5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky {{and they wanted}} {{to make it look like}} tight skin <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E

The shell wall is relatively thick, with an external prismatic layer of calcite, which may be pigmented, and an internal layer of lamellar, but not nacreous, aragonite.|$|R

25|$|This is {{selected}} where the liner {{is required to}} mechanically hold back the movement of formation sand. There are many variants of openhole sand control, the three popular choices being stand-alone screens, openhole gravel packs (also known as external gravel packs, where a sized sand 'gravel' is placed as an annulus around the sand control screen) and expandable screens. Screen designs are mainly wire-wrap or premium; wire-wrap screens use spiral-welded corrosion-resistant wire <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> drilled basepipe to provide a consistent small helical gap (such as , termed 12 gauge). Premium screens use a woven metal cloth <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> basepipe. Expandable screens are run to depth before being mechanically swaged to a larger diameter. Ideally, expandable screens will be swaged until they contact the wellbore wall.|$|E

They claim these may be produced at 10-nanometer scale using existing fabrication techniques.|$|E
25|$|Regulations {{governing}} {{the use of}} expensive Tyrian purple dyestuffs varied over the years, but cloth dyed in these colours was generally restricted to specific classes and was used in diplomatic gifts. Other dyes used in Byzantine silk workshops were madder, kermes, indigo, weld, and brazilwood. Gold thread was made with silver-gilt strips <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> silk core.|$|E

The witch also tells John that after killing the worm he must then kill the first living thing he sees, or else his family will be cursed for nine generations and will not die in their beds.|$|E
25|$|Contour cuffs have an arc-shaped design that, when <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> limb, {{gives them}} a smaller {{diameter}} distally than proximally. Contour cuffs enhance comfort in patients with tapered limbs and {{reduce the risk of}} mechanical shearing. It has been reported that contour tourniquet cuffs occlude blood flow at lower inflation pressures than standard rectangular cuffs of equal width, which may be attributable to better cuff fit and more efficient transmission of pressure to deep tissues. There are two types of contour cuff designs; fixed-contour and variable-contour.|$|E
50|$|Plastic films, usually {{polyethylene}} or polypropylene, can be <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>an</b> {{item and}} attached with adhesive, PSA tape, or heat seals. Sometimes {{the film is}} in the form of a plastic bag which is sealed around the item.|$|R

50|$|Cord {{entanglement}} - The {{umbilical cord}} can <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> <b>an</b> extremity, the body or {{the neck of}} the fetus. When the cord is <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> {{the neck of the}} fetus, it is called a nuchal cord. These entanglements can cause constriction of blood flow to the fetus. These entanglements can be visualized with ultrasound.|$|R
25|$|On July 18, 1877, Thomas Edison and {{his team}} invented the phonograph. His first {{successful}} recording and reproduction of intelligible sounds, achieved early in the following December, used a thin sheet of tin foil <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> hand-cranked grooved metal cylinder. Tin foil was not a practical recording medium for either commercial or artistic purposes and the crude hand-cranked phonograph was only marketed as a novelty, to little or no profit. Edison moved on to developing a practical incandescent electric light and the next improvements to sound recording technology were made by others.|$|E
25|$|The {{clock in}} the {{building}} tower was originally mechanical in nature, and kept accurate time via gravity. A cable was <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> drum, and a large weight attached {{to the end of}} the cable. As the cable unwound due to the force of gravity, the clock hands turned. The cable was rewound once or twice a day. On October 10, 1956, the weight came loose from the cable and plunged through two floors (narrowly avoiding killing a man, who had just gotten up from his desk). The mechanical clock was later replaced with an electric one.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, {{during the}} Crimean War, Armstrong {{read about the}} {{difficulties}} the British Army experienced in manoeuvring its heavy field guns. He decided to design a lighter, more mobile field gun, with greater range and accuracy. He built a breech-loading gun with a strong, rifled barrel made from wrought iron <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> steel inner lining, designed to fire a shell rather than a ball. In 1855 he had a five-pounder ready for inspection by a government committee. The gun proved successful in trials, but the committee thought a higher calibre gun was needed, so Armstrong built an 18-pounder on the same design.|$|E
