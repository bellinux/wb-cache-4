40|$|States {{normally}} enjoy {{immunity from}} suit by private parties, {{but they may}} <b>waive</b> this <b>immunity.</b> <b>The</b> Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s steady contraction of other exceptions {{to the rule of}} state sovereign immunity has renewed interest in the previously little-discussed possibilities of waiver. This Article explores the boundaries of waiver doctrine. This Article shows that, prior to 1945, the Supreme Court-even as it enforced a broad, substantive rule of state sovereign immunity-applied a sensible doctrine of waiver that balanced the interests of states with those of private parties and the federal judicial system. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s traditional doctrine treated state sovereign <b>immunity</b> like <b>the</b> defense of personal jurisdiction. Failure to assert immunity in a timely fashion <b>waived</b> <b>the</b> <b>immunity</b> defense. This rule prevented unfair gamesmanship. Beginning in 1945, the traditional rules concerning waiver of state sovereign immunity got swept away by the overall ideological tide of state sovereign <b>immunity</b> doctrine. <b>The</b> <b>immunity</b> became so important that it overrode all other considerations, including the need to run the federal judicial system in a sensible way. The new rules of waiver permitted states to abuse their immunity and waste federal judicial resources by litigating the merits of a case while holding an immunity defense in reserve. The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s most recent decisions suggest that the Court has returned to its traditional rules concerning waiver. The Court should make clear that it has fully reinstated the traditional, sensible, non-ideologized rules of waiver. Such rules respect the states 2 ̆ 7 prerogative of refusing to be sued in a federal forum, {{while at the same time}} requiring states to assert their prerogative in an orderly way that respects the needs of the federal judicial system...|$|R

40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is Espionage Delinquency Committed by Diplomatic Agent (Case Study of Illegal Interception Committed by Australia Ambassador towards Officials Government of Indonesia). The legal issue of this thesis {{is the fact that}} {{diplomatic}} agent often involves criminal offences in the receiving state; one of them is espionage act. Then the purpose of this thesis is to find out the legal consequences of espionage delinquency committed by diplomatic agent related to the case of Illegal Interception Committed by Australia Ambassador towards Officials Government of Indonesia. The method of this research is literature research. Automatically, the kind of this research is normative law research which is a research focused on positive law norms. The positive law norms include Vienna Convention 1961, Vienna Convention 1969, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts Convention, Budapest Convention 2001 on Cybercrime, bilateral agreement between Republic of Indonesia and Australia on The Framework for Security Cooperation and other regulations which related to the research object. In addition to positive law norms, this research also uses other resources as supporting data. It is obtained from the result of interview with resource person, books, article on journals and newspaper. Based on the Vienna Convention 1961 Article 3 and Article 41 verses (1) and (3), the agent diplomatic has basic obligations to perform his function in receiving state. These basic obligations are not to interfere {{in the internal affairs of}} receiving state and to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State. If the agent diplomatic involves espionage act, it indicates that the agent diplomatic has violated the provisions of Vienna Convention 1961 Article 3 and Article 41 verses (1) and (3). In the case of Indonesia and Australia, the illegal interception which committed by the Australia Ambassador has violated the provisions of Agreement between The Republic of Indonesia and Australia on The Framework for Security Cooperation Article 2 verse (2). Certainly, these violation have some legal consequences because the injured state, in this case is Republic of Indonesia, will take some measures to ensure reparation and cessation of espionage act. The result of this research are the receiving state can declare persona non grata to diplomatic agent who committing espionage act, but in certain case, the receiving state can request the sending state to <b>waive</b> <b>the</b> <b>immunity</b> and inviolability of diplomatic agent.

Part I consists of three chapters. Following an introductory chapter, Chapter II describes the system and the general characteristics of GPS. Chapter III outlines the military uses of the system and the increasing and evolving civilian uses. Part II discusses the liability ramifications of providing GPS services for civilian use.

2500|$|The {{state of}} Virginia has enacted the Virginia Tort Claims Act, which <b>waives</b> <b>the</b> {{sovereign}} <b>immunity</b> of <b>the</b> state {{with respect to}} actions brought under certain limitations.
