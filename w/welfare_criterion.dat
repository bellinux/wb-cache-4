However, the effects of alternative policies are increasingly studied using DSGE methods. Since DSGE models are constructed {{on the basis of}} assumptions about agents' preferences, it is possible to ask whether the policies considered are Pareto optimal, which is a state of allocation of resources in which it is impossible to make any one individual better off without making at least one individual worse off, or how well they satisfy some other social <b>welfare</b> <b>criterion</b> derived from preferences (Woodford, 2003, p. 12).|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} assumption {{in economic}} studies of climate {{policy is the}} social welfare function. This paper shows that applying distinct decision or social <b>welfare</b> <b>criteria</b> can result in different optimal policies of climate control, notably if climate change impacts are uncertain. First, decision criteria in current climate-economic studies are reviewed. Next, the most important alternatives are discussed, including their (mathematical) formalization and incorporation in economy-climate models. Most of these alternative criteria suggest more stringent climate policies to be optimal than the standard discounted utilitarianism approach. However, several important <b>welfare</b> <b>criteria</b> have not or hardly seen any application in the economic analysis of climate policy. We conclude that there is clear need for systematic research on this theme, for which the current review provides a solid basis. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Instability in a Phillips curve {{relation}} originates from {{a theoretical}} {{model in which}} monopolistic firms face changing quadratic costs of price adjustment. Deriving the switching-Phillips curve explicitly from the firm’s optimization problem has benefits in terms of constructing a utility-based <b>welfare</b> <b>criterion.</b> Optimal monetary policy is computed under both ad-hoc and utility-based welfare criteria, where the utility-based criterion has a weight on the output gap that varies {{with the cost of}} price adjustment. The ad-hoc <b>welfare</b> <b>criterion</b> instructs monetary policy to change the systematic component of policy to offset inflation depending on the state determining the cost of price adjustment. In contrast, the utility-based <b>welfare</b> <b>criterion</b> instructs monetary policy to keep its systematic actions constant. The results imply that a central bank using an ad-hoc criterion will place too much weight on output stabilization in states with a ‘steep ’ Phillips curve and not enough in states with a relatively flat Phillips curve. 1...|$|E

We readdress this issue within a model that combines excess health-care demand due to health insurance with market power due to monopolistic production of health-care services. We evaluate the market equilibrium in terms of consumer welfare and social welfare. The consumer <b>welfare</b> <b>criterion</b> suggests that in the market equilibrium consumers in fact purchase too much health insurance coverage. The social <b>welfare</b> <b>criterion,</b> in contrast, suggests that because profits of the health-care industry are properly accounted for, consumers should purchase more insurance coverage than they choose {{to do in the}} market equilibrium.

The <b>welfare</b> <b>criterion</b> obtained for this model shares several features with the corresponding expressions {{that have been}} derived in simpler models without capital accumulation. In particular, a criterion can be specified such that welfare losses depend solely on quadratic functions of the model’s variables, thus confirming that policy should be oriented toward stabilization of macroeconomic aggregates, rather than toward attaining particular levels of those aggregates. That said, an important difference that obtains {{in this case is}} that the composition of output directly affects welfare in the endogenous-capital model—a result that is not present in standard treatments...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effects of real {{government}} spending in a New Keynesian model. A social <b>welfare</b> <b>criterion</b> is derived by a second order Taylor expansion of the representative house-hold utility. The <b>welfare</b> <b>criterion</b> includes inflation, output gap and the deviation of government spending from a time varying target level. Using this <b>welfare</b> <b>criterion,</b> optimal monetary and fiscal policy are analyzed. This paper shows that even if Ricardian Equivalence holds, real spend-ing can have substantial effects on output and prices. This is particularly relevant in a liquidity trap since then the effectiveness of monetary policy is reduced by the zero bound. The only way the government can use monetary policy in a liquidity trap to influence aggregate demand is by committing to future monetary actions that are dynamically inconsistent. On the other hand, increasing real government spending involves current action and is thus {{not subject to the}} same credibility problem. For a government that cannot credibly commit to future policies, varying real government spending is therefore a particularly effective policy tool in a liquidity trap. Note: Apart from minor revisions, this draft was written in October 2000. The paper will be revised an reorganized since many of the issues in this paper also arise in “Committing to being irresponsible: Deficit Spending to Escape a Liquidity Trap ” although {{in the context of a}} different model. 1...|$|E
