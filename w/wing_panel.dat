5|$|The Entombment is a glue-size {{painting}} on linen {{attributed to the}} Early Netherlandish painter Dieric Bouts. It shows {{a scene from the}} biblical entombment of Christ, and was probably completed between 1440 and 1455 as a <b>wing</b> <b>panel</b> for a large hinged polyptych altarpiece. The now-lost altarpiece is thought to have contained a central crucifixion scene flanked by four <b>wing</b> <b>panel</b> works half its height – two on either side – depicting scenes from the Life of Christ. The smaller panels would have been paired in a format similar to Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of the Holy Sacrament. The larger work was probably commissioned for export to Italy, possibly to a Venetian patron whose identity is lost. The Entombment was first recorded in a mid-19th century Milan inventory and has been in the National Gallery, London since its purchase on the gallery's behalf by Charles Lock Eastlake in 1861.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} very similar in {{appearance}} to the Fea's petrel, but is smaller. The size difference and lighter flight may not be apparent at sea, especially with lone birds, but a recent study helped to clarify other useful features. Zino's has a diagnostically small, delicate, often rather long and slender bill, which may be obvious in the most slender-billed examples, which are probably mostly females, but {{can be difficult to}} determine in larger-billed, probably adult male, birds. Another useful feature is a large whitish panel on the underwing. The <b>wing</b> <b>panel</b> is exclusive to Zino's but is only shown by 15% of the birds. Zino's has a more rounded wing tip, but P. feae deserti sometimes shows a rounded wing tip, so this feature is not diagnostic. Previously suggested criteria such as head, upperwing and flank patterns were found to be inconclusive. Off the eastern United States and the Azores, both Macronesian petrels are easily distinguished from the larger Bermuda petrel by that species' upperparts, which are uniformly dark but for a pale grey rump.|$|E
25|$|The underparts are buff {{white and}} the grey breast band {{contrasts}} with the white throat in the breeding season. They have a rufous <b>wing</b> <b>panel</b> and the upperparts are smoky grey during the breeding season and olive brown in the non-breeding period. Non-breeding birds have a short indistinct white supercilium and often lack the breast band. Young birds are like non-breeding adults but more rufous above. The distinctive greyer endemic race in Sri Lanka, P. h. pectoralis, retains the summer-type plumage all year round. Young birds have a pale lower mandible. The tail feathers are shorter in summer than in the non-breeding winter plumage.|$|E
25|$|Another {{role the}} Bf 110 took on {{was as a}} potent bomber-destroyer. The extreme power of the Bf 110's {{weaponry}} could cripple or destroy any Allied bomber in seconds. Without encountering an Allied escort, it was capable of wreaking immense destruction. When encumbered {{with a total of}} four 21cm (8in) Werfer-Granate 21 (Wfr.Gr. 21) rocket tubes, with two of these under each outer <b>wing</b> <b>panel,</b> and additional armament, the 110 was vulnerable to Allied escort fighters, partly from the development of a major change in American fighter tactics at the end of 1943, rendering them increasingly vulnerable to developing American air supremacy over the Reich. In late 1943 and early 1944 Bf 110 formations were frequently devastated by the roving Allied fighters.|$|E

25|$|In late 1938, the Bf 109E entered production. To {{improve on}} the {{performance}} afforded by the 441–515kW (600–700PS) Jumo 210, the larger, longer Daimler-Benz DB 601A engine was used, yielding an extra 223kW (300PS) {{at the cost of}} an additional 181kg (400lb). A much bigger cooling area was needed to disperse the extra heat generated by the DB 601 and this led to the first major redesign of the basic airframe. Enlarging the existing nose mounted radiator sufficiently to cool the engine would have created extra weight and drag, negating some of the performance gains afforded by the increased power, so it was decided to move the main radiators to beneath the wings' undersurfaces immediately outboard of the juncture between the wing root and <b>wing</b> <b>panel,</b> just forward of the trailing edges' inner ends, leaving the oil cooler under the nose in a small, streamlined duct. The new radiator position also had the effect of counterbalancing the extra weight and length of the DB 601, which drove a heavier three-bladed Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke (VDM)-made propeller. To incorporate the new radiators, the wings were almost completely redesigned and reinforced, with several inboard ribs behind the spar being cut down {{to make room for the}} radiator ducting. Because the radiators were now mounted near the trailing edge of the wing, coinciding with the increased speed of the airflow accelerating around the wing's camber, the overall cooling installation was more efficient than that of the Jumo engined 109s, albeit at the cost of extra ducting and piping, which could be vulnerable to battle damage. In addition, the lowered undercarriage could throw up mud and debris on wet airfields, potentially clogging the radiators.|$|E
500|$|The Fireball {{was armed}} with four [...]50in (12.7mm) M2 Browning machine guns with 300 rounds per gun. They were {{mounted in the}} center section of the wing, {{immediately}} outboard of the air intakes for the jet engine. Four 5-inch (127mm) rockets could be carried under each outer <b>wing</b> <b>panel</b> and two hardpoints were provided under the center section for 1,000lb (454kg) bombs or [...] drop tanks. Armor plates were provided in front and behind the pilot's seat and for the oil cooler.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{have not}} {{established}} if the panel {{was meant to}} be a single devotional work, or part of a larger, and now broken up, polyptych. According to Ainsworth, its size and [...] "the sacramental nature of its subject would have been appropriate for a family chapel in a church or monastery for the chapel of a guild corporation." [...] An intact, inscribed frame is unusual for a <b>wing</b> <b>panel,</b> indicating that it was probably intended as a single piece, but scholars are unsure because the slight left-to-right axis of the tiles tend to suggest it could have been the left-hand wing of a larger piece. There is no information about the panel's reverse, which has not survived.|$|E

500|$|Spectrum 3 {{fatigue testing}} started in 1979. This round of testing quickly {{determined}} that more drastic reinforcement would be needed. [...] The second change in production, starting with aircraft #442, was {{to increase the}} thickness of the lower skin on the outer wing panels. [...] A tech order was issued to retrofit the [...] "thick skin" [...] to the whole fleet, but the tech order was rescinded after roughly 242 planes, leaving about 200 planes with the original [...] "thin skin". [...] Starting with aircraft #530, cold working at WS0 was performed, and this retrofit was performed on earlier aircraft. [...] A fourth, even more drastic change was initiated with aircraft #582, again to address the problems discovered with spectrum 3 testing. [...] This change increased the thickness on the lower skin on the center <b>wing</b> <b>panel</b> but it required modifications to the lower spar caps to accommodate the thicker skin. [...] The Air Force determined that it was not economically feasible to retrofit earlier planes with this modification.|$|E
2500|$|Reports {{coming back}} from the war in Europe {{indicated}} that an armament of two [...]30in (7.62mm) synchronized engine cowling-mount machine guns, and two [...]50in (12.7mm) machine guns (one in each outer <b>wing</b> <b>panel)</b> was insufficient. The U.S. Navy's November 1940 production proposals specified heavier armament. The increased armament consisted of three [...]50 caliber machine guns mounted in each <b>wing</b> <b>panel.</b> This improvement greatly increased the ability of the Corsair to effectively shoot down enemy aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|During June, further {{analysis}} {{of information from}} Columbia's flight data recorder narrowed the probable impact site to one single panel: RCC <b>wing</b> <b>panel</b> 8. On July 7, in a final round of testing, a block fired {{at the side of}} an RCC panel 8 created a hole [...] in that protective RCC panel.

2500|$|One {{offensive}} weapons upgrade in 1943 for the Bf 109G — {{and also}} used for the Fw 190A — was one that mounted the Werfer-Granate 21 heavy calibre rocket weapon system with one launching tube under each <b>wing</b> <b>panel.</b> The rockets, fitted with a massive 40.8kg (90lbs) warhead, were aimed via the standard Revi reflector sights, and were spin-stabilized in flight. In emergency, the tubes could be jettisoned via a small explosive charge. Intended as a [...] "stand-off" [...] weapon, fired {{from a distance of}} 1,200 meters and outside the effective range of the formations defensive guns, it was [...] employed against Allied bomber formations, the Wfr. Gr. 21 rocket was unofficially known as the BR 21 (Bordrakete 21cm) for the Bf 109G-5, G-6 and G-14. The weapons system received the designation of Rüstsatz VII on the G-10.|$|E
2500|$|The Fw 190, {{designed}} as a rugged interceptor capable of withstanding considerable combat damage and delivering a potent 'punch' from its stable gun platform, was considered ideal for anti-bomber operations. Focke-Wulf redesigned parts of the wing structure to accommodate larger armament. The Fw 190A-6 was the first sub-variant to undergo this change. Its standard armament was increased from four MG 151/20s to two of them with four more in two underwing cannon pods. The aircraft was designated A-6/R1 (Rüstsatz; or field conversion model). The first aircraft were delivered on 20 November 1943. Brief trials saw the twin cannon replaced by the MK 108 30mm autocannon in the outer wing, which then became the A-6/R2. The cannons were blowback-operated, had electric ignition, and were belt fed. The 30mm MK 108 was simple to make and its construction was economical; {{the majority of its}} components consisted of just pressed sheet metal stampings. In the A-6/R4, the GM-1 (nitrous oxide) Boost was added for the BMW 801 engine to increase performance at high altitude. For protection, [...] of armoured glass was added to the canopy. The A-6/R6 was fitted with twin heavy calibre Werfer-Granate 21 (BR 21) unguided, air-to-air rockets, fired from single underwing tubular launchers (one per <b>wing</b> <b>panel).</b> The increased modifications, in particular heavy firepower, made the Fw 190 a potent bomber-killer. The A-7 evolved in November 1943. Two synchronized 13mm (.51 caliber) MG 131 machine guns replaced the twin cowl-mount synchronized 7.92mm (.318 cal) MG 17 machine guns. The A-7/R variants could carry two 30mm MK 108s as well as BR 21 rockets. This increased its potency as a Pulk-Zerstörer (Bomber Formation Destroyer). The A-8/R2 was the most numerous Sturmbock aircraft, some 900 were built by Fiesler at Kassel with 30mm MK 108s installed in their outer <b>wing</b> <b>panel</b> mounts. While formidable bomber-killers, the armour and substantial up-gunning with heavier calibre firepower meant the Fw 190 was now cumbersome to maneuver.

2500|$|Design was {{initiated}} by Junkers Chief Designer Ernst Zindel. He was assisted by Wilhelm Heinrich Evers and American engineer Alfred Gassner. Evers and Gassner had worked together at Fokkòer Aircraft Corporation of America where Gassner had been Chief Engineer. [...] Junkers presented their initial design in June 1936, and were given clearance to build two prototypes (Werknummer 4941 and 4942). The first two aircraft {{were to have}} a range of 2,000km (1,240mi) and were to be powered by two DB 600s. Three further aircraft, Werknummer 4943, 4944 and 4945, were to be powered by Jumo 211 engines. The first two prototypes, Ju 88 V1 and V2, differed from the V3, V4 and V5 in that the latter three models were equipped with three defensive armament positions {{to the rear of the}} cockpit, and were able to carry two 1,000kg (2,200lb) bombs, one under each inner <b>wing</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The C.II {{had much}} lower drag than {{comparable}} aircraft of its time. [...] It featured a monocoque fuselage built with an outer skin of {{two layers of}} thin plywood strips {{at an angle to}} each other (known as a Wickelrumpf, or [...] "wrapped body" [...] design). This had both lower drag and better strength per weight than typical of the time, but it was relatively slow and expensive to build. [...] (This approach was further developed in the de Havilland Mosquito of World War II.) [...] The deep fuselage completely filled the vertical gap between the <b>wing</b> <b>panel</b> center sections, eliminating any need for cabane struts commonly used in biplanes, and gave the aircraft its [...] "whale" [...] nickname. Struts and wires were reduced, without suffering the weight penalty of cantilever wings, like those used on the pioneering all-metal Junkers J 1 of late 1915. [...] There was even some attempt to flair the wings into the fuselage, to eliminate dead air space, a feature prominently missing from the Schneider Trophy contestants of the following decade.|$|E
