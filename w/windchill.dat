25|$|Often, a Chinook is {{preceded by}} a “Manyberries Chinook” during {{the end of a}} cold spell. This {{southeast}} wind was named for the small village Manyberries, now a hamlet, in southeastern Alberta, from where the wind seems to originate. It can be fairly strong and cause bitter <b>windchill</b> and blowing snow. The wind will eventually swing around to the southwest and the temperature rises sharply as the real Chinook arrives.|$|E
500|$|The Flames {{hosted the}} Montreal Canadiens at McMahon Stadium in February for the 2011 Heritage Classic. The {{game was played}} before 41,022 fans who braved a <b>windchill</b> as cold as [...] Calgary won the game, 4–0, on the {{strength}} of Bourque's two goals, including the 100th of his career. Kiprusoff became the first goaltender in NHL history to record a shutout at an outdoor game, and his play remained strong following the Heritage Classic, as he shut the Blues out in back-to-back games on February 27 and March 1. He then became the first goaltender in 25 years to stop two penalty shots in one game to lead the Flames to a 4–3 win over the Blue Jackets on March 4 as the Flames moved into fifth place in the West. Two nights later, Iginla scored his 30th goal of the season on a penalty shot against Pekka Rinne of the Nashville Predators. In doing so, he became the 10th player in NHL history to score at least 30 goals in ten consecutive seasons.|$|E

40|$|Until now, the {{technical}} development of wind force is mainly combined with electrical generator and already achieves the skillful technique in application. In this paper the newly developed <b>windchiller</b> directly applies the mechanical energy of wind force for refrigeration {{instead of the}} traditional electrical/mechanical energy conversion. The devise avoids energy loss during the two to-and-fro energy conversion processes between wind force and electrical energy. The special finished wind machine applies the technique with two directions to capture the wind force, the faced and its opposite directions, in the fans design. Between the wind turbine and the compressor, a transmission system with a fixed conversion rate 1 : 20 was used for acceleration. After the combination with open-type reciprocating compressor, the wind forced chiller is built. The <b>windchiller</b> increases the working efficiency {{in comparison with the}} refrigerating system of indirect connection from wind generator to refrigerator and ignores the unstable property of wind force. The strength of wind force influences only the windchiller's efficiency; the stronger wind force, the larger windchiller's efficiency. The experimental results show the newly developed windchiller's efficiency ca. 21. 28 %, which agrees to the pre-evaluation and achieves a high efficiency.

2500|$|The Twin Cities area {{takes the}} brunt of many types of extreme weather, {{including}} high-speed straight-line winds, tornadoes, flash floods, drought, heat, bitter cold, and blizzards. The costliest weather disaster in Twin Cities history was a derecho event on May 15, 1998. Hail and Wind damage exceeded $950million, {{much of it in}} the Twin Cities. Other memorable Twin Cities weather-related events include the tornado outbreak on May 6, 1965, the Armistice Day Blizzard on November 11, 1940, and the Halloween Blizzard of 1991.

50|$|A squamish (also {{known as}} an Arctic outflow wind in winter months) is a strong and often violent wind {{occurring}} {{in many of the}} fjords, inlets and valleys of British Columbia. Squamishes occur in those fjords oriented in a northeast-southwest or east-west direction where cold polar air can be funneled westward, the opposite of how the wind generally flows on the Coast. These winds in winter can create high <b>windchills</b> by coastal standards of -20 to -30 C. They are notable in Jervis, Toba, and Bute Inlets and in Dean Channel and the Portland Canal. Squamishes lose their strength when free of the confining fjords and are not noticeable more than 25 km offshore.|$|R
50|$|Small {{creeks and}} ponds {{can be found}} around the community, {{including}} Cedar Creek on Romance's south side. Clifty Creek flows {{through the center of}} Romance. Bad Luck Creek and Bayou Des Arc also flow nearby to the east, with Des Arc being dammed and forming Barnett Lake between Romance and the nearby community of Floyd. Scenic waterfalls can be found along these streams. There are a series of steep and elevated bluffs along Highway 31, with several pull off points to enjoy the scenic view. Geographically, Romance is considered to be {{in the foothills of the}} Ozark Mountains. The southern portion of the community, which is situated atop Black Jack Mountain, is significantly higher in elevation than other parts of Romance. The overall climate is somewhat similar to that found in other north central Arkansas communities, with warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters. Severe weather can include thunderstorms, hail, and tornados during the warm months, with snow, sleet, freezing rain and frigid <b>windchills</b> in the winter months.|$|R
50|$|Twin Lakes Beach {{experiences}} a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) with warm to hot summers and cold windy winters. The climate is {{also influenced by}} Lake Manitoba. Due {{to the fact that}} Twin Lakes Beach lies on its shores, the community experiences temperature moderation during the ice free months of year, and thus has reduced diurnal temperature variation during these months, resulting in cooler high temperatures in the summer, but also warmer nighttime lows in the summer and fall compared to nearby locations. In the spring, when the ice has not yet melted, any wind off the lake can also depress temperatures compared to nearby locations. Comparison with relatively nearby weather stations located off of the lake such as Lundar, Manitoba to the north and Marquette, Manitoba to the southeast illustrates the moderation provided by Lake Manitoba. In the fall and early winter before freeze-up Twin Lakes Beach also experiences periodic lake-effect snow. Wind coming off the lake also tends to be stronger than nearby locations due to less resistance, and this can lead to extreme <b>windchills</b> and snow drifts in the winter. Data is from Oak Point located about 20 km to the north.|$|R
2500|$|The highest {{temperature}} {{recorded in}} Kielce since 1971 is [...] {{and the lowest}} is , giving the city a temperature range of 70.3°C (126.5°F), the second highest in Poland. [...] The city receives 1720 to 1829 hours of sunshine annually, depending on the source, with a notably sunny spring and summer, and a cloudy late autumn and winter. [...] Winds are generally very light throughout the year, {{with an abundance of}} calm days, and as a result, cool temperatures often feel much milder than expected due to a relative lack of <b>windchill,</b> especially during sunny spells in early spring, as well as during severe winter cold snaps, which are typically dominated by calm, anticyclonic weather. [...] Föhn winds from the Carpathian mountains do occasionally reach the city, resulting in unusually mild temperatures for a semi-continental location at this latitude, on rare occasions reaching approximately [...] in the winter months.|$|E

50|$|As a sidenote, Cincinnati {{head coach}} Forrest Gregg had already participated {{in one of}} the coldest games in NFL history prior to this one. When he was a player for the Green Bay Packers in 1967, Gregg played in the famous NFL {{championship}} game against the Dallas Cowboys that became known as the Ice Bowl. Another sidenote is that Brooks, whose fumble helped the Bengals win the game, would later go on to help the Bengals get to Super Bowl XXIII in the 1988 season, this time not as an opponent, but as a player for the team. After spending two more seasons with the Chargers, Brooks was traded to the Bengals in exchange for Pete Johnson, and remained on the team until 1991. Brooks made the Pro Bowl four times with the Bengals (1986, 1988-1990) and left Cincinnati as the team's all-time leading rusher. Both Winslow and Ken Anderson said that the <b>windchill's</b> effect was so brutal that they have felt its effects decades later—Winslow in noting that he suffers from the residual impact of frostbite in one of his toes, and Anderson because his hands turn cold and numb much more quickly in cold weather now than they did pre-Freezer Bowl.|$|R
5000|$|Starting on 22 August 2009, {{he walked}} from Kennedy Airport in New York City to within 15 miles of Devil's Lake, North Dakota. This was a {{distance}} of 2053 mi and Skinner stopped his journey on 3 December 2009, after 3 days with <b>windchills</b> down to -30 Fahrenheit. During the trip Skinner had to make incisions in his feet to relieve the pressure from blisters, suffered food poisoning, met up with a wolf in Upper Michigan, had to face down two wild dogs, and had ski masks frozen to his beard in North Dakota. On the journey he appeared on television, radio and in newspaper articles. He also wrote a daily blog for the National Hospice Foundation. [...] He met hospice patients, including one woman with a terminal illness, who said that at times she could forget she was ill, thanks to the care she received in a hospice house in Buffalo, New York. He also met a man with lung cancer who could not sleep in hospitals, where there was always someone coming to check on him.

50|$|Meanwhile, another {{powerful}} storm {{moved across}} much of the continent, bringing first blizzard conditions and frigid temperatures from Alberta to Manitoba and down towards the Dakotas where temperatures dropped locally 40 degrees below zero with much colder <b>windchills.</b> While approaching the eastern half of the continent, it intensified further and brought widespread damage wind some of them from thunderstorms. Winds exceeded locally as much as 120 km/h in some areas while blowing snow shut down many roads near the shorelines of Georgian Bay and Lake Huron. The cold front associated with the depression produced very rapid temperature drops in a short period from Iowa to southern Ontario. The storm killed at least two in Indiana due to an EF2 tornado.A third strong storm developed across the Texas Panhandle on January 31 and affected much of the Midwest and East with heavy snows from Northern Oklahoma to Quebec with significant ice across the Appalachians and the Ohio Valley and severe weather from southern Texas to the Middle Atlantic States. It brought massive amounts of snow to the Midwest with some isolated reports of 11 in of snow. Chicago saw its largest snowstorm this season as it dropped over ten inches (203 mm) of snow in downtown, building up traffic delays.http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crnews/display_story.php?wfo=lot&storyid=12666&source=0 Across Ontario and Quebec it dumped about 8 inches of snow (20 cm) in Toronto, 13 to 14 in in Ottawa, Gatineau and Quebec City and 11 in in Montreal with higher amounts as much as 22 in in the mountains north of Quebec City. It also brought severe weather to the deep south bringing several inches of rain. The storm also produced heavy sleet and freezing rain in much of Pennsylvania and New York. The highest reported amount of ice accumulation was at State College, Pennsylvania, where 0.75 in of ice fell, coupled with moderate wind gusts, caused downed trees and powerlines there, and in much of the Northeast United States. The ice then moved into the Canadian Maritimes for several hours. While it disrupted air travel at various major airports along the path, the storm was responsible for at least 15 deaths across three states and one Canadian province including one in Ontario, four in New York, six in Illinois, three in Texas and one in Oklahoma.|$|R
