40|$|A ten cell bipolar nickel {{hydrogen}} 6. 5 ampere-hour battery demonstrated over 2000 low {{earth orbit}} cycles at an 80 percent depth-of-discharge. Charge/discharge cyclic ampere-hour and <b>watt-hour</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of 88 and 76 percent, respectively, observed. Peak power capability was determined at 1. 1 kW. A 10 C discharge rate yields 83 percent of the nominal stark capacity to the 1. 0 volt cut off in just under 6 minutes. Previously announced in STAR as N 83 - 2625...|$|R
50|$|Wh (<b>watt-hours)</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{tests of}} UltraBattery in a {{stationary}} application for an electricity smart grid showed that over 30 cycles of charge-discharge at rates of 0.1 C10A, Wh efficiencies ranged from 91% to 94.5%, {{depending on the}} battery’s state of charge. REF This is compared with a Sandia National Laboratories study into lead-acid battery efficiency which found that traditional lead-acid batteries operating between 79% and 84% state-of-charge (the “top” charge mode to which traditional lead-acid batteries are generally restricted to prolong their life) achieve only 55% incremental charging efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies in}} a 14. 5 sq cm single cell system using mixed {{reactant}} solutions at 65 C are described. Systems were tested under isothermal conditions i. e., reactants and the cell {{were at the}} same temperature. Charging and discharging performance were evaluted by measuring <b>watt-hour</b> and coulombic <b>efficiencies,</b> voltage-current relationships, hydrogen evolution and membrane resistivity. <b>Watt-hour</b> <b>efficiencies</b> ranged from 86 % at 43 ma/sq cm to 75 % at 129 ma/sq cm with corresponding coulombic efficiencies of 92 % and 97 %, respectively. Hydrogen evolution was less than 1 % of the charge coulombic capacity during charge-discharge cycling. Bismuth and bismuth-lead catalyzed chromium electrodes maintained reversible performance and low hydrogen evolution under normal and adverse cycling conditions. Reblending of the anode and cathode solutions was successfully demonstrated to compensate for osmotic volume changes.

40|$|Nickel-Hydrogen (Ni/H 2) {{secondary}} batteries will {{be implemented}} as a power source for the Space Station Freedom {{as well as for}} other NASA missions. Consequently, characterization tests of Ni/H 2 cells from Eagle-Picher, Whittaker-Yardney, and Hughes were completed at the NASA Lewis Research Center. Watt-hour efficiencies of each Ni/H 2 cell were measured for regulated charge and discharge cycles as a function of temperature, charge rate, discharge rate, and state of charge. Temperatures ranged from - 5 C to 30 C, charge rates ranged from C/ 10 to 1 C, discharge rates ranged from C/ 10 to 2 C, and states of charge ranged from 20 percent to 100 percent. Results from regression analyses and analyses of mean watt-hour efficiencies demonstrated that overall performance was best at temperatures between 10 C and 20 C while the discharge rate correlated most strongly with <b>watt-hour</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In general, the cell with back-to-back electrode arrangement, single stack, 26 percent KOH, and serrated zircar separator and the cell with a recirculating electrode arrangement, unit stack, 31 percent KOH, zircar separators performed best...|$|E
40|$|A {{history is}} given of low Earth orbit (LEO) {{laboratory}} test {{data on a}} 6. 5 ampere-hour bipolar nickel hydrogen battery designed and built at the NASA Lewis Research Center. The bipolar concept {{is a means of}} achieving the goal of producing an acceptable battery, of higher energy density, able to withstand the demands of low-Earth-orbit regimes. Over 4100 LEO cycles were established on a ten cell battery. It seems that any perturbation on normal cycling effects the cells performance. Explanations and theories of the battery's behavior are varied and widespread among those closely associated with it. Deep discharging does provide a reconditioning effect and further experimentation is planned in this area. The battery <b>watt-hour</b> <b>efficiency</b> is about 75 percent and the time averaged, discharge voltage is about 1. 26 volts for all cells at both the C/ 4 and LEO rate. Since {{a significant portion of the}} electrode capacity has degraded, the LEO cycle discharges are approaching depths of 90 to 100 percent of the high rate capacity. Therefore, the low end-of-discharge voltages occur precipitously after the knee of the discharge curve and is more an indication of electrode capacity and is a lesser indicator of overall cell performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{structures}} of modern traction vehicles {{are based on}} new generation devices. Technical progress {{within the field of}} power transmission concerns such elements as sources of power supply, electric devices and energy electronic solutions in power transmission systems. The prototypes of traction vehicles being currently drawn up are hybrid vehicles using different kinds of sources of power supply of power transmission systems, the most important of which are combustion engines, contact systems, supercapacitors (ultracapacitors), accumulators and fuel cells. Main engines are usually electric machines. In energy electronic starting systems it is permissible to use all kinds of main electric engines, for example, direct-current motors (inline engines, commutator motors with permanent magnets or non-commutator motors) or three-phase motors of alternating current (induction and synchronous). This means a complete change of rules in energy managing in a vehicle. Sources of energy can have the function of basic power supply (contact system, combustion engine or combustion cell) or the function of power supply support (supercapacitors, accumulators or fuel cell). New functions of drive operation will be available, namely, leveling of basic power supply load, recuperation of braking energy of the whole train set, driving at the temporary disconnection of basic power supply (short-term application of accumulator as basic power supply). Each of the above functions can contribute to the improvement of <b>watt-hour</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the system or to prolonging the range of driving. Therefore, i...|$|E
