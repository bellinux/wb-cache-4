25|$|The {{competing}} bids <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> the Air Corps in April 1936. Vought offered to sell V-141s at a unit price of $34,148 for {{a batch of}} 25 aircraft (excluding engines and Government provided equipment), reducing to $16,041 for a batch of 200 aircraft. Testing showed that the V-141 still had poor handling and was prone to spinning, and also suffered from tail flutter, leading to the Vought design being rejected. The primary winner of the competition was Seversky, with 77 P-35s being ordered.|$|E
25|$|Three Ba.88s were {{modified}} by the Agusta plant in late 1942 {{to serve as}} ground-attack aircraft. The Ba.88M had the wingspan increased by 2 meters (6ft 6½ in) to alleviate wing-loading problems, and featured dive brakes, Fiat A.74 RC.38 engines, and a nose armament increased to four 12,7mm (0,5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns. Evaluated at Guidonia, they were delivered to the 103° Gruppo Autonomo Tuffatori at Lonate Pozzolo on 7 September 1943, the day before Italian Armistice. Later they <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> Luftwaffe pilots {{and that was the}} last heard of the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|On August 10, 2014, {{at about}} 3pm, 24 people were trapped on {{the roller coaster}} when the train stalled along the course. The train was upright on a curve {{near one of the}} highest points on the ride. The local fire {{department}} used an aerial fire apparatus to bring down riders one at a time. By 7:30pm local time, all riders had been removed from the ride, which was immediately closed for investigation. Investigators claim that the stalled train was caused by debris on the track. No riders were injured, and all <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> emergency personnel.|$|E
25|$|According to the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Office, {{the areas}} {{highlighted}} by Tim Mentz <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> state officials on both September 21 and October 20, 2016. They {{found that only}} four stone features would be directly impacted by the pipeline. However, many are still concerned about the cumulative effect the project may have on sites that lie outside the 150 ft corridor. Jon Eagle, a Historic Preservation Officer for the tribe, was {{invited to participate in}} the evaluation on Sept. 23, but was not allowed access to the areas of the corridor on private property. The tribe insists that evidence was destroyed by the construction company, as grading had gone on in the area previously.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Alice {{characterized}} the atmosphere, both by emissions of atmospheric molecules (airglow), and by dimming of background stars {{as they pass}} behind Pluto (occultation). During and after closest approach, SWAP and PEPSSI sampled the high atmosphere {{and its effects on}} the solar wind. VBSDC searched for dust, inferring meteoroid collision rates and any invisible rings. REX performed active and passive radio science. The communications dish on Earth measured the disappearance and reappearance of the radio occultation signal as the probe flew by behind Pluto. The results resolved Pluto's diameter (by their timing) and atmospheric density and composition (by their weakening and strengthening pattern). (Alice can perform similar occultations, using sunlight instead of radio beacons.) Previous missions had the spacecraft transmit through the atmosphere, to Earth ("downlink"). Pluto's mass and mass distribution <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> the gravitational tug on the spacecraft. As the spacecraft speeds up and slows down, the radio signal exhibited a Doppler shift. The Doppler shift was measured by comparison with the ultrastable oscillator in the communications electronics.|$|E

The class was given a displacement of [...] as a limit on size; all of the officers opted to design either fast or slow battleships, {{with the exception of}} Lieutenant Durand-Viel, who chose instead to create a design for a battlecruiser. Durand-Viel drew up a pair of designs, which <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> the General Staff in June 1914. He saw his ships forming a fast division of the battle fleet capable of encircling an enemy squadron; as with Gille's design, this required heavy armament and armor to permit the ships to engage battleships.|$|E

500|$|The tactics used in Operation Teardrop <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> U.S.Navy {{officers}} {{after the}} war. The escort carriers' air wings were disappointed with their experience, as {{their ability to}} detect submarines was hampered by severe weather throughout the operation. Despite this, the aircraft were successful in forcing the U-boats to remain submerged, thereby greatly slowing their speed. [...] Other after action reports {{stressed the importance of}} teamwork between destroyer escorts when attacking submarines and argued that single barrier lines such as those used throughout most of Operation Teardrop were inferior to grouping ships in assigned patrol areas. [...] Nevertheless, Philip K. Lundeberg has assessed the operation as [...] "a classic demonstration not only of coordinated hunter tactics, derived in part from British experience, but also of the profound impact of communications intelligence in the interdiction of U-boat transit and operating areas." [...] Similarly, the British official history of the role intelligence played in World War II noted that information obtained from decrypted German radio transmissions contributed to [...] "virtually all" [...] of the sinkings during Operation Teardrop.|$|E

However, if the free agent's last team acquired the player in a trade during {{the last year of his}} contract, it is ineligible to receive compensatory picks for that player.|$|E
