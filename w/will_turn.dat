5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help confirm the identify of the mushroom: a drop of dilute (3–10%) potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> the tubes pale red whereas nitric acid (HNO3) on the tubes produces orange-yellow; a solution of Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) applied to the flesh results in a pale grey color.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, {{the gang}} the Sole Survivor {{has been most}} {{neglecting}} <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> on them and take over the power plant of Nuka-World. With the remaining two gangs by their side, the Sole Survivor will have to eliminate the rogue gang. Their actions ultimately decide who controls Nuka-World. In an alternate scenario, they are also given the option of ending raider influence by assassinating the leaders of each gang and their lieutenants, thereby returning control of Nuka-World to the traders who originally {{used it as a}} hub of commerce.|$|E
5|$|Further {{methods of}} {{identification}} are chemical tests. With {{the application of}} FeSO4 to the cap cuticle (pileipellis), it <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> a dark grey, almost black color and with the application of potassium hydroxide or NH4OH it has a negative coloration. The context stains a bluish grey to an olive green when FeSO4 is applied to it, a pale orange to a pale yellow with the application of KOH, and negative with the application of NH4OH.|$|E

5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the player}} take severe damage, the screen <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> red {{and the sound}} of the character's {{heartbeat}} will increase in volume; this indicates the player's health is low. The player must find a way to stay out of fire to recover before entering battle again or else will die and restart from the last checkpoint. Health is only restored through automatic recharging when the player is not taking fire. Some attacks, such as explosions from grenades or shells, will kill the player instantly if the player is too close.|$|E
5|$|Some {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help identify the mushroom. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide placed on the cap cuticle will stain dark red to blackish, and orange-yellow on the flesh, while ferrous sulphate solution turns the cuticle yellow and then greenish-yellow.

5|$|The basidia are 15–25×3.5–5.5µm {{and have}} a slim, club-like shape. Each {{basidium}} features four sterigmata, each of which bear one spore. The spores' shape is slimly ellipsoidal or cylindrical. Their surface is smooth and their walls are thin. Although they are colourless and hyaline, the spores are amyloid, meaning they <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> bluish or purple when stained with Melzer's reagent. This characteristic differs from other very similar species, and this gave the genus its name.|$|E
5|$|Various {{chemical}} color {{tests can}} be used to help identify fruit bodies suspected to be S.amygdalinus. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> the cap flesh dingy orange, while it turns the cap cuticle red, or darker. Ammonia (as ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH) produces a dingy yellow on the flesh, and brown on the cap. Iron sulphate (FeSO4) produces either no change to a pale grey color with both the flesh and the cuticle. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) causes the flesh to turn orange or pink, but has no color reaction with the cuticle.|$|E
5|$|Various {{parts of}} the {{mushroom}} display characteristic color reactions to chemical tests commonly used in mushroom identification. The cap cuticle <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> a blackish color with {{the application of a}} drop of potassium hydroxide (KOH), iron sulfate (FeSO4) solution, or ammonia solution. The mushroom flesh turns grayish-green to greenish black with a drop of FeSO4, and olive to greenish black with KOH or NH4OH.|$|E

Denham notes the missing car and Shaw's safe and, for violating his bail by not declaring the latter, has him remanded back into federal custody until his real court date. Denham and the FBI arrest Josh and the crew (except Slide) as they walk outside the Tower. Miss Iovenko arrives, telling the FBI that she passed her bar exam three days ago and is acting as Josh's attorney. She shows them Shaw's ledger and tells them she <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> it over in exchange for everyone's freedom. The FBI accepts {{on the condition that}} Josh, being the primary conspirator, must serve a minimal two-year sentence, but Denham lowers it to 16 months to make sure Josh gets out for good behavior. Shaw is convicted and sentenced to prison {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

In July 2005, Fonda announced plans to make an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the Iraq War. She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from Cindy Sheehan's activism.|$|E

5|$|Mycena galericulata {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are , 8–10 by 5.5–7μm, and amyloid—which means they <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> blue-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have stout sterigmata, and measure 34–40 by 7–9μm. They may be either two-spored or four-spored. There are numerous club-shaped to rounded cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge), that measure 32–40 by 8–12μm; their apices or the entire enlarged portion bear rodlike projections that become increasingly elongated and branched in age. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue {{has a very}} thin cuticle, under which is a narrow hypoderm, while {{the remainder of the}} tissue comprises densely matted tufts of mycelia, and stains deep vinaceous-brown in iodine. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of the four-spored forms.|$|E
