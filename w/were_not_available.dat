5|$|By 14 August, large {{forces from}} the NK 5th and 12th Divisions, as well was the 766th Independent Regiment were focused entirely on taking P'ohang-dong. However {{they were unable to}} hold it because of U.S. air superiority and naval {{bombardment}} on the town. More importantly, the supply chain had completely broken down for the division, and more food, ammunition and supplies <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>available.</b> Captured North Korean prisoners claimed the units received no food after 12 August and had been so exhausted that they were completely unable to fight. Opposing them, the ROK Capital Division and Task forces P'ohang and Bradley which had joined forces to prepare for a final offensive to push the North Koreans out of the region.|$|E
5|$|By August 14, large NK {{forces were}} focused entirely on taking P'ohang-dong. However {{they were unable}} to hold it because of US air superiority and naval {{bombardment}} on the town. The North Korean supply chain had completely broken down and more food, ammunition, and supplies <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>available.</b> UN forces began their final counteroffensive against the stalled North Korean forces on August 15. Intense fighting around P'ohang-dong ensued for several days as each side suffered large numbers of casualties in back-and-forth battles. By August 17, UN forces were able to push North Korean troops out of the Kyongju and An'gang-ni areas, putting the supply road to Taegu out of immediate danger. By August 19 the North Korean forces had completely withdrawn from the offensive.|$|E
5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% of the poverty line. Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>available</b> to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 {{for a family of}} three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance. Absent children, able-bodied adults were not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic {{program was}} {{adjusted}} {{from that of}} the 1956 Winter Olympics omitting bobsleigh and adding a sport new to Olympic competition, men's biathlon. The sport of military patrol, similar to biathlon, had previously been a medal sport in 1924 and a demonstration sport in 1928, 1936 and 1948. The removal of bobsleigh from the Olympic program was by necessity; the site for the 1960 Games lacked a bobsleigh track and the funds <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>available</b> to build one. Despite only five nations confirming their intention to take part, the removal of the event from the program garnered international criticism. Both men and women competed at the 1960 Games, with women taking part in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and speed skating.|$|E
5|$|The final {{storm was}} last noted on October17. These dates {{fall within the}} period with the most {{tropical}} cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Only two tropical cyclones during the season existed simultaneously. The hurricane brought heavy rainfall to Jamaica, resulting in eight deaths. This storm also left damage to crops and vessels in portions of the Bahamas and Cuba. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>available</b> until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period may not be comprehensive. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated.|$|E
5|$|The {{second game}} {{was held at}} Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore on May 3, 1999, in front of 47,940 fans. By May 3, the Orioles had a 7–17 win-loss record in the 1999 MLB season. The Cuban {{national}} team, meanwhile, was stronger than during the first game, as the 1998–99 Cuban National Series had concluded and players who <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>available</b> for {{the first game of}} the exhibition joined the Cuban team. A 300-person delegation accompanied the Cuban team, including members of the Cuban media, students, and retired players. MLB requested the Federal Aviation Administration clear the airspace above Camden Yards for the game, in response to an attempt by a Miami-based pilot and veteran of the Bay of Pigs invasion, to drop anti-Castro leaflets over Estadio Latinoamericano during the first game.|$|E

Machine guns or anything heavier <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>available</b> at the time. In August 1940, some officers and non-commissioned officers (NCO) were sent to Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands on a commando course.

5|$|As {{with other}} American {{self-propelled}} guns produced {{during the early}} World War II period, the prototype was assembled and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The M2 recoil mechanism {{and other parts of}} the M2 howitzer carriage were used in the vehicle mounting. After several tests, the gun carriage proved fragile on bumpy terrain. The problem was corrected by reinforcing the frame, and redesigning the howitzer mount. Demountable headlights were recommended because of the muzzle blast, although they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>available</b> for early production models. Early models had no shield for the howitzer either, but a foldable shield was added during testing. The gun faced forward, like many other half-track models. The total traverse was 40 degrees and the elevation was from −5 to +35 degrees. The armored windshield cover was remounted so it could fold onto the hood. After further testing, it was accepted for production.|$|E
