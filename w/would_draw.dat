5|$|Concerned by the US carrier {{strikes in}} the Doolittle, Marshall Islands, and Lae-Salamaua raids, Yamamoto {{determined}} {{to force the}} US Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat. Yamamoto decided to invade and occupy Midway Island, which he was sure <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> out the American carrier forces to battle. The Midway invasion was codenamed by the Japanese as Operation MI.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of Saturday 23–24 January, the rebels met at the Mission church in Mbombwe, where Chilembwe gave a speech {{stressing}} {{that none of them}} should expect to survive the reprisals that would follow the revolt but that the uprising <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> greater attention to their conditions and destabilise the colonial system. This, Chilembwe believed, was the only way change would ever occur.|$|E
5|$|In late 2011, the FAA {{assigned}} a common type rating to the 787 and 777, allowing pilots qualified on either aircraft to operate both models, due to related design features. The smaller 787 {{was the first}} stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Reportedly, the 777 could eventually be replaced by a new aircraft family, Yellowstone 3, which <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> upon technologies from the 787.|$|E

The images serve the same purpose in the pieces as a gemstone <b>would,</b> <b>drawing</b> the viewer in and focusing their attention. Her images and inspiration come from art history, iconography, metaphor, and memory.|$|R

5|$|Approval for the mission, codenamed Operation Chariot, {{was given}} on 3 March 1942. Using a French ship would involve using the Free French forces and {{increase}} the number of people aware of the raid. Consequently, it was decided the navy would have to provide a ship of their own. The RAF complained that the raid <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> heavily on their resources; the number of aircraft assigned by RAF Bomber Command was reduced time and time again before the day of the raid. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill further complicated matters when he ordered that bombing should only take place if targets were clearly identified.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Tarrare {{had a huge}} {{appetite}} and by his teens could eat {{a quarter of a}} bullock, weighing as much as Tarrare himself, in a single day. By this time, his parents could not provide for him and had forced him to leave home. For some years after this, he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves and prostitutes, begging and stealing for food, before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling charlatan. Tarrare <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other. He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of snake meat.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{arose from}} other genres. Players {{turned away from}} RPGs, flight {{simulators}} and adventure games in favor of action-oriented titles, such as first-person shooters and real-time strategy games. Later RPGs <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> influences from action genres, but would face new challenges {{in the form of}} massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), a late-1990s trend that may have siphoned players away from single-player RPGs. They also faced competition from Japanese console RPGs, which were becoming increasingly dominant around that time, for reasons such as more accessible, faster-paced action-adventure-oriented gameplay, and a stronger emphasis on storytelling and character interactions.|$|E
50|$|If CD {{was drawn}} as the PB number, a second FAC <b>would</b> be <b>drawn</b> to {{determine}} the position involved. Next, a third FAC <b>would</b> be <b>drawn</b> for a Random Number. Using the CD rating of position player (pre-1988, CD0 through CD2; 1988 and later, CD1 through CD4) and the Random Number, the CD chart would be consulted {{to determine the}} outcome of the play.|$|R

5|$|Concerned by the US carrier {{strikes in}} the Marshall Islands, Lae-Salamaua, and the Doolittle raids, Yamamoto was {{determined}} to force the US Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat. He decided to invade and occupy Midway Atoll, which he was sure <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> out the American carriers to defend it. The Japanese codenamed the Midway invasion Operation MI. Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese plan by breaking its JN-25 code and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, the Australian government decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which precluded sending the Militia outside of Australian territory to fight. While this force <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> from the military forces that already existed—the part-time Citizens Force and the Permanent Military Force—it would be largely be made up from recruits not currently serving. Known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), initially it was to consist of 20,000 men, comprising one infantry division and a light horse brigade. Recruitment for the first intake began on 10 August 1914, and the 7th Battalion was among the first units raised, forming less than a fortnight after the declaration of war.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{were often}} first sketched by Oliver, before {{she moved to}} {{construction}} in three dimensions. When preparing commissions, she <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> on the ideas of clients or {{the nature of the}} site. For large works she created maquettes (or models), sometimes in plasticine, on other occasions using copper wire or, in the case of her 2002 sculpture Globe, wood and metal. Oliver would produce the more delicate works herself. Many were created by crafting and joining wire to create abstract forms. These were built around moulds, twisting the metal into place with pliers, before severing it with wirecutters. Joins were soldered or brazed (though in some pieces, the wire was woven). In Web (2002), copper pieces were sewn together using wire.|$|E
50|$|Bratton {{was criticized}} for his {{emphasis}} on petty crimes, which <b>would</b> presumably <b>draw</b> resources away from addressing more serious crimes.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 12th century, Philip Augustus {{extended}} the Louvre fortress {{to defend the}} city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges {{to either side of}} its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares. In 1190, he transformed Paris' former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of Paris and <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> students from all of Europe.During the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420; in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city, it would remain under English occupation until 1436.|$|E
5|$|Manstein favoured an {{immediate}} pincer {{attack on the}} Kursk salient after the battle at Kharkov, but Hitler was concerned that such a plan <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> forces away from the industrial region in the Donets Basin. In any event, the ground was still too muddy to move the tanks into position. In lieu of {{an immediate}} attack, the OKH prepared Operation Citadel, the launching {{of which would be}} delayed while more troops were gathered in the area and the mud solidified. Meanwhile, the Red Army, well aware of the danger of encirclement, also moved in large numbers of reinforcements, and their intelligence reports revealed the expected locations and timing of the German thrusts.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1905, President Roosevelt further {{consolidated}} {{power in}} Panama by appointing Magoon Minister to Panama, to replace John Barrett. This put Magoon in the unique {{position of being}} both a governor of a U.S. territory and a diplomat to the country of which that territory was an enclave. During the tenure of Governor Davis, there had been friction between him and Minister Barrett. This double appointment would ensure that the two roles could not work at cross-purposes. Magoon <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> two salaries in the arrangement, an issue which would come up later to haunt him. With influential posts in both Panama proper and the Canal Zone, Magoon was an exceptionally powerful man on the Isthmus.|$|E

5|$|On this planet, {{magic and}} {{witchcraft}} are quite normal. The Megans are an ageless species that had, at one time, lived on Earth, and {{were responsible for}} the legends about witches. During this time, the Enterprise crew begin to experiment with magic: Lt. Hikaru Sulu (voiced by George Takei) conjures up a beautiful woman while Science Officer Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) telepathically moves a Vulcan chess piece. Lucien, their guide, warns the crew that their experiments <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> unwanted attention, but it is too late. The Enterprise splits into two halves and disappears, and the crew are transported to a location on the planet that appears to be Salem during the middle of a witch trial in 1691.|$|E
5|$|Similar to Tangled, Frozen {{employed}} a unique artistic style by blending together features of both computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional hand-drawn animation. From the beginning, Buck knew Giaimo {{was the best}} candidate to develop the style he had in mind– which <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> from the best Disney hand-drawn classics of the 1950s, the Disney Little Golden Books, and mid-century modern design– and persuaded {{him to come back}} to Disney to serve as the art director for Frozen. Buck, Lasseter, and Giaimo were all old friends who had first met at the California Institute of the Arts, and Giaimo had previously served as the art director for Disney's Pocahontas (1995), which Buck had worked on as a supervising animator.|$|E
5|$|Survivor Series 1992 was {{attended}} by 17,500 fans, the same number as the previous year. It drew more fans {{than any of the}} following three Survivor Series event <b>would</b> <b>draw.</b> The pay-per-view buyrate was 1.4, which means that 1.4 percent of households to which the event was available purchased the pay-per-view. This was, to that point, the lowest buyrate in Survivor Series history and down more than one-third from the previous year's 2.2 buyrate. The buyrate was higher than that of any of the following twelve Survivor Series events, however.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} European competition, the Heineken Cup, teams from the same country were kept apart where possible. However, as 7 teams qualified from England, 2 pools would by necessity contain two English teams and as 6 French teams qualified, there would be one pool with two French teams. Sale Sharks and Wasps <b>would</b> be <b>drawn</b> into pools which contained one other Aviva Premiership club, and Toulouse <b>would</b> be <b>drawn</b> into a pool which contained one other Top 14 club.|$|R
50|$|Portrayed by Horatio Sanz, Jasper Hahn was {{touted as}} an {{illustrator}} for children's books. During his appearance, he <b>would</b> begin <b>drawing</b> what <b>would</b> initially {{be perceived as}} something phallic. Colin Quinn, and later Jimmy Fallon, would bristle and try to stop him, but the <b>drawing</b> <b>would</b> usually end up as a moose or other animal with a phallic-shaped nose or proboscis. Debuted January 8, 2000.|$|R

5|$|With {{the help}} of several of Roger's friends, Barbara {{attempts}} to oversee his finances and takes {{him out of the}} still-chaotic city. At Tamworth, Roger gradually becomes worse and dies. Stricken and in mourning, Barbara holds a public memorial in London for her deceased husband, despite being warned that it <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> attention to his estate during the Parliamentary inquest into the financial crisis. To give her peace, the Duchess develops a scheme of spiriting her granddaughter out of the country by having her visit their plantation in Virginia. The novel ends with Barbara and several servants leaving on a ship intended for the colonies.|$|E
5|$|After the Holland fight, Dyer {{made several}} {{attempts}} at a rematch with Darcy, reportedly {{to the exclusion}} of other fights, in the belief that the encounter <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> a big crowd and a large purse. The postponed fight with Delmen was again mooted, but this too never occurred. In the meantime Dyer continued to busy himself with charity work, setting up a boxing fund for injured soldiers in Sydney, and continued to tour the vaudeville circuit in New South Wales. Dyer's persistence eventually paid off, and an encounter with Darcy was arranged for 9 October at Rushcutters Bay Stadium, with the Middleweight Championship title at stake. The fight was a one-sided affair, with Dyer outclassed throughout. Although Darcy was warned for a low blow in the fourth round, Dyer was never in the fight and his corner threw in the towel after one minute of the sixth round.|$|E
5|$|As social centres castles were {{important}} places for display. Builders {{took the opportunity}} to draw on symbolism, through the use of motifs, to evoke a sense of chivalry that was aspired to in the Middle Ages amongst the elite. Later structures of the Romantic Revival <b>would</b> <b>draw</b> on elements of castle architecture such as battlements for the same purpose. Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features. The right to crenellate, when granted by a monarch– though it was not always necessary– was important not just as it allowed a lord to defend his property but because crenellations and other accoutrements associated with castles were prestigious through their use by the elite. Licences to crenellate were also proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who was the one responsible for granting permission.|$|E
