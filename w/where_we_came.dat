500|$|Although the survivors' {{experiences}} after Rosewood were disparate, none publicly acknowledged {{what had}} happened. Robie Mortin, Sam Carter's niece, {{was seven years}} old when her father put her on a train to Chiefland, [...] east of Rosewood, on January 3, 1923. Mortin's father avoided the heart of Rosewood {{on the way to the}} depot that day, a decision Mortin believes saved their lives. Mortin's father met them years later in Riviera Beach, in South Florida. None of the family ever spoke about the events in Rosewood, on order from Mortin's grandmother: [...] "She felt like maybe if somebody knew <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> from, they might come at us".|$|E

While she {{was still}} a child in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) he often used to gaze up at the night sky and say, [...] "Makes you think – there are so many worlds up there, wouldn't really matter if we did blow ourselves up – plenty more <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> from." [...] Shikasta gave rise to a religious cult in America. Lessing {{said in an interview that}} its followers had written to her and asked, [...] "When are we going to be visited by the gods?", and she told them that the book is [...] "not a cosmology. It's an invention", and they replied, [...] "Ah, you're just testing us".|$|E
500|$|Genesis were {{targets for}} {{criticism}} throughout the 1970s {{from those who}} disliked progressive rock. Influential BBC DJ John Peel championed the band in their early years and they performed three sessions for him between 1970 and 1972, but he [...] "grew disillusioned with their later excesses". Some regarded the group as overtly middle class, paying {{particular attention to the}} founder members' private education, and claimed rock music was being taken away from the working class, whom they regarded as its core audience. Likening his background to that of the punk artist Joe Strummer, who had become a [...] "people's hero" [...] musician, Gabriel stated in 2013, [...] "To this day, we've never outgrown the snotty rich-kid thing ... we were always very straight about <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> from, and we were middle-class, not aristocratic". Gabriel's theatrics were unpalatable to some of the mainstream rock audience, resulting in a cult following rather than that of a mainstream rock band.|$|E

500|$|Roger Wilkins, {{a history}} {{professor}} at George Mason University who studies race in the United States, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] provided [...] "insightful, wonderful explorations on the complexities of many levels of race." [...] He also said the show [...] "really does understand how we're all caught in this culture, and we're all struggling with it. And we all bring to this jagged enterprise the limited understanding of <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> from and who we are. Being fully alive requires us to struggle with these realities. That's what the show does." [...] In his journal article about the portrayal of African American men in Homicide: Life on the Street, documentary historian Thomas A. Mascaro said the presentation of light-skinned black villains like Luther Mahoney and dark-skinned actors like the one played by James Earl Jones in [...] "Blood Ties", [...] "dispels the notion that black skin color is uniform or determinative with regard to character". Some media outlets described the Watson subplot as a racial spin on the 1996 murder of six-year-old child beauty pageant queen JonBenét Ramsey, although Tom Fontana said any similarities were not intended.|$|E
500|$|Along with Gentlemen, Congregation is {{generally}} considered by music journalists {{to be part of}} the Afghan Whigs' peak recording period. Dulli cites it as [...] "the record <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> into our own". Melody Maker dubbed it [...] "the finest rock LP of the decade" [...] and commented that it is [...] "nothing less than rock raping pop, a ferocious deflowering of Motown's romantic ideal". With Congregation, Stephanie Benson of Rhapsody found the band to be [...] "crucial to the birth of '90s alternative rock." [...] AllMusic's Jason Ankeny said that it was the band's artistic breakthrough and [...] "ticket to the big leagues", [...] "an incendiary and insidious set which bridges the gap between the noisy aggression of the band's early releases and the soulful swagger of their later work." [...] Ankeny also cited it as [...] "the grunge era's most overlooked masterpiece" [...] and an indication of the band's musical growth, writing that [...] "while still unmistakably a member of the Sub Pop stable, there's a greater maturity and depth to their sinewy sound, with a newfound grasp of mood and nuance". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Joe Gross called it a [...] "quantum leap" [...] over the band's previous work, commenting that it [...] "shows that they ditched grunge for soul because they were no damn good at the former and ladies dig the latter." [...] In 2002, Italian music magazine [...] included the album in its list of 100 Best Albums by Decade. Polish webzine [...] ranked it number 79 on its 2004 list of the Top 100 Albums of the '90s. Italian music journalists [...] and [...] included Congregation in their 2010 book on essential rock albums. The Spin Alternative Record Guide (1995) was somewhat less enthusiastic, writing that [...] "the results feel like dress rehearsals for Gentlemen, with one partial exception, 'Conjure Me,' and one absolute triumph: a surging final track ... that might be the Afghan Whigs' strongest recorded performance." ...|$|E
500|$|Ty Burr of the Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{describing}} it as [...] "ridiculously satisfying", and the [...] "best prequel ever". Burr praised the character {{development in the}} film, opining that [...] "emotionally, Star Trek hits every one of its marks, functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades, entertainment mediums, even blurring the line between audience and show." [...] He continued: [...] "Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, Star Trek does what a franchise reboot rarely does. It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place." [...] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an 'A-' grade, commenting that director Abrams [...] "crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars. He felt that the acting from the cast was {{the highlight of the}} filming, asserting that the performance of Pine radiated star quality. Likewise, Travers called Quinto's performance [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "intuitive", and felt that Quinto [...] "gave the film a soul". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote, [...] "Star Trek [...] isn’t just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle's favorite science-fiction series. It's also a testament to television's power as mythmaker, as a source for some of the fundamental stories we tell about ourselves, who we are and <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> from. Slate Dana Stevens felt that the film was [...] "a gift {{to those of us who}} loved the original series, that brainy, wonky, idealistic body of work that aired to almost no commercial success between 1966–69 and has since become a science fiction archetype and object of cult adoration." [...] Time Out London Tom Huddleston praised the aesthetic qualities of the film, such as the design of Enterprise, and praised the performances of the cast. He wrote, [...] "The cast are equally strong: Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character, while Pine powers through his performance in bullish, if not quite Shatner-esque fashion." ...|$|E
