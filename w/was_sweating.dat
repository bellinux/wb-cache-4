25|$|Warrior died on April 8, 2014 in Scottsdale, Arizona. He {{had been}} {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 5, appeared at WrestleMania XXX on April 6, and made his first Raw appearance in almost 18 years on April 7, the day before his death. According to reports, Warrior clutched his chest and collapsed at 5:50p.m. while walking to his car with his wife outside of their hotel in Arizona. He {{was rushed to the}} hospital where he was pronounced dead at age 54. Warrior's colleagues said Warrior appeared frail during WrestleMania weekend, and said that he <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> profusely and breathing heavily backstage.|$|E
500|$|While {{the rest}} of the Scottish bench were celebrating Cooper's {{successful}} penalty, Stein was unanimated. It was thought that he was merely following the advice he had given to his staff and players throughout the evening - [...] "keep your dignity". However, Ferguson had noted that the manager appeared even more pallid, and <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> profusely.|$|E
500|$|In the {{documentary}} Living With Michael Jackson (2003), Michael alleged that {{near the beginning}} of their relationship, the 12-year-old actress tried to seduce the then 17-year-old singer. According to Jackson, the incident happened at her home, where she attempted to unbutton his shirt and talked explicitly about sex. O'Neal's behavior apparently proved too much for Jackson, who became scared and covered his face, before she walked away. When confronted with the allegation, O'Neal claimed to have been [...] "just as shocked as everyone else". She stated that while having respect for Jackson as an artist and a person, he had [...] "a very vivid imagination". The actress described his statements as [...] "inaccurate"; [...] "at 12 years old, {{there was no way she}} was capable of being as mature or as sophisticated as he claimed". O'Neal released her autobiography A Paper Life in 2004, a year after the Jackson documentary. In the book, she claimed it was Jackson who attempted to make out with her. The actress wrote, [...] "I was just 12 and not at all ready for a real-life encounter Michael, who <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> profusely, seemed as intimidated as I was. He jumped up nervously and said, 'Uh ... gotta go.'" ...|$|E

50|$|Phantom <b>sweating</b> <b>is</b> {{another form}} of {{autonomic}} neuropathy. It {{can be observed in}} patients with nerve damage (following accidents), diabetes mellitus {{and as a result of}} sympathectomy. Phantom <b>sweating</b> <b>is</b> a sensation that one <b>is</b> <b>sweating,</b> while the skin remains dry. Sufferers can not distinguish whether it <b>is</b> real <b>sweating</b> or just a sensation. The phenomena is experienced in the anhidriotic, denervated area of the body, presenting an abnormal sympathetic nervous system function.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} primate {{ancestors of}} modern humans most likely had light skin, like our closest modern relative – the chimpanzee. [...] About 7 {{million years ago}} human and chimpanzee lineages diverged, and between 4.5 and 2 million years ago early humans moved out of rainforests to the savannas of East Africa. They not only {{had to cope with}} more intense sunlight but had to develop a better cooling system. It was harder to get food in the hot savannas and as mammalian brains are prone to overheating – 5 or 6°C rise in temperature can lead to heatstroke – so there was a need for the development of better heat regulation. The solution <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> and loss of body hair.|$|E

6000|$|... "What is this--this job?" [...] labored Cleve. He <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> now and {{his hair}} hung damp over his brow. He lost that look which had made him a bold man and seemed a boy again, weak, driven, bewildered.|$|E
60|$|Straight {{to my room}} I hurried, {{changed my}} clothes, and {{less than an hour}} from my escape, in a Turkish bath, I <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> out {{whatever}} germs and other things had penetrated my epidermis, and wishing that I could stand a temperature of three hundred and twenty rather than two hundred and twenty.|$|E

60|$|Girty <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> blood. It trickled {{from his}} ghastly face. All the {{suffering}} and horror he had caused in all his long career was as nothing to that which then rended him. He, the renegade, the white Indian, the Deathshead of the frontier, panted and prayed for a merciful breath. He was exquisitely alive. He was human.|$|E
60|$|The whole crowd--curs to the backbone--yelled and ran; {{leaving one}} man dead, and another {{dying in the}} road. Michele <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> with fear, but he kept his {{weakness}} under, and went down into the town, past {{the house where the}} Sub- Judge had barricaded himself. The streets were empty. Tibasu was more frightened than Michele, for the mob had been taken at the right time.|$|E
60|$|Mr. James Nuttall {{made all}} speed, {{regardless}} of the heat, in his journey from Bridgetown to Colonel Bishop's plantation, and if ever man was built for speed in a hot climate that man was Mr. James Nuttall, with his short, thin body, and his long, fleshless legs. So withered was he {{that it was hard}} to believe there were any juices left in him, yet juices there must have been, for he <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> violently by the time he reached the stockade.|$|E

6000|$|... 'This evening,' {{said the}} thin young man, {{resuming}} his dirge, 'I <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> my brain {{to try to}} think of somebody I could hunt up in this ghastly, deserted city. It isn't so easy, you know, to think of fellows' names and addresses. I can get the names all right, but unless the fellow's in the telephone-book, I'm done. Well, I was trying to think of some of my pals who might still be around the place, and I remembered Gates. Remembered his address, too, by a miracle. You're a pal of his, of course?' ...|$|E
60|$|It was in {{that instant}} that {{rebellion}} stirred in me. Her coming had turned me cold, for all that my body was overheated from the exercise and I <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> furiously. Now, {{at the sound of}} her voice, something of the injustice that oppressed me, something of the unreasoning bigotry that chained and fettered me, stood clear before my mental vision for the first time. It warmed me again with the warmth of sullen indignation. I returned her no answer beyond a curtly respectful invitation that she should speak her mind, couched--as had been her reproof--in a single word of address.|$|E
60|$|The spill had not {{improved}} his clothes or his temper, {{and he had}} lost one spur. He kept the other one employed. By the time that stage was ended, the pony had had as much exercise as he wanted, and, {{in spite of the}} rain, Golightly <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> freely. At the end of another miserable half-hour, Golightly found the world disappear before his eyes in clammy pulp. The rain had turned the pith of his huge and snowy solah-topee into an evil-smelling dough, and it had closed on his head like a half-opened mushroom. Also the green lining was beginning to run.|$|E
60|$|Yea, dear {{brother of}} the outside world, while the {{whitewash}} was running off the press, while the august senators were wining and dining, we three of the living dead, buried alive in solidarity, <b>were</b> <b>sweating</b> our pain in the canvas torture.|$|R

6000|$|Riding postilion-wise, Jeff {{could control}} the horses. The {{dangerous}} curve was passed, {{but not the}} possibility of pursuit. The single leader he was bestriding was panting--more than that, he <b>was</b> <b>SWEATING,</b> and from the evidence of Jeff's hands, sweating BLOOD! Back of his shoulder was a jagged hole, from which his life-blood was welling. The off-wheel horse was limping too. That last volley was no foolish outburst of useless rage, but was deliberate and premeditated skill. Jeff drew the reins, and as the coach stopped, the horse he was riding fell dead. Into the silence that followed broke the measured beat of horses' hoofs on the road above. He was pursued! ...|$|E
60|$|His next pony {{was rather}} a brute at starting, and Golightly's hands being {{slippery}} with the rain, contrived {{to get rid}} of Golightly at a corner. He chased the animal, caught it, and went ahead briskly. The spill had not improved his clothes or his temper, and he had lost one spur. He kept the other one employed. By the time that stage was ended, the pony had had as much exercise as he wanted, and, in spite of the rain, Golightly <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> freely.

60|$|Whatever {{the nature}} of that interview, it did not improve either King's or Prout's ruffled plumes, for, when they came out of the Head's house, eyes noted that the one was red and blue with emotion as to his nose, and that the other <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> profusely. That sight {{compensated}} them amply for the Imperial Jaw with which they were favored by the two. It seems--and who so astonished as they?--that they had held back material facts; were guilty both of suppressio veri and suggestio falsi (well-known gods against whom they often offended); further, that they were malignant in their dispositions, untrustworthy in their characters, pernicious and revolutionary in their influences, abandoned to the devils of wilfulness, pride, and a most intolerable conceit. Ninthly, and lastly, they were to have a care and to be very careful.|$|E
5000|$|A good {{reporter}} who is well-steeped in his {{subject matter and}} who isn’t out to prove his cleverness, but rather <b>is</b> <b>sweating</b> out a detailed understanding of a topic worth exploring, will probably develop intelligent opinions that will inform and perhaps be expressed in his journalism.
