25|$|Although some of {{the above}} forms of {{determinism}} concern human behaviors and cognition, others frame themselves as {{an answer to the}} debate on nature and nurture.

25|$|At this stage, {{the story}} splits off in {{numerous}} possibilities, {{based on the}} player's choices. The narrator continues the story, but when the player comes to an area where a choice is possible, the narrator <b>will</b> <b>suggest</b> which route Stanley will take. The player can opt to go against the narrator and perform the other action, forcing the narration to account for this new direction which may return the player back to the target path or create a new narration. For example, the first choice the player makes in the game is at a set of two open doors, with the narrator stating that Stanley chose the left door; the player can choose to follow this narration, which keeps the narrator's story on track, or may choose the right door, which makes the narrator annoyed and causes him to pressure the player {{to return to the}} 'proper' path. Because of this, much of the story is considered thought-provoking about the nature of choice and decisions. The narration also breaks the fourth wall on several occasions in handling the player's decisions.|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{believed}} retaliatory prosecution claims {{differed from}} such ordinary retaliation claims in two key respects. [...] First, when the claimed retaliation is the bringing of criminal charges, {{there will always}} be evidence showing whether there was or was not probable cause for the underlying charge. [...] Demonstrating that there was no probable cause will tend to show that retaliation was the but-for cause for instigating the prosecution, while, conversely, establishing the existence of probable cause <b>will</b> <b>suggest</b> that prosecution would have occurred regardless. [...] The Court did not conclude that this alone meant that the plaintiff should be required to plead and prove no probable cause, but it did mean that any case for retaliatory prosecution would likely litigate the issue.|$|E

2500|$|Boat {{designs are}} used for {{departure}} or arrival wishes, adapted by Banmi Shofu Ryu from classic Ikenobo principles, and uses a boat-shaped container that may sit on a table or hang from a hook. The wish message {{is determined by the}} direction of the “oar” (nagashi) or a long sweeping material or branch. An oar that sweeps {{to the right of the}} viewer means a departing boat (De-Fune), and therefore a farewell or bon voyage wish. The opposite sweep direction indicates a welcome or a wish for a safe return (Iri-Fune). [...] Placement of floral and line materials follow the same rules for shin, soe and uke branches. Note that whether or not the boat is hanging or sitting on a surface, the arrangement should be at eye level so that the water cannot be seen. Otherwise, this <b>will</b> <b>suggest</b> a leaking boat. Sato, S. (2012). Ikebana: The art of arranging flowers.Tuttle Publishing.|$|E
2500|$|For example, if {{a patron}} {{requests}} [...] "a good book," [...] the readers' advisor might ask {{the reader to}} describe a book they have enjoyed. [...] The focus of the conversation is not on recitation of plot, but on the aforementioned appeal elements (i.e. pace, subject, tone, writing style, etc.). [...] In our example, the patron tells the readers' advisor of a humorous mystery novel with a sharp-tongued female protagonist. [...] Our readers' advisor also learns that the patron prefers fast-paced dialogue to excessive descriptive passages. [...] Once the appeal elements have been identified (i.e. a humorous mystery featuring snappy dialogue and a female protagonist), the readers' advisor <b>will</b> <b>suggest</b> appropriate titles in the collection by drawing on personal knowledge and/or by consulting appropriate print and online resources. [...] Even though the patron requested a mystery, a skilled readers advisor will often offer a suggestion or two that point the reader to new a new vista outside of a mentioned genre or milieu.|$|E
2500|$|Typically counselors <b>will</b> <b>suggest</b> an {{applicant}} {{apply to a}} mix of {{the different types of}} schools, usually having at least one safety school, but the numbers of the others are up to students and families. Andover's counseling director recommends that a student apply to a minimum of two [...] "solid" [...] schools and two [...] "probable" [...] schools. Many high schools subscribe to an online service called Naviance, which, among other things, can help a student gauge the likelihood of admission to a particular college. It is based on a student's grades and test scores in comparison to the admissions results from students from previous years applying to that particular college (see diagram). Naviance uses a scattergram to graphically illustrate the chances for a student from a particular high school being admitted into a particular college or university. In addition, counselors can help a student consider different types of colleges, such as liberal arts colleges, research universities, and specialty schools. A report in Time magazine in 2013 suggested that it was almost impossible for poor students to gain admission to elite universities, and that the percentage of students at 28 elite colleges coming from less affluent households was relatively constant at around 10% from 2001 to 2009, based on a study that included all eight Ivy League schools. The difficulty of admissions to elite universities has sometimes prompted accusations: ...|$|E

2500|$|In a March 2015 {{review of}} the Android app, Sarah Mitroff of CNET wrote that the new Material Design-inspired app was [...] "cleaner", with [...] "fewer distractions and {{colorful}} graphics that add a lot of personality to an otherwise dull app". She praised the Smart Suggestions feature for making new event creation easy, adding that [...] "Even {{after just a few}} letters, the app <b>will</b> <b>suggest</b> the most relevant appointments. This is a great feature for creating events that occur over and over, like a haircut or doctor's appointment, because the app remembers the phrases you use". She complimented the integration between Google Calendar and Gmail, writing that [...] "All of the relevant details are there, including confirmation numbers, links to the source email, even gate assignments for flights", and called it [...] "one of my favorite parts of the app", but also noted that the feature could be turned off. Furthermore, she praised [...] "the personal design touches that keep it from looking dull", namely the app offering visual illustrations for certain types of events, like a bucket of popcorn for movie events, or a visual map of the event location, as well as themed illustrations for different months, including [...] "a snow-covered mountain and a skier" [...] for December. Overall, she wrote that Google Calendar [...] "is a reliable, simple and playful alternative to your device's built-in calendar" [...] and that it is [...] "efficient and a breeze to use".|$|E
2500|$|Investment and {{accumulation}} goals: planning how {{to accumulate}} enough money – for large purchases and life events – {{is what most}} people consider to be financial planning. [...] Major reasons to accumulate assets include, purchasing a house or car, starting a business, paying for education expenses, and saving for retirement. Achieving these goals requires projecting what they will cost, and {{when you need to}} withdraw funds that will be necessary to be able to achieve these goals. [...] A major risk to the household in achieving their accumulation goal is the rate of price increases over time, or inflation. [...] Using net present value calculators, the financial planner <b>will</b> <b>suggest</b> a combination of asset earmarking and regular savings to be invested in a variety of investments. [...] In order to overcome the rate of inflation, the investment portfolio has to get a higher rate of return, which typically will subject the portfolio to a number of risks. [...] Managing these portfolio risks is most often accomplished using asset allocation, which seeks to diversify investment risk and opportunity. [...] This asset allocation will prescribe a percentage allocation to be invested in stocks (either preferred stock or common stock), bonds (for example mutual bonds or government bonds, or corporate bonds), cash and alternative investments. [...] The allocation should also take into consideration the personal risk profile of every investor, since risk attitudes vary from person to person.|$|E
