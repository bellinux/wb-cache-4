A virtual world seems the ideal bridge between the innate interactivity of online courses and the intense absorption offered by immersive role-playing video games. Virtual <b>worlds,</b> <b>as</b> digital learning objects appear to provide a space for constructivist learning at its best, facilitating more student engagement than the simple discussion boards comprising most online courses. Students in a virtual world can actively create their own projects as three-dimensional environments without the restrictions of gravity, scale, economics, identity, or distance. Virtual <b>worlds</b> <b>as</b> educational spaces—with their three-dimensional landscapes and customizable avatars—seem so similar to video games that educators may assume, as we did when we considered designing a course in Second Life, that students will become as motivated by virtual <b>worlds</b> <b>as</b> they are by video games.
