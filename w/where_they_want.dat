StubHub applications for iPhone, iPad, BlackBerry 10, and Android also allow users to decide <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to sit using interactive venue maps and the number of seats, and to plan the event by finding local restaurants, bars, and parking facilities. In 2012, StubHub integrated with Apple Passbook. Also in 2012, StubHub announced that Adele was the best-selling British act of 2011-2, with sales worth $35.18 million for her performances and merchandise alone.|$|E

50|$|There was one {{usage of}} a single-ply code wheel, where only two {{challenge}} symbols were used; in the Amiga game Rocket Ranger, the player turned {{the wheel to}} match their Ranger's current location, then read a value from the hole corresponding to the location <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to fly to. The holes were in a simple column. Since {{this was the only}} mechanism for the player to specify <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to fly, it was impossible for crackers to remove it from the game without destroying the entire gameplay.|$|R

25|$|The {{initial public}} {{offering}} (IPO) market in India has been small compared to NYSE and NASDAQ, raising US$300 million in 2013 and US$1.4 billion in 2012. Ernst & Young stated that the low IPO activity reflects market conditions, slow government approval processes and complex regulations. Before 2013, Indian companies {{were not allowed to}} list their securities internationally without first completing an IPO in India. In 2013, these security laws were reformed and Indian companies can now choose <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to list first: overseas, domestically, or both concurrently. Further, security laws have been revised to ease overseas listings of already-listed companies, to increase liquidity for private equity and international investors in Indian companies.|$|E
25|$|Skilled {{players can}} also hold {{a ball in}} place with the flipper, giving them more control over <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to place the ball when they shoot it forward. This is known as trapping. This {{technique}} involves catching {{the ball in the}} corner between the base of the flipper and the wall to its side, just as the ball falls towards the flipper; the flipper is then released, which allows the ball to roll slowly downward against the flipper. The player then chooses the moment to hit the flipper again, timing the shot as the ball slides slowly against the flipper. Multi-ball games, in particular, reward trapping techniques. Usually this is done by trapping one or more balls out of play with one flipper, then using the other flipper to score points with the remaining ball or balls.|$|E

However, Ayrton is a traitor, who was not present during the loss of the Britannia, but was {{abandoned}} in Australia after a failed attempt to seize control of the ship to practice piracy. He tries to take control of the Duncan, but by sheer luck, this attempt also fails. However the Glenarvans, the Grant children, Paganel and some sailors are left in Australia, and mistakenly believing that the Duncan is lost, they sail to Auckland, New Zealand, from <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to come back to Europe. When their ship is wrecked south of Auckland on the New Zealand coast, they are captured by a Māori tribe, but luckily manage to escape and board a ship that they discover, to their astonishment, to be the Duncan.|$|E

25|$|Beginners tend {{to point}} with the rod to <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to throw, but the {{movement}} of the hand has to be a controlled speed-up and then come to an abrupt stop. The rod will then start to unfurl and the tip of the rod will reach a high speed in the required direction. The high speed of the rod tip toward the target gives the impulse to make the cast, the abrupt stop and retreat of the rod tip is essential for the formation of a loop. Experienced fishermen also improve the speed of the line leaving the rod tip by a technique called hauling, applying a quick fast pull with the hand holding the line. At the end of the cast when the line is stretched the line as a whole will still have speed and the fisherman can let some extra line through their fingers making a false throw, either forward or backward or to finish the cast and start fishing.|$|E
25|$|Once {{one or more}} {{units have}} been {{selected}}, the player can click {{on the ground to}} make them walk to the selected spot, or click on an enemy to make them attack. Units with projectile weapons, such as archers and dwarves can also be ordered to attack a specific spot on the ground, rather than an enemy. It is also important that the player have their units facing in the right direction. This is accomplished by pressing the left or the right arrow key or moving the mouse to rotate the direction of the units as they move to the selected location. Facing the correct direction is especially important when using formations, of which there are nine available. After selecting a group of units, the player must press the corresponding formation button on the keyboard, and then click on the ground <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> the units to form. The player can also order all selected units to scatter and to retreat.

Ross returns home, dejected, and finds a message from Rachel on the phone. She explains her actions and decides to get off the plane, but the message cuts off. Ross panickingly tries fixing the answering machine, wondering to himself out loud if she got off the plane. From behind him, Rachel says she did. They kiss and get back together for good, both agreeing that this is <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to be. The following morning, the friends gather in Monica and Chandler's empty apartment. With some time remaining before Monica and Chandler leave for their new house, the six all leave their keys to the apartment on the kitchen counter and decide to go for one last cup of coffee together, to which Chandler sarcastically quips, [...] "Where?".

500|$|After {{watching}} {{the first several}} episodes of season three, Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine gave the show 3.5/4 stars, and praised it for making a [...] "huge, game-changing step forward". He continued that [...] "Hard science meets soft comedy, {{and the results are}} consistently surprising and rarely disappointing. The solid mythology and high stakes keep the series moving as forward as quickly as FlashForward and The Event, but the dual tones of the two worlds offer considerably more breadth in the stories it tells... captivating television". Robert Bianco from USA Today praised Torv, Noble, and Jackson's performances. He however disliked the new plotline of two Olivias, explaining [...] "It's hard to fault the execution of the first two episodes, which skillfully set up Fringe's two competing universes and two misplaced Olivias... Yet well-done isn't the same as welcome. I'm not giving up on the show, which was one of last year's best. But I don't want to spend weeks watching our Olivia suffer and their Olivia make Walter and Peter suffer. You have to give writers leeway to take you <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to go — but at a certain point, commercial entertainment has to be entertaining, or there's no reason to watch".|$|E
500|$|The series' {{background}} music is composed by William Kevin Anderson, and Daniel Ingram composes the songs, which are only included {{if they would}} make sense in the episode's script. The production team identifies specific parts of the episode <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> music cues, allowing Anderson to create appropriate music for each. Ingram works alongside Anderson's compositions to create vocal songs that mesh with the {{background music}} while filling out the show's fantasy setting. The composition {{of the music and}} songs far precedes the broadcast of the episode; for example, songs for the show's third season that began airing in November 2012 were composed in 2011. Ingram considered that songs from previous shows of My Little Pony were [...] "a little bit dated" [...] and decided to bring more interesting work to the Friendship Is Magic series. Such changes include making songs with more emotional depth than typical for children's animation, and tending to write songs that can be enjoyed musically outside of the context of the episode. Ingram's songs have [...] "became bigger and more epic, more Broadway and more cinematic over time" [...] with Hasbro blessing the effort to try [...] "something groundbreaking for daytime television", according to Ingram. Lyrics and overall musical themes may be suggested by the writers; two examples include songs written by Amy Keating Rogers, who is a self-professed Stephen Sondheim fan. The song [...] "The Art of the Dress" [...] in the first-season episode [...] "Suited for Success" [...] is inspired by [...] "Putting it Together" [...] from the musical Sunday in the Park with George, while the season one finale's song, [...] "At The Gala", is based on Sondheim's Into the Woods. A large musical number in the episode [...] "The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000" [...] paid homage to the song [...] "Ya Got Trouble" [...] from Meredith Willson's musical, The Music Man.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the run-up}} the bowler will bring his lead foot down on the pitch with the knee as {{straight}} as possible. This aids in generating speed but can be dangerous due to the pressure placed on the joint by this action. Knee injuries are not uncommon amongst fast bowlers: for example, the English pace bowler David Lawrence was sidelined for many months after splitting his kneecap in two. The pressure on the leading foot is such that some fast bowlers cut the front off their shoes to stop their toes from being injured as they are repeatedly pressed against the inside of the shoe. The bowler will then bring their bowling arm up over their head and release the ball at the height appropriate to <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> the ball to pitch. Again, the arm must be straight although this is a stipulation of the laws of cricket rather than an aid to speed. Bending the elbow and [...] "chucking" [...] the ball would make it too easy for the bowler to aim accurately at the batsman's wicket and get them out.|$|E
