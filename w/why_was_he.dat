25|$|The 19th century Italian writer Arturo Graf {{gives this}} version of the legend in his 1889 book Il Diavolo : There was once a duchess of Normandy who was tormented with a desire to have {{children}} and yet could have none. Weary of recommending herself to God, who will not listen to her, she betakes herself to the Devil, and her wish is speedily satisfied. A son is born to her, a veritable firebrand. As an infant, he bites his nurse and tears out her hair; as a lad, he knifes his teachers; at the age of twenty, he becomes a bandit chief. He is dubbed knight, in the belief that thus the wicked instincts raging within him may be overcome; but thereafter he is worse than he was before. No one surpasses him in strength or in courage. In a tourney he overthrows and slays thirty opponents; then he goes roaming about the world; then he returns to his native land, and begins once more to play the bandit, robbing, burning, murdering, ravishing. One day, after cutting the throats of all the nuns of a certain abbey, he remembers his mother and goes in search of her. Soon as they spy him, the servants take to their heels, scattering in all directions; not one tarries to ask him whence he comes or what he desires. Then, {{for the first time in}} his life, Robert is astounded at the horror which he inspires in his fellow-beings; for the first time, he becomes conscious of his own monstrous wickedness, and he feels how his heart is pierced by the sharp tooth of remorse. But why is he wickeder than other men? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> born thus? Who made him what he is? An ardent longing seizes him to unravel this mystery. He hastens to his mother, and with drawn sword he adjures her to unveil to him the secret of his birth. Learning this, he becomes frantic with terror, shame, and grief. But his sturdy nature is not weakened; he does not yield to despair; instead, the hope of a laborious redemption, of a marvelous victory, urges and spurs on his proud spirit. He will learn to conquer Hell, to subdue himself, to thwart the designs of that accursed fiend who created him to serve his own ends, who has made of him a docile instrument of destruction and of sin. And he makes no delay. He goes to Rome, casts himself at the feet of the pope, makes confession to a holy hermit, submits himself to the harshest kind of penance, and swears that henceforth he will taste no food that he has not first wrested from the jaws of a dog. On two separate occasions, when Rome was besieged by the Saracens, he fights incognito for the Emperor and gains the victory for the Christians. Recognized at last, he refuses all rewards and honors, the imperial crown, even the monarch's own daughter, goes away to dwell with his hermit in the wilderness, and dies a saint, blessed by both God and men. In other accounts, he finally weds the beautiful princess who is deeply in love with him.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{had already}} {{completed}} recording sessions for Don't Be Cruel in Los Angeles, California, but felt {{something was missing}} in the record. He said, [...] "I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better than New York {{to come up with}} it'". He travelled to the city with producer Gene Griffin. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] was written and co-produced by Brown and Griffin. It was recorded at Axis Studios and mixed at Soundworks, in New York. The track was mastered at Future Disc Systems in Hollywood, California. During an interview with The Hour on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, [...] "A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> doing this [...] It's my way of expressing to people it's your prerogative to do as you want, but make sure what you do is the right thing". A CD single of remixes by Joe T. Vannelli was released on October 13, 1995.|$|E

2500|$|The Talmud {{states that}} Pharaoh's {{daughter}} {{played a role}} in why Jeroboam was found worthy of becoming ruler of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. At Sanhedrin 101b it says [...] "Why did Jeroboam merit sovereignty? Because he reproved Solomon. And <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> punished? Because he reproved him publicly. As it is written, And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father. He said thus to him: Thy father David made breaches in the wall, that Israel might come up [...] on the Festivals; whilst thou hast closed them, in order to exact toll for the benefit of Pharaoh's daughter. What is meant by And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king? [...] — R. Nahman said: He took off his phylacteries in front of him." ...|$|E
2500|$|On an {{occasion}} in 628, Wang was attending a feast held by Emperor Taizong, when a beautiful concubine of Emperor Taizong's, who was originally a concubine of Li Yuan the Prince of Lujiang {{and who was}} taken into Emperor Taizong's palace after Li Yuan was executed, was attending to Emperor Taizong. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "The Prince of Lujiang was despicable. [...] He killed her husband and seized her. [...] How could he survive long after this barbarous act!" [...] Wang instead responded, [...] "Does Your Imperial Majesty believe that the Prince of Lujiang was correct in seizing this woman?" [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Why do you ask me whether it is correct to kill a woman's husband and seize her?" [...] Wang responded, [...] "I had once read from the writings of Guan Zhong, which stated, 'When Duke Huan of Qi visited the land of Guo , he asked the seniors of Guo, [...] "Why was Guo destroyed?" [...] The seniors stated, [...] "The lord of Guo knew right from wrong." [...] Duke Huan responded, [...] "If you are correct, then he was an intelligent ruler. [...] <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> destroyed?" [...] The seniors responded, [...] "The lord of Guo knew what was right but could not do it. [...] He also knew what was wrong but could not stop doing it. [...] That was why he was destroyed."' [...] Now, this woman is still by your side. [...] I believe it is that Your Imperial Majesty in fact believes that this is right. [...] If you {{believe that this is}} wrong, you are the one who knows what is wrong and could not stop doing it." [...] Although Emperor Taizong could not send away the woman, he was nevertheless humbled by Wang's words and respected him for his words. [...] On another occasion, there was an incident where Emperor Taizong had the official Zu Xiaosun (祖孝孫) teach his ladies in waiting music, and when the ladies in waiting could not learn it well, rebuked Zu. [...] Wang and Wen Yanbo spoke against the rebuke, stating that it was not appropriate for Emperor Taizong to have had an important official become a music teacher for ladies in waiting in the first place. [...] Emperor Taizong became angry and rebuked Wen and Wang. [...] Wen bowed and begged for forgiveness, but Wang refused to do so, stating to Emperor Taizong that the rebuke to him and Wen was not warranted as they were reporting what was true. [...] Emperor Taizong was surprised, but the next day indicated to the high-level officials that he was rash and improper in rebuking Wang and Wen.|$|E

6000|$|This is an 'argumentum in circulo', and 'petitio rei sub lite'. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> {{called the}} Son in 'antithesis' to the Father, if it meant, [...] "no not the Christ, except in his {{character}} of the co-eternal Son, included in the Father?"

6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Ayala, quite satisfied,--remembering {{now that}} she had heard her friend Nina boast of a Colonel cousin, who was {{supposed}} to be the youngest Colonel in the British army, who had done some wonderful thing,--taken a new province in India, or marched across Africa, or defended the Turks,--or perhaps conquered them. She knew that he was very brave,--but <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> so very ugly? His hair was ruby red, and very short; and he had a thick red beard: not silky, but bristly, with each bristle almost a dagger,--and his mouth was enormous. His eyes were very bright, and there was a smile about him, partly of fun, partly of good humour. But his mouth! And then that bristling beard! Ayala was half inclined to like him, because he was so completely master of himself, so unlike the unhappy ancient gentleman who was still hovering at a distance.
