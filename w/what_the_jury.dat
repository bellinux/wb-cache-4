The money was awarded stemming from arson convictions; these Klan units burned down the historic black church in 1995.

The next day and the day after, he hung about the court-room, drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out. Huck was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each other. Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination always brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the court-room, but {{invariably}} heard distressing news--the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor Potter.

6000|$|Before the Council (May 1567) Appleyard {{confessed that}} he had said to people that he had often moved the Earl to let him pursue the murderers of Amy, 'showing certain {{circumstances}} which led him to think surely that she was murdered.' He had said that Leicester, on the other hand, cited the verdict of the jury, but he himself declared that the jury, in fact, 'had not as yet given up their verdict.' After these confessions Appleyard lay in the Fleet prison, destitute, and scarce {{able to buy a}} meal. On May 30, 1567, he wrote an abject letter to the Council. He had been offered every opportunity of accusing those whom he suspected, and he asked for 'a copy of the verdict presented by the jury, whereby I may see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> have found,' after which he would take counsel's advice. He got a copy of the verdict (?) (would that we had the copy!) and, naturally, as he was starving, professed himself amply satisfied by 'proofs testified under the oaths of fifteen persons,' that Amy's death was accidental. 'I have not money left to find me two meals.' In such a posture, Appleyard would, of course, say anything to get himself out of prison. Two days later he confessed that for three years he had been, in fact, trying to blackmail Leicester on several counts, Amy's murder and two political charges.* ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{about two}} Sam and Carry {{were told to}} go into Court, and way was made for the old man to {{accompany}} them. At that moment the cross-examination was being continued of the man who, early on the Sunday morning, had seen the Grinder with his companion in the cart on the road leading towards Pycroft Common. A big burly barrister, with a broad forehead and grey eyes, was questioning this witness as to {{the identity of the}} men in the cart; and at every answer that he received he turned round to the jury as though he would say [...] "There, then, what do you think of the case now, when such a man as that is brought before you to give evidence?" [...] "You will swear, then, that these two men who are here in the dock were the two men you saw that morning in that cart?" [...] The witness said that he would so swear. [...] "You knew them both before, of course?" [...] The witness declared that he had never seen either of them before in his life. [...] "And you expect the jury to believe, now that the lives of these men depend on their believing it, that after the lapse of a year you can identify these two men, whom you had never seen before, and who were at that time being carried along the road at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour?" [...] The witness, who had already encountered a good many of these questions, and who was inclined to be rough rather than timid, said that he didn't care twopence <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> believed. It was simply his business to tell what he knew. Then the judge looked at that wicked witness,--who had talked in this wretched, jeering way about twopence!--looked at him over his spectacles, and shaking his head as though with pity at that witness's wickedness, cautioned him as to the peril of his body, making, too, a marked reference to the peril of his soul by that melancholy wagging of the head. Then the burly barrister with the broad forehead looked up beseechingly to the jury. Was it right that any man should be hung for any offence against whom such a witness as this was brought up to give testimony? It was the manifest feeling of the crowd in the court that the witness himself ought to be hung immediately. [...] "You may go down, sir," [...] said the burly barrister, giving an impression to those who looked on, but did not understand, that the case was over as far as it depended on that man's evidence. The burly barrister himself was not so sanguine. He knew very well that the judge who had wagged his head in so melancholy a way at the iniquity of a witness who had dared to say that he didn't care twopence, would, when he was summing up, refer to the presence of the two prisoners in the cart as a thing fairly supported by evidence. The amount of the burly barrister's achievement was simply this,--that for the moment a sort of sympathy was excited on behalf of the prisoners by the disapprobation which was aroused against the wicked man who hadn't cared twopence. Sympathy, like electricity, will run so quick that no man may stop it. If sympathy might be made to run through the jury-box there might perchance be a man or two there weak enough to entertain it to the prejudice of his duty on that day. The hopes of the burly barrister in this matter did not go further than that.|$|E

40|$|In civil cases, forum {{selection}} {{has become}} an integral part of litigation strategy. Plaintiffs have the initial choice of where to file a complaint, and thus where to begin a lawsuit. Defendants have the power to remove cases, under circumstances prescribed by statute, from state court to federal court. Many factors enter into the decision of where to file a complaint or whether to remove a case including convenience, applicable law, and suspected biases. But <b>what</b> about <b>the</b> <b>jury?</b> Should a plaintiff consider characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> when deciding where to file a complaint or a defendant in a civil case when deciding whether to remove? In criminal cases, where the defendant is tried is determined largely by what type of crime the defendant has committed—federal or state—and where the crime has taken place. Is <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> afforded to a criminal defendant significantly different based on whether the defendant committed a crime against New York state or the United States, or whether the crime took place downstate or upstate? Should a criminal prosecutor consider characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> before deciding to bring a case against a defendant who has committed a certain type of crime? This paper will attempt to answer these key questions in civil and criminal cases. Part I will examine the role of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> and <b>the</b> court structure in New York. Part II will examine New York-specific differences between state and federal juries by examining methods of <b>jury</b> pool assembly, <b>the</b> demographics of members comprising <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> pool in all New York counties, and other factors that may influence the juror experience or the representativeness of <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b> Part III will provide advice for litigators and prosecutors, as well as determine any consequences of state and federal differences. Overall, my research suggests that there are key differences between both the various procedures and demographics of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> pool that can influence a trial proceeding in state and federal courts in New York...|$|R

40|$|Some of {{the most}} vociferous criticisms of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> relate to its {{performance}} in cases involving business and corporate wrongdoing. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> 2 ̆ 7 s competence in such cases is assaulted {{on a variety of}} fronts. Critics question <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> 2 ̆ 7 s factfinding ability in cases with business and corporate parties, and doubt whether lay jurors can understand the often complex and esoteric evidence of business wrongdoing. Others claim that bias and prejudice, rather than evidence, determine jury decisions about businesses and corporations. The presumed biases cut both ways. The generally positive regard in which the public holds business is credited with creating leniency toward business wrongdoing. In contrast, other critics perceive harsh treatment for businesses in cases that pit corporations against individual litigants. Jurors 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of and experiences with business, their understanding of business transactions, and their beliefs about the responsibilities of corporations in contemporary society may all play a role in their determination of liability and damages in specific trials. Yet to date there have been few systematic analyses of how jurors decide cases involving businesses and corporations. This article begins to develop a comprehensive account of jury decisionmaking in such cases. It starts by showing that suits involving businesses and corporations form an increasing part of <b>the</b> contemporary <b>jury</b> 2 ̆ 7 s caseload, and thus deserve systematic scrutiny and investigation. <b>The</b> issue of <b>jury</b> competence in business cases is best addressed by analyzing existing research on jury decisionmaking. Two key questions about jury competence, reflecting two criticisms of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> in business cases, will be explored here. First, <b>what</b> are <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> 2 ̆ 7 s factfinding abilities in such cases? Are jurors able to understand and evaluate the specialized technical evidence so central to the evaluation of much business wrongdoing? Second, in cases involving individual lawsuits against businesses, are juries biased in their decisionmaking, either for or against business...|$|R
