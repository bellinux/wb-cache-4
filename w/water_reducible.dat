40|$|A Comparison of Solvent and Water-Borne Alkyd Coatings Abstract Conventional solvent based alkyd {{coatings}} {{have gone}} out of favor due to concerns over volatile organic compound (VOC) content. However, due to recent focus on renewable raw materials, alkyds are making a comeback in waterborne form. Water based alkyd coatings are known to have poor shelf stability and corrosion resistance, as well as other problems during the formulation process. This project focused on comparing solvent borne to two types of water-borne alkyds, <b>water</b> <b>reducible</b> alkyds and alkyds emulsions. The purpose was to understand the differences between the three types of alkyds in terms of their production and final properties. It was ultimately hoped that the formulations used for this project would prove to solve the problems normally experienced by waterborne alkyds. After testing several chemical and physical properties, it was determined that the solvent borne alkyd coatings performed better than both water based systems in corrosion resistance, accelerated weathering, and shelf stability but the <b>water</b> <b>reducible</b> and emulsion alkyd coatings performed similarly to the solvent borne alkyd in gloss, contrast ratio, and durability. The VOC emissions for all three alkyd types were as expected; the solvent borne had the highest emission at 253 g/L, followed by <b>water</b> <b>reducible</b> with 166 g/L, and emulsion with 34 g/L. The History of VOC Regulations in the United States Abstract In another solvent based alkyd coating focused project within my research group, the question of the how volatile organic compound (VOC) regulation in the United States (U. S.) evolved came up. It quickly became apparent that no comprehensive answer to this question existed. Part two of this project is an attempt to answer this question in a comprehensive manner. VOC regulations started in California in the late 1970 s, and paints and coatings became a nationally regulated emission source by the 1990 s. The U. S. government limited harmful emissions, such as smog and compounds contributing to ozone depletion, through Clean Air Acts. The first Clean Air Act was enacted in 1965, but it wasnâ€™t until the Clean Air Act of 1990 that VOC emissions became a focus. VOCs are not inherently hazardous but are a source of concern because they serve as a precursor to the formation of damaging ground level ozone. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established the minimum VOC emission limits in the Architectural and Industrial Maintenance (AIM) federal rule, but each state or state subdivision can enforce stricter limits within their borders. The strictest limits are set by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) in Southern California, but other entities exist. This report thoroughly documents the history of VOC regulation in the United States by collecting, combining, organizing, and summarizing information gathered from various industries and government publications, agency members, and industrial and academic professionals...|$|E
40|$|The California Air Resources Board (CARB) {{plans to}} reduce the {{volatile}} organic compound (VOC) limit of specialty primers, sealers, and undercoaters (SPSU), {{also referred to as}} stain blocking primers, from 350 g/L to 100 g/L in January of 2012. These coatings are primarily used as stain blocking primers over a variety of substrates, such as wood and drywall. Currently the stain blocking primers that are considered most effective are solvent based primers that contain VOC levels much higher than 100 g/L. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine if primers on the market today with a VOC content of 100 g/L or less can provide acceptable performance in comparison to primers with a VOC content greater than 100 g/L. This project had four milestones: 1) survey currently available SPSU coatings and related literature, 2) substrate and stain characterization, 3) benchmark testing of existing formulated commercial products, and 4) prepare a final report. This report: 1) describes the preliminary work performed in preparation of a more systematic and comprehensive study to evaluate the performance of paints sold for the SPSU market, 2) describes the final results of selected test methods for all primers, and 3) discusses the future steps required for the completion of this project. In preliminary testing, six primers, both waterborne and solvent based, were selected for testing and comparison. Basic primer characterization was completed, including sag, leveling, contrast ratio, and density, as was preliminary stain blocking testing, including stains by various common markers and tannin staining from dark wood. From the tests conducted during this portion of the project, and through input from an industrial advisory panel, a total of 15 commercially available primers, 7 solvent based and 8 water based, were tested. Acceptable test methods representing both the physical properties and the stain blocking capabilities of the SPSU primers were also selected from the preliminary testing and industry counsel. As a result of the data obtained from stain blocking testing, conclusions were drawn regarding the stain blocking capabilities of both categories of primer and also about each primer individually. Although it cannot be said that all stain blocking primers, both waterborne and solvent based, perform equally, it can be said that there are waterborne primers that perform as well or nearly as well as solvent based primers in several of the stain blocking tests. Part B of this report addresses the characterization of a <b>water</b> <b>reducible</b> coating for polypropylene. The solvent retention of the paint with varying drying times and film thicknesses is analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Solvent retention affects the production and shipment of coated polypropylene siding. When solvent is retained within the coating, adhesion can be reduced, and stacking or movement of the product may result in adhesion failure. Corona treatment of polypropylene was used to increase the surface tension of the substrate and improve adhesion. It was hoped that the surface tension would rise to 60 dynes/cm, however this could not be accomplished. An increase in surface tension to 38 dynes/cm was achieved and proved to be effective at significantly increasing the adhesion of the coating to the substrate...|$|E
