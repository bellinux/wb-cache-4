5|$|The young Ueshiba {{was raised}} in a {{somewhat}} privileged setting. His father Yoroku was a wealthy gentleman farmer and minor politician, being an elected member of the Nishinotani village council for 22 consecutive years. His mother Yuki was from the Itokawa clan, a prominent local family who could trace their lineage back to the Heian period. Ueshiba <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> weak, sickly child and bookish in his inclinations. At a young age his father encouraged him to take up sumo wrestling and swimming and entertained him with stories of his great-grandfather Kichiemon, who was considered a very strong samurai in his era. The need for such strength was further emphasized when the young Ueshiba witnessed his father being attacked by followers of a competing politician.|$|E
5|$|Under Louis, {{only between}} 20 and 50 prisoners were usually {{held at the}} Bastille at any one time, {{although}} as many as 111 were held {{for a short period}} in 1703. These prisoners were mainly from the upper classes, and those who could afford to pay for additional luxuries lived in good conditions, wearing their own clothes, living in rooms decorated with tapestries and carpets or taking exercise around the castle garden and along the walls. By the late 17th century, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> disorganised library for the use of inmates in the Bastille, although its origins remain unclear.|$|E
5|$|Colley Cibber <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> {{unsuccessful}} young actor at {{the time}} of the split, with a squeaky voice and without any of the physical attractiveness of the soon-to-be-dead Horden. After the success of Love's Last Shift, his status was transformed, with both companies vying for his services as actor and playwright. He made an off-season transfer to Betterton's company in the summer of 1696 and wrote part of a play for the rebels before being re-seduced by Rich by means of a fat contract (Milhous). Cibber as Lord Foppington was thus also assured, and finally the première of The Relapse could be scheduled with some confidence. Cibber's performance in it was received with even greater acclaim than in his own play, Vanbrugh's Lord Foppington being a larger and, in the estimation of both contemporaries and modern critics, much funnier part than Sir Novelty Fashion. Vanbrugh's play incorporates some of the ad-libbing and affectations of Cibber's by all accounts inspired performance in Love's Last Shift. Cibber has thus imprinted not only his own playwriting but also his acting style and squeaky personality on Vanbrugh's best-known character.|$|E

5|$|John Komnenos <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> {{unimportant}} {{figure in}} the court, and in a marginal note dating to the late 13th century, Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos, who briefly became emperor during Constantinople's final siege by the Fourth Crusade, was named as the real mastermind behind the coup. He was certainly supported by a wider circle of nobles from the Komnenian era, possibly even the brothers Alexios Komnenos and David Komnenos, who later founded the Empire of Trebizond. Thus the historian Michael Angold traces the coup's inception {{to the events of}} early 1199, when Alexios III married his two daughters Irene and Anna to Alexios Palaiologos and Theodore Laskaris respectively. This marriage not only spoke of increasing confidence for the Emperor, but also provided for the imperial succession and began the establishment of a separate aristocratic power-base, which must have displeased many noble families.|$|E
5|$|Vilhelm Moberg, in {{his history}} of the Swedish people, {{provides}} a thoughtful discussion of the atrocities which were committed by {{both sides in the}} struggle over the border provinces, and identified them as the source of propaganda to inflame the peoples' passions to continue the struggle. These lopsided representations were incorporated into history text books on the respective sides. As an example, Moberg compares the history texts he grew up with in Sweden which represented the Swedish soldier as ever pure and honorable to a letter written by Gustavus Adolphus celebrating the 24Scanian parishes he had helped level by fire, with the troops encouraged to rape and murder the population at will, behavior that may well have been mirrored equally on the Danish side. Skåneland <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> unpleasant place to dwell for an extended period.|$|E

25|$|The A.F.B.1 was a biplane with un-staggered, equal-span wings. They had no {{dihedral}} {{but were}} slightly swept. The tailplane was rather large, and triangular in shape – the rudder {{on the other}} hand <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> small balanced affair, with no vertical fin.|$|E

25|$|In league play, {{the month}} of July <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> {{frustrating}} patch, as D.C. United lost two games by a combined score of 5–0, losing by four to Houston Dynamo and one against Columbus Crew, both matches being on the road. The lopsided result against Houston was {{largely due to the}} ejection of starting goalkeeper, Bill Hamid, 20 minutes in, when United and the Dynamo were drawn at zero.|$|E
25|$|Although the orthography {{was changed}} by the reform, it is hardly a simplification. In fact, some other nations of the Soviet Union changed their scripts from Arabic (Central Asian nations) and Latin (Moldova) to Cyrillic. However, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> {{progressive}} step {{in the spirit of}} the historical developments in that it did not hinder the ability of all of the former Soviet nations to develop literature, education, research and science.|$|E

25|$|The {{culture that}} created the most {{commonly}} used version of this pattern was that of Cuba. The circumstances that created that music and culture were very similar to those that created jazz; French, African, Spanish, and native Cuban cultures were all combined in Cuba and created many popular musical forms as well as the clave, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> early invention. The music also affected the development of a variant of jazz, known as Latin jazz.|$|E
25|$|The wheeled {{undercarriage}} was {{a simple}} single-axle arrangement, with oleo legs forward to the engine bulkhead and rearward bracing struts {{to the root of}} the rear wing spar. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> long tailskid to protect the downward-extended fin. The seaplane version used a pair of floats, their low drag profile refined via Schneider Trophy experience, cross braced with a pair of horizontal transverse struts. They were mounted with N-shaped struts which sloped strongly outwards from the fuselage.|$|E

The next day de Gaulle tried again with the same result. But by now even complete success couldn't have saved the forces in the north.|$|E

On one road trip, Turner and a teammate got into a scuffle after that player knocked Turner's tray in a fast-food joint. The coach told Turner to cool it but once they got back on campus, Turner exacted retribution. The next day when the coach saw that teammate sporting a black eye, he summoned Turner to his office and kicked him off the team.|$|E
25|$|The TDC <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> bulky {{addition}} to the sub's conning tower and required two extra crewmen: one as an expert in its maintenance, the other as its actual operator. Despite these drawbacks, {{the use of the}} TDC was an important factor in the successful commerce raiding program conducted by American submarines during the Pacific campaign of World War II. Accounts of the American submarine campaign in the Pacific often cite the use of TDC. Some officers became highly skilled in its use, and the navy set up a training school for its use.|$|E

The show <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> daring departure from the ABC's otherwise rather staid entertainment programming, as its charter obliged it to cater to a mainstream audience and its radio and TV outlets had until then, featured little of the new rock'n'roll craze.|$|E
