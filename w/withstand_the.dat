5|$|Full-scale armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with armour protection identical to that used by the s then under construction.

5|$|Indriids {{such as the}} sifakas {{use their}} toothcombs to gouge bark or dead wood (bark-prising), which is done prior to scent-marking with the gland on their chest.

5|$|On 23 May 1948, the Indian Army {{captured}} Tithwal from Pakistani troops, but the Pakistanis quickly {{launched a}} counter-attack {{to recapture the}} area.

5|$|Approximately 1000 {{passengers}} {{were trapped in}} darkness for several hours inside two Eurostar trains {{on the night of}} 19/20 February 1996. The trains stopped inside the tunnels due to electronic failures caused by snow and ice. Questions were raised at the time about the ability of the train and tunnel electronics to <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> mix of snow, salt and ice which collect in the tunnels during periods of extreme cold.|$|E
5|$|Days {{after the}} first filling of the reservoir, around 80 {{hairline}} cracks were observed in the dam's structure. The submerged spillway gates of the dam might pose a risk of cavitation, similar to that which severely damaged the poorly designed and cavitating spillways of the Glen Canyon Dam in the US state of Arizona, which was unable to properly <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> Colorado river floods of 1983. However 163,000 concrete units of the Three Gorges dam all passed quality testing and the deformation was within design limits. An experts group gave the project overall a good quality rating.|$|E

5|$|During the {{modernization}} in the 1980s, three important weapons {{were added to}} the Iowa-class battleships. The first was the CIWS anti-aircraft/anti-missile system discussed above. The other two were missiles for use against both land and sea targets. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> over-pressure effects when the main battery was fired.|$|E
5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the battle until several months later, almost all Allied {{supplies}} and reinforcements sent to Guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys, mainly during daylight hours, while Allied aircraft from the New Hebrides and Henderson Field and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions. During this time, Allied forces on Guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and provisions to <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> several Japanese drives to retake the islands.|$|E

Plymouth Sound, Shores and Cliffs is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, because of its geology.

5|$|In 1984, the Somali studies scholar Charles Geshekter {{produced}} The Parching Winds of Somalia. Shot {{on location}} in Somalia, the film examines how the country's nomadic inhabitants managed to <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> ravages of a harsh desert environment and the encroachment of imperial forces by synthesizing knowledge of the past, Muslim practices, and skillful livestock management in a successful fusion of traditional values with modern techniques.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Newfoundland pony {{was used}} for ploughing, {{assisting}} with gardens, hauling kelp from the beaches, gathering hay, and carrying wood, and they were also used for transportation. They were successfully used and bred to <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> hard climate, and by 1935 there were over 9,000 ponies on the island. During the mid-20th century, however, increasing mechanization and a ban on free-roaming ponies contributed {{to a decline in}} the population, and increased exports to France for horse meat in the 1970s almost led to the extinction of the breed.|$|E

5|$|Opisthocoelicaudia {{may have}} been able to rear up on its hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several {{skeletal}} features that might have been related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum, the flaring ilia, and the fused pubic symphysis, may have allowed the pelvis to <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> stress of rearing.|$|E
5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> flooding {{of a single}} forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the typhoon's {{arrival in}} China, {{officials}} evacuated 467,900people, {{many of them}} to government shelters across the region. It was estimated that about 30% of coastal houses were too weak to <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> winds from the typhoon. In addition, officials ordered the closure of all restaurants and entertainment venues. Ferry service near Shanghai was disrupted, and 9,900ships were moved to safer areas. In addition, several airports across the region were closed, including in Shanghai.|$|E
