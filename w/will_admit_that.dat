5|$|Mr. Burns is {{at first}} shocked, but after {{acknowledging}} the resemblance admits that Larry {{was the product}} of a one-night stand with the daughter of a former flame at a college reunion. At first, Mr. Burns is overjoyed to have a son and tries to shape Larry after himself. Burns takes Larry to fancy parties and tries to have him enrolled in Yale, but Larry keeps acting like an oaf and proves to be an embarrassment. Larry is put to work in Sector 7G at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant alongside Homer and the two become friends. Larry invites Homer to dinner, and at dinner, Mr. Burns becomes frustrated due to Larry's boorishness and tells him that he wishes he had no son. Homer tries to convince Larry to fake a kidnapping so that Burns <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> he loves his son, and although Larry at first opposes the idea, he eventually agrees to do it and moves into the Simpsons' basement. Homer calls Mr. Burns and says that he can have Larry back if he admits that he loves him. Marge discovers the plan and convinces Homer and Larry to abandon their plot, but as they leave the house, they are spotted.|$|E

500|$|Journalists {{reviewing}} the match praised Arsenal’s young team; some however {{went as far}} to criticise their conduct in the brawl. Henry Winter wrote in The Daily Telegraph of 26 February 2007 [...] "…all feline grace and youthful ambition, [...] were the better team, moving the ball around exquisitely at times," [...] while Glenn Moore of The Independent reflected [...] "the Arsenal manager can take great consolation from {{the quality of his}} young footballers." [...] The Guardian correspondent Kevin McCarra opened his match report with the line [...] "To Chelsea the trophy, to Arsenal the future," [...] and felt the latter club deserved plaudits for the role they played in the final, and competition as a whole. He commended Chelsea’s adversity and singled out Carvalho as an example; at fault for Arsenal’s goal, the defender’s performance thereafter was faultless. Matt Dickinson of The Times agreed that Arsenal had played the better football, but said their temperament was [...] "brittle" [...] – [...] " [...] had lost the trophy before they lost their heads." [...] Football pundit Alan Hansen was scathing of Arsenal’s behaviour and suggested their inexperience had a part to play: “When they reflect upon it, Arsenal <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> they were largely in the wrong." [...] He was critical of Wenger’s team selection and felt the big clubs saw the competition, much like the FA Cup as an irrelevance. The violence and sendings off on the pitch led to some media outlets dubbing the match as the [...] "Snarling Cup Final", {{or in the case of}} Winter's match report the [...] "Carnage Cup final".|$|E

Upon the death of Milton Friedman, Summers wrote an Op-Ed in The New York Times entitled [...] "The Great Liberator" [...] arguing that [...] "any honest Democrat <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> we are now all Friedmanites." [...] In it Summers wrote that even though Friedman's contributions to monetary policy had been highly lauded, his most important contribution may have been [...] "in convincing people {{of the importance of}} allowing free markets to operate." ...|$|E

Etim in an interview with Leadership Newspaper stated: [...] "I am not exactly a rookie {{when it comes to the}} Igbo Language but until Phone Swap, I never needed to speak Igbo as a native would.

2500|$|In July 2004, {{the band}} {{released}} their second album, Porcelain. Despite popular belief, {{none of the}} tracks are fueled {{by the loss of}} Jeremy Ward. Tracks such as [...] "Death in the Family" [...] and [...] "Travel by Bloodline" [...] stem from other personal losses, such as Jim Ward's grandfather and a close friend. In a 2004 issue of the magazine Alternative Press, Ward describes his feelings towards these events, and how they have affected him. [...] "...he <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> he hasn't yet made sense of it, and, perhaps for that reason, there isn't a song on Porcelain about Jeremy. I don't think I'll ever make peace with that," [...] he says. Immediately prior to the release, Sparta toured as the opening act for Incubus, after which followed their own headlining tour.|$|E

2500|$|Stewart {{also had}} a family life. He was married to Mina Stephan and had one son and eight daughters. During Stewart's later life he made many trips between Africa and Europe. He {{traveled}} to Lovedale in 1899, then came back to Scotland in 1900. He again visited Lovedale in 1901, and returned to Edinburgh in 1902. He then visited America in 1903, and went from there to Lovedale in 1904, then went to Cape Town in 1905. Looking back on his experience in Africa, Dr. Stewart realized that [...] "but of all that the African continent contains which the civilized nations prize and want, it still remains true that the most valuable asset in Africa is the African himself. We cannot do without him, and, if he is wise, he <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> he cannot do without us." [...] Stewart learned to respect the African's and realized that the natives had as much to offer {{to him as he}} has to them. Stewart died on December 21, 1905, in Lovedale.|$|E
