25|$|From the outset, The X Factor has {{attracted}} heavy criticism. Recurring allegations include: that the excessive commercialism {{of the show}} detracts from its supposed purpose of unearthing musical talent and even actively damages and distorts the UK music industry; that auditionees at mass auditions are shabbily treated; that controversy is deliberately courted and orchestrated, and supposedly spontaneous scenes are staged and scripted; that problems <b>with</b> <b>phone</b> lines leave {{members of the public}} unable to vote for their favourite acts; and that contestants are manipulated and unfairly edited.|$|E

Despite ICSTIS ruling that Big Brother breached its guidelines and misled phone voters, Channel 4 was not made to refund viewers and was instead fined and forced to pay almost £50,000 in administrative costs.|$|E

In particular, the fifth President, Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, faced a contentious dispute with the government in 1976 over the signing of a bill declaring a state of emergency, which ended in Ó Dálaigh's resignation. His successor, Patrick Hillery, was also involved in a controversy in 1982, when then Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald requested a dissolution of the Dáil Éireann. Hillery was bombarded <b>with</b> <b>phone</b> calls from opposition members urging him to refuse the request, an action that Hillery saw as highly inappropriate interference with the President's constitutional role and resisted the political pressure.|$|E

500|$|Relations {{between the}} Olympians and the Australian Government {{remained}} tense {{after months of}} political struggle regarding the boycott. A prime minister would customarily send a congratulatory message to Olympic medallists. However, the Australian Olympic chef de mission Phil Coles confirmed at the following day's press conference that the quartet had not received a message from Malcolm Fraser. Australian journalists soon bombarded Fraser's office <b>with</b> <b>phone</b> calls asking why he had not applauded the athletes. Various members of the government recommended that Fraser congratulate the swimmers, but the prime minister baulked. When questioned in a radio interview, he said [...] "I hope that circumstances do not arise {{over the next few}} years which will cause them to have very great regrets about the fact that they've gone". Fraser relented and late in the night, his office sent a telegram. However, he would not send his message directly to the Olympic village, so the telegram was sent to the Australian Embassy in Moscow. Fraser had ordered the Australian diplomatic mission to close its doors to the Olympians, so the embassy staff had to pass the envelopes containing the message through the fence to Australian Olympic officials.

500|$|... "Fire Water Burn" [...] {{played a}} major role in the slow build of {{interest}} that ultimately led to the band's mainstream breakthrough. Because the band could not afford financially solvent national tours, they promoted themselves by sending their music to alternative rock-based radio stations across the country. Eventually, an intern brought the band to the attention of the music director of 107.7 The End in Seattle. The director, liking what he heard, played [...] "Fire Water Burn" [...] on his Friday night show. After airing, the station was flooded <b>with</b> <b>phone</b> calls asking about the song and the band and the director passed the song onto the music director at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. This snowball effect eventually overwhelmed the band with demands for their new record. After hearing of the underground success One Fierce Beer Coaster was receiving, many record labels began courting the band. According to manager Brett Alperowitz in an interview with HitQuarters, Madonna's label Maverick [...] "really wanted to sign the band in the worst possible way, even to the point where I had to tell Madonna that I couldn’t put her on the phone with Jimmy Pop." [...] The band eventually signed a record deal with Geffen Records.|$|E
500|$|According to The Plain Dealers Rodney Ferguson, {{the timber}} {{industry}} was insulted by the scene in which a timber industry lobbyist offers a bribe to the corrupt congressman {{so that he can}} demolish Springfield Forest.

[...] Karen Clark, a payroll clerk for a timber company in Stayton, Oregon, said: [...] "The Simpsons portrayed us as greedy, bribery-type people. It didn't portray us as the everyday people—mothers, fathers, good members of society—that we are." [...] Luke Popovich, vice president of the American Forest Council, {{wrote a letter to the}} show's producer to protest [...] "the fuzzy-headed characterizations that pass for political correctness, the thinking in Hollywood where people are not very serious about these issues, but interested in pushing the right hot buttons, scoring the right points with audiences." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the Australians' {{domination}} of the local teams, the English public showed unprecedented levels {{of interest in the}} cricket. Record gate takings were registered at most venues, even when rain affected the [...] matches, and the record attendance for a Test match in England was broken twice, in the Second Test at Lord's and the Fourth Test at Headingley. The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil. As a result, Australia made £82,671 from the tour, resulting in a profit of £54,172. The popularity of the team meant that they were inundated with invitations for social appointments with government officials and members of the royal family, and they had to juggle a plethora of off-field engagements, with 103 days of scheduled cricket in the space of 144 days. As a result, Johnson was flooded <b>with</b> <b>phone</b> calls and letters, which he had to attend to by himself, as he was the only administrator among the touring party. Bradman later said he was worried that Johnson's tireless work would cause health problems because he [...] "worked like a slave day and night" [...] and that [...] "it was the tribute to a bulldog determination to see the job through".
