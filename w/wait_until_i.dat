500|$|Though DeLonge would joke {{around at}} shows, {{as he would}} with Blink-182, the mood was much different. [...] "With Blink, I cant <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> get done playing a song so I can say {{something}} stupid. With this band I hardly talk at all," [...] he told Las Vegas Weekly. He expounded upon this in another interview: [...] "It's a much more powerful, emotional experience than it is with Blink. To play songs and have them showcased to where it represents what this kind of music is all about is a welcome experience. It's not about anything but the music itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Gunn had a [...] "fantastic {{rapport with}} the Norwich supporters". As a player, he liked [...] "to tease the crowd during the game". Before each half of a match, Gunn would run toward his goal and pretend to attempt to headbutt the crossbar. Gunn {{says this is a}} habit he began as a youngster, and cannot {{remember}} how or why he began to do it. Norwich fans noticed it soon after his arrival at the club and, in Gunn's words, [...] "would <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> got to about the 18-yard line and then start a small [...] "Wooo..." [...] which would build into a full-blown [...] "WOOOO ... AH!" ... I loved it and came close to smacking my head against the woodwork a couple of times". [...] During play, he would cup his ear, which would prompt shouts of [...] "Bryan, Bryan, give us a wave".|$|E
500|$|As October {{passed without}} major headway, Rudd grew anxious {{to return to}} the Witswatersrand gold mines, but Rhodes insisted that he could not leave Bulawayo without the concession. [...] "You must not leave a vacuum," [...] Rhodes instructed. [...] "Leave Thompson and Maguire if {{necessary}} or <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> can join... if we get anything we must always have someone resident". Thus prevented from leaving, Rudd vigorously tried to persuade Lobengula to enter direct negotiations with him over a concession, but was repeatedly rebuffed. The king only agreed to look at the draft document, mostly written by Rudd, just before Shippard was due to leave in late October. At this meeting, Lobengula discussed the terms with Rudd for over an hour. Charles Helm, a missionary based in the vicinity, was summoned by the king to act as an interpreter. According to Helm, Rudd made a number of oral promises to Lobengula that were not in the written document, including [...] "that they would not bring more than 10 white men to work in his country, that they would not dig anywhere near towns, etc., and that they and their people would abide by the laws of his country and in fact be his people." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So {{you knew}} what {{threatened}} us?" [...] Osborn remarked, rather sharply. [...] "If so, it's curious you <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> sent for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|My master <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had in {{a measure}} {{recovered}} myself. [...] "Feel if his heart beats," [...] he said, pointing to {{the man on the}} ground.|$|R
2500|$|... "Wonderwall" [...] was {{featured}} in the popular mashup [...] "Boulevard of Broken Songs" [...] mixed by Party Ben in late 2004, which also contained parts of both Travis's [...] "Writing to Reach You" [...] and Green Day's [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams". In late 2006, Gallagher accused Green Day of 'ripping off' [...] "Wonderwall", saying [...] "If you listen, you'll find it {{is exactly the same}} arrangement as [...] "Wonderwall". They should have the decency to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> am dead [...] I, at least, pay the people I steal from that courtesy".|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> gave the word; then we would fire simultaneously, he at the heart and I at the spine.|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{all ready}} for Codfish," [...] {{announced}} Randy, somewhat excitedly. [...] "Just <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> {{go down to}} the gym and tip Walt Baxter off." ...|$|E
5000|$|Clare Finzi, Hilary du Pré's daughter, {{charged that}} the film was a [...] "gross misinterpretation, which I cannot let go unchallenged." [...] Daniel Barenboim said, [...] "Couldn't they have <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> was dead?" ...|$|R
60|$|At this question, {{or series}} of questions, {{the young girl}} turned quite round, and, <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> was even with her, she {{continued}} her walk at my side, although still holding her companion's hand.|$|R
6000|$|Steel's {{face grew}} somber, but he <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> added: [...] "Then, because they're not my beasts as yet, {{if he can}} take them by main force--and I almost hope he'll try--he is welcome to do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As soon as possible," [...] said Miss Ponsonby. [...] "Stephen {{was going}} away next week, {{but he says}} he will <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> can get ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got all {{the food}} I'm going to take," [...] Jimmy rejoined. [...] "I can load up at Kelshope, but you must <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> get back." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{spoke in}} a voice in which Lane's ears {{detected}} insincerity. [...] "Be seated, and <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> get my book," [...] he continued, and left the room.|$|E
6000|$|... “One {{has to take}} a risk, and if I’d <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had Aynsley {{alone and}} then made him tell me what he knew, it might have looked significant. In a general way, the thing you’re willing to talk over in public isn’t of much account.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> saw {{him under}} {{the lights of the}} Grand Walk, and fairly running. Then I swung on my heel. I was of two minds whether to wait for Comyn, by far the wiser course. The unthinking {{recklessness}} I had inherited drove me on.|$|R
5000|$|... "And I don't know {{if anybody}} {{explained}} to her we've got to spend {{three nights a week}} in Columbus. So, how does that work out for you? <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> was 48 and my kids were raised, and at least adults, before we took the opportunity to try." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't be left out," [...] Walthew {{answered}} with a gleam in his eyes. [...] "But I'll <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> feel better. I may see my way then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> see {{you go on}} board," [...] {{the guard}} said {{when they reached the}} beach. [...] "You will be called upon some time to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Wyllard, [...] "I {{will come}} with you. I have left two comrades a little further down the ravine. Will you <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> bring them?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The Kilburns {{made two}} albums, {{but they were}} both the same. The second one was to try and stop the first one coming out! In fact, it didn't prevent them, because Warner Bros. Records <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had some success, and then they put out that album called Wotta Bunch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me look," [...] I said, and I {{looked for}} a long while and saw nothing except the five bits of glass. So I told Jan {{outright}} that he was a fool whom any conjurer could play with, but he <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had done and then asked Sihamba what the vision meant.|$|R
2500|$|... "When I {{go across}} the creek, {{it will be because}} I can't help myself or can't work any longer." [...] Shortly before his death, he said, [...] "I <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> was too old {{to decide what to do}} with my own {{personal}} assets and have decided that I worked most of my business life managing the duPont estate." ...|$|R
6000|$|LIEUTENANT (drawing himself upright). I say it again, just <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> catch him. Just wait: that's all. (He folds {{his arms}} resolutely, and {{breathes}} hard, with compressed lips.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, aye," [...] said Hardy, with {{careless}} contempt; [...] "I'll {{tell him}} {{to keep out of}} your way. But I should advise you to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> have sailed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Margery, {{accepting}} {{his suggestion}} and seating herself. [...] "Now just <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> get the oars into the rowlocks, {{and then you}} can push me off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Nettie Harding reflectively, “he can. Still, he’s sensible, and doesn’t say too much. I’m rather fond {{of those}} quiet men. There was another point that pleased me. He didn’t hang {{about where he}} would be sure to meet me, and then appear {{astonished}} when what he expected happened, as some men would have done, but <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> walked up to him.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure, your honour, I {{went to the}} praste, and by {{good luck}} his house {{is in front of}} the church. I went into the church, and I crossed myself before the altar and said a prayer or two. As I did so who should come out of the vestry but the father himself. He <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had done and then came up to me, and to my {{surprise}} said in good Irish: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you?" [...] {{she asked}} once more. [...] "Can you dive {{when they come}} too close? Otherwise you could not escape if you <b>waited</b> here <b>until</b> <b>I</b> reached the bottom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{all that}} you must anchor the ketch behind the banks and <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> {{come back from the}} desert," [...] said Kit, and stated why he meant to {{undertake}} the journey.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} {{begun to think}} so yet," [...] Gerald laughed happily. [...] "At any rate I shall <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> get you home before such ideas begin to occur to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just you <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> {{call the}} porter," [...] said Roger, {{and touched the}} push-button. [...] "This gentleman will have his berth made up," [...] he went on, as the porter appeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be dark soon," [...] said Tip, {{observing that}} the sun was low on the horizon. [...] "Perhaps we should have <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> morning. <b>I</b> wonder if the Gump can fly in the night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There won't be any {{difficulty}} about that. You are {{to go to}} pier 466 North River, and <b>wait</b> there <b>until</b> <b>I</b> come. Don't stop on the way, for I shall probably ride down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Might {{it not be}} best, my Prince, that we <b>wait</b> here <b>until</b> <b>I</b> prove {{myself and}} make my rights secure to my domains? I should be {{so much the better}} able then to--" ...|$|R
