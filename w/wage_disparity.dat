The primary cause for the gap between productivity and income growth is the decline in per capita hours worked.

2500|$|The USSR {{underwent}} a massive economic transformation. New mines were opened, new cities like Magnitogorsk constructed, {{and work on}} the White Sea-Baltic Canal begun. Millions of peasants moved to the cities and became proletariat, although urban house building could not keep up with the demand. Large debts were accrued while purchasing foreign-made machinery. Many of the major construction projects, including the White Sea-Baltic Canal and the Moscow Metro, were constructed largely through forced labour. The last elements of workers' control over industry were removed, with factory managers increasing their authority and receiving privileges and perks; Stalin defended <b>wage</b> <b>disparity</b> by pointing to Marx's argument that it was necessary during the lower stages of socialism. To promote the intensification of labour, a series of medals and awards as well as the Stakhanovite movement were introduced. Stalin's message was that socialism was being established in the USSR while capitalism was crumbling amid the Wall Street crash. His speeches and articles reflected his utopian vision of the Soviet Union rising to unparalleled heights of human development, creating a [...] "new Soviet person".|$|E

This article {{analyses}} the causalities between external liberalisation {{and the increase}} of <b>wage</b> <b>disparities</b> in Latin America during the 1990 s. The direct effects of the international insertion of these countries on relative wage variations exist, but the main force results from the indirect effects of external liberalisation.

The dynamics of relative wages therefore simultaneously expresses the improvements in productive efficiency and cost-effects. Deffarges Thierry.
