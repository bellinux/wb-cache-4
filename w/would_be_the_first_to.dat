5|$|During the North Sea {{flood of}} 1953, Jaywick was flooded, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 35 people. Since then, sea defences have been put in place and many precautions have been made to avoid flooding. Coastal Jaywick has benefited from 30,000 cubic metres of dredged sand as part of a £9.4million upgrade. The residential areas are categorised as having the highest risk of flooding in the country, and a council report anticipated that global warming would increase the risk to human life in Jaywick from flooding over the next 50 to 75 years. The area <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be hit by floods {{in the event of a}} tidal surge over the marshes surrounding St Osyth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Christensen got {{in contact with}} Valgard Murray and Elton Hall, Heathens {{operating}} a kindred in Arizona, and in 1976 their group <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be certified by the Odinist Fellowship. During the early 1980s she established a prison-outreach program {{in the hope of}} attracting incarcerated individuals to Odinism, in doing so getting Odinism legal recognition as a religion from the state of Florida. In the prisons, the Odinist Fellowship organised four seasonal festivals a year that were marked with sumbel as well as commemorating Hitler's birthday.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 game <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> award the Crab Bowl Trophy to the winner. 69,348 fans {{turned out}} to see the game at M Bank Stadium in Baltimore, which was {{considered}} a home game for Maryland. Navy dominated the game statistically, controlling the ball for nearly 40 minutes and gaining 485 yards. The Midshipmen also converted 10 of 18 third-down chances. But their errors and failure to convert near the goal line cost them dearly. Navy kicker Joe Buckley missed a 32-yard field goal attempt, quarterback Ricky Dobbs lost a fumble at the Maryland 1-yard line, and Maryland eventually walked away with a 17–14 victory.|$|E

5|$|The county {{magistrate}} and commandery administrator {{were the}} official court judges {{of the county}} and commandery, respectively. Their jurisdictions overlapped, yet the commandery administrator only interfered in county court cases when necessary; it was generally agreed that whoever arrested a criminal first <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> judge him or her. If a commandery-level court case could not be resolved, the central government's Commandant of Justice was the final authority of appeal before the emperor. Yet he most often dealt with cases of political rebels and regicide in regards to kings, marquesses, and high officials. Above the Commandant was the emperor, the supreme judge and lawgiver.|$|E
5|$|Hellblazer {{was first}} {{published}} during {{the early days of}} the Modern Age of Comics, and so its themes were as dark, edgy, politically and morally complex as its contemporaries. The comic mixed supernatural and real life horror, akin to contemporary gothic, with noire, surrealism and occult detective fiction elements. Unlike other comic books, it is also unique as it follows real time in its span of 20 years, with its protagonist John Constantine aging in every publication. Because of this, writers of the series often places their era's culture and social commentary in their run. When Jamie Delano first wrote the series in the late 1980s and early 1990s, his issues were heavily inspired by the era such as punk rock and the British economy. Delano <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> put his political views in the series, an element never before seen in mainstream comics, such as his negative views of Thatcher's regime and by 2005 includes the War on Terror. This made John Constantine different from other comic book characters at that time, in that he fights the political and social injustice of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} the plan was the Constitutional Agreement on Krajina (Part One). Part One defined Krajina as an {{autonomous}} region of Croatia, with borders {{based on the results}} of the 1991 Croatian census (which identified eleven municipalities with an absolute Serb majority). Those areas would enjoy a high level of autonomy, with most authority transferred from the central government in Zagreb to Krajina. The region would have its own president, cabinet, legislation, courts, police force, emblem, flag and currency, and the right to levy taxes and make international agreements. Part One also provided for demilitarising the autonomous area. Part Two of the plan, the Agreements Concerning Slavonia, Southern Baranja, Western Sirmium and Other Areas, related to areas where the Croatian Serbs did not form the majority in 1991 (including eastern and western Slavonia) and contained transitional provisions. Part Three of the plan spelled out safeguards on human rights, fundamental freedoms, prosecution of war crimes, a human-rights court with international judges, and provisions allowing dual Croatian and Yugoslav citizenship for Croatian Serbs. The plan envisaged that western Slavonia <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be restored to Croatian control, followed by eastern Slavonia (where a transitional UN administration would be set up before the handover).|$|E

5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped {{off the top of the}} upright piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E
25|$|Other regular {{targets of}} the {{magazine}} included David Lloyd George, Alfred Viscount Northcliffe, H.G. Wells, Frank Harris, and Sinn Féin.

25|$|A promise {{had been}} made to Carlton Urban District Council that the Carlton tramway service <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be {{converted}} to trolleybus operation. It was intended to connect this service with the Wollaton Park section by introducing trolleybuses in place of motorbuses via Ilkeston Road, continuing round Middleton Boulevard to Derby Road and returning via the Derby Road tram route to the city.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010 Nokia {{introduced}} its next flagship mobile device, the Nokia N8, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> run on Symbian^3. However it was delayed {{for many months}} which tarnished the company's image, especially after the failure of its previous flagship N97 and tougher competition from Apple and the rising Google. On 10 September 2010, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was fired as CEO and {{it was announced that}} Stephen Elop from Microsoft would take Nokia's CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia's history.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s civil rights bills were being {{introduced}} in Congress. To overcome the Southern Democrats’ {{suppression of the}} pro-Republican African-American vote, then-Republican Hawaii’s prospects for statehood were tied to Alaska’s, which many thought would be more Democratic. Hawaii statehood was expected to result in the addition of two pro-civil-rights senators from a state which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> have majority non-white population. This would endanger the Southern minority segregationist Democrat Senate by providing two more pro-civil rights votes to invoke cloture and halt a Senate filibuster.|$|E

25|$|In {{twenty years}} Hayes lost the {{district}} only once, when a Republican {{was elected to}} the Assembly. In 1910, Henry H. Lazarus made an unsuccessful contest, supported by the upcoming Italian-American lawyer Salvatore A. Cotillo. After the defeat, Cotillo, supported by the increasing ethnic Italian-American vote, made a deal with Hayes that gave Little Italy a political foothold in the city. Due to the new alliance the district <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> send an Italian-American to the Assembly – Cotillo – and would produce the first Italian Magistrate and Judge – Francis X. Mancuso.|$|E
25|$|After the Brooklyn Bridge was {{completed}} on May 31, 1883, there was speculation about who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> successfully leap from it. In May 1886, swimming instructor Robert Emmet Odlum {{died in an}} attempt to prove the harmlessness of falling long distances through the air. A month later, Steve Brodie was said to have successfully dropped {{from the bottom of the}} bridge and survived with injuries, but doubts about whether he actually made the jump surfaced years later and the matter remains unsettled.|$|E
25|$|All adult Octopus Card holders <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> {{benefit from}} the merger.

Student Octopus holders would continue to pay the current reduced concessionary fares on the MTR network. Elderly Octopus holders would be introduced to a new fare system which only the elderly can enjoy a $2 fare to anywhere on the MTR network (excluding Airport Express, Light Rail, and Cross-Boundary Stations).|$|E
2500|$|The initial letter {{identifies}} the printing facility.

25|$|Without Ismail, {{the country}} was {{momentarily}} leaderless, without an acting Prime Minister. Tun Razak ordered that he be laid in state at the Malaysian Houses of Parliament, and be buried at the Makam Pahlawan (Heroes' Mausoleum) near Masjid Negara (National Mosque), Kuala Lumpur. Ismail <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be laid to rest there, and also the first recipient of a Malaysian state funeral. However, Works & Communications Minister Tun Sardon Jubir, the next-most senior Cabinet minister, ordered that Ismail lie in state at the Masjid Negara, and that he be buried just outside the Makam Pahlawan instead. As Ismail's body was transported from his home to the National Mosque, crowds thronged the streets.|$|E
25|$|John Allen Paulos, a {{mathematician}} at Temple University, {{coined the term}} 'the Jeane Dixon effect', which references a tendency to promote a few correct predictions while ignoring {{a larger number of}} incorrect predictions. Many of Dixon's predictions proved erroneous, such as her claims that a dispute over the offshore Chinese islands of Quemoy and Matsu would trigger the start of World War III in 1958, that American labor leader Walter Reuther would run for president of the United States in the 1964 presidential election, that the second child of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and his young wife Margaret would be a girl (it was a boy), and that the Soviets <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> put men on the moon.|$|E
