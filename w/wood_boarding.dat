40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{experimental}} setup developed to characterize reactions between ozone and building products and document their potential impact on indoor air quality. Preliminary experiments were conducted on four building products: two carpets, a gypsum board and a pine <b>wood</b> <b>board.</b> These preliminary experiments clearly indicate that ozone is significantly removed in contact with the four selected products. Measured ozone removal were around 65 % for the two carpets, 70 % for the gypsum board and 75 % for the pine <b>wood</b> <b>board.</b> In case of exposure to ozone, emissions of building products were modified and reaction products (mainly carbonyl compounds) have been identified. For instance, when exposed to ozone, the carpet with PVC backing shows higher emissions of formaldehyde, the carpet with textile backing emits nonanal and decanal and the pine <b>wood</b> <b>board</b> exhibits increased emissions of hexanal...|$|R

40|$|Subject of investigation: {{process of}} sawing of <b>wood</b> {{particle}} <b>boards</b> by circular saws. Purpose of the work: substantiation of the rational {{parameters of the}} circular saw teeth and sawing conditions. The theoretical results include the study and determination {{of the influence of}} technological and tool factors on the power, energy and qualitative characteristics of the process of sawing of <b>wood</b> particle <b>boards</b> by circular saws; specification of the peculiar dependences of the characteristics of the sawing conditions on the geometry of the saw teeth; development of a mathematical model for sawing of <b>wood</b> particle <b>boards</b> by the circular saws. The work substantiates the rational parameters of circular saw teeth and the conditions of sawing of <b>wood</b> particle <b>boards</b> which provide for lower power consumption and for a high quality of the sawn surface. The rational parameters are substantiated for the circular saws and for the conditions of sawing of <b>wood</b> particle <b>boards</b> by the circular saws. The use of the improved circular saws and sawing conditions makes it possible to decrease the extent of chipping of the edges of <b>wood</b> particle <b>boards,</b> to reduce power consumption in sawing and to prolong the durability of toolsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

The experimental <b>wood</b> <b>boards</b> with dimensions of 250 mm in width by 500 mm in length by 18 mm in thickness were thermally compressed at a temperature of 120 ˚C or 150 ˚C, press pressure of 5 or 7 MPa for 60 min in a hot press. Results obtained in this study showed that the colour characteristics of the pine <b>wood</b> <b>boards</b> were affected by press pressure and temperature. The resin leakages significantly increased the chromacity (a* - 25. 99 and b* - 43. 18) of the treated wood samples. Thermally compressing caused browning of wood colour, which rate increases with pressure at high temperature conditions. </p...|$|R

40|$|The knot {{area ratio}} (KAR) {{is well known}} to show good {{correlation}} with the strength of <b>wood</b> <b>boards.</b> However up to now no system was able to compute it automatically {{in order to use}} it in an industrial application. This paper introduces a new method which allows matching the knots from the 4 faces of <b>wood</b> <b>boards.</b> This method is based on the detection of knots by an optical scanner. The knots matching computation is validated through a complete study and tested over 451 structural lumbers (Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and Spruce (Picea excelsa)). The correlation between the module of rupture and the KAR is also investigated on these samples, as well as the impact on the settings of grading machine (EN 14081). The study shows that coupling a scanner with a standard MOE measurement can significantly improve the grading results. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
