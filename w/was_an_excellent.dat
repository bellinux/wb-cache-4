5|$|Booth's stage {{performances}} were often characterized by his contemporaries as acrobatic and intensely physical, with him leaping upon {{the stage and}} gesturing with passion. He <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> swordsman, although a fellow actor once recalled that Booth occasionally cut himself with his own sword.|$|E

5|$|A 1997 report {{stated that}} Messers Run {{was a poor}} site for angling {{upstream}} of the Lofty Reservoir. The same report stated that the stream <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> site for angling between the Lofty Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir. Additionally, the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 308 are in the stream's watershed. These state game lands contain 432 hectares of forested land.|$|E
5|$|As a young girl, she <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> student, but {{needed to}} quit {{school at the}} age of 11 to care for her ill grandmother. At 15, she taught school and a year later joined an academy in Providence, Rhode Island, where she earned her way through school by making and selling needlework. She {{graduated}} with highest honors and established a school that she operated for years. Paine gave the profits to her family, and she helped support them throughout most of her life.|$|E
5|$|At age 16, Honório Hermeto was {{commissioned}} as a lieutenant and standard-bearer of the 2nd Militia Cavalry Regiment, 1st Company, in Vila Rica. Antônio Neto made great {{efforts to provide}} Honório Hermeto with an education of much higher quality than would normally have been expected {{in a family of}} their limited financial means. The promotion to captain in 1819 increased Antônio Neto's income, allowing his eldest son to go to Portugal and enroll in the University of Coimbra's law school in 1820, thus ending Honório Hermeto's brief military career. He <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> student and struck up acquaintances among his fellow Brazilians in Coimbra, including Paulino Soares de Sousa (who would become one of his greatest allies and later the 1st Viscount of Uruguai) and Aureliano de Sousa Oliveira Coutinho (later Viscount of Sepetiba).|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Kanō stood 1.57 m (5feet 2inches) but weighed only 41kg (90pounds). He wished he were stronger. One day, Nakai Baisei (a {{friend of the}} family {{who was a member of}} the shogun's guard), {{mentioned}} that jūjutsu <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> form of physical training. He showed Kanō a few techniques by which a smaller man might overcome a larger and stronger opponent. Kanō decided he wanted to learn the art despite Nakai's insistence that such training was out of date and somewhat dangerous. Kanō's father also discouraged him from jūjutsu, telling him to pursue a modern sport instead.|$|E
5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player {{to throw a}} contest, {{there was a very}} good chance he would not be informed upon. Now, there <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> chance he would be turned in. No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E
5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich Carl <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> sea boat; {{the ship}} was {{responsive}} to commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius. She was somewhat unbalanced, however, and a 6degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a straight course. The ship's crew numbered 33 officers and 498 enlisted men, and while serving as a flagship, the crew was augmented with a command staff of 6 officers and 35 enlisted men. Friedrich Carl carried a number of smaller boats, including a large tender, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy.|$|E
5|$|Robert Dudley was counted among Elizabeth's special friends by PhilipII's {{envoy to}} the English court a week before Queen Mary's death. On 18November 1558, the morning after Elizabeth's accession, Dudley {{witnessed}} the surrender of the Great Seal to her at Hatfield. He became Master of the Horse on the same day. This was an important court position entailing close attendance on the sovereign. It suited him, as he <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> horseman and showed great professional interest in royal transport and accommodation, horse breeding, and the supply of horses for all occasions. Dudley was also entrusted with organising and overseeing {{a large part of}} the Queen's coronation festivities.|$|E
5|$|When {{he was a}} boy, {{his family}} moved to Moravia, New York, and in 1851 to Owego, New York, where he {{attended}} Owego Academy. In 1853, {{his family moved to}} Strongsville, Ohio and he attended Cleveland's Central High School, the first high school in Cleveland and the first free, public high school west of the Alleghenies. Then, he took a ten-week business course at Folsom's Commercial College, where he studied bookkeeping. Despite his father's absences and frequent family moves, young John was a well-behaved, serious, and studious boy. His contemporaries described him as reserved, earnest, religious, methodical, and discreet. He <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> debater and expressed himself precisely. He also had a deep love of music and dreamed of it as a possible career.|$|E

5|$|Gerd Heidemann {{was born}} in Hamburg in 1931. During the rise of Hitler his parents {{remained}} apolitical, but Heidemann, like many other young boys, joined the Hitler Youth. After the war he trained as an electrician, and pursued an interest in photography. He began working in a photographic laboratory and became a freelance photographer for the Deutsche Presse-Agentur and Keystone news agencies, {{as well as some}} local Hamburg papers. He had his first work published in Stern in 1951 and four years later joined the paper as a full-time member of staff. From 1961 he covered wars and hostilities across Africa and the Middle East; he became obsessed with these conflicts and other stories on which he worked, such as the search for identity of the German writer B. Traven. Although he <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> researcher—his colleagues called him , the Bloodhound—he would not know when to stop investigating, which led to other writers having to finish off the stories from large quantities of notes.|$|E
5|$|Their {{frustration}} clearly apparent, the Virginia Tech offense fared {{no better}} on their next possession. Two plays were stopped for no gain, {{and the only}} positive play—a five-yard pass to Eddie Royal—was negated by a false start penalty. The Hokies were again forced to punt the ball away to Florida State, their fifth of the game. The punt allowed FSU to start at their own 46-yard line, and at first, the Seminoles were able to capitalize on that opportunity, showing some of the effectiveness that characterized their prior drive. Lorenzo Booker ran for 24yards on two plays, but afterwards, Drew Weatherford threw two incompletions. A false start penalty backed up the Seminoles, who were forced to punt after failing {{to pick up the}} first down. The kick <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> one, and Florida State's special teams were able to get downfield and stop the ball inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line, again hurting the Hokie offense.|$|E
