We examine how perceiving control over setbacks alters neural processing {{in ways that}} increase persistence through adversity. For example, a student might retake a class if initial failure was due to controllable factors (e. g., studying) but give up if failure was uncontrollable (e. g., unfair exam questions). Participants persisted more when they perceived control over setbacks, and when they experienced increased negative affect to setbacks. Consistent with previous observations involving negative outcomes, ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal (VMPFC) activity was decreased in response to setbacks. Critically, these structures represented distinct neural mechanisms for persistence through adversity. Ventral striatum signal change to controllable setbacks correlated <b>with</b> <b>greater</b> <b>persistence,</b> whereas VMPFC signal change to uncontrollable setbacks mediated the relationship between increased negative affect and persistence.

Method: We conducted a retrospective analysis of longitudinally organized, individual-specific anonymous data from linked prescription and health databases covering the population of British Columbia for 1990 through 1996. No prescriptions being filled for 4 months indicated cessation of one bout of therapy. Results: Among 16 945 identified MPH patients aged 19 years or under, overall duration of therapy was 584 days, and {{the average number of}} prescriptions received was 6. 6. One-third of patients received 2 or fewer prescriptions, while 18 % followed a chronic, continuous course. Among patients receiving more than 2 prescriptions, 50 % of discrete therapy bouts lasted 4 months or less, and one-third of cases had multiple bouts of therapy (range 2 to 6 bouts). Younger age (that is, children aged 0 to 8 years, vs those aged 10 to 19 years), male sex, and receipt of initial prescription from a psychiatrist were associated <b>with</b> <b>greater</b> <b>persistence.</b> Conclusions: Enormous variability in persistence with MPH therapy and often-occurring low rates of persistence raises questions about the diligence with which MPH patients are selected, prepared, and followed in the general population.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of medication treatment on Medicaid costs for persons with schizophrenia. MethodsMichigan Medicaid claims from January 1995 through  September 1998 were analyzed for  persons with schizophrenia diagnoses who initiated olanzapine (n = 458), risperidone (n = 481), or haloperidol (n = 252) treatment between January 1996 and September 1997. Total and component Medicaid payments were compared for the year after treatment initiation, with simultaneous adjustment for patient demographics, comorbid conditions, prior medication use, prior service use, and prior year costs. ResultsSignificant baseline differences existed between the groups in prior medication and service use. Adherence to index medication varied between the groups (O = 60 %; R = 54 %; H = 37 %; P < =. 01 for each pairwise comparison). Average postperiod costs were $ 14, 512 per subject. After baseline adjustment, there were no significant differences in mean total cost. Excluding index medication costs, the olanzapine group's average cost was significantly lower than risperidone (–$ 1, 791, P =. 002) and haloperidol (–$ 2, 080, P =. 003), whereas the risperidone and haloperidol groups were not significantly different. The differences were driven by significantly lower cost for inpatient services for other medications among the olanzapine group. ConclusionTotal costs of schizophrenia care associated with olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol were similar, but  component costs differed. Relative to risperidone or haloperidol, olanzapine may have a higher acquisition cost, but may decrease inpatient costs and be associated with more optimal medication use patterns.

The advent of genetic engineering and {{the identification of the}} modes of biocontrol that bacteria possess has allowed the potential modification of successful inocula to improve their efficacy in biocontrol. A plant growth promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW 25 (WT) was modified to contain the phenazine-l-carboxylic acid biosynthesis pathway. The genetically modified biological control agent (GM-BCA) 23. 10 was previously shown to have improved biocontrol activity when compared to WT. The work described in this thesis assessed the natural microbial community structure and function in the rhizosphere of pea, wheat and sugar beet under field conditions and the potential impact of the release of a GM-BCA may have on these communities, using laboratory based mesocosms. In addition to this, an investigation in to the production and conservation of HCN biosynthesis was undertaken on global collection of biocontrol strains to assess the potential of HCN biosynthesis as another trait for genetic modifications. A detailed field study of the indigenous rhizosphere communities was undertaken using culturable microbiological techniques, carbon source utilization and the development of molecular community profiling approaches on bacteria and fungi. A dominating effect of the plant species was shown and specific enrichment was identified on soil communities with significant effect also seen relating to plant growth stage. These data provided a robust baseline data set for comparisons to mesocosm experiments assessing the potential ecological impact that the release of a GM-BCA may have on the environment.

Several {{studies have suggested}} suboptimal persistence and adherence to thiazide diuretic monotherapy; this study compared patient persistence and adherence with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) monotherapy to fixed-dose combinations containing HCTZ. Methods Patients {{with at least one}} prescription claim during 2001 to 2003 for either HCTZ or one of the following fixed-dose combinations: angiotensin-receptor blockers/HCTZ (ARB/HCTZ), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/HCTZ (ACEI/HCTZ), or beta blockers/HCTZ (BB/HCTZ) were identified. Patients were required to be continuously benefit-eligible six months pre- and one year post-index date, and to have no prescription claims for any antihypertensive therapy six months prior to the index date. Patients were followed for one year to assess persistence, medication possession ratio (MPR), adherence (MPR > 80 %), and proportion of days covered (PDC) with initial antihypertensive therapy. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for persistence, adherence and PDC, adjusted for age, gender, business segment, RxRisk disease categories, average co-pay and concurrent cardiovascular-related medication utilization. Results The study cohort consisted of 48, 212 patients; 72. 5 % used HCTZ, 13. 2 % ACEI/HCTZ, 9. 3 % ARB/HCTZ, and 5. 0 % BB/HCTZ. Mean age was 53. 7 years and 66. 5 % were female. A significantly lower proportion of patients using HCTZ (29. 9 %) remained persistent with therapy at 12 months compared with ARB/HCTZ (52. 6 %; OR = 0. 37, CI = 0. 36, 0. 38), ACEI/HCTZ (51. 4 %; OR = 0. 38, CI = 0. 37, 0. 39), and BB/HCTZ (51. 9 %; OR = 0. 38, 0. 37, 0. 40). Similarly, PDC was lower for HCTZ patients (32. 5 %) as compared to ARB/HCTZ (53. 7 %; OR = 0. 39, CI = 0. 37, 0. 40), ACEI/HCTZ (50. 9 %; OR = 0. 42, CI = 0. 40, 0. 43), and BB/HCTZ (51. 3 %; OR = 0. 44, CI 0. 42, 0. 45). MPR was also significantly lower for HCTZ patients as compared to those using fixed-dose combination therapies. Conclusion Initiating HCTZ fixed-dose combination therapy with an ACEI, ARB, or BB was associated <b>with</b> <b>greater</b> <b>persistence</b> and adherence as compared to HCTZ monotherapy.

40|$|Companies {{worldwide}} {{are facing}} a severe competition from {{an increasing number of}} domestic and foreign competitors, who put extra pressure on the achievement of market efficiency and performance. In this context, research and transference of managerial tools aimed at increasing performance has become decisive for organizations. One particular tool, the coaching of the sales force, has been largely praised by practitioners and scholars alike as a central managerial activity increasing employee's performance. As salespeople's performance is a key antecedent of organizational performance, research on sales coaching as a tool for increasing performance is critical. Despite its importance, research on coaching has been scarce and inconsistent, and published work has been predominantly practice-driven and guru-led, lacking solid theoretical basis. Additionally, the relationship between coaching and performance has not received conclusive support, and the mediating variables linking coaching with performance have not been studied; these restrictions limited the explanations and predictive capacity of present models. This research tries to close the gap between what is presently known about coaching and what should be known in the opinion of both practitioners and scholars, by answering two general research questions: 1) does coaching by the sales manager have an impact on salesperson's performance?; and 2) what are the mediating mechanisms that turn coaching by the sales manager into salesperson's performance? This dissertation presents a model based on two institutionalized' theories, Leader-member Exchange (LMX) Theory and Goal-setting Theory; LMX is a dyadic, relational theory, useful to explain the high quality relationship developed between coach and coaché during the coaching intervention, and some of the proximal outcomes of this relationship; goal-setting theory is particularly useful in sales contexts, where salespeople have clearly defined goals, to understand how the coaching intervention can mobilize salesperson's cognition and motivation in order to achieve the goals. The model explores the motivational and cognitive process enacted by the coaching intervention that have an impact on salesperson's performance, and proposes different ways through which coaching could be translated into increased performance; according to the model, the coaching intervention helps the salesperson to develop new task-specific strategies, which increases his capacity of adapting to different selling situations; additionally, the characteristics of the coaching intervention increases his goal commitment and his self-efficacy; in consequence, the salesperson will spend more effort, <b>with</b> <b>greater</b> <b>persistence,</b> and will choose better strategies; as a consequence of increased sales adaptability, new strategies, goal commitment, self-efficacy and effort, salesperson's performance will also increase. The model was tested using data collected early in 2011; a local Latin-American branch of a global industrial company and a Canadian bank accepted to participate in the study, and invitations to take a web-based survey were sent to their sales forces. I received 186 complete, usable responses, for a total response ratio of 40. 43 %, which were used to test the model using Structural Equation Modeling. Results supported the main hypotheses; the conclusion of the dissertation is that the coaching intervention actually enacts motivational and cognitive mechanisms in the salesperson that allows him to increase his performance. These mechanisms are increased effort, adaptive selling, sales planning, new strategies, goal commitment and self-efficacy. The dissertation contributes to the solution of the research problem in several ways. First, it proposes a model of coaching mediators, an issue that has not been addressed by previous research. The model represents an original perspective that advances the field of coaching research by enlarging our understanding of the processes addressed by the coaching intervention. Second, the model proposes two complementary ways for achieving performance; one that considers the motivational aspects of the coaching intervention, where an increased performance is achieved through increased goal commitment and effort; the other one considers the cognitive aspects of the coaching intervention, where an increased performance is achieved through increased adaptive selling and sales planning behavior, and {{the development and implementation of}} new task-related strategies. These two ways are consistent with present research on adaptive selling and sales performance. Third, the model is based on two institutionalized theories: LMX and Goal-setting Theory. The use of these theories is an original approach, useful to understand how coaching work in sales contexts. As the proposed model is not based on any particular practitioner's model or set of experiences, it can potentially be generalized through a large series of organizational settings. Finally, the results of this research contributes: 1) to the advancement of scientific knowledge through the development of an original, theory-based model of coaching mediators, as well as 2) to the solution of a managerial problem by providing practical insights to practitioners willing to implement successful coaching processes in their organizations...|$|E

40|$|The {{persistence}} of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is studied using observations of the three-dimensional vorticity budget in the Atlantic sector. Analysis of the relative vorticity tendency equation shows that con-vergence of eddy vorticity flux in the upper troposphere counteracts the effect of anomalous large-scale divergence at the upper level. At low levels, the convergence associated with this large-scale vertical circula-tion cell maintains the relative vorticity anomaly against frictional drag. The eddy vorticity flux convergence thus acts to sustain the vorticity anomaly associated with the NAO against drag and increases the persis-tence of the NAO vorticity anomaly. The adiabatic cooling associated with the rising motion in the vorticity maximum also sustains the thermal structure of the NAO anomaly. This constitutes a positive eddy feed-back that helps maintain the NAO. The positive eddy feedback occurs only in the mid-latitude region and is strongest when the Atlantic jet is displaced toward the equator, with a high pressure anomaly {{to the north and}} a low pressure anomaly to the south. The stronger feedback demonstrated in the case where the jet is displaced toward the equator is consistent <b>with</b> the <b>greater</b> <b>persistence</b> observed for this phase of the NAO.

Distinct structural features in regions that surround the RGD motifs may differentially regulate how the PDGF receptor-a promotes integrin distribution and actin filament remodeling at the cell’s leading edge. Understanding how fibrillins regulate LF migration may help elucidate how the elastic fiber system could be restored as an interconnected unit, which fails to occur in emphysematous lungs...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} {{was to assess the}} {{efficacy}} and safety of endoscopic coblator adenoidectomy compared to cold curettage in paediatric patients. Forty homogeneous children (4 - 16 years of age) with adenoid hypertrophy were divided in 2 groups to receive adenoidectomy using cold curettage (A) or coblator (B). After surgery the following outcomes were evaluated: pain score on first day, days reporting pain, analgesic days, liquid diet days, absent from school days, pain score, days with nausea, days with fever, endoscopic adenoid grade and intraoperative bleeding. Forty days after surgery, basal rhinomanometry and nasal decongestion test were measured. The coblation group reported significantly less pain on the first post-operative day, days reporting pain, analgesic days, liquid diet days and absent school days. Patients in group A showed a higher grade of adenoid persistence by rhinoendoscopy, with high values of nasal resistances at the rhinomanometry even after nasal decongestion, consistent <b>with</b> <b>greater</b> adenoid <b>persistence</b> after cold curettage causing air flow obstruction even after turbinate decongestion. Intra-operative bleeding during coblation was significantly less compared the group undergoing cold curettage. Coblator treatment significantly improved patient recovery compared to curettage. Endoscopic coblation adenoidectomy ensures complete removal of adenoids and reduces postoperative adenoid grade. It can also be considered safer because it is under endoscopic control and can reach the cranial portion of the adenoid and its intranasal extension...|$|R
40|$|A {{microscopic}} {{theory of}} the free energy barriers and folding routes for minimally frustrated proteins is presented, greatly expanding on {{the presentation of the}} variational approach outlined previously [J. J. Portman, S. Takada, P. G. Wolynes, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 5237 (1998) ]. We choose the λ-repressor protein as an illustrative example and focus on how the polymer chain statistics influence free energy profiles and partially ordered ensembles of structures. In particular, we investigate the role of chain stiffness on the free energy profile and folding routes. We evaluate the applicability of simpler approximations in which the conformations of the protein molecule along the folding route are restricted to have residues that are either entirely folded or unfolded in contiguous stretches. We find that the folding routes obtained from only one contiguous folded region corresponds to a chain <b>with</b> a much <b>greater</b> <b>persistence</b> length than appropriate for natural protein chains, while the folding route obtained from two contiguous folded regions is able to capture the relatively folded regions calculated within the variational approach. The free energy profiles obtained from the contiguous sequence approximations have larger barriers than the more microscopic variational theory which is understood as a consequence of partial ordering.

40|$|Research {{aimed at}} {{explaining}} the <b>greater</b> <b>persistence</b> of unemployment in European countries {{relative to the}} US has found higher employment adjustment costs in Europe {{to be a significant}} contributing factor. This paper explores the potential for costly adjustment of labour to explain {{at least some of the}} persistence in Canadian unemployment rates relative to US rates. In contrast to what one might expect, our results suggest that relative adjustment costs are very similar in both countries, as are the speeds of adjustment of labour demand. These findings suggest that employment adjustment costs are not a leading candidate to account for the <b>greater</b> <b>persistence</b> of unemployment in Canada relative to the US. ...|$|R
