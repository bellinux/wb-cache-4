5|$|Barr {{reflected}} on the campaign {{in an interview with}} Reason shortly after the election. He explained that his campaign's inability to gain access to donor lists hindered the campaign's fundraising capacity. In April 2009, he commented that his exclusion from the presidential debates prevented his campaign from gaining significant traction. Barr has stated that he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>run</b> for public office in the future.|$|E
5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>run</b> to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E

5000|$|Malbolge Unshackled is a {{hopefully}} Turing-complete variation, {{allowing for}} programs of any length. However, due to command variations {{to allow for}} values above 257, valid Malbolge programs <b>will</b> <b>not</b> necessarily <b>run</b> correctly in Malbolge Unshackled.|$|R
50|$|Each Grade is {{targeted}} {{at a specific}} area of potential difficulty a person might have. The working hypothesis {{is that if the}} subject matter is not “charged”; in other words, if it is not causing any difficulty, then it <b>will</b> <b>not</b> read on the E-meter, and therefore <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be <b>run.</b>|$|R
5|$|It is {{no longer}} {{possible}} for active parliamentarians to sit on the committee, except for the last half year of parliamentary representation, if they have stated that they <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>run</b> for re-election. This allowed Jagland and Valle to sit on the committee in 2009, while they were still elected. The appointment is made by parliament after nominations by the parties who are to be represented in the committee. In 2009, the Labour Party had two seats, while the three next-largest parties, the Progress Party, the Conservative Party and the Socialist Left Party, each have one representative. The remaining parties in parliament are not represented.|$|E
5|$|Underwood {{announces that}} he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>run</b> for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which {{he intends to}} pay for by {{stripping}} entitlement programs. He fails to get the bill through Congress and uses that {{as a reason to}} renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather Dunbar (Elizabeth Marvel) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives Underwood a battle. Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping women’s votes from Dunbar, at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins the Iowa caucuses.|$|E
25|$|He {{announced}} on October 16, 2009 that he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>run</b> {{for re-election in}} 2010. When asked if he will run for another office he indicated that he is undecided, though suggested he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>run</b> for Congress. State Senator Juan Hinojosa suggested that Shapleigh might run for governor.|$|E
50|$|A game {{using the}} Simple DirectMedia Layer <b>will</b> <b>not</b> {{automatically}} <b>run</b> on every operating system, further adaptations must be applied. These {{are reduced to}} the minimum, since SDL also contains a few abstraction APIs for frequent functions offered by an operating system.|$|R
50|$|The Vermont gubernatorial {{election}} of 1944 {{took place on}} November 7, 1944. Incumbent Republican William H. <b>Wills</b> did <b>not</b> <b>run</b> for re-election to a third term as Governor of Vermont. Republican candidate Mortimer R.

25|$|In cold weather, {{the outdoor}} unit {{of an air}} source heat pump needs to be {{intermittently}} defrosted. This will cause the auxiliary or emergency heating elements (located in the air-handler) to be activated. At the same time, the frost on the outdoor coil will quickly be melted due to the warm refrigerant. The condenser/evaporator fan <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>run</b> during defrost mode.|$|E
50|$|Begging the court's indulgence, Cardigan {{abruptly}} {{announces that}} his assistants will handle {{the rest of}} the case. He then confesses that he had been sent to reform school—with Powers—for burglary and <b>will</b> therefore <b>not</b> <b>run</b> for governor, returning to his defense attorney status immediately. (Powers had threatened to blackmail him if Cardigan prosecuted him.) Outside, June congratulates him for his courage and for choosing his values over his ambition. They embrace and leave hand in hand.|$|R
40|$|Resource {{constraints}} {{may make}} a biobased economy impossible if {{it is expected to}} continue at the pace and consumption level of the fossil-based economy in industrial and postindustrial societies. While the world economy <b>will</b> <b>not</b> suddenly <b>run</b> out of land to produce food and materials for the biobased economy, progression toward the ultimate limit to growth will be incremental, marked by increased pollution of air and water, declines in productivity of degraded soils, and reduced availability and access to fossil-fuel-derived inputs to production...|$|R

25|$|Speculation about Gabriel's {{future as}} leader of the SPD has been brewing since he {{registered}} just 74 percent in a party delegates' vote of confidence in December 2015 – the lowest for an SPD leader in 20 years.

25|$|Applications {{native to}} both PPC and Intel-based Macs such as Safari web browser {{were found to}} perform better on the Intel-based Mac than on the PPC-based Mac. However, classic Mac OS {{applications}} <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>run</b> directly on Intel Macs. Pre-Mac OS X applications can only be run on Intel Macs by using emulators such as vMac, Basilisk II, and SheepShaver, though the lack of stability of these emulators severely limits their functionality.|$|E
25|$|David Stahl {{served as}} mayor from his {{election}} in 2012 until his resignation on January 14, 2016, {{when he left}} office {{to take on a}} judge position in nearby Woodbridge Township. The Township Council appointed Kevin McEvoy, a former history teacher at East Brunswick High School and trustee of the East Brunswick Public Schools, to serve the balance of Stahl's term as mayor that expires in December 2016; McEvoy has stated that he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>run</b> to serve a full term as mayor.|$|E
50|$|If Windows is {{installed}} on an NTFS volume, by default, the 'Program Files' folder {{can only be}} modified {{by members of the}} 'Administrators' user groups. This can be an issue for programs created for Windows 9x. Those operating systems had no file system security, and programs could therefore also store their data in 'Program Files'. Programs that store their data in 'Program Files' <b>will</b> usually <b>not</b> <b>run</b> correctly on Windows NT systems with normal user privileges unless security is lowered for the affected subdirectories. Windows Vista addressed this issue by introducing File and Registry Virtualization.|$|R
60|$|The {{practical}} question, then, is {{what to do}} {{with the}} children.

25|$|To support 64-bit {{platforms}} such as Intel Xeon, Intel Core 2, AMD Opteron and AMD Athlon 64, Microsoft released 64-bit {{versions of}} every edition of Windows Vista {{except for the}} Starter edition. These editions can run 32-bit programs by running them within the WOW64 subsystem. Most 32-bit programs can run natively, though applications that rely on device drivers <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>run</b> unless those device drivers have been written for 64-bit Windows. Reviewers have reported that the 64-bit editions of Windows Vista outperform their 32-bit counterparts in synthetic benchmarks such as PassMark.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{results were}} {{widely seen as}} a victory for Netanyahu and the more {{moderate}} faction within Likud, {{as opposed to the}} far-right fringe. Moshe Feiglin, who for a long time led his own far-rightist faction within Likud and once challenged Netanyahu for the chairmanship, suffered a major defeat in the primary, failing to win a realistic spot on the ticket. In response, he left Likud and announced plans to form a new party. Feiglin said his new party, which may be called the Jewish State Party, <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>run</b> in the 2015 election but will run in the next election after that.|$|E

5000|$|As a microkernel-based OS, QNX {{is based}} on the idea of running most of the {{operating}} system kernel {{in the form of a}} number of small tasks, known as servers. This differs from the more traditional monolithic kernel, in which the operating system kernel is a single very large program composed of a huge number of [...] "parts" [...] with special abilities. In the case of QNX, the use of a microkernel allows users (developers) to turn off any functionality they do not require without having to change the OS itself; instead, those servers <b>will</b> simply <b>not</b> <b>run.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the less}} formal events, most {{entrants}} are not career racers, nor bred for racing. Often, dogs <b>will</b> choose <b>not</b> to <b>run</b> {{the length of}} the course and instead visit with other dogs or the owner that released them. Otherwise, dogs will run swiftly to their owner at the finish line, coaxed by food or toys.|$|R
50|$|Filming for the cut scenes {{was done}} in California during mid-1995. Erickson {{recalled}} that due to video game budget constraints, the actors were expected {{to show up at}} the set prepared to give a perfect delivery; director <b>Will</b> Binder would <b>not</b> <b>run</b> more than two takes of any scene unless absolutely necessary. In addition, all of Erickson's narrative voice overs were recorded in a single day at a sound studio.|$|R
