30|$|We {{acknowledge}} {{several limitations}} {{in the present}} study. First, due to the retrospective design, we {{are not able to}} confirm the causality of the association we observed. Despite adjustment for prehospital and in-hospital confounders, we cannot be sure that metabolic acidosis might only be a mediator rather than an independent predictor of ICU mortality. Second, we specifically collected information about acidosis of OHCA patients included in analysis previously performed that focused on the prognostic impact of acute kidney injury in this setting [3]. Thus, {{we were not able to}} extend the study period beyond 2012. However, we do believe the results we observed would be similar in a more recent cohort. Third, we were not able to collect additional information on the pathogenesis of the metabolic acidosis. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>collect</b> chloremia, albumin or magnesium level, which could have allowed us to explore more deeply metabolic acidosis mechanisms. Fourth, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>collect</b> repeated measurements of base deficit, which prevented us to evaluate the prognostic impact of metabolic acidosis correction or acidosis duration. Last, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>collect</b> renal replacement therapy details, which could partly explain the differences between survivors and patients who died in the fourth quartile of base deficit.|$|E

30|$|The {{literature}} {{dealing with}} vacancy rates constructed with HW data has {{pointed at a}} number of additional problems that might bias the estimated rates over time. For instance, the relative importance of the chosen newspapers might change over time (a point we already discussed above). Moreover, if the propensity to advertise vacancies in newspapers varies across productive sectors and the relative importance of the latter changes over time, we will observe changes in the estimated vacancy rates even if the true vacancies remain unaltered.

30|$|Our {{study has}} several limitations. The study sample had a Hispanic {{ethnicity}} predominance of 52 % children being of Hispanic ethnicity.

30|$|Turning to the {{limitations}} of our study, we list {{the small number of}} study participants used in our analyses (i.e. 29 individuals) and the short temporal duration of our study (i.e. only 4 weeks). However, it is worth noticing that the epidemic curve of 2012 - 2013 influenza season presents a peak during the four weeks selected for our study. In addition, the symptoms data are self-reported by the study participants. Finally, our sample is composed by parents. Hence, it may be plausible that the predictive performance of our approach is affected also by the changes in parents’ mobility behavior related to the health status of the kids. For example, a parent may change her/his mobility behaviors in order to take the children to the doctor or to stay at home with the sick children. Moreover, the parent may get sick from her/his children, thus showing the symptoms few days later. Unfortunately, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>collect</b> data about the health status of the children due to privacy reasons. Therefore, future studies on different samples of study participants (e.g., students, older adults) should be conducted to better investigate the predictive role of changes in human mobility behaviors for the emergence of flu-like and cold symptoms.|$|R
30|$|In {{the current}} study, urinary {{creatinine}} was not measured {{to estimate the}} true creatinine clearance for these patients.

30|$|This {{study has}} several limitations. Firstly, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>collect</b> all the ethiological agents of {{children}} with diarrhea without CDI.

3000|$|Our study {{presents}} several limitations. There {{is currently}} {{no consensus on}} the definition of ECMO device-related infection. Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines have established a clear definition of central line-related infection or blood stream infections that precisely exclude ECMO devices [14]. Moreover, the definitions that include differential time to blood culture positivity appear to be inappropriate given the impossibility and danger of performing blood culture in ECMO cannulae [13, 28]. We have {{decided to use the}} threshold of 103 colony-forming unit for the positivity of the device culture, which is derived from catheter infection literature but not validated for the ECMO device so far. At least, our study focused on ECMO device infection and colonisation at the time of removal and not during the ECMO support period. Moreover, the huge majority of our patients were receiving antibiotics at the time of ECMO insertion and during the ECMO run. These two last elements could have led to possible underestimation of the number of infections and colonisations. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>collected</b> data regarding dressing disruption or changes that might help to explain the differences between the rate of colonisation and the rate of infection. Using a multinomial logistic regression procedure, we failed to establish factors associated with ECMO device colonisation or infection, probably because of the cohort size.|$|R
40|$|Are {{applicable}} {{and useful}} librarian performance indicators (UNE 50137 standard) for hospital libraries? Objectives: Test {{the effectiveness of}} librarian performance indicators {{as a tool to}} assess Health Science and Hospital libraries and try to define those that would be are considered most relevant for this type of libraries. Material and methods: We selected 6 performance indicators (UNE 50137) that we considered would be easy to obtain and we try to reliably achieve the same data in 4 Hospital libraries with similar features. We unifyed measurement criteria to perform calculations, in order to perform a reliable comparisson, and annual calculations to: patrons costs; visits to the library per capita; cost per visit to the library; speed of services of document obtaining; volume of loans; loans per capita. In some cases it was necessary to extract representative samples, obtained randomly so as not to bias the results. All these calculations were performed using the annual accounting information and statistical data obtained as common tasks of libraries. Results: A table was elaborated synthesizing the main results obtained for the 6 selected indicators was elaborated. Conclusions: It is very complicated to apply the same criteria measurement in the different libraries because <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>collect</b> the same data or in the same way, and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have accurate and homogeneous measurement systems. The criteria and methodology for data collection has to be unifyed to obtain valid and comparable indicators. These data and these indicators are not really representative of our work. Discussion: can UNE 50137 standard apply for hospital libraries? Do the indicators really measure performance in the field of hospital libraries? To what extent are these data useful...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reflects}} {{upon some}} limitations of Urban Sensing, a EU-funded research project that explores {{the potential of}} social media analysis and data visualization {{as a source of}} knowledge for participatory urban planning processes.

Anyway, we found a reduction of the time spent in the ED by the patients with the ultrasound integrated approach. We think that the result is interesting even if it was not completely significant and, according to the extent of the reduction, the lack of significance might be caused by the small number of subjects. The possibility to reach the correct diagnosis and to set the right therapy earlier permitted to speed up the in-hospital management of the patients.|$|E

40|$|Tbe {{emigration}} data project can be {{boosted by}} adopting a development focus in issues of emigration, the {{concern with the}} bilateral issues between origin and host countries notwithstanding. Increased demand for information on links between emigration and local development will increase allocation for information; and new queries will generate databases that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>collect</b> now, facilitating new research and understanding. The paper surveys our present databases and future requirements {{from this point of}} view. It first surveys our current knowledge of the links between emigration and development. It then identifies the areas where we cannot produce precise answers or quantify them because of inadequate data, rather than inadequate knowledge. This produces a preliminary wish list for data. Then the paper asks what further linkages we should strive to understand next. It argues that to analyse the links better, we should develop the capability for forecast and simulation of income effect, price effect and terms of trade effects of emigration. Many policy questions hinge on general equilibrium issues that can be adequately answered using these effects in a partial equilibrium framework. By using illustrative models for the effects, the paper tries to identify databases required for this sort of project. This provides a second round of wishes. Finally, data requirements identified throughout the paper are summarised, and strategies for collecting them discussed. Depending on the information, important recommendations are: (i) disaggregation of some categories in published tables; (ii) change of accounting format in some cases; (iii) periodic survey of emigrants in destination countries, and Indian districts of large emigration; (iv) database on internal migration and index of wages at major labour markets; (v) index of wages for highly emigrant skills; (vi) sociological study of returnees with structured interviews; (vii) procuring micro databases developed by private researchers...|$|R
30|$|At {{the time}} of writing, we are not sure if burned stands will {{maintain}} lower tree mortality probabilities {{in the face of}} the continued, severe drought of 2015. Future work should aim to better identify drought response mechanisms. While the causal links among prescribed fire, reduced stand density, and reduced mortality under drought are intuitively appealing, our data were insufficient to test this directly. Plot sizes were generally too small (0.1 ha) to confidently measure individual-level competitive interactions (i.e., many trees will be at the plot margins, with unknown competitive environments outside of the plot boundary) (Das 2012). <b>We</b> also <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>collect</b> information on other potentially important mortality predictors, such as individual tree growth history (Das et al. 2007), insect and pathogen pressure, and plot-level environmental conditions (e.g., soil depth or water holding capacity).

40|$|This {{research}} project assesses progress towards achieving the target {{articulated in the}} Threatened Species Strategy of 2 million feral cats culled by 2020 (Australian Government 2015). For the first time, we have a plausible estimate of feral cat control in Australia by which to assess current and future effort.

Our survey {{results indicate that the}} contribution of private individuals to feral cat control is extremely significant, and that the vast majority (in excess of 80 %) of feral control may currently be unreported through official channels. Shooting (or trapping then shooting) is the main method of feral cat control. While <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> specifically <b>collect</b> information regarding the change in effort over time since the implementation of the Threatened Species Strategy (Australian Government 2015), qualitative data collected through our strategic survey indicates that culling by private individuals has not changed substantially over the years or in recent times.

30|$|There are {{shortcomings}} in this study. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>collect</b> data regarding some other potential risk {{factors such as}} a history of smoking prior to the injury.

[37] showed that within the same institution, the fasciotomy rate among surgeons varied. We did not analyse this. We also did not have records of patient consciousness levels in our data base, and hence we are unable to say whether ACS was more likely to occur in unconscious patients than conscious patients (who can complain of severe pain). However, we believe that consciousness levels are not variables that would directly influence the occurrence of ACS and therefore are not a direct risk factor.|$|E
40|$|Forest {{restoration}} programmes aim to use {{material for}} re-planting that is genetically diverse and not inbred. However, restricted seed sampling, high variance in reproductive output, {{and the production}} of inbred seeds that survive in the nursery but not in the wild can lead to forest restoration stock being genetically compromised. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether the reproductive biology of the New Caledonian endemic conifer Araucaria nemorosa makes it susceptible to these genetic problems and to assess whether there is evidence for genetic bottlenecks and elevated inbreeding in nursery stock compared to seedlings and adults from wild source populations. Reproductive output was low with high variance among trees (only 14 % of adult trees surveyed produced mature cones, > 50 % of examined cones had < 10 viable seeds). Evidence for an extreme genetic bottleneck was detected in a nursery population established from cones collected from adult trees. A second nursery population established with seed collected from the forest floor showed no evidence of a genetic bottleneck, but was inbred compared to its wild source population. In light of these results, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> recommend <b>collecting</b> cones directly from A. nemorosa as an efficient means of establishing genetically diverse stock for restoration programmes. Collecting seed from the forest floor is likely to be more effective, but the planting stock may contain a high proportion of inbred individuals. Collecting established wild seedlings already subjected to natural selection is suggested as an alternative method of maximising the diversity captured, whilst minimising sampling effort and proportion of inbred individuals...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Art {{museums are}} faced with how to {{implement}} policies and practices to acquire media-based artworks in the original formats while planning for potential maintenance, repairs and upgrades of technology. As Christine Frohnert and Martha Singer state in their 2010 American Institute of Conservation (AIC) News article, "incorporation of technology into works of art, whether visibly or covertly, serves to anchor a work to its historical specificity and to grant it a more full cultural identity. Therefore {{it comes as no}} surprise that artists increasingly use electronic media. " This research explores the range of challenges museums face when collecting works which have software and describes the range of emerging strategies for collecting software-based artwork while planning for future exhibitions and preservation. Three research methods were used to collect data; an electronic survey regarding media-based collection, site visits to James Turrell Skyspaces and interviews with experts who work with media-based artwork. Results indicate that museums are interested in collecting software-based works despite concerns in the field regarding the inherent vice of the technology degrading and the lack of museum professionals with computer science expertise. In response to these concerns strategies for collecting software-based artworks are beginning to emerge such as internal museum workgroups, documenting software code and establishing digital repositories. These are strategies that may enhance the museum's ability to exhibit and preserve software-based art. Digital technology has become a pervasive aspect of daily life for most individuals if <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> begin <b>collecting,</b> documenting and preserving this history we will those records of our cultural history...|$|R
30|$|Limitations of our {{analysis}} include its single-center {{design and the}} lack of standardization of the SpO 2 measurements, due to their retrospective collection. Indeed, standardization of ventilatory settings at baseline and after 24  h, and thus calculation of the PaO 2 /FiO 2, may be crucial for appropriate stratification and patient selection bias minimization [43], and the same may apply for SpO 2 -based markers. While we tried to minimize potential errors by increasing the number of SpO 2 values collected, we are aware that potential artifactual SpO 2 values or ones resulting from acute events unrelated to the disease process may have been included (such as patient–ventilator asynchrony, obstruction of endotracheal tubes, suctioning and hemodynamic instability). <b>We</b> also <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>collect</b> information on skin pigmentation, motion artifacts, skin perfusion, ambient light, methemoglobinemia and carboxyhemoglobinemia levels—factors that all may be associated with the accuracy of SpO 2 measurements. Its retrospective design allowed us neither to determine the type of pulse oximeter used nor to capture the positions of the probes used in individual patients. The minor but not quantifiable amount of measurements from a different probe or location other than the conventional finger oximeter represents a methodological weakness, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe affects the outcome or correlation analysis in an important way. We focused on only two time points, i.e., the time of initial ARDS diagnosis and after 24  h. It may be possible that SpO 2 /FiO 2 and PEEP at other time points add to risk stratification. Finally, re-classification after 24  h means that patients who died in the first 24  h are missed. The same happens with the small proportion of patients who are extubated or transferred before 24  h. We also excluded patients with a PaO 2 /FiO 2  >  200  mm Hg; however, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe this weakens our results. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> this for the two following reasons. Patients classified as having mild ARDS [1] are very ‘heterogeneous’ with respect to outcomes. Moreover, the milder degree of oxygenation impairments in these patients increases the number of patients with SpO 2 values >  97 %, above which the relationship between PaO 2 and SpO 2 becomes weak.|$|R
