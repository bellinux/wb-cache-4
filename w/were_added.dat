We interviewed six site creators {{to understand the}} motivations they felt and the challenges they encountered. We found that these challenges ultimately resulted {{from a lack of}} information visibility, particularly concerning work in progress. Less technically skilled interviewees coped with these challenges by collaborating with other people, but they were less positive about their respective siteâ€™s success compared to interviewees whose skills enabled them to work alone. We conclude by outlining opportunities for research aimed at helping people more rapidly and effectively collaborate on future web-centric projects...|$|R
