5|$|We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. <b>We</b> <b>played</b> everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E
5|$|<b>We</b> <b>played</b> Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} {{a lovely}} ovation from their supporters and it was the same at Yeovil last year. He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E
5|$|When Me and Juliet began tryout {{performances}} in Cleveland, the duo {{realized that the}} show had problems with the plot and staging. Extensive revisions during the remaining Cleveland and Boston tryouts failed to cure the difficulties with the plot, which the critics considered weak and uninteresting. The show was met with less than favorable reviews, though Mielziner's staging won praise from audience and critics. The show closed once it had exhausted its advance sales. According to Bill Hayes the show's star in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he says' <b>We</b> <b>played</b> nearly five hundred performances, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits went into the R till. So, though {{not in the same}} category as the storied five that were made into films - Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music - our show must be considered a success. With the exception of a short run in Chicago, there was no national tour, and the show has seldom been seen. A small-scale production was presented by London's Finborough Theatre in 2010.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{know where}} this will lead, if anywhere, but the right thing is {{to sit down and}} have these conversations and see if we want our {{championship}} in more than eight cities or do <b>we</b> like <b>playing</b> exclusively in domes. None of the cities where <b>we</b> <b>play</b> our championship is named New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago or Miami. <b>We</b> don't <b>play</b> on a campus. <b>We</b> <b>play</b> in professional football arenas.|$|R

25|$|But {{there was}} such a {{bittersweet}} feeling. Eddie had really changed. Paul was on his last legs. Watch the clip of us doing the song on Ed Sullivan we're not together. Eddie is off by himself. There was no more group. Sure enough, when <b>we</b> <b>played</b> the Copa that week, Eddie left between shows. He didn't come back.|$|E
25|$|There {{would be}} {{more of the same}} during the {{following}} tour of New Zealand in '86 under Jones. After winning the first Test in Wellington, the Wallabies were robbed of a series victory in the second Test when Welsh referee Derek Bevan disallowed a legitimate try by Steve Tuynman. The enigmatic Jones was Campo's greatest admirer, but after a wretched day at fullback, that relationship soured. 'Today <b>we</b> <b>played</b> without a fullback,' commented Jones to a group of exhausted players in the Australian dressing room.|$|E
25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. <b>We</b> <b>played</b> those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal stuff that I won't get into. If I give myself to that, I can feel the psychological effects of that personality in the same way that an actor can say it wasn't healthy to live in that role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E

25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then <b>we</b> <b>played</b> the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the Detroit Lions 20–0 in Week 11 to improve to 10–0, {{and set a}} franchise record for wins to start to a season. Simms threw a 57-yard touchdown pass to receiver Mark Ingram {{in the second quarter}} to run the score to 17–0. After the Giants kicked a field goal to make the score 20–0, the teams played a scoreless second half. The shutout was the Giants' first of the season, and coach Parcells commented, [...] "he defense played very well. The offense played well when I let them. <b>We</b> <b>played</b> conservatively in the second half. <b>We</b> <b>played</b> pretty much error-free. We didn't do anything stupid." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{shows the}} band playing the {{song on the}} Vertigo Tour stage. The live audio is kept to {{demonstrate}} the imperfections and emotion in the performance. The lighting is kept low, drawing attention to the visuals on the LED curtains used throughout the tour and obscuring much of the band members' facial features in shadow. Courtes and Fougerol explained: [...] "we wanted to reflect the mood we've seen at the concerts, so <b>we</b> <b>played</b> with that lighting knowing that you are more blinded from a light if it was darker before".|$|E
500|$|On 4 January 2013, it was {{announced}} that Chamakh had been loaned to West Ham United {{until the end of the}} 2012–13 season.

500|$|The band {{performed}} in a hotel in Winnipeg, where the basement was the club. Araya comments, [...] "We stayed there for like four or five days, I think. We saw Verbal Abuse play there.

[...] When one of the guitarists broke a string Araya would hand them the bass, Hanneman stating, [...] "We'd argue about it, too—like, 'I wanna play bass for a while!'" ...|$|E

500|$|In May 1912 Diaghilev's company {{returned}} to Paris. Monteux was the conductor {{for the two}} outstanding works of the season, Vaslav Nijinsky's ballet version of Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, made with the composer's approval, and Fokine's Daphnis et Chloé to a score commissioned from Ravel. Monteux later recalled [...] "Debussy was behind me when <b>we</b> <b>played</b> L'après midi d'un faune {{because he did not}} want anything in his score to be changed on account of the dancing. And when we came to a forte, he said 'Monteux, that is a forte, play forte'. He did not want anything shimmering. And he wanted everything exactly in time".|$|E
500|$|Springsteen himself {{remained}} quite {{interested in}} his and the band's commercial fortunes.
