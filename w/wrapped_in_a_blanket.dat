25|$|After a {{while the}} rage of the {{soldiers}} turned to thoughts of booty. Plate and jewels, stored gold and cunningly wrought tapestry fell prey to the victors. The men who were spared were stripped of their outer garments, and old Inigo Jones was carried out of the House <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket,</b> because the spoilers had left him absolutely naked.|$|E
25|$|For a {{total of}} two weeks {{following}} Tuomi's murder, Dahmer retained the victim's head <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket.</b> After two weeks, Dahmer boiled the head {{in a mixture of}} Soilex (an alkali-based industrial detergent) and bleach in an effort to retain the skull, which he then used as stimulus for masturbation. Eventually, the skull was rendered too brittle by this bleaching process, and was also pulverized and disposed of.|$|E
25|$|In March 1981, 22-year-old Keryn Barnes, an {{aspiring}} actress from Georgia {{who had been}} the Carsons' roommate in San Francisco, was found dead in their shared apartment. She had been stabbed thirteen times and her skull crushed before being <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> and hidden in the basement. Evidence suggested that Keryn had been killed by someone she knew, and the Carsons became the prime suspects. However, the family disappeared before the body was found. The Carsons later confessed to killing Keryn after Suzan had decided she was a witch.|$|E

500|$|That same evening, a {{large crowd}} gathers in the park to hear a band play. [...] Suddenly, the nearby factory whistle blows to alert the townspeople of {{a fire in the}} second {{district}} of the town; men gather hose-carts and head toward the blaze that is quickly spreading throughout Dr. Trescott's house. [...] Mrs. Trescott is saved by a neighbor, but cannot locate Jimmie, who is trapped inside. [...] Henry appears from the crowd and rushes into the house in search of the boy, finding him unharmed in his bedroom. [...] Unable to retreat the way he came, Henry carries Jimmie, <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket,</b> to the doctor's laboratory and the hidden stairway that leads outside. [...] He discovers the fire has blocked this way out as well and collapses beside Dr. Trescott's desk. A row of nearby jars shatters from the heat, spilling molten chemicals upon Henry's upturned face.|$|E
500|$|On 30 April, the Soviets {{were less}} than [...] from the bunker. That afternoon, Hitler and Eva Braun {{committed}} suicide fewer than 40 hours after they were married. Misch witnessed {{the discovery of the}} bodies of Hitler and Braun. He followed Otto Günsche and Hitler's chief valet Heinz Linge to the door of Hitler's private room. After the door was opened, Misch only took a quick [...] "glance". He saw Eva, with her legs drawn up, to Hitler's left on the sofa. Her eyes were open and she was dead. Hitler was also dead. He was either sitting on the sofa or in the armchair by it; his head [...] "had fallen forward slightly". Misch started to leave to report the events to Schädle, but then stopped and returned to the door of Hitler's study. By then Misch observed that Hitler's corpse had been removed from inside the study and <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket.</b> Several men then picked it up and carried it past him. Misch left and reported the events to Schädle, who instructed him to return to his duty station. After returning to the telephone exchange, Misch later recalled Unterscharführer Retzbach proclaiming [...] "So they're burning the boss now!" [...] Retzbach asked Misch if he was going upstairs to watch the events, but Misch declined to go. Thereafter, Günsche came down and told Misch that the corpses of Hitler and Braun had been burned in the garden of the Reich Chancellery.|$|E

"Baby Doe": The {{third body}} found on April 4, about 250 {{feet away from}} the partial remains of [...] "Jane Doe No. 6," [...] was that of a female toddler between 16 and 24 months of age.

2500|$|The bandaging in Deposition/ Nature Mourned was {{partially}} removed due to more sanding and filing than in Unger’s other pieces. [...] It {{is made of}} two short, forking uprights that cradle a bundle of long, sagging stem-like forms. [...] The title implies that the objects are being brought down for burial, but the form seems swollen with life. [...] One could read the bandaging as an infant <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> and the forks as the huge hands {{of some sort of}} motherly deity. [...] The piece represents the possibility of regeneration after ridding oneself of fear and loss.|$|E
2500|$|Off-screen, Hay was {{described}} as being a very serious and private man, some thought he may have a dark side due to his demeanour. Peter Ustinov, who made his film debut in The Goose Steps Out as a straight man to Hay, said in a 1990 interview when asked about working with him [...] "Well, Will Hay wasn't very funny but I found that very few comics are." [...] as well as [...] "And Will Hay was always <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> at certain hours and had his tea, and we all stopped talking while he was having his tea, {{and then we went}} on shooting. I don't remember him saying anything memorable, nothing I could remember at all. He was very funny when you saw him on the screen, but in life all those people are very, very strange." ...|$|E
2500|$|The race {{seemingly}} {{having been}} decided by progress through bed-pan slops, Curll prays to Jove, who consults the goddess Cloacina. He hears the prayer, passes {{a pile of}} feces down, and catapults Curll to the victory. As Curll grabs the phantom Moore, the poems {{it seemed to have}} fly back to their real authors, and even the clothes go to the unpaid tailors who had made them (James Moore Smythe had run through an inherited fortune and bankrupted himself by 1727). Dulness urges Curll to repeat the joke, to pretend to the public that his dull poets were really great poets, to print things by false names. (Curll had published numerous works by [...] "Joseph Gay" [...] to trick the public into thinking they were by John Gay.) For his victory, she awards Curll a tapestry showing the fates of famous Dunces. On it, he sees Daniel Defoe with his ears chopped off, John Tutchin being whipped publicly through western England, two political journalists clubbed to death (on the same day), and himself being <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> and whipped by the schoolboys of Westminster (for having printed an unauthorised edition of the sermons of the school's master, thereby robbing the school's own printer).|$|E
5000|$|Unbelievable Truth were a British rock band, led by Andy Yorke, with Nigel Powell, Jason Moulster, and Jim Crosskey.

5000|$|The term bindle may {{descend from}} the German/Yiddish word Bündel, meaning {{something}} <b>wrapped</b> up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> and bound by cord for carrying (cf. originally Middle Dutch [...] "bundle), or have arisen as a portmanteau of [...] "bind" [...] and [...] "spindle".|$|R
50|$|Kanaung {{tried to}} rebuild the Burmese Army with modern weapons. He sent men to study in Western {{countries}} to establish an up-to-date arms industry. His efforts were well depicted in contemporary stories and poems. One story relates to his effort in testing depth charges in order to repulse British troops sailing up the Irrawaddy. Eventually, these testings were thwarted {{by the head of}} the Buddhist Sangha who protested against them by asserting their harmful effects on aquatic lives. Another story tells about his visits to the factories on cold early winter mornings while <b>wrapping</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket.</b> He was also known for his waywardness as depicted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> famous love song called Seinchu Kya-nyaung bawlè written by his wife, Princess Hlaing Hteik-hkaung Tin.|$|R
2500|$|After {{escaping}} the musketeers, Don Quixote and Sancho ride {{to a nearby}} inn. Once again, Don Quixote imagines the inn is a castle, although Sancho is not quite convinced. Don Quixote is given a bed in a former hayloft, and Sancho sleeps on the rug next to the bed; they share the loft with a muleteer. When night comes, Don Quixote imagines the servant girl at the inn, Helen, to be a beautiful princess, and makes her sit on his bed with him, scaring her. Seeing what is happening, the muleteer attacks Don Quixote, breaking the fragile bed and leading to a large and chaotic fight in which Don Quixote and Sancho are once again badly hurt. Don Quixote's explanation for everything is that they fought with an enchanted Moor. He also believes that he can cure their wounds with a mixture he calls [...] "the balm of Firearbras", which only makes them sick. Don Quixote and Sancho decide to leave the inn, but Quixote, following {{the example of the}} fictional knights, leaves without paying. Sancho, however, remains and ends up <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> and tossed up in the air (blanketed) by several mischievous guests at the inn, something that is often mentioned over the rest of the novel. After his release, he and Don Quixote continue their travels.|$|E
2500|$|The film then rolls {{into the}} song “A World Without” as a grief-stricken Charlie {{and several other}} mourners, {{some of whom are}} clearly played by Queensrÿche's band members, attend Cathy’s funeral. The priest begins his eulogy but then appears to be {{laughing}} and pointing at Charlie, as do everyone else in attendance except for La Torre, who looks at Charlie with a serious face, as Charlie clutches his child <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket.</b> Brian is also shown to be laughing and pointing but his appearance {{as well as the other}} mourners’ cruelty is revealed to be happening merely inside Charlie’s head, coinciding with the lyric [...] "what is real and what is fantasy". The song continues playing as Charlie is seen sitting beside a crib and drinking heavily while a baby is heard crying. He has a vision of Cathy picking up their child from the crib, and recalls the look on Brian’s face that day when he finked on him. Charlie then proceeds to pull a gun from a drawer and point it at his head but the vision of Cathy returns to assure him that she is there with him. Four years later, Charlie is seen working at his desk and smiling at a picture that his daughter drew for him. As he leaves his desk, the camera zooms in on a photograph of his now four-year-old daughter. Charlie heads toward the garage where he finds his brother waiting for him by the car. Without saying a word, Brian nervously holds his hand out to Charlie who happily embraces him, and the two of them reconcile. During the end credits, the track [...] "X2" [...] is played.|$|E

60|$|Half naked, numbed {{through and}} through, with {{chattering}} teeth and failing limbs, Leroy staggered into the guard-house at Chantenay.

6000|$|She {{was awakened}} by a blaze of {{sunshine}} pouring into the tent, a smell of fried bacon and Trafford's voice telling her to get up.

6000|$|... "You shall," [...] said a {{low voice}} behind; and {{starting}} round they beheld by the dim light a thin, pallid, almost spectral form, <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket,</b> and looking like Lazarus coming from the tomb.|$|E
6000|$|... "After that I {{made my way}} to {{my little}} camp, which, fortunately, the {{elephants}} had not walked over, and <b>wrapping</b> myself up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket,</b> was soon fast asleep.|$|R
5000|$|Christophe {{looked at}} the man and said casa house. He took him into the house, undressed him and <b>wrapped</b> him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket.</b> Christophe did {{physical}} exercises to get his blood restarted. Then van Hauwaert and Paul came in. [...] "They were so frozen that they put their hands into the flames. Ernest Paul had lost a shoe without noticing," [...] Christophe said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Peter," [...] {{the elder}} brother said, [...] "open our lantern. The night is quite still. You {{hold your hand}} behind it, so that the light will not fall on our faces, and I will look whether he is only <b>wrapped</b> up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> or has <b>a</b> regular bed; we must not risk setting the place on fire. Get the {{crackers}} ready." ...|$|R

60|$|With one leap Colonel Zane {{was at the}} gate, and, {{following}} {{with his}} eyes the direction indicated by Douns' trembling finger, he saw two tall, brown figures striding down the lane.

60|$|The hunters were {{carrying}} between them {{what appeared to}} be the body of Hans. At first I was frightened, thinking that he must be dead, but examination showed that he was only <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of insensibility such as might be induced by laudanum.
