In other words, an adver-sary that can crash any subset of size at most t can prevent the processes from agreeing on t values. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other 22 n− 1 − (n + 1) adversaries that are not uniform in this sense and might crash certain combination of processes and not others? This paper presents a precise way to clas-sify all adversaries. We introduce the notion of disagreement power: the biggest integer k for which the adversary can pre-vent processes from agreeing on k values. We show how to compute the disagreement power of an adversary and derive n equivalence classes of adversaries. ...|$|E

Involving many stakeholders at different scales, they form a complex system {{that can be easily}} disturbed by internal or external events, because then all the dependencies that allow to optimizing their working become flaws that help failures to spread beyond the flooded area and from one network to another. Thus every flood reminds us how vulnerable infrastructures are and how much it costs when they fail. But whereas it isn’t so difficult to adapt new urban development, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> existing and exposed infrastructures? CEPRI carried out research on encountered difficulties and good practices to understand the situation and consider improvement opportunities. We worked out three steps to a better territory resilience to flood. First, get a better knowledge of networks. Then, as far as possible, reduce networks vulnerability. Finally, as risks of network failures always remain, get prepared to cope with disruptions! CEPRI gathered many experiences to illustrate and strengthen its work, which aims at helping local authorities to reduce their vulnerability to flood and related networks failures...|$|E

Although the exact implementation of such a tax is not yet clear, the general idea of a tax on information from the point of view of an eroding tax base and the changing society is certainly worth considering. Furthermore, the tax revenues could be directed towards improving access to the Internet, educating individuals to become acquainted with the Internet and providing additional needed bandwidth. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to study}} moral {{motivation}} in economic {{decision making and}} to increase understanding of how we treat the element of choice {{when it comes to}} economic inequality and distribution of income. Most people agree that inequality caused by differences in choice and effort is acceptable. We also accept inequality caused by luck if we take the risk by choice. On the other hand, we feel that inequalities caused by factors beyond our control should be redistributed to a considerable extent. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> grey zones in between, all the different combinations of luck and choices? The starting point for this thesis is that there exist choice situations that are mere illusions – situations involving choice where the decision maker have little or no control over the outcome despite the freedom to choose. From psychological literature we also know that people have a tendency to exaggerate the control that choices provide. Combining these features, we are interested in to what extent people assign responsibility to more or less meaningless choices. This thesis analyses an economic experiment. In the experiment, a spectating dictator is asked to redistribute the total earnings of a two-person winner-takes-it-all lottery, where the detailed rules of the lottery vary across three different treatments. The results reveal that a choice illusion – luck that is covered up as a choice – in fact undermines the willingness to redistribute. Using a pure luck lottery as a baseline, we find that people transfer less from the lucky to the unlucky when an “empty” choice is introduced. We find that inequality is reduced substantially across all treatments, but that people redistribute less in the choice treatments...|$|E

40|$|Electronic theses and {{dissertation}} are {{the topic}} of the ETD, but <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> theses, which are not yet electronically published and only available on paper or even worse on microfilm? As the manufacturer of the Bookeye® family of scanners we {{have had a lot of}} discussions with libraries and their needs. One topic was the gap between the increasing demand for electronic availability of documents like dissertations and theses and their real availability on paper or microfilm. To close this gap - besides others like electronic document delivery via ILL and/or an alternative to ARIEL - we were asked to develop an open WEB-based system together with librarians. The development guidelines were a browser-based user interface, usage of PHP, Apache, MySQL, and the system should run on Windows and Linux. The result was Mybib, a platform to cover: * electronic document delivery * scan on demand applications, as an alternative to scanning entire stocks * back file conversion to supply extended OPAC´s Requests for documents to be scanned and delivered can be issued to Mybib by any library system, OPAC or free style WEB-form via ILL, XML or E-Mail. The whole process from the incoming request, through scanning to the delivery is cov-ered by Mybib. Modules for tracking, billing, claim handling, statistics and others support the management and supervisor of the library. MyBib is scalable from one to many scanning, operation and management workplaces. It covers the needs of big libraries located in one place, as well as libraries with departments located in different places. And all of them can be supervised from one place anywhere in the world via Internet or VPN with a Browser To get theses and documents from paper/microfilm to a digital form, they have to be scanned, which is realized by the My-Bib Scan-client. It covers overhead-, flatbed-, autofeed- and microfilm- scanners as well as digital copier systems from RICOH, CANON and others, which can be used as scanner and printer. And if the scanner supports color or formats up to A 1 (34 " by 22 "), Mybib supports it too. Last, but not least there is the question of intellectual property rights. To help protect these rights, the electronic endorser in Mybib imprints a digital watermark as proof of information supplier or copyright remarks with time stamp in the delivered documents...|$|E
