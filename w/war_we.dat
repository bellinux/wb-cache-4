The quality of the Test sides usually runs in cycles. A number of the batsmen who scored heavily on previous occasions found that Don Bradman had not spent hours at the wicket softening the bowling, and run-scoring against bowlers who were not tired was not so easy.|$|E
500|$|Samuel Fuller’s The Steel Helmet (1951) {{was made}} during the Korean War (1950–1953). The critic Guy Westwell notes that it {{questioned}} {{the conduct of the}} war, as did later films like The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954) and Pork Chop Hill (1959). Fuller agreed that all his films were anti-war. No Hollywood films about the Korean War did well at the box office; the historian Lary May suggested that they reminded American viewers of [...] "the only <b>war</b> <b>we</b> have lost".|$|E
500|$|At Moscow, Kennan {{found the}} {{atmosphere}} even more regimented than on his previous trips, with police guards following him everywhere, discouraging contact with Soviet citizens. At the time, Soviet propaganda charged the U.S. with preparing for war, which Kennan did not wholly dismiss. [...] "I {{began to ask}} myself whether... we had not contributed... by the overmilitarization of our policies and statements... to a belief in Moscow that it was <b>war</b> <b>we</b> were after, that we had settled for its inevitability, {{that it was only}} a matter of time before we would unleash it." ...|$|E

[...] On the following day, Secretary of State William P.

500|$|Hair makes many {{references}} to Shakespeare's plays, especially Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet, and, at times, takes lyrical material directly from Shakespeare. [...] For example, {{the lyrics to}} the song [...] "What a Piece of Work Is Man" [...] are from Hamlet (II:scene2) and portions of [...] "Flesh Failures" [...] ("the rest is silence") are from Hamlet's final lines. [...] In [...] "Flesh Failures/Let The Sun Shine In", the lyrics [...] "Eyes, look your last!/ Arms, take your last embrace! And lips, O you/ The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss" [...] are from Romeo and Juliet (V: iii, 111–14). [...] According to Miller, the Romeo suicide imagery makes the point that, with our complicity in <b>war,</b> <b>we</b> are killing ourselves.|$|E
500|$|Arthur also {{attempted}} to secure Cobby's {{support for the}} protest. The commander of No.1 TAF had been the Australian Flying Corps' leading ace in World WarI, as Caldwell was the RAAF's in World WarII. Arthur reasoned that, although Cobby was partly {{to blame for the}} morale issue, [...] "we felt that his value to our move, because of his name with the Public, together with Group Captain Caldwell, would give us a very considerable amount of public support...he was the prima donna of one war, and... arm-in-arm with the prima donna of the next <b>war,</b> <b>we</b> would put up a reasonable front and attract a lot of attention in the headlines of the newspapers." [...] Cobby refused to join in and later claimed to be unaware of the depth of feeling among the pilots.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of local and regional conflicts {{around the world in}} the past several decades has led us to investigate the causes of <b>war</b> and coups. <b>We</b> used economic, cultural and demographic differences as explanatory variables in elucidating the causes of coups and <b>wars</b> between countries. <b>We</b> found that as the culture in a country becomes more individualistic and less collectivistic, the number of coups declines. However, as the uncertainty avoidance increases, the probability of coups also increases. When the standard of living in a country high, the probability of coups is lower. In relation to <b>wars,</b> <b>we</b> found that as the cultural differences between countries are greater, the likelihood of war is higher, and that the probability of war is also higher when the size (economic and demographic) differences are greater. ...|$|R
500|$|Wolfgang Flür {{has stated}} Kraftwerk were {{influenced}} by {{the music of the}} Weimar Germany era: [...] "we were children who were born straight after World War Two ... we had no musical or pop culture of our own ... there was the war, and before the <b>war</b> <b>we</b> had only the German folk music. In the 1920s or 1930s melodies were developed and these became culture that we worked from". Karl Bartos also spoke of post-war influence as the group thought that they [...] "had this development in the 1920s which was very, very strong and was audio visual. We had the Bauhaus school before the war and then after the <b>war</b> <b>we</b> had tremendous people like Karlheinz Stockhausen and the development of the classical and the electronic classical. This was very strong and it all happened very close to Düsseldorf in Cologne and all the great composers at that time came there." [...] Paul Alessandrini is credited for helping contribute to the album's concept. Alessandrini told Hütter and Schneider that [...] "with the kind of music you do, which is kind of like an electronic blues, railway stations and trains are very important in your universe, you should do a song about the Trans Europe Express". Kraftwerk believed critics in the United Kingdom and the United States associated them with Nazi Germany, with tracks such as [...] "Autobahn" [...] inextricably linked with the Nazis who built the high-speed roads in the 1930s and 1940s. At the same time, the band were keen to move away from their German heritage towards a new sense of European identity and felt that the Trans Europ Express could be used to symbolize this. Allmusic referred to Trans-Europe Express as a concept album with two different themes. The first being the disparities between reality and image, represented by the songs [...] "Hall of Mirrors" [...] and [...] "Showroom Dummies", and the others about the glorification of Europe. Slant Magazine described the album as [...] "a sonic poem to Europe".|$|E
500|$|Berryman {{discontinued}} {{his university}} studies {{to prepare for}} the entrance examination for Staff College, Camberley. Eighteen Australian Army officers sat the exam that year, but only Berryman and one other officer passed. Only two Australian officers were accepted into staff college each year, so Berryman's [...] attendance from 1926 to 1928 marked him out as one of the Australian Army's rising talents. It also allowed him to forge useful contacts with the British Army. Berryman later recalled, [...] "The advantage of this was that in <b>war</b> <b>we</b> had the same doctrine of tactics and administration, which was essential if we had to work together. More than that, the officers who had to carry out their duties in cooperation knew each other personally." [...] After graduation he was posted to the High Commission of Australia, London, from 1929 to 1932, where he served under the Military Liaison Officer, Major General Julius Bruche.|$|E
500|$|A notable {{event at}} the Congress was the {{promotion}} of the policy of [...] "peaceful coexistence" [...] by Khrushchev, which officially was a policy to increase East-West collaboration against the threat of nuclear war, but which anti-revisionists believed [...] "was merely a way to divide the world in to spheres of influence inside which each side would enjoy unquestioned supremacy." [...] One anti-revisionist author described Khrushchev's policy as follows: [...] "Khrushchev {{made it clear that he}} was prepared to give up international class struggle, renouncing on behalf of the colonial peoples any right to liberate themselves from oppression and reassuring capitalist governments by emphasising 'peaceful transition to socialism' or the Parliamentary road..." [...] He then quoted Khrushchev as saying that [...] "'if any mad man wanted <b>war,</b> <b>we</b> , the two strongest countries in the world, would have but to shake our fingers to warn him off.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2007 Clark's memoir A Time to Lead: For Duty, Honor and Country.

He had made the allegation a number of times in public and media appearances in 2006 and 2007. The book also described a conversation Clark had with Paul Wolfowitz in May 1991 after the Gulf War, quoting Wolfowitz as lamenting the non-removal of Saddam Hussein, but also telling him that [...] "...we did learn one thing that’s very important. With the end of the Cold <b>War,</b> <b>we</b> can now use our military with impunity. The Soviets won’t come in to block us. And we’ve got five, maybe 10, years to clean up these old Soviet surrogate regimes like Iraq and Syria before the next superpower emerges to challenge us...".|$|E
500|$|Asda, {{along with}} several other UK supermarkets, having already taken pre-orders for the book at a heavily {{discounted}} price, sparked a price war {{two days before the}} book's launch by announcing they would sell it for just £5 a copy. Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a loss leader. This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions. Independent shops protested loudest, but even Waterstone's, the UK's largest dedicated chain bookstore, could not compete with the supermarket price. Some small bookstores hit back by buying their stock from the supermarkets rather than their wholesalers. Asda attempted to counter this by imposing a limit of two copies per customer to prevent bulk purchases. Philip Wicks, a spokesman for the UK Booksellers Association, said, [...] "It is a <b>war</b> <b>we</b> can't even participate in. We think it's a crying shame that the supermarkets have decided to treat it as a loss-leader, like a can of baked beans." [...] Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba Information, said: [...] "You are not only lowering the price of the book. At this point, you are lowering the value of reading." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1939, Britain {{entered the}} Second World War, which lasted until 1945. During the war, many of London's {{children}} were evacuated {{to avoid the}} frequent aerial bombing. The suggestion by senior politician Lord Hailsham that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, [...] "The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave." [...] Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk. From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived {{for most of the}} next five years. At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments. In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities. She stated: [...] "We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our share of the danger and sadness of <b>war.</b> <b>We</b> know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well." ...|$|E

500|$|One of the film's strongest detractors was Time Out magazine's Keith Uhlich, {{who called}} the film [...] "war porn of the highest order". [...] Geoff Pevere wrote in his review for The Globe and Mail, [...] "The {{sensation}} of being pinned down and shot apart is so harrowingly conveyed...that one almost forgives the movie's failure to be quite as persuasive in almost every other respect." [...] While praising the film for its visuals and sound effects, as well as Berg's atmospheric direction, Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave Lone Survivor a mixed review. Smith concluded his review by describing it as [...] "a movie about an irrelevant skirmish that ended in near-total catastrophe, during a <b>war</b> <b>we</b> are not winning." [...] Film critic Steven Boone, writing for Roger Ebert's website, compared the film's violence to that of Mel Gibson's 2004 film The Passion of the Christ: [...] "What's in between amounts to The Passion of the Christ for U.S. servicemen: a bloody historic episode recounted mainly in images of hardy young men being ripped apart, at screeching volume. Though Berg's source material isn't the New Testament, he often handles Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell's account...with the thunderous reverence Mel Gibson brought to Christ's crucifixion and resurrection." ...|$|E
