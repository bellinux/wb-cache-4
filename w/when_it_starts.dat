25|$|The {{basic problem}} is that the {{constructor}} is a peculiar function; <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> off, there is no object, only raw memory. And by the time it finishes, you have a fully initialized object. Therefore, i) The constructor cannot be called on an object ii) However, it needs to access (and initialize) non-static members. This makes calling the constructor directly an error. The solution is the placement form of operator new.|$|E
25|$|Tarlochan Singh Bedi (1999) {{writes that}} the Gurmukhī script {{developed}} in the 10-14th centuries from the Devasesha stage of the Śāradā script, the intermediate phase being Siddha Matrika, before the final evolution into Gurmukhī. His argument is that from the 10th century, regional differences started to appear between the Śāradā script used in Punjab, the Hill States (partly Himachal Pradesh) and Kashmir. The regional Śāradā script evolved from this stage until the 14th century, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> {{to appear in the}} form of Gurmukhī.

25|$|Pagtatawas: A {{method of}} {{diagnosing}} illness wherein alum (called tawas) is ritualistically {{used by the}} albularyo or medicine man for diagnosis {{of a variety of}} health conditions. The tawas is used to 'cross' (sign of the cross) the forehead and other suspicious or ailing parts of the body as prayers are being whispered (bulong or oracion). It is then placed on glowing embers, removed <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>starts</b> to crack, then transferred to a small receptacle of water. As it cools, its softened form spreads on the water surface and assumes a shape that may suggest the cause of the illness, often one of several indigenous forces: dwarfs, devils or other evil spirits (na-nuno, na-kulam, na-demonyo). The water in the vehicle is then used to anoint the ailing part or parts of the body to counteract the evil forces or illness. The tawas is then discarded and thrown westward, preferably into the setting sun.|$|E
