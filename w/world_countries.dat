5|$|As large {{consumers}} of fossil fuels, First <b>World</b> <b>countries</b> {{drew attention to}} environmental pollution. The Kyoto Protocol is a treaty {{that is based on}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First <b>World</b> <b>countries.</b> Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, were not required to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the recent}} past, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the interests of Third <b>World</b> <b>countries.</b> This is because most international relations scholars have come from the industrialized, First World nations. As more countries have continued to become more developed, the interests of the world have slowly started to shift. However, First World nations still have many more universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which has made it very difficult for Third <b>World</b> <b>countries</b> to gain legitimacy and respect with their new ideas and methods of looking at the world.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the more}} {{commonly}} used steel alloys are categorized into various grades by standards organizations. For example, the Society of Automotive Engineers has a series of grades defining many types of steel. The American Society for Testing and Materials has a separate set of standards, which define alloys such as A36 steel, {{the most commonly used}} structural steel in the United States. The JIS also define series of steel grades that are being used extensively in Japan as well as in third <b>world</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 14 September 1955, the Apostolic Vicariate of Dakar {{became an}} archdiocese, and Lefebvre thus {{became the first}} Metropolitan Archbishop of Dakar. Archbishop Lefebvre {{was the first and}} {{foremost}} advisor to Pius XII during the writing of the encyclical Fidei Donum (1957), which instructed the clergy and laity on the missions in the Third <b>World</b> <b>countries</b> and called for more missionaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of people and information largely characterizes the inter-world relationships in the present day. A majority of breakthroughs and innovation originate in Western Europe and the U.S. and later their effects permeate globally. As judged by the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, most of the Top 30 Innovations of the Last 30 Years were from former First <b>World</b> <b>countries</b> (e.g., the U.S. and countries in Western Europe).|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First <b>World</b> <b>countries.</b> After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E

The 1,420-millimeter Export pipeline was 4,451 kilometers long. It crossed the Ural and Carpathian Mountains and almost 600 rivers, including the Ob', Volga, Don, and Dnepr. It had 41 compressor stations and a yearly capacity of 32 billion cubic meters of natural gas.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{the concept}} of the First World came about as a result of World War II, so did the European Union. In 1951 the {{beginnings}} of the EU were founded with the creation of European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). From the beginning of its inception, countries in the EU were judged by many standards, including economic ones. This is where the relation between globalization, the EU, and First <b>World</b> <b>countries</b> arises. Especially during the 1990s when the EU focused on economic policies such as the creation and circulation of the Euro, the creation of the European Monetary Institute, and the opening of the European Central Bank.|$|E

5|$|Outsourcing {{is among}} some of the many reasons for {{increased}} competition within developing countries. Aside from being a reason for competition, many First <b>World</b> <b>countries</b> see outsourcing, in particular offshore outsourcing, as an opportunity for increased income. As a consequence, the skill level of production in foreign countries handling the outsourced services increases within the economy; and the skill level within the domestic developing countries can decrease. It is because of competition (including outsourcing) that Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson predict {{that there will be a}} rise of 15–33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} of Jerry Alisandros {{and the other}} mass tort lawyers are based on their previous experience. Several times before they had caught Varrick marketing seriously faulty drugs, as well as ruthlessly trying out their products in Third <b>World</b> <b>countries.</b> In all these cases, Varrick preferred to negotiate lucrative compensations for these lawyers' clients, of which the lawyers got a big cut. Alisandros expects the same to happen again: the lawsuits {{from all over the}} U.S. would be concentrated in South Florida, with a federal judge which Alisandros considers amendable; Varrick would negotiate, reach again a settlement out of court and everybody will grow rich.|$|E
5|$|Back in Seattle, Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) surprises his fiancée Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) with a visit. The couple reunites with {{constant}} sexual activity, {{for which the}} interns tease Bailey. Meanwhile, Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) allows Shepherd to operate on a spinal cord, despite his hand being broken from the plane crash. Thereafter, it is revealed that Sloan is in a comatose state, and will be taken off of life support that evening. In the hospital cafeteria, Meredith Grey announces that Wilson will be given the honor of performing a supervised appendectomy, a procedure historically used {{as a reward for}} interns. The hospital's chief of surgery, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), introduces the new pediatric surgery attending, Dr. Mel Barnett (Philip Casnoff), to Torres and Karev. Barnett informs Karev that he will not be continuing with the African orphan charity program (a function to treat ill children from Third <b>World</b> <b>countries),</b> something that was initially finalized by the latter and former chief of pediatric surgery, Robbins. Karev becomes upset about this, and asks Torres to prevent Barnett from discontinuing the program, though Torres shows no interest in helping Karev.|$|E

5|$|Soviet rail {{transport}} became, after the Great Patriotic War, {{one of the}} most developed in the world, surpassing most of its First World counterparts. The Soviet railway system was growing in size, at a rate of 639km a year from 1965 to 1980, while the growth of {{rail transport}} in First <b>World</b> <b>countries</b> was either decreasing or stagnating. This steady growth in rail transport {{can be explained by the}} country's need to extract its natural resources, most of which were located close to, or in Siberia. While some problems with the railways had been reported by the Soviet press, the Soviet Union could boast of controlling {{one of the most}} electrified railway systems at the time. During much of the country's later lifespan, trains usually carried coal, oil, construction material (mostly stone, cement and sand) and timber. Oil and oil products were one of the key reasons for building railway infrastructure in Siberia in the first place.|$|E
5|$|While North Korea {{had already}} begun to move from a foreign policy based upon proletarian internationalism at the Conference of Party Representatives in 1966, the WPK {{leadership}} had never explicitly broken with proletarian internationalism as it did at the 6th Congress. In theory, a communist party supports policy contributing to the world revolution. Communist regimes rarely lived up to this ideal; by the 1950s, ideological schisms within the world communist movement made it all but impossible. From 1966 onwards, North Korea strengthened relations with neutral countries in the global Cold War. Proletarian internationalism was replaced with a national, independent foreign policy; if a socialist and non-socialist country were at war, North Korea could (in theory) support the non-socialist country if it benefited North Korea. At the 6th Congress, Kim Il-sung attached more importance to relations with Third <b>World</b> <b>countries</b> than to unity in the socialist camp. Nevertheless, North Korea still received massive funds and aid from the Soviet bloc, the People's Republic of China and relations with the United States would remain bitterly cold. While North Korea argues that independence and proletarian internationalism are not exclusive, in orthodox communist theory they are.|$|E
