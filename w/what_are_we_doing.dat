500|$|A finger injury {{suffered}} {{during the}} 1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs hampered Oates throughout 1994–95 and required {{surgery at the}} season's conclusion. Despite the injury, Oates finished fourth in the NHL with 41 assists in a season disrupted by a work stoppage. The Bruins signed him to a five-year, $10 million contract extension late in that season, but Oates once again became frustrated with his salary relative {{to the rest of}} the league by 1997. [...] With the Bruins struggling on the ice and out of playoff contention late in 1996–97 season, Oates publicly berated team management: [...] "You go on a [...] trip and everyone says it's a big trip. For what? So we can win five games because we're lousy and we get in the eighth spot and lose four straight and get embarrassed and then get shelled all summer? It's upstairs, baby.

2500|$|When Randal {{enters the}} Quick Stop after closing RST, Dante attacks {{him and the}} two fight, making a mess of the store. Afterward, they {{lie on the floor}} exhausted. Dante claims that Randal does nothing for him but make his life miserable by getting him fined, {{offending}} his customers, and ruining his relationship. Randal loses his temper and verbally explodes, saying that Dante deserves the blame, as Dante, closed the store to play hockey, closed it again to go to the wake, and closed it yet again to try to hook up with his ex-girlfriend, cheating on his current one in the process. He then says that Dante came to work of his own free will and [...] "overcompensates for having a monkey's job". He claims Dante thinks he is more advanced than the customers and storms off with [...] "if we're so fucking advanced, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> working here?"

On April 16, 2011, she said Obama [...] "willfully ignored {{the will of the}} American people... when you got us into a third war for fuzzy and inconsistent reasons, a third war that we cannot afford." [...] She further criticized him on April 26, demanding Obama [...] "step up and justify our Libyan involvement, or Americans are going to demand you pull out." [...] She continued, [...] "Simply put, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> there? You’ve put us in a strategic no man’s land. If Gaddafi’s got to go, then tell NATO our continued participation hinges on this: We strike hard and Gaddafi will be gone. If, as you and your spokesmen suggest, we’re not to tell Libya what to do when it comes to that country’s leadership, and if you can’t explain to Americans why we’re willing to protect Libyan resources and civilians but not Syria’s, Yemen’s, Bahrain’s, Egypt’s, Israel’s, etc., then there is no justification for U.S. human and fiscal resources to be spent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{cast and}} crew members warned the {{audience}} of the graphic content of the episode. Prior to the episode's release, certain scenes {{were reported to have}} been cut from the official broadcast, having been deemed too disturbing. The scenes remaining in the episode have been met with comparable observations by the show's actors. Steven Yeun, who portrays Glenn Rhee, said: I remember a couple of scenes I would look over at {{what was going on in}} the scene and I would be like, ‘What the eff? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>doing?</b> How is this legal? It's grounded and real, too; it's not like torture or gore for no reason. It's literally, that is what would happen and we are trying to show it. It would not work on network television, let me tell you that. Lauren Cohan, who portrays Maggie Greene, made similar comments regarding the episode, saying some of the scenes were [...] "so disturbing", she did not think they would make it on TV. The series' composer, Bear McCreary, tweeted to parents of young children: [...] "Do not let children watch The Walking Dead tonight. Or ever again. I'm very serious", as he is aware of the show's younger fans. Despite his warning, McCreary said that [...] "No Sanctuary" [...] was his [...] "favorite episode in years, and, , the scariest score I've ever done." [...] Series creator and executive producer Robert Kirkman stated that the episode's opening presented to the audience the threat that the characters face, although he said, [...] " [...] actually adds a tremendous amount of value to the story, and so that’s what justifies these great lengths that we go to to, you know, disgust the audience." [...] Gimple said that there was concern of the graphic nature of the episode, but both he and the network eventually felt it was necessary for the episode's plot, and that it contained meaning within the story. He also stated that the disturbing acts of the people in Terminus was important to convey the terror of [...] "institutional evil", saying: ...|$|E

What are our great political societies but mere political inquisitions--our pot-house committees but little tribunals of denunciation--our newspapers but mere whipping-posts and pillories, where unfortunate individuals are pelted with rotten eggs--and our council of appointment but a grand auto-da-fe, where culprits are annually sacrificed for their political heresies? ...|$|E

60|$|Let me {{apply this}} {{question}} to one matter upon which England {{has certainly been}} profoundly in earnest during the last decade. We have been almost frantically resolved to keep the empire of the sea. But have we really done all {{that could have been}} done? I ask it with all diffidence, but has our naval preparation been free from a sort of noisy violence, a certain massive dullness of conception? Have we really made anything like a sane use of our resources? I do not mean of our resources in money or stuff. It is manifest that the next naval war will be beyond all precedent a war of mechanisms, giving such scope for invention and scientifically equipped wit and courage as the world has never had before. Now, have we really developed any considerable proportion of the potential human quality available to meet the demand for wits? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> to discover, encourage and develop those supreme qualities of personal genius that become more and more decisive with every new weapon and every new complication and unsuspected possibility it introduces? Suppose, for example, there was among us to-day a one-eyed, one-armed adulterer, rather fragile, prone to sea-sickness, and with just that one supreme quality of imaginative courage which made Nelson our starry admiral. Would he be given the ghost of a chance now of putting that gift at his country's disposal? I do not think he would, and I do not think he would because we underrate gifts and exceptional qualities, because there is no quickening appreciation for the exceptional best in a man, and because we overvalue the good behaviour, the sound physique, the commonplace virtues of mediocrity.|$|E
6000|$|It was true, {{she said}} to herself, that Mr. Casaubon had a debt to the Ladislaws--that he had to pay back what the Ladislaws had been wronged of. And now she {{began to think of}} her husband's will, which had been made {{at the time of their}} marriage, leaving the bulk of his {{property}} to her, with proviso in case of her having children. That ought to be altered; and no time ought to be lost. This very question which had just arisen about Will Ladislaw's occupation, was the occasion for placing things on a new, right footing. Her husband, she felt sure, according to all his previous conduct, would be ready to take the just view, if she proposed it--she, in whose interest an unfair concentration of the property had been urged. His sense of right had surmounted and would continue to surmount anything that might be called antipathy. She suspected that her uncle's scheme was disapproved by Mr. Casaubon, and this made it seem all the more opportune that a fresh understanding should be begun, so that instead of Will's starting penniless and accepting the first function that offered itself, he should find himself in possession of a rightful income which should be paid by her husband during his life, and, by an immediate alteration of the will, should be secured at his death. The vision of all this as what ought to be done seemed to Dorothea like a sudden letting in of daylight, waking her from her previous stupidity and incurious self-absorbed ignorance about her husband's relation to others. Will Ladislaw had refused Mr. Casaubon's future aid on a ground that no longer appeared right to her; and Mr. Casaubon had never himself seen fully what was the claim upon him. [...] "But he will!" [...] said Dorothea. [...] "The great strength of his character lies here. And <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> with our money? We make no use of half of our income. My own money buys me nothing but an uneasy conscience." ...|$|E

He is, we will suppose, {{temporarily}} unemployed through the production of a glut of coal, and he goes about the world trying to see the fine and noble collective achievements that justify the devotion of his whole life to humble toil. I ask the reader: What have we got to show that man? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> up in the light and air that justifies our demand that he should go on hewing in narrow seams and cramped corners until he can hew no more? Where is he to be taken to see these crowning fruits of our release from toil? Shall we take him to the House of Commons to note which of the barristers is making most headway over Welsh Disestablishment, or shall we take him to the Titanic inquiry to hear the latest about those fifty-five third-class children (out of eighty-three) who were drowned? Shall we give him an hour or so among the portraits at the Royal Academy, or shall we make an enthusiastic tour of London sculpture and architecture and saturate his soul with the beauty he makes possible? The new Automobile Club, for example. [...] "Without you and your subordination we could not have had that." [...] Or suppose we took him the round of the West-End clubs and restaurants and made him estimate how many dinners London can produce at a pinch at the price of his local daily minimum, say, and upward; or borrow an aeroplane at Hendon and soar about counting all the golfers in the Home Counties on any week-day afternoon. [...] "You suffer at the roots of things, far below there, but see all this nobility and splendour, these sweet, bright flowers to which your rootlet life contributes."
