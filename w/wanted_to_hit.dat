5|$|Since {{it never}} reached a target, the exact place {{intended}} {{to be hit by}} Flight93 has never been decisively confirmed. Before the attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and Mohammed Atef developed a list of potential targets. Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed wanted to strike the World Trade Center and all three <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden told 9/11 planner Ramzi bin al-Shibh to advise Mohamed Atta that he preferred the White House over the Capitol as a target. Atta cautioned bin al-Shibh that this would be difficult, but agreed to include the White House as a possible target and suggested they keep the Capitol as an alternative in case the White House proved too difficult. Eventually, Atta told bin al-Shibh that Jarrah planned to hit the Capitol. Atta briefly mentioned the possibility of striking a nuclear facility, but balked after the other attack pilots voiced their opposition. Based on an exchange between Atta and bin al-Shibh two days before the attacks, the White House would be the primary target for the fourth plane and the Capitol the secondary target.|$|E
5|$|Vann {{wanted to}} use a C-47 flare plane to {{illuminate}} the rice fields on the eastern flank of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the Viet Cong with 500 rounds of artillery and destroy them as they retreated. Cao would not approve the use of flares because it could expose the airborne battalion's night defensive positions, and instead ordered 100 rounds of artillery to be fired {{at a rate of}} four shells per hour. At 22:00, Viet Cong commander Hoang led his two companies out of Ap Tan Thoi and headed for their base camp in the Plain of Reeds, while the local force units left by a different route for their hideouts in the local area. The 1st Company, 261st Battalion, led the column, followed by litter carriers carrying the dead and wounded. The 1st Company, 514th Battalion, covered the tail of the formation, with one of their platoons acting as a rear guard. The wounded Viet Cong soldiers were transferred onto sampans at the canal {{on the east side of}} Ap Tan Thoi, while the rest of the formation marched on. At 07:00 on 3 January, Hoang's men successfully reached their destination without being detected.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike most tennis games, Dream Match Tennis is {{controlled}} primarily {{through the use}} of [...] rather than simply the directional buttons. If a player <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> a cross-court shot, they have <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the ball slightly early. If they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the ball in the opposite direction, they have <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> it slightly later (i.e., when it's going behind the player's character). The directional buttons can be used to get extra angle or direction; for instance, the downwards directional button makes the ball go short, and is useful for hitting angled cross-court shots.|$|R

500|$|Fraser and Navarro {{write that}} {{toward the end}} of her life, Evita was working as many as 20 to 22 hours per day in her foundation, often {{ignoring}} her husband's request that she cut back on her workload and take the weekends off. The more she worked with the poor in her foundation, the more she adopted an outraged attitude toward the existence of poverty, saying, [...] "Sometimes I have wished my insults were slaps or lashes. I've <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> people in the face to make them see, if only for a day, what I see each day I help the people." [...] Crassweller writes that Evita became fanatical about her work in the foundation and felt on a crusade against the very concept and existence of poverty and social ills. [...] "It is not surprising", writes Crassweller, [...] "that as her public crusades and her private adorations took on a narrowing intensity after 1946, they simultaneously veered toward the transcendental." [...] Crassweller compares Evita to Ignatius Loyola, saying she came to be akin to a one-woman Jesuit Order.|$|E
500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E
2500|$|As it was, the [...] "short porch" [...] in {{left field}} looked {{attractive}} to batters. In {{the first week of}} play during the 1959 season, the media's worst preseason fears seemed to be realized when 24 home runs were hit in the Coliseum, three of them by Chicago Cubs outfielder Lee Walls, not especially distinguished as a hitter. But pitchers soon adapted, throwing outside to right-handed hitters, requiring them to pull the bat hard if they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> toward left. Perhaps no player took better advantage than Dodgers outfielder Wally Moon, who figured out how to hit high fly balls that dropped almost vertically just behind the screen. By season's end, he had hit 19 homers, all but 5 of them in the Coliseum. In recognition, such homers were dubbed [...] "Moon Shots." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cao Cao's general Yu Jin was {{captured}} by Guan Yu during the Battle of Fancheng and was held captive in Nan Commandery. After Sun Quan seized control of Nan Commandery, he released Yu Jin and treated him with respect. One day, when Sun Quan travelling on horseback, he asked Yu Jin to ride beside him. Yu Fan saw that and shouted at Yu Jin, [...] "You're a surrendered prisoner-of-war. How dare you ride side-by-side with my lord!" [...] He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> Yu Jin with his horsewhip but Sun Quan ordered him to stop. Later, when Yu Jin joined Sun Quan in a feast with his subjects on board a ship, he shed tears when he heard music being played. Yu Fan mocked him, [...] "Are you trying to pretend to plead for mercy?" [...] Sun Quan was very unhappy with Yu Fan.|$|E
2500|$|When {{approaching}} the fanfare, Tyler looked {{not just at}} the films, but [...] "Marvel as a whole...going {{all the way back}} from The Human Torch through" [...] the comics. Because [...] "there was very little time for the listener or the viewer to really hone in on what's there musically", Tyler [...] "needed something that could be played a little bit more simply as a melody. Then all the orchestrationâ€”you know, I wrote these string lines that are actually, have kind of a fantastical, more complex nature to it. That just supports a melody that is more of a whistler." [...] Marvel agreed with this approach, and worked with Tyler to hone the orchestration; [...] "as the graphics were being done we really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> little moments with some sparkly shimmer and get it more specific." [...] The main melody remained unchanged from Tyler's initial composition.|$|E
2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> over the top, he just looked at me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E

She hated him {{so that she would}} even lower her pride to take such a man as me into her confidence if she could gain her end by doing so.

6000|$|Things do go so contrary-like with me. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> upon an {{especially}} novel, out-of-the-way subject {{for one of}} these articles.

[...] And I went about for days, trying to think of something of this kind; and I couldn't. And Mrs. Cutting, our charwoman, came yesterday--I don't mind mentioning her name, because I know she will not see this book. She would not look at such a frivolous publication. She never reads anything but the Bible and Lloyd's Weekly News. All other literature she considers unnecessary and sinful.|$|E

2500|$|... "If {{he finds}} the crowd harsh here then he must {{remember}} he asked for it." [...] said Jeremy Coney. [...] "But crowds just can't be neutral about him", he said. Some applaud his behaviour and others didn't. His behaviour polarises the crowds here and he must expect some sort of reaction from those who don't like it. I just feel neutral about him â€“ when he is batting I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get rid of him, when he is bowling I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> him around the park." ...|$|R

You'd only cut me and make me angry, besides exhausting all your strength at one gasp. Whereas, if you took it easy--like this--" [...] Here he made a light step forward and placed his open palm gently against the breast of Lncian, who instantly reeled back as if the piston-rod of a steam-engine had touched him, and dropped into the chair.|$|E
60|$|He had {{all those}} violent adjuncts to speech we Western Europeans have abandoned, shruggings of the shoulders, waving of the arms, {{thrusting}} {{out of the}} face, wonderful grimaces and twiddlings of the hands under your nose until you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> them away. Day after day it went on, and I had to keep any anger to myself, to reserve myself for the time ahead {{when it would be}} necessary to see the quap was got aboard and stowed--knee deep in this man's astonishment. I knew he would make a thousand objections to all we had before us. He talked like a drugged man. It ran glibly over his tongue. And all the time one could see his seamanship fretting him, he was gnawed by responsibility, perpetually uneasy about the ship's position, perpetually imagining dangers. If a sea hit us exceptionally hard he'd be out of the cabin in an instant making an outcry of inquiries, and he was pursued by a dread of the hold, of ballast shifting, of insidious wicked leaks. As we drew near the African coast his fear of rocks and shoals became infectious.|$|E

50|$|The song has a {{distinctive}} leitmotif played throughout on the keyboards, {{backed by a}} heavy bass riff which repeats throughout the song.

The song features a guitar and keyboard solo played in the call and response style during its climactic bridge before reprising its elongated chorus.|$|R

60|$|The field grew tolerably quiet just then. The Rube did not exert himself. The {{critical}} stage had {{no concern}} for him. He pitched Lane a high curve, over the plate, but in close, a ball meant <b>to</b> be <b>hit</b> and a ball hard <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> safely. Lane knew {{that as well}} as any hitter in the world, so he let two of the curves go by--two strikes. Again the Rube relentlessly gave him the same ball; and Lane, hitting viciously, spitefully, because he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> that kind of a ball, sent up a fly that Rand easily captured.|$|R
