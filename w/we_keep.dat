25|$|A very {{different}} kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.|$|E

[...] For the next several days, Bastogne was defended by the 101st, along with elements of CCR and some corps artillery assets that Middleton was able to supply. McAuliffe had units scattered in towns surrounding Bastogne, which bore the brunt of attacks by the Panzer Lehr Division and Second Panzer Division. At one point on 19 December, some of McAuliffe's units wanted to fall back, and McAuliffe concurred, calling Middleton for his approval. Middleton's response was, [...] "we can't hold Bastogne if <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> falling back" [...] and the units were ordered to stay.|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were more}} cautionary; the New York Times wrote that [...] "the {{aim of the}} filmmaker seems unclear, with Magdalena at first celebrated for her humanness and then exalted for her sudden saintliness" [...] and {{describing}} the story as [...] "wearyingly eventful". The Manila Bulletin noted that while the film is about belief (or lack thereof) in miracles, [...] "the effort to explore this issue is not brought into fulfilling fruition. <b>We</b> <b>keep</b> on hoping something else more significant would happen later in the film to invoke the viewers own feelings about faith and an all-seeing, all-merciful God, but this never comes".

John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout called it [...] "a song about the preverbial merry go round we feel like we're on when <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> committing the same sins over and over".

500|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, Taylor decided to remove the Kazon as the series' primary antagonists, having found the effort to develop the alien species to be unsuccessful. She felt that they never grew into a {{compelling}} adversary, despite their appearances in multiple episodes. Taylor argued that the Kazon limited the potential of the series, saying: [...] "It created the curious implication that we are standing still in space, when our franchise is that we are going at incredible speeds toward the Alpha Quadrant – <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> running into the same people over and over again! It was just an oddity, and I don't think the Kazon have served us well." [...] While discussing their role in the future episodes, she explained that it was her [...] "intention to leave them behind and to find new and I hope more interesting aliens".|$|E
500|$|Chris Robinson and Robb Buono, the film's {{production}} designer, {{decided that}} the script was composed of two distinct parts— {{the reality of the}} teens' lives and the time they spent at the skating rink. According to Buono, [...] "we wanted to look at it [...] through rose colored glasses, because when you think back on your memories of that time period— no matter what age you are— you see everything bigger. Our goal was to make that roller skating rink a character that grows as <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> coming back, and each time it’s more magical— a Saturday Night Fever-like contrast to the reality of life.” Robinson and Buono chose to shoot at the Cascade Family Skating Rink in Atlanta after visiting and witnessing the energy and excitement of the rink. However, the filmmakers felt Cascade's interior design was too bland and decided it should be redesigned.|$|E
500|$|Johnson was {{candid about}} his performance: [...] "We had a decent car and {{ran in the}} top five and top 10 but just didn't end up {{finishing}} there."

500|$|Designers {{improved}} on {{the design}} of the Batsuit from Batman Begins, adding wide elastic banding to help bind the costume to Bale, and suggest more sophisticated technology. It was constructed from 200 individual pieces of rubber, fiberglass, metallic mesh, and nylon. The new cowl was modeled after a motorcycle helmet and separated from the neck piece, allowing Bale to turn his head left and right and nod up and down. The cowl is equipped to show white lenses over the eyes when the character turns on his sonar detection, which gives Batman the white eyed look from the comics and animation. The gauntlets have retractable razors which can be fired. Though the new costume is eight pounds heavier, Bale found it more comfortable and not as hot to wear. The depiction of Gotham City is less gritty than in Batman Begins. [...] "I've tried to unclutter the Gotham we created on the last film," [...] said production designer Nathan Crowley. [...] "Gotham is in chaos. <b>We</b> <b>keep</b> blowing up stuff, so we can keep our images clean." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's only one thing I really feel that is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E
