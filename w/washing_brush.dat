40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{establish}} the answer to a clinical question regarding the effectiveness of preoperative hygiene with hand <b>washing</b> <b>brush</b> or without it. This first technique has been performed on the skin to reduce transient bacteria and to inhibit the growth of resident microorganisms as a common and required act before any surgical procedure. Despite this measure and others such as prophylactic antibiotics, the main operative complication continues to be the surgical wound infection. Today, it is as prevalent as in the past with the consequent negative effects derived from it, both for the institutions and for patients. Being controversial today which one is the most effective and safe surgical hand washing method for the binomial: professional surgical team/ patient, this study is done under the criteria of the Evidence-Based Nursing. A question was built in PICO format (Personal, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome). After this is done, continues information search in the databases GOOGLE ACADÉMICO, Pub Med, Cochrane y Base de Datos para la Investigación en Enfermería (BDIE) We obtained 20 articles related to the topic of them 8, which fulfilled the set CASPe criteria to answer the clinical question, were analyzed. We conclude that washing hands with a brush is equally effective as without brush technique in terms of decreased of the superficial skin bacterial flora, although this technique has advantages over the traditional practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} accuracy {{attained with}} the use of transbronchial fine needle aspiration biopsy, aspiration of bronchial secretion, bronchial <b>washing,</b> <b>brush</b> biopsy and forceps biopsy via a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was compared in patients with carcinoma of the lung. In endoscopic visible tumours the sensitivity of forceps biopsy was higher than that of the other methods. When forceps biopsy was combined with bronchial washing the overall diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher than that of any of the single methods, while no appreciable increase was obtained by adding additional methods. Selective brush biopsy from every segment bronchus has been established as a method in the search for occult bronchial carcinoma. The extent of respiratory mucosal damage and wound healing after brush biopsy was therefore studied in rabbits. Large differences in the extension and depth of the damage was observed. The basement membrane was often penetrated. Regeneration started during the first day after brush biopsy and a normal ciliated epithelium was restored within three weeks. To determine if the bronchoscope itself damaged the respiratory epithelium, bronchial mucosa was studied in the pig after examination with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. The columnar epithelial cells were torn off in areas where the bronchoscope had rubbed against the airway wall but the basement membrane was not damaged. Since the function of the respiratory epithelium is to remove inhaled particles from the airways, mucociliary clearance was studied in man after fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The study suggests that the tracheobronchial clearance system has a large reserve for mechanical trauma. Mucociliary clearance can however be decreased after fiberoptic bronchoscopy in some patients. An increasing number of patients with impaired cardiopulmonary function are today subjected to examination with flexible fiberoptic broncoscopy. The haemodynamic effects of fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed under topical anaesthesia were therefore studied in patients with restrictive lung disease. The procedure induced marked haemodynamic changes during passage of the larynx and during suctioning. A slight fall in arterial oxygen tension was observed during bronchial suctioning and in the post-bronchoscopic period. Three of ten patients developed ST-T-segment changes during bronchial suctioning. S. 1 - 48 : sammanfattning, s. 49 - 126 : 5 uppsatser digitalisering@umu. s...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{is still}} {{disagreement}} {{as to the}} value and reliability of <b>wash</b> and <b>brush</b> cytology, in comparison with histology, for the diagnosis of malignancy at flexible bronchoscopy. The present study compares the yield and concordance of findings from the two modalities for visible tumours at flexible bronchoscopy. A single-centre study of 514 consecutive flexible bronchoscopy procedures, in which a lesion suspicious of cancer was seen and bronchial <b>wash</b> cytology, <b>brush</b> cytology and forceps biopsy samples were taken. All equivocal or suspicious results were taken as negative. An overall yield of 89 · 3 % was achieved {{using a combination of}} all three tests. This was greater for endobronchial than submucosal (95 %vs. 86 %) tumours. Cytology alone diagnosed 17 · 7 % of cases. Use of all three modalities allowed tumours to be differentiated between small and non-small cell types in all but 5 / 459 positive cases (98 · 9 %). There were only 3 / 313 cases in which there was a difference in cell type (small cell vs. non-small cell) between the two modalities. We conclude that <b>wash</b> and <b>brush</b> cytology are valuable tools, in addition to forceps biopsy, at flexible bronchoscopy. All three tests should be performed routinely in cases of suspected malignancy...|$|R
