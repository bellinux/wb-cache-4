500|$|Drummer Shannon Larkin said of {{the album}} [...] "I'm proud of that one. That was a killer record. Producer Ross Robinson is very {{demanding}} {{when it comes to}} drums in the studio. Everything had to be 110% for that guy, and I love him for that." [...] Vanilla Ice stated of working with Robinson, [...] "The vibe was totally so cool. We had the album finished in {{a month and a half}} because <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> vibe." ...|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{traveled}} {{to face the}} Los Angeles Rams on November 11, winning 31–7 in front of 64,632 fans at Anaheim Stadium and led by Simms' efficient passing. The Rams had beaten the Giants {{three times in the}} past two years, including a win in the 1989 playoffs. Although the Giants were able to sack Rams quarterback Jim Everett just twice, they limited him to 17-of-36 passing for 186yards, no touchdowns and three interceptions. [...] "It's hard to sack him", Belichick said. [...] "But <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> pressure on. We had the same coverage we used the last eight years. Nothing radically different." ...|$|E
500|$|Orci also said, [...] "The comic has {{the themes}} of enemies uniting to fight a common enemy and has the setting of that {{specific}} time period, so <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> inspiration from all of that. In terms of {{the specifics of the}} story and who these characters are, we wanted the audience to be surprised and to not feel like they've already seen everything if they were fans of the comic. So, while the themes and the setting and many of the elements are a great inspiration, the story is completely adapted and translated for live action." [...] The aliens were loosely based on the Anunnaki gods of Zecharia Sitchin's interpretation of the Babylonian religion, who have a distinct interest in gold.|$|E

500|$|McCready said, [...] "I'd {{sum it up}} {{as kind of a}} tight, concise, rock 'n' roll {{record with}} kind of pop or maybe new wave {{elements}} to it... It's a really quick record, but I like that element to it. I like the sparseness of the songs and the way that Brendan pulled us together and made us play as good as we could." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that [...] "prior to Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn't or couldn't have made music this unfettered, unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun." [...] Vedder stated, [...] "The new record feels good so far—really strong and uptempo, stuff we can sink our teeth into", and added that the band's live performances inspired the album's sound: [...] "At one of our gigs, without flashpots and electricity, there's only so much room for those difficult listening songs. That's one reason <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> arrangements lean." [...] The singer cited Guided by Voices as a reference in creating the shorter and faster songs of Backspacer. Gossard said that Backspacer is [...] "what we could have done for the last five records, in terms of re-engaging with the roots of why this band works", and that [...] "there's plenty of ballads, too... and there's some shifts in how Jeff and Matt and I are all relating—I think this record's got a chance to sound significantly different." [...] Ament said, [...] "There's a couple of great things that Ed brought in that could be real departures for us. Whatever wave Ed caught with [...] Into the Wild has taken him to different places." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Fig.nbsp&2, the magenta curve {{shows how}} the spatial vectors [...] are {{spinning}} about [...] (which is suppressed in the figure since the Z coordinate is inessential). [...] That is, the vectors [...] are not Fermi–Walker transported along the world line, so the Langevin frame is spinning as well as non-inertial. [...] In other words, in our straightforward derivation of the Langevin frame, <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> frame aligned with the radial coordinate basis vector [...] [...] By introducing a constant rate rotation of the frame carried by each Langevin observer about , we could, if we wished [...] "despin" [...] our frame to obtain a gyrostabilized version.|$|E
2500|$|This time, Wagner {{could not}} be stifled as he outhit Cobb, [...]333 to [...]231, and stole six bases, {{establishing}} the new Series record. The speed demon Cobb only managed two steals, one of which Cobb himself admitted was a botched call. Wagner recounted: [...] "We had him out at second. We put up a squawk, but Silk O'Loughlin, the umpire, overruled it. <b>We</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> squawk going {{for a minute or}} so, making no headway of course, and then Cobb spoke up. He turned to O'Loughlin, an American League umpire, by the way, and said, 'Of course I was out. They had me by a foot. You just booted the play, so come on, let's play ball.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Davidson had {{the actors}} {{who played in}} Eddie's band rehearse {{as if they were}} getting ready for a real concert. Pare remembers, [...] "The first time we played {{together}} - as a band - was a college concert. An odd thing happened. At first, the extras simply did what they were told. Then, as the music heated up, so did the audience. They weren't play-acting anymore. The screaming, stomping and applause became spontaneous." [...] Davidson recalls, [...] "One by one, kids began standing up in their seats, screaming and raising their hands in rhythmic applause. A few girls made a dash for the stage, tearing at Michael's shirt. We certainly hadn't told them to do that. But <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> cameras rolling." [...] Additionally, New Jersey musician Southside Johnny was hired as a technical advisor for the film.|$|E
2500|$|India Today {{reported}} that the two flats were RAW safe houses used as operational fronts for Mossad agents and housed Mossad's station chief between 1989 and 1992. RAW had reportedly decided to have closer ties to Mossad, and the subsequent secret operation was approved by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. India Today cites [...] "RAW insiders" [...] as saying that RAW agents hid a Mossad agent holding an Argentine passport and exchanged intelligence and expertise in operations, including negotiations {{for the release of}} an Israeli tourist by the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front militants in June 1991. When asked about the case Verma refused to speak about the companies, but claimed his relationship with them was purely professional. Raman stated, [...] "Sometimes, spy agencies float companies for operational reasons. All I can say is that everything was done with government approval. Files were cleared by the then prime minister [...] and his cabinet secretary. Balachandran stated, [...] "It is true that we did a large number of operations but at every stage, <b>we</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet Secretariat and the prime minister in the loop." ...|$|E
