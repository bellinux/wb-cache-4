500|$|In the Time interview, Cada {{expressed}} {{his thoughts on}} legislation related to the legality of gambling: [...] "I support the right to play poker online. Poker isn't gambling. It's a hobby, an activity, a game. It's not about luck—it's about logic, decision-making, math. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>should</b> {{be able to play}} poker on the Web if we want to, and I believe that making it illegal strips us of our rights. This is an important issue, and hopefully we'll see it resolved soon." [...] Outside of poker, Cada also plays indoor soccer. , he was considering purchasing a second home in Las Vegas, Nevada and possibly opening a bar.|$|E
2500|$|Cold 187um's {{association}} with Insane Clown Posse was criticized by both fans of West Coast hip hop and Juggalos. Cold 187um {{responded to the}} criticism, stating [...] "The Only Solution project was an innovative good idea between myself and Violent J, but everyone is so damn opinionated these days and not going {{with the idea of}} the artist’s creativity, the project was harder than it needed to be. We are all independent, we are all against mainstream music, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>should</b> have been one not separate. That goes for both Juggalos and my West Coast Hip Hop fans. We might come from different places but we are all on the same side, fighting the same fight. It’s like anything else in life, if there is no unity the real enemy will always win. End of story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the shootings of Castile and Alton Sterling, President Barack Obama did {{not comment on the}} {{specific}} incidents, but called on the U.S. to [...] "do better" [...] and said that controversial incidents arising from the police use of force were [...] "not isolated incidents" [...] but rather were [...] "symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system". Obama expressed [...] "extraordinary appreciation and respect {{for the vast majority of}} police officers" [...] and noted the difficult nature of the job. He stated, [...] "When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our citizenry that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same, and that hurts, and that should trouble all of us. This is not just a black issue, not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>should</b> care about." [...] Obama telephoned Castile's mother to offer his condolences.|$|E

2500|$|The team's lockout-shortened 50-game 1998–99 season {{included}} a brief {{stint as a}} player by Dennis Rodman, the firing of head coach Harris, and the interim head coaching stint of former Laker player Kurt Rambis. During the lockout, O'Neal, Bryant, Derek Fisher, and Corie Blount played a two-on-two basketball game. Bryant was always a physical player during practice. Other players, though, disliked Bryant's approach to practice. Fisher said, [...] "That was really the way <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>should</b> have been playing. With Kobe's spirit." [...] During the game, O'Neal slapped Bryant. Fisher said neither O'Neal nor Bryant really started it, as they were both being physical. During the season, the team would blame their problems on what they felt was Bryant's selfish play. At one point, O'Neal pointed at Bryant and told reporters in the locker room, [...] "There's the problem." [...] Bryant's jerseys were outselling O'Neal's in Southern California sporting goods stores, and rumors started that O'Neal was jealous, as he was with Penny Hardaway when they played together in Orlando. [...] "That's far from the truth", said Fisher. [...] "All Shaq {{wants to do is}} win." [...] Asked if he helped Bryant through his growing pains, O'Neal said [...] "I try not to help guys out too much. Experience is the best teacher ... Kobe's a great player ... He's a new, up-and-coming kid." [...] O'Neal thought Rambis favored Bryant. Rambis asked O'Neal, the veteran team leader, to heal the rift and reach out to Bryant. Rambis said O'Neal gave him a [...] "blank, cold stare." [...] The rift between O'Neal and Bryant continued into the playoffs. While the Lakers defeated the Houston Rockets {{in the first round of}} that year's NBA Playoffs, they were ultimately swept 4–0 by the San Antonio Spurs in the second round.|$|E
