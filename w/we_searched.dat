500|$|Early in 1918, Hemingway {{responded to}} a Red Cross {{recruitment}} effort in Kansas City and signed on to become an ambulance driver in Italy. He left New York in May and arrived in Paris as the city was under bombardment from German artillery. By June, {{he was at the}} Italian Front. It was probably around this time that he first met John Dos Passos, with whom he had a rocky relationship for decades. On his first day in Milan, he was sent to the scene of a munitions factory explosion, where rescuers retrieved the shredded remains of female workers. He described the incident in his non-fiction book Death in the Afternoon: [...] "I remember that after <b>we</b> <b>searched</b> quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments". A few days later, he was stationed at Fossalta di Piave.|$|E
500|$|... "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] {{has strong}} autobiographical elements. During World War I, Hemingway {{signed on as}} a member of the Red Cross at age 19, [...] and was sent to the Italian Front at Fossalta as an {{ambulance}} driver. On his first day there, he helped to retrieve the remains of female workers killed in a munitions factory explosion, about which he later wrote in Death in the Afternoon: [...] "I remember that after <b>we</b> <b>searched</b> quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments". A few days later, on July8, 1918, he was severely wounded when a mortar bomb exploded between his legs. He was sent to a hospital in Milan where he recuperated for six months; after his return home, he went on a week-long fishing and camping trip in September 1919 with two high school friends to the backcountry near Seney in Michigan's Upper Peninsula—a trip that became the inspiration for [...] "Big Two-Hearted River". The manuscript shows the use of plural pronouns, suggesting that in an early version more characters were included, but by publication any mention of his friends or the townspeople had been removed—leaving Nick alone in the woods.|$|E

We extract local features and <b>we</b> <b>search</b> for co-occurrence of hand shape features. Co-occurrence of many local features is high ability to describe a specific shape. It is difficult to search all combinations of co-occurrence because {{there are too many}} varieties of combinations of co-occurrence. Instead of searching all co-occurrence combinations, <b>we</b> take hierarchical <b>search</b> strategy. <b>We</b> start from <b>searching</b> for co-occurrence of pairs of local features.

2500|$|Amal Saad-Ghorayeb, a Shiite {{scholar and}} {{assistant}} professor at the Lebanese American University has written that Hezbollah is not Anti-Zionist, but rather Anti-Jewish. She quoted Hassan Nasrallah as saying: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>searched</b> the entire world for a person more cowardly, despicable, weak and feeble in psyche, mind, ideology and religion, we would not find anyone like the Jew. Notice, I do not say the Israeli." [...] Regarding the official public stance of Hezbollah as a whole, she said that while Hezbollah, [...] "tries to mask its anti-Judaism for public-relations reasons ... a study of its language, spoken and written, reveals an underlying truth." [...] In her book Hezbollah: Politics & Religion, she argues that Hezbollah [...] "believes that Jews, by the nature of Judaism, possess fatal character flaws". Saad-Ghorayeb also said, [...] "Hezbollah's Quranic reading of Jewish history has led its leaders to believe that Jewish theology is evil." ...|$|E

As soon as I saw the body clearly I knew who it was. I used to be a fan, it's difficult to put my feelings into words. The scene was horrific in that corner of the room. I saw him lying there and thought what a pity it all was. I deal with many fires but this one was like walking down memory lane. We managed to salvage all his guitars and musical equipment. I feel a bit upset, all the firemen do. It was like seeing part of our lives gone forever." [...] – (Fire Officer) ...|$|E

He knows how to recognize great music that's not his. He knows how to utilize great sounds and great music. So before I met him, I had the utmost respect for Kanye West.

40|$|Book synopsis: Over {{a century}} ago, William James {{proposed}} that people search through memory {{much as they}} rummage through a house looking for lost keys. We scour our environments for territory, food, mates, and information. <b>We</b> <b>search</b> for items in visual scenes, for historical facts, and for the best deals on Internet sites; <b>we</b> <b>search</b> for new friends to add to our social networks, and for solutions to novel problems. What we find is always governed by how <b>we</b> <b>search</b> and by {{the structure of the}} environment. This book explores how <b>we</b> <b>search</b> for resources in our minds and in the world. The authors examine the evolution and adaptive functions of search; the neural underpinnings of goal-searching mechanisms across species; psychological models of search in memory, decision making, and visual scenes; and applications of search behavior in highly complex environments such as the Internet. As the range of information, social contacts, and goods continues to expand, how well we are able to search and successfully find what we seek becomes increasingly important. At the same time, search offers cross-disciplinary insights to the scientific study of human cognition and its evolution. Combining perspectives from researchers across numerous domains, this book furthers our understanding of the relationship between search and the human mind...|$|R
