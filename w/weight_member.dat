40|$|AbstractHuman cystatin C (HCC) {{is a low}} {{molecular}} <b>weight</b> <b>member</b> of the cystatin family (type 2). HCC consists of 120 amino acids. Normally it is an inhibitor of cysteine proteases, but in pathological conditions it forms amyloid fibrils in brain arteries of young adults. An ‘aggregation-prone’ pentapeptide (47 LQVVR 51) was located within the HCC sequence using AmylPred, an ‘aggregation-prone’ peptide prediction algorithm developed in our lab. This peptide was synthesized and self-assembled into amyloid-like fibrils in vitro, as electron microscopy, X-ray fiber diffraction, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier-Transform Spectroscopy and Congo red staining studies reveal. Thus, the 47 LQVVR 51 peptide seems to {{have an important role}} in HCC fibrillization...|$|E

The incompressible liquid states when described on a sphere are fully invariant under the rotation group. Excited quasiparticle/quasihole states are member of multiplets under the rotation group and generically there is a nontrivial highest <b>weight</b> <b>member</b> of the multiplet from which all states can be constructed. Some of the trial states proposed in the literature belong to classical families of symmetric polynomials. In this paper we study Macdonald and Jack polynomials that are highest weight states. For Macdonald polynomials it is a (q,t) -deformation of the raising angular momentum operator that defines the highest weight condition. By specialization of the parameters we obtain a classification of the highest weight Jack polynomials. Our results are valid {{in the case of}} staircase and rectangular partition indexing the polynomials. Comment: 17 pages, published versio...|$|E
40|$|FKBP 51 (FKBP 5 Official Symbol) {{is large}} {{molecular}} <b>weight</b> <b>member</b> of the FK 506 binding protein family, a subfamily of the immunophilin proteins. FKBP 51 exerts multiple biological {{functions in the}} cell, including modulation of steroid hormone response, immune regulation, cell proliferation, regulation of pAkt levels and control of NF-κB activation. Several lines of evidence support a role for this protein in cancer biology, especially in resistance to chemo- and radio-therapy. Recent research studies highlighted functions of FKBP 51 in promoting the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) transdifferentiation program in melanoma. This process, which is classically regulated by Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) -β, enables cancer cells to disseminate from primary tumors and spread to distant locations, acquiring resistance to therapy and self-renewal capability. This last, in turn, is crucial to their subsequent expansion at sites of dissemination. The aim of the present article is to review recent literature data that involve FKBP 51 in the mechanisms that switch the TGF-β from a tumor suppressor to a pro-metastatic invader...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Acanthamoeba myosin-IA and myosin-IB are {{single-headed}} molecular motors {{that may}} {{play an important}} role in membrane-based motility. To better define the types of motility that myosin-IA and myosin-IB can support, we determined the rate constants for key steps on the myosin-I ATPase pathway using fluorescence stopped-flow, cold-chase, and rapid-quench techniques. We determined the rate constants for ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, actomyosin-I dissociation, phosphate release, and ADP release. We also determined equilibrium constants for myosin-I binding to actin filaments, ADP binding to actomyosin-I, and ATP hydrolysis. These rate constants define an ATPase mechanism in which (a) ATP rapidly dissociates actomyosin-I, (b) the predominant steady-state intermediates are in a rapid equilibrium between actin-bound M YOSIN-I is the single-headed low molecular <b>weight</b> <b>member</b> of the myosin superfamily that has been proposed to mediate actin-dependent membrane-based motility (for review see Pollard et al., 1991; Cheney et al., 1993). This membrane-based motility may include (a) the rearrangement of the actin-rich cell cortex, and (b) the movement of organelles and membranes along actin filaments. In vitro motility assays have shown that membrane-bound myosin-I supports ATPdependent actin gliding. Localization and myosin-I knockout experiments suggest that unique myosin-I isoforms within a single cell may play specific roles in several actindependent membrane-based movements, including phagocytosis, pseudopod extension, contractile vacuole function, and directed organelle motility (Adams and Pollard, 1986...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the crystallization and structure elucidation of Arabidopsis thaliana allene oxide cyclase 2 (AOC 2), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of jasmonates. In a coupled reaction with allene oxide synthase, AOC 2 releases the first cyclic and biologically active metabolite, 12 -oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA). AOC 2 (AT 3 G 25770) folds into an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel with a C-terminal partial helical extension. The protein forms a hydrophobic binding cavity with two distinct polar patches. AOC 2 is trimeric in crystals, in vitro and in planta. Based on the observed folding pattern, we assigned AOC 2 as a low molecular <b>weight</b> <b>member</b> of the lipocalin family with enzymatic activity in plants. We determined the binding {{position of the}} competitive inhibitor vernolic acid (a substrate analog) in the binding pocket. Based on models for bound substrate 12, 13 -epoxy- 9, 11, 15 -octadecatrienoic acid and product OPDA, we propose a reaction scheme that explains {{the influence of the}} C 15 double bond on reactivity. Reaction is promoted by anchimeric assistance through a conserved Glu residue. The transition state with a pentadienyl carbocation and an oxyanion is stabilized by a strongly bound water molecule and favorable π–π interactions with aromatic residues in the cavity. Stereoselectivity results from steric restrictions to the necessary substrate isomerizations imposed by the protein...|$|E
40|$|A {{major effort}} within NASA's vehicle {{analysis}} discipline {{has been to}} automate structural analysis and sizing optimization during conceptual design studies of advanced spacecraft. Traditional spacecraft structural sizing has involved detailed finite element analysis (FEA) requiring large degree-of-freedom (DOF) finite element models (FEM). Creation and analysis of these models can be time consuming and limit model size during conceptual designs. The goal is to find an optimal design that meets the mission requirements but produces the lightest structure. A structural sizing tool called HyperSizer has been successfully used in the conceptual design phase of a reusable launch vehicle and planetary exploration spacecraft. The program couples with FEA to enable system level performance assessments and weight predictions including design optimization of material selections and sizing of spacecraft members. The software's analysis capabilities are based on established aerospace structural methods for strength, stability and stiffness that produce adequately sized members and reliable structural weight estimates. The software also helps to identify potential structural deficiencies early in the conceptual design so changes can be made without wasted time. HyperSizer's automated analysis and sizing optimization increases productivity and brings standardization to a systems study. These benefits will be illustrated in examining {{two different types of}} conceptual spacecraft designed using the software. A hypersonic air breathing, single stage to orbit (SSTO), reusable launch vehicle (RLV) will be highlighted as well as an aeroshell for a planetary exploration vehicle used for aerocapture at Mars. By showing the two different types of vehicles, the software's flexibility will be demonstrated with an emphasis on reducing aeroshell structural <b>weight.</b> <b>Member</b> sizes, concepts and material selections will be discussed as well as analysis methods used in optimizing the structure.

The method is addressed as a parameter estimation problem to weight the ensemble of precipitation forecasts carried out using different options of the convective parameterization scheme. Ensemble simulations were performed using different choices of closures, representing different formulations of dynamic control (the modulation of convection by the environment) {{in a deep}} convection scheme. The optimization problem is solved as an inverse problem of parameter estimation. The application and validation of the methodology is carried out using daily precipitation fields, defined over South America and obtained by merging remote sensing estimations with rain gauge observations.

To reduce the model rainfall biases, the set of weights determined by the algorithm is used to <b>weight</b> <b>members</b> of an ensemble of model simulations in order to compute a new precipitation field that represents the observed precipitation as closely as possible.
