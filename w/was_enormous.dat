5|$|Events in {{southern}} Britain to 796 have sometimes been {{portrayed as a}} struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity in their power <b>was</b> <b>enormous.</b> By 796 Charlemagne had become master of an empire which stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Hungarian Plain, and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{prosperity}} and cultural life, the Komnenian period {{was one of}} the peaks in Byzantine history, and Constantinople remained the leading city of the Christian world in size, wealth, and culture. There was a renewed interest in classical Greek philosophy, as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular Greek. Byzantine art and literature held a pre-eminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west during this period <b>was</b> <b>enormous</b> and of long lasting significance.|$|E

The Mansion House Scott Memorial Fund closed at £75,000 (2009 approximation £5.5million). This was not equally distributed; Scott's widow, son, mother and sisters received a total of £18,000 (£1.3 million). Wilson's widow got £8,500 (£600,000) and Bowers's mother £4,500 (£330,000). Edgar Evans's widow, children, and mother received £1,500 (£109,000) between them.|$|E

5|$|The {{value of}} the Admiralty Islands to the Allies <b>was</b> <b>enormous.</b> Their capture saved more lives than they cost by obviating the need to capture Truk, Kavieng, Rabaul, and Hansa Bay and thereby {{speeding}} up the Allied advance by several months. As an airbase, the Admiralties' value was great, for aircraft based there ranged over Truk, Wewak, and beyond. As a naval base, their value was greater still, as they combined a fleet anchorage with major facilities.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of resistance, {{in some places}} chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, <b>was</b> <b>enormous.</b> In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).|$|E
5|$|During {{his long}} and {{productive}} career, Arcadelt wrote music both sacred and secular, {{all of it}} vocal. He left a total of 24 motets, 125 French chansons, approximately 250 madrigals (about fifty of which are of uncertain attribution), three masses, as well as settings of the Lamentations of Jeremiah and the Magnificat. There may {{be as many as}} 250 more madrigals by Arcadelt which survive anonymously in manuscript sources. Influences on his music ranged from the chanson and polyphonic style of his northern homeland, the native secular music of Italy such as the frottola, and the music he heard while he served in the Sistine Chapel choir. Of all the early madrigalists, he was by far the most universal in his influences as well as his appeal; and his influence on others <b>was</b> <b>enormous.</b> Arcadelt brought the madrigal form to its early maturity.|$|E

5|$|From 1284 to 1330, when {{accounts}} end, between £20,000 and £25,000 {{was spent}} on Caernarfon's castle and town walls. Such a sum <b>was</b> <b>enormous</b> and dwarfed the spending on castles such as Dover and Château Gaillard, which were amongst the most expensive and impressive fortifications of the later 12th and early 13thcenturies. Subsequent additions to Caernarfon were not major, and {{what remains of the}} castle is substantially from the Edwardian period. Despite the expense, much of what was planned for the castle was never carried out. The rears of the King's Gate (the entrance from the town) and the Queen's Gate (the entrance from the south-east) were left unfinished, and foundations in the castle's interior mark where buildings would have stood had work continued.|$|E
5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number of possibilities <b>was</b> <b>enormous,</b> since there are many possibilities for each component of a reactor—fuel, coolant, moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the coolant may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the moderator may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, at the very beginning of nuclear power, we had to choose which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, it {{was during}} the Komnenian period that contact between Byzantium and the 'Latin' Christian West, {{including}} the Crusader states, was at its most crucial stage. Venetian and other Italian traders became resident in Constantinople and the empire in large numbers (60–80,000 'Latins' in Constantinople alone), and their presence together with the numerous Latin mercenaries who were employed by Manuel in particular helped to spread Byzantine technology, art, literature and culture throughout the Roman Catholic west. Above all, the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west at this period <b>was</b> <b>enormous</b> and of long lasting significance.|$|E

5|$|Operation Barbarossa was {{the largest}} {{military}} operation in human history — more men, tanks, guns and aircraft were committed than had ever been deployed before in a single offensive. The invasion opened up the Eastern Front of World War II, the largest theater of war during that conflict, and it witnessed clashes of unprecedented violence and destruction for four years {{that resulted in the}} deaths of more than 26 million Soviet people. More people died fighting on the Eastern Front than in all other fighting across the globe during World War II. Damage to both the economy and landscape <b>was</b> <b>enormous</b> for the Soviet Union as approximately 1,710 towns and 70,000 villages were razed.|$|E
5|$|The corpse rotted quickly; the {{surgeons}} {{of the hospital}} refused to dissect it.

At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach <b>was</b> <b>enormous,</b> covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} neighbour Mercia was, {{under the}} rule of kings Æthelbald, Offa and Coenwulf, the dominant kingdom in Anglo-Saxon England. Offa, the greatest of the three, ruled Mercia until 796, followed soon after by Coenwulf. Offa's dominance was secured in part by marriage alliances with the other major kingdoms: Beorhtric of Wessex and Æthelred of Northumbria were married to his daughters. Further afield, Charlemagne, the pre-eminent ruler in the Christian West, appears to have taken an active interest in Northumbrian affairs. Charlemagne initially ruled Francia and parts of Italy, but by 796 had become master of an empire which stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Hungarian Plain. He was a staunch defender of the Papacy, and in the popes and the church hierarchy he had allies whose influence extended to Northumbria and beyond. Events in southern Britain to 796 have sometimes been portrayed as a struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity in their power <b>was</b> <b>enormous,</b> and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.|$|E

5|$|The first Ju 88s {{took off}} at 23:00 and began {{heading toward the}} Dutch coast where they dived to sea level and stayed at {{approximately}} 50 metres while they flew out to sea. Crews were forbidden to engage enemy aircraft over the North Sea {{in order to preserve}} surprise until the last possible moment. The rain and squall assisted crews in judging the location and distance of the water. However, with crews prone to human error, it was decided to use the very accurate FuG 101 radar altimeter and the Ju 88s blind-flying instruments. The strain on the crews <b>was</b> <b>enormous,</b> as a careful vigil was kept on them until the British coast was reached and the pilot began his ascent to the height of the returning bomber stream. As they did so, the Ju 88s released Düppel to obscure the radar of Mosquito fighters. The pilots were then free to begin their attacks.|$|E
