40|$|Background The {{conventional}} {{method of}} attachment of prosthesis involves on a socket. A new method relying on osseointegrated fixation is emerging. It has significant prosthetic benefits. Only a few studies demonstrated the biomechanical benefits. Purpose The ultimate {{aim of this study}} was to characterise the functional outcome of transfemoral amputees fitted with osseointegrated fixation, which can be assess through temporal and spatial gait characteristics. The specific objective of this preliminary study was to present the key temporal and spatial gait characteristics. Methods Four male transfemoral amputees fitted with a fixation were asked to performe 3 trials of straight level walking. The speed of walking, cadence, duration of gait cycle, support and swing phases, length of stride and step, and <b>walking</b> <b>base</b> were extracted from displacements of foot markers using a 3 D motion analysis system recording at 200 Hz. Results The speed of walking and the cadence were 0. 81 ± 0. 16 m/s and 46. 03 ± 4. 70 steps/min, respectively. The duration of the gait cycles, support and swing phases were 1. 31 ± 0. 13 s, 0. 76 ± 0. 07 s and 0. 55 ± 0. 07 s, respectively. The stride and step length, and <b>walking</b> <b>base</b> were 1. 29 ± 0. 09 m, 0. 10 ± 0. 65 m and - 0. 09 ± 0. 138 m for the prosthetic leg, and 1. 31 ± 0. 07 m, 1. 00 ± 0. 64 m and 0. 11 ± 0. 12 m for the sound leg, respectively. Conclusion The results demonstrate that the amputees fitted with an osseointegrated fixation showed a highly functional walk compared to normative data presented in previous studies focusing on amputees fitted with a socket and able-bodied...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cerebellar Ataxias are a {{group of}} gait {{disorders}} resulting from dysfunction of the cerebellum, commonly characterised by slowly progressing incoordination that manifests as problems with balance and walking leading to considerable disability. There is increasing acceptance of gait analysis techniques to quantify subtle gait characteristics that are unmeasurable by current clinical methods This systematic review aims to identify the gait characteristics able to differentiate between Cerebellar Ataxia and healthy controls. METHODS: Following systematic search and critical appraisal of the literature, gait data relating to preferred paced walking in Cerebellar Ataxia was extracted from 21 studies. A random-effect model meta-analysis was performed for 14 spatiotemporal parameters. Quality assessment was completed to detect risk of bias. RESULTS: There is strong evidence that compared with healthy controls, Cerebellar Ataxia patients walk with a reduced walking speed and cadence, reduced step length, stride length, and swing phase, increased <b>walking</b> <b>base</b> width, stride time, step time, stance phase and double limb support phase with increased variability of step length, stride length, and stride time. CONCLUSION: The consensus description provided here, clarifies the gait pattern associated with ataxic gait disturbance in a large cohort of participants. High quality research and reporting is needed to explore specific genetic diagnoses and identify biomarkers for disease progression {{in order to develop}} well-evidenced clinical guidelines and interventions for Cerebellar Ataxia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper aims {{to further}} improve {{previously}} developed design for Acrobot <b>walking</b> <b>based</b> on partial exact feedback linearization of order 3. Namely, such an exact system transformation {{leads to an}} almost linear system where error dynamics along trajectory to be tracked is a 4 -dimensional linear time-varying system having 3 time-varying entries only, the remaining entries being either zero or one. In such a way, exponentially stable tracking {{can be obtained by}} quadratically stabilizing a linear system with polytopic uncertainty. The current improvement is based on applying LMI methods to solve this problem numerically. This careful analysis significantly improves previously known approaches. Numerical simulations of Acrobot <b>walking</b> <b>based</b> on the above mentioned LMI design are demonstrated as well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Compared {{to human}} {{locomotion}} capabilities, today’s bipedal robots are still lacking in efficiency, velocity, and robustness. Thus, a control concept for dynamic <b>walking</b> <b>based</b> on insights into human motion control is suggested. Key features include {{the exploitation of}} passive dynamics, no usage of a full dynamic model, and hierarchical, distributed control.

We examined the contributions of the sensory information from the force-sensitive afferents in the ankle extensor muscle and from the position-sensitive afferents from the hip, inspired by a neuro-mechanical simulation for the stepping of the hind legs of cats. Our simulation results showed that the sensory signals related to the force in the ankle extensor muscle make a larger contribution than sensory signals related to the joint angle at the hip to produce robust walking against disturbances, as observed in the simulation results of cat locomotion.
