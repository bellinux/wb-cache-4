500|$|In a September 1995 {{speech before}} the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued very forcefully against {{practices}} that abused <b>women</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{world and in}} the People's Republic of China itself, declaring that [...] "it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights". Delegates from over 180countries heard her say: [...] "If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all." [...] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks. The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later <b>women</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world would recite Clinton's key phrases. She {{was one of the}} most prominent international figures during the late 1990s to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.
