5|$|Fortifications such as this, and the star-shaped fortresses more {{commonly}} found in the flatter lands of the Dutch Provinces, increasingly made 16th-century warfare both difficult and expensive; victory <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> matter of winning a battle over the enemy's army. Victory required traveling from one fortified and armed city to another and investing time and money {{in one of two}} outcomes. Ideally, a show of extraordinary force convinced city leaders to surrender. If the show of force did not intimidate a city, the alternative was an expensive siege that reduced the city to rubble and ended with storming the ruins. In the case of the former, when a city capitulated, it would have to quarter troops at its own expense, called execution, but the soldiers would not be permitted to plunder. In the case of the latter, no quarter would be given to the defenders and the victorious soldiers were released to pillage, plunder, and sack.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{invasion}} of Ireland began between 1166 and 1171, under first Richard de Clare and then Henry II of England, with {{the occupation of}} southern and eastern Ireland {{by a number of}} Anglo-Norman barons. The rapid Norman success depended on key economic and military advantages, with castles enabling them to control the newly conquered territories. The new lords rapidly built castles to protect their possessions, many of these were motte-and-bailey constructions; in Louth at least 23 of these were built. It remains uncertain how many ringwork castles were built in Ireland by the Anglo-Normans. Other castles, such as Trim and Carrickfergus, were built in stone as the caput centres for major barons. Analysis of these stone castles suggests that building in stone <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> military decision; indeed, several of the castles contain serious defensive flaws. Instead the designs, including their focus on large stone keeps, were intended both to increase the prestige of the baronial owners and to provide adequate space for the administrative apparatus of the new territories. Unlike in Wales the indigenous Irish lords do not appear to have constructed their own castles in any significant number during the period.|$|E

25|$|Though {{some critics}} charged that Jewish {{interests}} were partially {{responsible for the}} push to war with Iraq, Jewish Americans were actually more strongly opposed to the Iraq war from its onset than any other religious group, or even most Americans. The greater {{opposition to the war}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> result of high Democratic identification among U.S. Jews, as Jews of all political persuasions were more likely to oppose the war than non-Jews who shared the same political leanings.|$|E

Also instrumental were new statistical methods developed by Emerson Seim for disentangling deceptive counter-effects that had resulted when numerous cities reacted to departures of a wealthier tax base by annexation. In other words, central cities had been bringing back their new suburbs, such that families that had departed from inner cities were not even being counted as having moved from the cities.|$|E

25|$|Yet law <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> {{matter of}} codes and procedures. Law was {{understood}} {{to reflect the}} moral universe, and a criminal or civil offense would throw that universe out of balance {{in a way that}} only just punishment could restore. The official Five Punishments (wu xing) prescribed under the Qing Code included beating with the light bamboo, beating with the heavy bamboo, penal servitude, exile, and execution. In calibrating punishment, the magistrate had to take into account not only the nature of the offense but the relation between the guilty party and the victim. An offense by a son against a father was far more serious than one by a father against a son, likewise an offense by a wife or other member of the family.|$|E
25|$|Djoser’s Step Pyramid complex {{has several}} {{structures}} pivotal to its function in both {{life and the}} afterlife. Several are discussed below with attention paid to function and form. The pyramid <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> grave in ancient Egypt. Its purpose was to facilitate a successful afterlife for the king {{so that he could}} be eternally reborn. The symbolism of the step pyramid form, which did not survive the 3rd Dynasty, is unknown, but {{it has been suggested that}} it may be a monumental symbol of the crown, especially the royal mortuary cult, since seven small step pyramids (not tombs) were built in the provinces. Another well accepted theory is that it facilitated the king’s ascension to join the eternal North Star.|$|E

He also became head of the Iași hygiene institute in 1930, {{and set up a}} tuberculosis sanatorium in nearby Erbiceni. He served as general secretary under Health Minister Cantacuzino, between 1931 and 1933. He wrote articles arguing that the high mortality rate in Romania's rural areas <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> matter of health, but had to do with lack of education, poverty, malnutrition, with political and administrative causes. Still a socialist, Slătineanu believed the 1923 land reform entrenched a form of neo-serfdom that did not address other issues plaguing the peasantry. He organized a model health system in Tomești plasă where he introduced various methods of health education. One of these consisted of a garden where the local peasants would learn how to cultivate vegetables with a rational system of nutrition in mind.|$|E

500|$|Monte Testaccio <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> {{haphazard}} waste dump; it was {{a highly}} organised and carefully engineered creation, presumably managed by a state administrative authority.

Empty amphorae were probably carried up the mound intact on the backs of donkeys or mules and then broken up on the spot, with the shards laid out in a stable pattern. Lime appears to have been sprinkled over the broken pots to neutralise the smell of rancid oil.|$|E
500|$|It was {{believed}} during {{the mid-19th century}} that wife selling was restricted to the lowest levels of labourers, especially to those living in remote rural areas, but {{an analysis of the}} occupations of husbands and purchasers reveals that the custom was strongest in [...] "proto-industrial" [...] communities. Of the 158cases in which occupation can be established, the largest group (19) was involved in the livestock or transport trades, fourteen worked in the building trade, five were blacksmiths, four were chimney-sweeps, and two were described as gentlemen, suggesting that wife selling <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> peasant custom.

500|$|In the 1970s, the occultist E.W.

According to Liddell's account—which has failed to receive any scholarly support—Pickingill {{was a member of a}} hereditary witch-cult, leading a Canewdon coven and forming nine other covens across southern England. Liddell claimed that Pickingill reformed the established English witch-cult by introducing new concepts from French and Danish witchcraft and from Classical sources, and that in doing so, Pickingill created the structure from which Gardnerian Wicca emerged in the 1950s. Prominent Wiccans Doreen Valiente and Lois Bourne have expressed criticism of his claims, which have also been rejected as spurious by such historians and scholars of religion as Maple, Hutton, Owen Davies, and Aidan A. Kelly.|$|E

500|$|... "Northern Lites" [...] {{was written}} by singer Gruff Rhys about [...] "the weather", and was {{particularly}} inspired by coverage of the [...] "terrifying, worldwide, seven-year phenomenon" [...] of the west Pacific El Niño climate pattern on [...] "weather channels" [...] in 1998. The song's title refers to the Aurora Borealis, a natural light display which can be observed particularly in the polar regions, and usually at night. The band were convinced that they had seen the lights before the track was written but, as no-one else was present, they could not get confirmation that what they had witnessed <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Furry fantasy".

500|$|The primary {{continued}} to grow more heated in February 2010. On February 5, the two candidates held their first face-to-face debate, and used the 30-minute forum to strongly criticize each other, with Sestak continuing to associate Specter with failed Republican policies and Specter arguing his opponent was more focused on criticizing him than debating policy. Sestak {{continued to}} attack Specter for switching parties, asking, [...] "Is the best the Democrats can do {{someone who has been}} on the other side, with respect, for 50 years, and cast 2,000 votes with President Bush?" [...] Likewise, Specter once again criticized Sestak's missed votes in Congress, which he said would have been enough to earn Sestak a court-martial for going AWOL in his former Naval career. Sestak also criticized Specter for voting in favor of the Iraq War, and Specter in turn condemned Sestak for supporting Obama's proposed troop increase for the War in Afghanistan, which Specter opposed. The next day, the Pennsylvania Democratic Committee voted to endorse Specter over Sestak, with 77 percent of voters supporting the incumbent Senator, or 229 votes compared to Sestak's 72. Sestak criticized the committee for its decision, but also argued it solidified his own position as a political outsider independent from the mainstream Washington establishment. Media outlets said the vote indicated Specter had convinced most important figures in the state party that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> crossover politician.|$|E
