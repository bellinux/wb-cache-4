However, the Muslim passengers refused it, shielding the Christians. At least {{two people were}} killed in the attack and three others were injured. On 19 January 2016, Salah Farah, a Muslim teacher who was among the passengers, died of his injuries in hospital.|$|E

Lepidus, Agrippina and Livilla were accused of being lovers. Not much is known concerning this plot and the reasons behind it. At the trial of Lepidus, Caligula felt no compunction about denouncing them as adulteresses, producing handwritten letters discussing how they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him.|$|E
500|$|Becky {{was created}} as a {{short-term}} recurring character, working in the Underworld sewing factory. The character was deemed popular so producers decided to bring her back, with executive producer Steve Frost initially pitching the idea of bringing in her family, stating: [...] "Becky will leave Weatherfield {{for a short period}} of time and shock the Street's residents when her relatives return with her." [...] However, this never materialised and Becky returned without any relatives. It was also thought that producers <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> the character off, in her early stages.|$|E

This became even clearer when his character's storylines began to develop quickly. While filming [...] "Obscura", Johnson was informed that his character would not be returning as a series regular for season two. Initially fearing that he had made some mistake and that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> his character off, Johnson learned that Whitney would be enlisting into the Marines. The actor has expressed his pleasure in the way the writers handled Whitney's departure, by giving the character the exit of a hero.|$|E
500|$|At first, plot {{information}} about the episode, [...] "Coup D'etat" [...] was a bit scarce. Many fans speculated that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Lorne off the show. Smith went and had a brief talk with the writing staff, responding to his worries {{that it was a}} part of a [...] "cliffhanger". According to Smith, the only reason for making Lorne a recurring character was the positive feedback from fans. [...] "Sunday" [...] became the first episode to reveal {{information about}} Lorne's backstory. Smith described Lorne as [...] "that sort of faithful, loyal guy that everybody kind of knows," [...] and representing a [...] "steady constant." [...] On his own weblog, Joseph Mallozzi said that Lorne as a character would become more active during season 5.|$|E
500|$|A {{post-mortem}} examination of Norgrove's body {{was conducted by}} British coroner Russell Delaney on 19 October 2010. Detective Chief Inspector Colin Smith of the Metropolitan Police told an inquest, opened 22 October in the Salisbury coroner's court, that the examination identified {{the cause of death}} as [...] "penetrating fragment injuries to the head and chest." [...] In February 2011 the coroner recorded a narrative verdict confirming the earlier military investigations' findings that Norgrove was killed {{by a member of the}} US rescue team, noting that a gunshot wound to the leg Norgrove received during the rescue did not contribute to her death. In October 2012 Abdul Wadood, Norgrove's colleague and fellow captive, told the BBC that she asked the kidnappers if they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> her and that they assured her they would not.|$|E

500|$|Due to time constraints, a team {{of writers}} was {{assigned}} to write the teleplay. In addition to the story credit to Ganino and Stillwell, Moore, Ira Steven Behr, Hans Beimler and Richard Manning would work on the teleplay, and Piller would provide the finishing touches. Because the Writers Guild would not allow more than three staff writers {{to appear in the}} credits (four after a special waiver was granted), Piller agreed to not feature his name in the credits. A partial first draft was submitted on November 30 so that preproduction for the episode could commence. The altered timeline provided a chance to show the Enterprise crew in a much more dramatic and human light than would be allowable in a normal episode. Behr explained that since the original timeline was to be restored, the writers had the freedom to include more action. [...] "Even though it was an alternate universe, [...] and I got all excited because we realized we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> everyone on screen", he said. Michael Okuda and Rick Sternbach submitted technical memos regarding the type of anomaly that might drag the Enterprise-C through time, and suggested interstellar, super-dense strings as a possibility. The first draft teleplay was completed by December 4, and a preproduction meeting was held the same day. Given the scale of the story, various departments argued over costs and what items could be cut to reduce the budget. The final draft was finished and submitted on December 8.|$|E
500|$|Oan woke Lock at dawn, {{convinced}} that an intruder {{was in the}} embassy. Lock was sent to investigate, but no intruder was found. Later in the morning, Oan called Lock to examine a bulge in the wall separating the Iranian embassy from the Ethiopian embassy next door. The bulge had, in fact, been caused by the removal of bricks to allow an assault team {{to break through the}} wall and to implant listening devices, resulting in a weakening of the wall. Although Lock assured him that he did not believe the police were about to storm the building, Oan remained {{convinced that}} they were [...] "up to something" [...] and moved the male hostages from the room in which they had spent the last four days to another down the hall. Tensions rose throughout the morning and, at 13:00, Oan told the police that he would kill a hostage unless he was able to speak to an Arab ambassador within 45 minutes. At 13:40, Lock informed the negotiator that the gunmen had taken Abbas Lavasani, the embassy's chief press officer, downstairs and were preparing to execute him. Lavasani, a devout believer in the Iranian Revolution, had repeatedly provoked his captors during the siege. According to Lock, Lavasani stated that [...] "if they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> a hostage, [...] wanted it to be him." [...] At exactly 13:45, 45 minutes after Oan's demand to speak to an ambassador, three shots were heard from inside the embassy.|$|E
500|$|Following Tahil's departure, plots were {{abandoned}} and many scripts {{had to be}} rewritten. EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan revealed that it was intended that Dan would be murdered by his children after prolonged bullying and abuse, saying [...] "The family arrived in Albert Square in what {{was expected to be}} a huge storyline. The father [...] was an oppressive and violent bully – eventually his children <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him. It was all scripted – how they buried him in a shallow grave, how they dealt with it, and how it all exploded. And then Dalip got bloody deported. He was actually on the studio floor and they marched him off. Broken legs, nervous breakdowns – we can deal with that. But when actors are physically taken away by the government and deported, there's not much you can do. Fifty scripts had to be reworked. And because all the episodes had been written around this big storyline, we had to keep the same amount of Ferreira material." [...] The murder storyline was replaced with one concerning a kidney transplant between Ronny and his newly discovered half brother Tariq. Jordan admitted they could have recast the character of Dan, but it may have looked [...] "tacky": [...] "We couldn't go, 'Tonight, the part of Mr Ferreira will be played by Michael French with a suntan'. We were trying to do it with integrity. Then somebody said, 'What if Ronnie Ferreira's mate Tariq turns out to be his half-brother and we do the whole kidney transplant thing?' And, of course, it was like watching paint dry. 'Can I have your kidney?' 'No. Oh, go on then...'" [...] Jordan told the Daily Mirror the Ferreiras were [...] "the least successful characters I created – through no fault of their own." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{deaths of}} Ana Lucia and Libby caused {{speculation}} {{that they were}} killed off due to the DUIs that actresses Michelle Rodriguez and Cynthia Watros received within fifteen minutes of each other on December 1, 2005. Watros pleaded guilty, was fined $370, and had her license suspended for 90 days. Rodriguez initially pleaded innocent, but in April pleaded guilty, {{and was sentenced to}} five days in Oahu correctional facility, but ended up serving only 65 hours due to jail overcrowding. In February 2006, US Weekly claimed that an insider told them that the Lost producers were frustrated with Rodriguez's behavior and <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> her character off. Soon after, [...] "Two for the Road" [...] aired, writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse told TV Guide that when talking to Rodriguez about the part of Ana Lucia, she said that she would be interested, but only for a year. After sitting down with her, the two were very impressed with her energy, and decided to adjust their plan to make her character only last one season. Since audiences had a negative reaction to Ana-Lucia, the producers thought her death would not generate enough sympathy from fans, so they decided that Libby, who was well liked, should also be killed for emotional impact. [...] Lindelof recalled that after they found out that both Rodriguez and Watros got the DUIs, he was concerned that it would look like killing Ana and Libby was the producers attempt to say [...] "Don't drive drunk!", and even considered re-writing the script so it wouldn't seem that way, but the producers decided just to keep it like it was. Lindelof also denied rumors that Rodriguez was killed off because she was hard to deal with, saying that Michelle was [...] "totally professional and got along well with all the other actors." [...] According to Lindelof and Cuse, Watros was very sad about Libby being killed off, and the producers felt bad for her, so they helped her get in a pilot for a show on CBS called My Ex-Life, although it was not picked up by the network.|$|E
500|$|While {{many fans}} were upset with this sudden change of direction, {{the album was}} {{generally}} well received by mainstream publications. Entertainment Weekly was highly positive, writing that [...] "This is the group at their best." [...] In his review of the album, Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters wrote [...] "On a Wire quivers with the anxieties that must have arisen as the Get Up Kids left behind what originally made them. Straining vocals, racing tempos and walls of distortion give way to softer singing, spacious guitars and prominent keyboards [...] [...] [...] The Get Up Kids dig deeper into themselves. What they find is often subtle, less visceral but far more tender." [...] The poor public reception of the album had a larger impact on the band's popularity as a whole. The band embarked on a tour to promote the album in the late spring soon after the album was released, {{only to find that}} they had far less support from both their fans and their record label. Using the financial and critical success of Something to Write Home About, Vagrant signed several other headlining emo bands such as Alkaline Trio, Dashboard Confessional, and Saves the Day. The Get Up Kids were no longer the label's top priority, and certainly not after the lukewarm reception of On a Wire. In an interview with Alternative Press, lead singer Matt Pryor considered the dramatic change in style on On a Wire seriously dented the momentum the band had built up since Something to Write Home About, allowing later bands such as Dashboard Confessional to take much of the fan base that The Get Up Kids had previously earned. In an interview, Pryor confessed that he did not think that [...] "anyone, including Vagrant, gave that record a chance". Even though they had avoided the term since its inception, it was at this point the band actively began trying to shed the term [...] "emo", a word that had defined them for years but had come to be associated with more pop-oriented acts. Pryor commented on the album, saying [...] "We really didn't give two shits if anyone liked the record or not, we were really confident that we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> this 'emo' stigma that we had and take the people with open minds with us and leave everyone else in the dust." ...|$|E

Savage said his name, believing they were targeting only jocks (which he himself was not), in an attempt to save his life; he then asked Klebold what they were doing, to which he answered, [...] "Oh, just killing people." [...] Savage asked if they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him. Possibly because of a fire alarm, Klebold said, [...] "What?" [...] Savage asked again whether they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him. Klebold hesitated, then told him to leave.

2500|$|Fan {{reaction}} to leaked news that Spock {{would be killed}} was overwhelmingly negative, and one fan paid for advertisements urging Paramount to abandon the plan.

But now that I've seen how it was accomplished, I {{think it was a}} very good idea." [...] Some fans even went so far as to issue death threats against Leonard Nimoy's family. Bennett explained, [...] "For some reason fans got the impression that [...] wanted Spock dead. He'd written a book I Am Not Spock, and that gave people the idea. Anyway, when a fringe group of Trekkies learned that we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> the Spock character, it was like we'd taken a child of theirs onto the Brooklyn Bridge with the intention of throwing it off.

2500|$|In December 1953, Jackson {{suffered}} a heart attack, {{as a result of}} which directing animator Eric Larson of Disney's Nine Old Men took over as director. By April 1954, Sleeping Beauty was scheduled for a February 1957 release. With Larson as the director, Disney instructed Larson, whose unit would animate the forest sequence, that the picture was to be a [...] "moving illustration, the ultimate in animation" [...] and added that he did not care how long it would take. Because of the delays, the release date was again pushed back from Christmas 1957 to Christmas 1958. Fellow Nine Old Men Milt Kahl would blame Walt for the numerous release delays because [...] "he wouldn’t have story meetings. He wouldn't get the damn thing moving." [...] Relatively late in production, Disney removed Larson as the supervising director and replaced him with Clyde Geronimi.
