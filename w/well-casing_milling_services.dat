40|$|The {{number of}} rice mills in Uganda {{increased}} rapidly {{during the past}} decade, in response to increasing demand for <b>milling</b> <b>services.</b> However, despite the notable improvement in access to <b>milling</b> <b>services,</b> {{recent studies have shown}} that some farmers still sell rice in unmilled form which attracts lower prices. This study was undertaken to examine why some rice farmers still sell un-milled rice in the advent of improved access to <b>milling</b> <b>services.</b> Descriptive statistical methods of data analysis were used to characterize rice-growing households by the form in which they sell rice, before fitting a Tobit model to determine the factors influencing the proportion of rice sold as grain after milling. The returns (gross margins) to rice-milling were also estimated. The study findings show that rice production is profitable regardless of the form in which it is sold; and the majority of households invest in milling all or part of their rice before sale. However, although milling households incurred higher costs, they also had higher gross margins, implying that selling milled rice is more profitable than selling paddy. The price of milled rice, volume of harvested rice, household size and group membership have significant and positive relationships with the proportion of rice sold as grain; while distance to the nearest rice mill i...|$|R

50|$|The 1890s brought {{problems}} due to depressed sugar {{prices and}} {{major changes in}} the sugar industry.

50|$|The {{community}} is ostracized, {{as it does}} not belong to either of the two primary religious groupings — Islam or Christianity. Members of the Awra Amba community therefore were not given agricultural land to cultivate, but instead were pushed into the most infertile and malaria infested corner of the district. As they cannot live on farm activities, they have diversified into the weaving business, using both traditional and modern weaving machines. In addition, using three grinding mills provided the Regional Micro and Small Scale Enterprise Development Agency, they offer <b>milling</b> <b>service</b> to neighbouring farmers.
