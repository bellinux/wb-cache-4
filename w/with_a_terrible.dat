Eventually, the Alterans were afflicted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> plague that wiped out most of their civilization. It would later be discovered that what was known of this plague {{is very similar to}} the disease used by Ori Priors against non-believers, which had led Daniel Jackson to speculate that the pre-Ascended Ori might have been responsible for this plague.|$|E

25|$|In February 1873 MacGregor became {{assistant}} {{medical officer}} at the Seychelles, and in 1874 he was appointed resident {{at the hospital and}} superintendent of the lunatic asylum at Mauritius. This brought him under the notice of Sir Arthur Gordon who was then governor of the island, and on Gordon being transferred to Fiji in 1875, he obtained MacGregor's services as chief medical officer of Fiji. There he had to grapple <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> epidemic of measles, which resulted in the death of 50,000 natives. In 1877 he was made receiver-general and subsequently a variety of other offices was added, including the colonial secretaryship. On more than one occasion he acted as governor, and was also acting high commissioner and consul-general for the western Pacific. In 1884 the ship Syria, with coolies for Fiji, ran ashore about 15 miles from Suva. MacGregor organised a relief expedition and personally saved several lives; his report made no mention of his own deeds, but they could not remain hidden, and he was given the Albert Medal, and the Clarke gold medal of the Royal Humane Society of Australasia for saving life at sea. In January 1886 he represented Fiji at the meeting of the federal council of Australasia held at Hobart.|$|E
25|$|Years {{after they}} moved to Monastir, the Husainid Dynasty made many reforms for Tunisia to avoid the fate of Ottoman Algeria who had just being colonized by France, in 1830. The reforms {{included}} the establishment of new institutions in order to compete with Europe. But this attempt was a complete failure and ended with a financial crisis. In order to repay foreign loans, the Tunisian government raised the taxes of the mejba. But this resulted in dissatisfaction of the Tunisian people who decided to revolt in 1864. The uprising ended <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> repression: The bey decided to punish any person {{who had participated in}} the event. Therefore, the bey sent general Ahmed Zarrouk to Monastir in order to pacify the situation. Thus, he arrested the city's notables, including Mohamed Bourguiba and his brother, who were detained in a beylical camp settled at the west of the city. They were freed only with the family's efforts who sacrificed all their wealth, jewelry, money and properties. The youngest of Mohamed Bourguiba's sons, Ali, who was only 14, was responsible for bringing the ransom to the general's tent. He was noticed by Zarrouck who saw in him a good recrew for his troops and decided to enroll him in the army. Therefore, Ali spent 19 years of his life campaigning, before ending his military career with the rank of sergeant-in-chief and a quarterly pension of 11.25 francs. However, Mohamed Bourguiba passed away on the very night he got back home, in 1865.|$|E

25|$|Will {{returns to}} The Great Hall, and learns the form each sign will take. Will reveals {{the first sign}} within Gwen’s pendant. As the sign-seeker, Will travels through time to find the next four signs. The Rider enlists a mysterious figure {{to help him get}} the signs from Will. When Will's brother invites Maggie to their home, she reveals some of her powers to Will. Will reveals his {{affections}} for her, saying he felt an instant connection with her. He tells her he has been thinking of her constantly. The Rider also tricks Will's older brother Max, using his magic to partially control him. The spell over Max is finally broken when Will uses his great strength to give Max a concussion. By the fifth day, The Dark that The Rider commands has now gained tremendous power and begins to attack the village <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> blizzard. Will locates the fifth sign but without the sixth sign, the Dark continues to rise. Maggie is revealed to be the mysterious witch helping the Rider in exchange for immortal youth. She is betrayed by him (for failing to get ANY of the signs) when she fails to get the fifth sign and ages rapidly, disintegrating into a flood of water while trying to steal them from Will. The Old Ones and Will seek sanctuary in the Great Hall, where the Rider cannot enter unless invited. However, The Rider's final trick (impersonating the voices of Will's mother and father, as well as Gwen) gains him access to The Great Hall. The Rider reveals that he has trapped Tom, whom The Rider mistook for The Seeker and kidnapped, within a glass sphere (and apparently took care of all these years). He sends Will into an evil dark cloud. As he enters, Will solves the riddle of the sixth sign: he himself is the sixth sign. With all six signs identified The Rider cannot touch nor harm Will. Using his power over the dark, Will banishes both The Rider – imprisoning the evil figure within one of his own glass spheres – and The Dark. The sphere disappears into murky water. Will and Tom are reunited and return to their family, who are shocked to see Tom.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{took issue}} with the game's lack of originality. Henry Kelly of The Digital Fix {{comments}} that [...] "The character models are quite basic and unimaginative - Jeremy has typically harsh features and the female characters are given skimpy outfits {{to show off their}} stereotyped fantasy physiques". X-ONE Magazine calls the game an [...] "unashamed clone of Diablo", which borrows mechanics, naming conventions, and character archetypes from Diablo. The gameplay was considered by critics to be too easy, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> enemy AI that made combat unchallenging, interspersed with what Henry Kelly called [...] "painfully simple non-puzzles". Other components that faced criticism included the shallowness of the RPG elements, the lack of online co-op, and the dialogue, which was considered poorly written and occasionally poorly acted.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} Brassey's Guide to War Films by Alun Evans was critical, calling the film [...] "Arguably the worst war picture {{made in the}} last quarter of the 20th century". Robert Niemi commented in his book History in the Media: Film and Television, [...] "Plagued <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> script, horrendous {{production}} problems, and shoddy performances all around, the resulting film, Inchon ... was bad beyond belief." [...] Niemi wrote that Olivier's performance [...] "was a low point in an otherwise distinguished film career". In his biography of the actor, Olivier, author Terry Coleman called the film [...] "probably the worst he ever made and one of the best paid". Author Lawrence H. Suid wrote in Guts and Glory: The Making of the American Military Image in Film that [...] "what combat the film portrayed lacked any believability or authenticity... As a result, the movie met with almost unanimous critical disdain." [...] Moon's 2009 autobiography, As a Peace-Loving Global Citizen, does not mention Inchon, nor did he or the Unification Church ever produce another major commercial motion picture.|$|E

500|$|Árbenz was {{initially}} confident that his army would quickly dispatch the rebel force. The victory {{of a small}} garrison of 30 soldiers over the 180-strong rebel force outside Zacapa strengthened his belief. However, the CIA's psychological warfare made the army unwilling to fight Castillo Armas. Gleijeses stated {{that if it were}} not for US support for the rebellion, the officer corps of the Guatemalan army would have remained loyal to Árbenz because, although not uniformly his supporters, they were more wary of Castillo Armas, and also had strong nationalist views. As it was, they believed that the US would intervene militarily, leading to a battle they could not win. On 17June the army leaders at Zacapa had begun to negotiate with Castillo Armas. They signed a pact, known as the Pacto de Las Tunas, three days later, which placed the army at Zacapa under Castillo Armas in return for a general amnesty. The army returned to its barracks a few days later, [...] "despondent, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> sense of defeat".|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} President {{announced}} his resignation, Díaz announced {{on the radio}} that he was taking over the presidency, and that the army would continue {{to fight against the}} invasion of Castillo Armas. He headed a military junta which also consisted of Colonels Elfego Hernán Monzón Aguirre and Jose Angel Sánchez. Two days later Ambassador Peurifoy told Díaz that he had to resign because, {{in the words of a}} CIA officer who spoke to Díaz, he was [...] "not convenient for American foreign policy". Peurifoy castigated Díaz for allowing Árbenz to criticize the United States in his resignation speech; meanwhile, a U.S.-trained pilot dropped a bomb on the army's main powder magazine, in order to intimidate the colonel. Soon after, Díaz was overthrown by a rapid bloodless coup led by Colonel Monzón, who was more pliable to U.S. interests. Díaz later stated that Peurifoy had presented him with a list of names of communists, and demanded that all of them be shot by the next day; Díaz had refused, turning Peurifoy further against him.

500|$|However, Doukhobor {{views on}} {{education}} and the extremist actions of a Doukhobor group called the Sons of Freedom eventually brought down their prosperous empire. In the 1920s, unknown arsonists destroyed several public schools in Brilliant as an act against British Columbia law. Then in 1924, on a routine rail trip to Grand Forks, Peter Verigin [...] and seven other people were killed by a dynamite explosion that completely destroyed the coach that he was traveling in. Pieces of battery and alarm clock indicated {{that this was the}} work of people who intentionally wanted to kill Verigin, most likely members of the Sons of Freedom, or as some historians put it, by the lover of one of Verigin's handmaidens. Over 7,000 people attended Verigin's funeral. The Doukhobor leader was buried in an elaborate tomb on a headland overlooking the city of Brilliant and the Kootenay and Columbia Rivers. Verigin was succeeded by his son, Peter P. Verigin, who arrived from Russia in 1927. Unfortunately, despite the economic reforms he created in response to debt to the federal government, his arrival coincided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> depression and bankruptcy which caused the Doukhobors to lose most of their lands. Verigin Jr. died in 1939 and by 1963, almost all Doukhobor lands were sold to the government. Today, little remains of the former settlement at Brilliant except for Verigin's tomb. [...] The Doukhobor suspension bridge spanning the Kootenay River still exists, and was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995.|$|E

Meeting with the Happy Mask Salesman again, he sees that Link has retrieved his ocarina, and hence teaches him the [...] "Song of Healing", which breaks the curse, returns Link to his human form and seals his Deku Scrub form into a mask which has the power to turn him back into a Deku Scrub if needed. After he finds out Link did not bring back the mask, he panics and explains that the mask conceals an evil, apocalyptic power that was once used by an ancient tribe in hexing rituals. The troubles caused by the mask were so great, that the ancient ones [...] "sealed the mask in shadow forever" [...] to prevent it from being misused. Link must then travel between the four cardinal regions of Termina: Woodfall, Snowhead, the Great Bay, and Ikana Canyon, for each region conceals one of the Four Giants who will be able, once reunited, to halt the moon's crashing. At the same time, each region has been struck <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> curse by the Skull Kid which plagues its inhabitants and seals away its giant. To lift the curse and free the giants, Link must enter a dungeon in each region and defeat its boss, after doing so, obtaining the power to summon the giant he has set free.
