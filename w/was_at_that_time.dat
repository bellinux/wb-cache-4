5|$|According to Oswald Spengler, the {{characteristic}} mistake of the Gracchan age was {{to believe in}} the possibility of the reversibility of history – a form of idealism which according to Spengler <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> shared by both sides of the political spectrum – Cato had sought to turn back the clock to the time of Cincinnatus, and restore virtue by returning to austerity.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} the States deemed it {{necessary}} to pass such an Act suggests <b>that</b> theatrical performances <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> frequent enough and of sufficient concern to the authorities to require the setting up of a regulatory system. However, there is little direct evidence of which plays were being performed as there <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> no established theatre and no newspapers.|$|R

5|$|Attalus <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> {{corresponding}} with Demosthenes, {{regarding the}} possibility of defecting to Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to leave alive. Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly {{as a result of}} poisoning by Olympias.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{erupted in}} June 1965 when Queen Elizabeth II {{appointed}} all four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) after Prime Minister Harold Wilson nominated {{them for the}} award. In protest – the honour <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders – some conservative MBE recipients returned their own insignia.|$|E
5|$|Courtier and {{journalist}} Dermot Morrah alleged {{that there was}} brief speculation as to the desirability of bypassing Albert (and his children) and his brother, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, in favour of their younger brother Prince George, Duke of Kent. This {{seems to have been}} suggested on the grounds that Prince George <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> the only brother with a son.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Bonds {{left the}} Pirates {{to sign a}} lucrative free agent {{contract}} worth a then-record $43.75 million ($ million today) over six years with the Giants, with whom his father had spent the first seven years of his career, and with whom his godfather Willie Mays played 22 of his 24 Major League seasons.

5|$|In all, Liza {{brought a}} total of $100million in damage in Baja California Sur, which {{receives}} catastrophic flooding from hurricanes every 50years or so. The hurricane was considered the worst natural disaster {{in the history of}} the peninsula, which at the time held 130,000 occupants. Furthermore, Liza <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> considered the worst hurricane to affect the entire country in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The Ex-Students' Union is the school's alumnae association, inaugurated on {{the evening}} of 9 December 1905. At the {{invitation}} of Dr. Marden several former students discussed the proposal, elected Marion Pickard (who <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> Lady Superintendent) as their President, and formed a committee to produce a constitution. These actions were confirmed at a General Meeting on Jersey Day 1906, and the committee took office until 1907.|$|E
5|$|The Thin Man gun-type design <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> {{based on}} the fissibility of the very pure plutonium-239 isotope so far only {{produced}} in microgram quantities by the Berkeley cyclotron. When the Hanford production reactors came on-line in early 1944, the mix of plutonium-239 and plutonium-240 obtained {{was found to have}} a high rate of spontaneous fission. To avoid pre-detonation, the muzzle velocity of the gun-type design would need to be greatly raised, making it impractically long.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was {{designed in the}} Art Nouveau style, which <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> a relatively new style and featured flowing, curvilinear designs often incorporating floral and other plant-inspired motifs. Horodecki featured such motifs in the building's exterior decor in the forms of mythical creatures and big-game animals. His work on the House with Chimaeras has earned him the nickname of the Gaudí of Kiev.|$|E
50|$|He {{published}} {{an essay on}} human anatomy. His Précis de médecine pratique, published in four instalments (between 1760 and 1776), shows how forward-thinking medical sciences <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{first public}} {{performance}} of opera {{in the new}} theatre took place on 26 January 1793, the dispute with the Lord Chamberlain over the licence having been settled. This theatre <b>was,</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> the largest in England, and it became {{the home of the}} Theatre Royal, Drury Lane company while that company's home theatre was itself rebuilt between 1791–94.|$|E
5|$|A 1937 {{survey of}} Kennedy's rebuilt church by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire {{said that it}} was formed from a {{continuous}} nave and chancel, measuring in total 43 by 15feet (13.3 by 4.7m). The church, which <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> in good condition, was entered through a porch on the south side, and there was a vestry on the north side. As well as the font, the church contained some 18th-century memorials. The font is now in the south chapel of St Cybi's Church, Holyhead.|$|E
50|$|According to Livy, during Valerius' first consulship in 483 BC the tribunes {{continued}} {{their attempts to}} increase their powers, but <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> successfully resisted by the Roman senate.|$|R

5|$|At age fifty-eight, Baldwin {{desired to}} satisfy his nature {{of being a}} pioneer again by moving to Kansas, which <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> a territory. He arrived as {{the brunt of the}} {{fighting}} in the territory was ending. Upon his arrival, he founded Baldwin City and built the first college building in the territory, which became the foundation for Baker University. He was in Kansas only for a short time when tragedy struck. On August 30, 1858, John's son Milton died unexpectedly after having been sick for only three days. Within a couple years, he laid out a town, built a grist mill and a saw mill, and he turned over the town and college to the Methodist Conference and returned to Berea, although he continued to finance it.|$|E
5|$|Barry Took, who had {{produced}} {{a series of}} ultimately unsuccessful documentaries for the BBC about working men's clubs, was partially responsible for the choice of location for the exterior shots. The programme which drew the highest ratings of the series focused on Burnlee Working Men's Club, a club in the small West Yorkshire town of Holmfirth and Took saw Holmfirth's potential as the backdrop of a television show. Took's idea was passed to James Gilbert and Roy Clarke via Duncan Wood, who <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> filming Comedy Playhouse. Gilbert and Clarke then travelled to Holmfirth and decided {{to use it as}} the setting for the pilot of Last of the Summer Wine.|$|E
5|$|Basil II <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> in {{the eastern}} provinces of his empire, {{wintering}} on the plain of Tarsus following his campaign against the Fatimid dynasty in Syria. On hearing of David’s death he marched north-eastward to claim the lands David had promised to the emperor. The local Georgian and Armenian nobility submitted without any serious resistance. The only notable incident occurred when a quarrel between a Georgian soldier and a Varangian Guardsman over a bale of hay developed into a major fight, involving 6,000 Varangians and taking the lives of thirty Georgian high-ranking nobles.|$|E
