5|$|Barrel Roll {{was one of}} {{the most}} closely held secrets and one of the most unknown {{components}} of the American military commitment in Southeast Asia. Due to the ostensible neutrality of Laos, guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954 and 1962, both the U.S. and North Vietnam strove to maintain the secrecy of their operations and only slowly escalated military actions there. As much as both parties <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> publicized their enemy's own alleged violation of the accords, both had more to gain by keeping their own roles quiet. Regardless, by the end of the conflict in 1975, Laos emerged from nine years of war just as devastated as any of the other Asian participants in the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|The post-Taylor {{capacity}} of Highbury {{was limited to}} 38,419, while Arsenal's success during the 1990s and 2000s meant that virtually every home match was filled to near capacity. Restrictions, such as the East Stand's status as a listed building and the fact the stadium was surrounded on all sides by a residential area, made any future expansion of Highbury difficult and expensive, although the club's directors <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> kept Arsenal at a modernized and expanded Highbury. In October 1998, just after Arsenal started playing Champions League games at Wembley, the club made an unsuccessful bid to buy the stadium and make it their permanent home {{to share with the}} England national football team, although at the time Wembley was two years away from closure for a redevelopment which was not completed until more than six years later.|$|E
5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod {{in order to avoid}} regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings {{and the fact that the}} deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to get their act together. If you look at what we paid it will go down in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E

Lee had originally said he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> shown how Saruman is first corrupted by Sauron, but would not be comfortable flying to New Zealand at his age. Lee {{went on to say that}} if a film were made, he would love to voice Smaug, as it would mean he could record his part in England and not have to travel. On 10 January 2011, it was reported that Lee had entered into negotiations to reprise the role of Saruman.|$|E
25|$|The album's {{front cover}} {{is taken from}} {{photographer}} Peter Sutherland's Sightings series. Sutherland has described his photograph as being a chance encounter with a wild fox that momentarily stopped and stared straight into his lens {{while he was in}} the back garden at a friend's wedding party. Lacey acknowledged that the decision to use Sutherland's fox photograph reflected a running theme of darkness and nature that had subconsciously crept into the album. Additional photographs were provided by Alexa Lambros and Accardi, while Lacey worked with Jason Noto of Morning Breath Inc. on the packaging and layout of the album. Due to an increased popularity in vinyl, the band's label rush released production of the vinyl, leaving the band out of the process - with Lacey later commenting that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> made the release differ from the CD version.|$|E

25|$|Inge King (née Ingeborg Viktoria Neufeld) {{was born}} in Berlin on 26 November 1915, the {{youngest}} of four girls in a well-to-do Jewish family. Her early childhood was typical one for a child of her class and time in a European city. But after World War I, conditions in Germany became increasingly difficult. The period of the Weimar Republic (1918–1933), though a culturally stimulating time, was never stable. Conditions were made more difficult by the hyper-inflation of the early 1920s and the depression of 1929. During that time, things became increasingly difficult for the Neufeld family. By the time King's father died in 1930, when she was 14, the family had lost most of its money. Her older sisters supported her to stay at school until she finished, in 1932, which enabled her {{to get a good}} education. She <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> gone on to university, possibly to study medicine, but, financially, that was out of the question.|$|E

Some critics, however, described their onscreen relationship as unbelievable and unsympathetic. Gershon was seen {{to have made a}} comeback after her role in the less well received 1995 film Showgirls. Tilly's performance was compared to her Academy Award-nominated part in Bullets Over Broadway. Pantoliano was described as [...] "a lot of fun" [...] and having the [...] "trickiest scenes in the movie".|$|E

That's the guy you have to work with five minutes later.' That's life… We can only be complete when we work together." [...] The director noted that Hellboy and The Devil's Backbone told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.|$|E

500|$|At West Point, Brown was {{roommates}} with John Norton, future US Army lieutenant general. Brown {{once again}} played polo, and was {{captain of the}} team in his senior year, when the West Point team lost in the final to Princeton University. In that year he was also cadet captain and regimental adjutant. He <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> joined the cavalry on graduation like his father, but his standing as 342nd in his class was too low for an appointment to the cavalry. Instead, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry on graduation on 11 June 1941. However, he volunteered for Air Corps training. At West Point he met Alice (Skip) Colhoun. An Army brat like himself, Alice met George at a party her father had thrown for {{the sons of the}} graduates of the class of 1913. George and Alice dated for over a year, [...] and were married in 1942. Their marriage produced three children, two boys and a girl.|$|E

That, however, appeared impossible. The first term {{of the problem was}} unreadable—lacked all suggestion but that of atrocious cruelty.|$|R
