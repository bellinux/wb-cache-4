5|$|Jabarona {{was filled}} with Dinka {{refugees}} who had fled the fighting {{in the south of}} Sudan and were forced to live together in sub-standard conditions. Bok settled among people who were from the Aweil area of North Bahr al Ghazal and began using his Christian name of Francis once again. Bok was quickly arrested by the Sudanese police for telling his friends and neighbors that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slave.</b> Slavery in Sudan is a subject that was largely denied by the government in Khartoum and anybody that spoke of it could be arrested or even killed. Francis was interrogated numerous times while he was imprisoned and each time he denied that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slave.</b> He was finally released from prison after seven months. Once he was released Bok decided that he must leave Sudan. Through the help of some Dinka tribesman he was able to acquire a Sudanese passport on the black market and obtain a ticket for passage to Cairo.|$|E

His father {{was a native of}} South Carolina; he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> owner who freed his slaves when he relocated to Indiana. Ambrose attended Liberty Seminary as a young boy, but his education was interrupted when his mother died in 1841; he was apprenticed to a local tailor, eventually becoming a partner in the business.|$|E

5|$|Francis Piol Bol Bok (born February 1979), a Dinka tribesman {{and native}} of South Sudan, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> {{for ten years}} but is now an {{abolitionist}} and author living in the United States. On May 15, 1986, he was captured and enslaved {{at the age of}} seven during an Arab militia raid on the village of Nyamlel in South Sudan during the Second Sudanese Civil War. Bok lived in bondage for ten years before escaping imprisonment in Kurdufan, Sudan, followed by a journey to the United States by way of Cairo, Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In December 1817, Edwards, {{responding}} to a movement for statehood led by his ally Daniel Pope Cook, recommended to the legislature that Illinois apply for admission to the Union. He also recommended that a census first be taken of the territory, a standard practice, but the legislature rejected this. Legislators, particularly those opposed to slavery, feared that any delay would allow Missouri to apply for statehood before Illinois, and that since Missouri <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> state, this would cause so much turmoil in Congress that it would delay Illinois' admission even longer.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield is {{best known}} for his {{judgment}} in Somersett's Case on the legality of keeping slaves in England. The English had been involved in the slave trade since 1553, and by 1768, ships registered in Liverpool, Bristol and London carried more than half the slaves shipped in the world. James Somersett <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> owned by Charles Stewart, an American customs officer who sailed to Britain for business, landing on 10 November 1769. A few days later Somersett attempted to escape. He was recaptured in November and imprisoned on the ship Ann and Mary, owned by Captain John Knowles and bound for the British colony of Jamaica. Stewart intended to sell him there. However, three people claiming to be Somersett's godparents, John Marlow, Thomas Walkin and Elizabeth Cade, made an application before the Court of King's Bench for a writ of habeas corpus, and Captain Knowles was ordered to produce Somersett before the Court of King's Bench, which would determine whether his imprisonment was legal.|$|E

5|$|While {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} the Acts, Josephine had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> trade of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution. A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian , and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were all involved in the trade. Josephine fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, William Thomas Stead, who purchased a 13-year-old girl from her mother for £5. The subsequent outcry led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 years of age and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the British Raj.|$|E
5|$|With its {{connection}} through the Ohio River to the east, the Mississippi {{to the south}} and north, and the Missouri to the west, St. Louis was ideally located to become the main base of interregional trade. In the 1840s, it became a destination for massive immigration by Irish and Germans. Some native-born Americans reacted with fear to the newcomers, adopting nativist sentiments. Missouri <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> state, but the city's proximity to free states caused it to become a center for the filing of freedom suits. Many slaves gained freedom through such suits in the antebellum years. But, by the 1850s and the Dred Scott case, interpretations had changed and the US Supreme Court ruled against him. It also ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, contributing to the tensions causing the American Civil War. During the War, St. Louis had a small skirmish on its outskirts, but was held under Union control.|$|E

5000|$|Leon Morris {{notes that}} the δουλεύειν, douleuein, {{translated}} as serve, literally means <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> to, unlike in Luke where the reference is to servants. The Holman Christian Standard Bible translated the phrase as [...] "No one can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> of two masters". David Hill notes that while labourers would frequently {{have more than one}} employer, it <b>was</b> impossible for <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> to have two masters and the author of Matthew may have chosen the slave metaphor as the clearer one. However, Morris notes that Acts 16:16 mentions <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> with more than one master. What Jesus is noting <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> legal impossibility, but a psychological one. While the slave might at first believe he can serve both masters equally eventually he will come to prefer one over the other. The slavery metaphor also can mitigate Jesus' warning. One cannot <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> to both God and money, but {{it does not mean that}} one cannot <b>be</b> both <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> to God and also pursue a reasonable interest in money. This verse <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> call for the renunciation of all wealth, merely a warning against the idolization of the pursuit of money.|$|R
