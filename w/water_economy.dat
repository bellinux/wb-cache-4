40|$|PS 10. 8 Management {{of water}} resources: Urban water managementThe {{presentation}} {{will look at}} 'water stories' in global cities, most of them coastal, rich and relatively wet. In these largely 'mature' <b>water</b> <b>economies,</b> per capita use has usually begun to decline or at least level out, although the causes are not clear. Yet provision costs have not declined commensurately, often generating a conservation-driven budgetary crisis that forces institutional change, including moves towards full cost pricing and, sometimes, greater private sector involvement. Often complications arise from the need of megacities to reach across administrative boundaries and watersheds to secure their supply. These are common problems, but we also find that specific paths taken by urban <b>water</b> <b>economies</b> depend upon critical choices at certain tipping points and larger governance considerations beyond the water sector. Hong Kong and Singapore provide a good comparison/contrast in this regard. In terms of their 'initial conditions,' they are very similar, yet they have moved along different paths. In the early 1960 s, both Hong Kong and Singapore were British colonies, suffering from severe drought. Both looked to diversions from neighbouring areas to secure a water supply, but {{at the cost of}} political insecurity. Both sought to address this problem through commitment to greater self-provision. From the mid 1980 s, Hong Kong abandoned this strategy. In both cities, water prices have been frozen {{since the beginning of the}} 21 st century, but Singapore has covered its costs while Hong Kong has relied on subsidies. We explore this divergence from a number of perspectives, not only historical but also in terms of the underlying political, budgetary and governance features...|$|R

President Omar Bongo's decision to remove him from the Ministry of Finance was attributed to the opposition his austerity measures had engendered among other members of the regime. Doumba's portfolio was altered on 21 January 2006, when he was appointed as Minister of the Forest <b>Economy,</b> <b>Water,</b> Fishing, and National Parks, again on 28 December 2007, when he was appointed as Minister of the Forest <b>Economy,</b> <b>Water,</b> and Fishing, and finally on 14 January 2009, when he was appointed as simply Minister of the Forest Economy.|$|R

40|$|Water {{resources}} management {{reform in}} developing countries has tended to overlook community-based water laws, which govern self-help water development and management by large proportions, if not the majority, of citizens: rural, small-scale water users, including poor women and men. In an attempt to fill this gap, global experts on community-based water law and its interface with public sector intervention present a varied collection of empirical research findings in this volume. The present chapter introduces {{the rationale for the}} volume and its contents. It further identifies key messages emerging from the chapters on, first, {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} community-based water law and, second, the impact of water resources management reform on informal water users' access to water and its beneficial uses. Impacts vary from outright weakening of community-based arrangements and poverty aggravation or missing significant opportunities to better water resource management and improved well-being, also among poor women and men. The latter interventions combine the strengths of community-based water law with the strengths of the public sector. Together, these messages contribute to a new vision on the role of the state inwater resources management that better matches the needs and potentials of water users in the informal <b>water</b> <b>economies</b> {{in developing countries}}...|$|R

40|$|Plant {{functional}} ecologists {{argue that}} there is a spectrum of plant types defined by fast versus slow strategies of resource acquisition and use across the whole plant (Reich 2014). Plant traits are likely to be correlated to yield this kind of spectrum. Stomata serve as the portals for regulating CO 2 and water vapour transfers between plants and the atmosphere, and in so doing they link plant carbon and <b>water</b> <b>economies.</b> However, {{it is not clear how}} stomatal behaviour fits into the spectrum of traits and strategies. The stomatal optimisation formalism recently proposed by Medlyn et al. (2011) provides a trait (g 1) that allows characterisation of stomatal behaviour. High values of g 1 indicate a low marginal cost of water per unit carbon gain to the plant and in theory should be linked to fast growth traits. We undertook a study of stomatal optimisation in six co-occurring tree species, which we combined with a recently published study of four eucalypts on the same site using similar methodology, for a robust comparison involving ten species. The study investigates correlations between g 1 and other plant traits to investigate how g 1 fits into the plant economic spectrum.  Our aims in this study were to apply stomatal optimisation theory to test if leaf and plant traits relating to water loss and carbon gain are related to optimal stomatal behaviour...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two primary potable water-treatment {{technologies}} used in South Texas include conventional surface-water and reverse-osmosis (RO) desalination of brackish-groundwater. As the region’s population {{continues to}} grow, municipalities {{are searching for}} economical means to expand their <b>water</b> supplies. <b>Economies</b> of size for both technologies are an important consideration for future expansion decisions. The 1944 Treaty requires the United States and Mexico to share the downstream water release from these two 1 reservoirs (Sturdivant et al. 2008). In addition to sharing the water, the treaty requires the United States to provide Mexico with 1. 5 million acre-feet per year from the Colorado River, while Mexico must provide the United States with 350, 000 ac-ft from the Rio Grande River (Spencer 2005) ...|$|R
50|$|These {{functions}} sometimes create conflicting demands.

40|$|The 'big is better' {{idea has}} {{recently}} been challenged in network industries. Scale economies are considered finite so that for the individual utility an optimal scale of operations arises. A similar observation yields for scope economies as joint production is not predicted univocally anymore. In the <b>water</b> sector, scale <b>economies</b> and joint production are preferred. Nevertheless, several countries are restructuring the sector {{in order to improve}} the scale and scope of operations. This article intends to provide some insights into this matter. We analyze the Portuguese water market structure using non-parametric techniques with data from the year 2005. After surveying the literature on scale and scope economies, we discuss the peculiarities of the Portuguese water sector. The paper confirms the natural monopoly features. Although scope economies are absent, it highlights scale economies. The optimal scale of the utilities is located between 160, 000 and 180, 000 inhabitants. As such, the Portuguese water sector optimally counts 60 water utilities. Performance Portugal Scale <b>economies</b> Scope <b>economies</b> <b>Water</b> and wastewater utilities...|$|R
