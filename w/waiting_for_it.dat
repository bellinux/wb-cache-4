5|$|Yoshikawa {{develops}} {{misgivings about}} Asami after {{he is unable}} to reach any of the references on her résumé, such as a music producer she claimed to work for, who is missing. However, Aoyama is so enthralled by her that he pursues her anyway. She lives in an empty apartment, containing a sack and a phone. For four days after the audition, she sits perfectly still next to the phone <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to ring. When it finally does, she answers pretending that she never expected Aoyama to call. After several dates, she agrees to accompany him to a seaside hotel, where a smitten Aoyama intends to propose marriage. At the hotel, Asami reveals burn scars on her body. Before making love, Asami demands that Aoyama pledge his love to her and no one else. A deeply moved Aoyama agrees. In the morning, Asami is nowhere to be found.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is diurnal and chiefly an ambush predator, {{though it has}} been {{recorded}} as hunting partly by pursuit, such as catching pigeons at a watering hole before they can fly high enough to escape. It usually goes hunting from a permanent lair, to which it will regularly return, if the hunting is good {{and it is not}} disturbed. It hunts mainly by sight and in doing so it commonly will raise much of its length well off the ground. The black mamba does not typically hold onto prey after biting, instead releasing its quarry and <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to succumb to paralysis and die. This however depends on the type of prey; for example, it typically will hold onto a bird till it stops struggling to escape. If prey tries to escape or defend itself, the black mamba often may follow up its initial bite with a rapid series of strikes to incapacitate and quickly kill its prey. The snake has been known to prey on hyrax and rock hyrax, bushbabies, and bats. The black mamba has a potent digestive system and has been observed to digest prey fully within eight to ten hours.|$|E

25|$|ZipRefill – To {{alleviate}} the return delivery times, Zip.ca pledged to (for qualified customers), send a replacement disc once a customer indicates (via the website) that a disc has {{been returned to}} Zip.ca, without <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to actually be received (the ZipRefill is not a guaranteed rental). Only a single ZipRefill is allowed at any one time, which allows a person with, for instance, a 4-disc membership to at times actually have 5 discs in their possession or in transit. Some other Canadian rental companies have incorporated a similar concept, often extending it to multiple active replacements.|$|E
25|$|The line's railway {{signaling}} {{system is designed}} to ensure that trains wait on the double track section while a train is proceeding {{in the other direction}} on the single track. The signal system was upgraded in the 1990s to support Metrolink commuter rail services, and Richard Stanger, the executive director of Metrolink in its early years of 1991 to 1998, said the system had functioned without trouble in the past. The Metrolink train would normally wait in the Chatsworth station for the daily Union Pacific freight train to pass before proceeding, unless the freight train was already <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> at Chatsworth. The location was not protected by catch points.|$|E

25|$|Charlotte {{would open}} the second half by {{recovering}} a forced fumble on the opening kickoff at the Wesley 22 yard line. They'd line up for a field goal attempt after gaining no yards on a 3-and-out series, but backup quarterback and place holder Lee McNeill would throw the snapped ball to Mark Pettit, who was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in the endzone for a touchdown. After Wesley went 3-and-out on their next series, Charlotte would gain the lead {{for the first time}} in the day off a Matt Johnson 3 yard touchdown pass to C.J. Crawford. Later in the quarter the Wolverines would tie the score again on a Rick Jackson 2 yard rushing touchdown.|$|E
25|$|The play most {{directly}} {{analogous to the}} Miracle involved a player's, rather than a coach's, questionable decision that cost his team a game. On Thanksgiving Day 1993, the Cowboys were playing their customary holiday contest, this time against the visiting Dolphins, in sleet. As the clock ticked down, Dallas appeared to have won when it blocked a 41-yard Miami field goal. But as several Dolphins players were gathered around the ball, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to come to rest in order to down it {{as close as possible}} to the Dallas goal, Dallas defensive end Leon Lett sprinted downfield to try to recover it. He slipped on the slick surface and touched the ball. His touch meant that it became a live ball and Miami was able to recover at the Dallas 1 and kick a field goal for a 16–14 victory.|$|E
500|$|In Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories (1902), the Elephant's Child acquires {{his trunk}} by having his (short) nose pulled very {{hard by the}} Crocodile [...] "on {{the banks of the}} great grey-green, greasy Limpopo river". The newly {{elongated}} nose allows him to pick fruit instead of <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to fall, and to do many other useful things. Roald Dahl's The Enormous Crocodile (1978), illustrated by Quentin Blake, tells how a crocodile wanders the jungle looking for children to eat, trying one trick after another.|$|E

I think as fans we'd been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> for so long. That said, {{it was a very}} difficult scene to shoot. Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days we shot it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was actually pretty ill and everyone was crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it got quite smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably more than a hundred times, only forgetting a line once in the entire time. When we finished the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew." ...|$|E
500|$|About Johann Urb's casting in Resident Evil: Retribution, the film's {{producer}} and director Paul W. S. Anderson said, [...] "You {{have no idea}} {{how difficult it is to}} find someone with Leon Kennedy's hair [...] has to be manly and has to have these long bangs," [...] adding that [...] "if you put photographs of them side-by-side, it's almost like he was manufactured by Capcom." [...] Anderson said that the decision to include Leon and other game characters in the film was [...] "fan-driven". Urb mentioned that he learned the video game Leon's mannerisms from watching clips posted on YouTube, commenting that [...] "he doesn't have a high-pitched voice. I feel like he talks how I naturally talk, which is kind of slower." [...] Speaking about the relationship between Leon and Ada, Urb said: [...] "It's kind of like Mulder and Scully and an X-Files type of deal, where you're <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to happen, but it never does. Maybe in the next one, I'm hoping." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 7, while Hendrix and Levine were {{travelling}} by limousine to a New York {{airport for}} their flight to Toronto, Levine noticed that Hendrix was putting some personal items into his guitar case. Levine then {{reminded him that}} they would be going through customs and that they had better not bring anything inappropriate. He reassured Levine, but as they approached their destination Levine confronted him: [...] "Jimi, I know you have something in that guitar case. I don't know what it is, and it's not normally my business to interfere, but I know we will be searched at customs." [...] Hendrix insisted that he had nothing to worry about, stating: [...] "Trust me, Bob, {{no one is going to}} recognize me", to which he replied: [...] "Recognize you? They will be waiting at customs for you." [...] Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case. He spent the night in jail, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be tested. Later that day, the Toronto police department dropped the charges when the pill was determined to be a legal medication.|$|E

500|$|On October 19, 1951, Josephine Baker made {{charges of}} racism against the Stork Club. [...] Baker visited the club on October 16 as {{the guest of}} Roger Rico and his wife; both entertainers were at the Stork after their theater performances. Baker said she ordered a steak and was {{apparently}} still <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> an hour later. [...] The controversy grew when Baker accused Walter Winchell {{of being in the}} Cub Room at the time and not coming to her aid. [...] Winchell was at the club; he said he had greeted Baker and vocalist Roger Rico as the two left their Cub Room table. Winchell said he was not aware of there being any problem, and left for a late screening of the film [...] The next morning, Winchell's rumored failure to assist Baker was big news, and he received countless telephone calls. The incident blew into a major scandal and was widely publicized on the radio and newspapers. Mrs. Rico, who was part of the Baker party with her husband, said that Baker's steak was waiting for her at the table after she returned from her phone call, but the entertainer chose to make a stormy exit from the Stork anyhow. News accounts show conflicting statements from the Ricos.|$|E
500|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy {{was better}} received. Bob Mackey at USgamer {{appreciated}} how {{the games were}} mostly left untouched, while getting minor improvements, {{such as the ability}} to read the text at the player's own pace rather than <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to [...] "slowly [...] across the screen". He said that the game's graphical upgrades were hit or miss, with certain characters, including Phoenix and Edgeworth, looking great, while elements that originally had less definition, such as the judge's beard, were [...] "a little wonky". Thomas Whitehead at Nintendo Life said that Capcom had done a [...] "solid job" [...] with the port, and appreciated the stereoscopic 3D effect and the game's faithfulness to the original; he, however, felt that the lack of an orchestral soundtrack similar to that in [...] was a minor disappointment. Geoff Thew at Hardcore Gamer called the updated art gorgeous, and noted that it did not have the same animation-related problems as the Trilogy HD on iOS. He appreciated the 3D effect, which he said works well most of the time, but said that the window frame in the detention center was not rendered on its own layer; he said {{that it was not a}} huge problem, but that it was distracting as the player visits that area often. He also commented on the lack of a remastered soundtrack, calling it a letdown.|$|E
500|$|Following his San Francisco sojourn, Divine {{returned}} to Baltimore {{and participated in}} Waters's next film Pink Flamingos. Designed by Waters to be [...] "an exercise in poor taste," [...] the film featured Divine as Babs Johnson, a woman who claims to be [...] "the filthiest person alive" [...] and who is forced to prove her right to the title from challengers, Connie (Mink Stole) and Raymond Marble (David Lochary). In one scene, the Marbles send Babs a turd in a box as a birthday present, {{and in order to}} enact this scene, Divine defecated into the box the night before. Filmed in a hippie commune in Phoenix, Maryland, the cast members spent much of the time smoking cigarettes and marijuana and taking amphetamines, although all of the scenes had been heavily rehearsed beforehand. The final scene in the film proved particularly infamous, involving Babs eating fresh dog feces; Divine later told a reporter, [...] "I followed that dog around for three hours just zooming in on its asshole," [...] <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to empty its bowels so that they could film the scene. The scene {{became one of the most}} notable moments of Divine's acting career, and he later complained of people thinking that [...] "I run around doing it all the time. I've received boxes of dog shit– plastic dog shit. I have gone to parties where people just sit around and talk about dog shit because they think it's what I want to talk about." [...] In reality, he remarked, he was not a coprophile but only ate excrement that one time because it was in the script.|$|E

500|$|The band {{arrived at}} Pachyderm Studio without their {{equipment}} and {{spent much of}} the first three days <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to arrive by mail. [...] However, once recording began on February 13, work moved quickly. [...] On most days the group began work around midday, took breaks for lunch and dinner, and continued work through midnight. [...] Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl recorded their basic instrumental tracks together as a band. [...] The group utilized this set-up on all songs except for faster compositions like [...] "Very Ape" [...] and [...] "tourette's", where the drums were recorded separately in a nearby kitchen due to its natural reverb. [...] Albini surrounded Grohl's drum kit with about 30 microphones. [...] Cobain added additional guitar tracks to about half of the songs, then added guitar solos, and finally vocals. [...] The band did not discard takes and kept virtually everything it captured on tape. [...] Albini felt he was more an engineer than a producer; despite his personal opinions, he ultimately let the band judge which were decent takes. [...] He said, [...] "Generally speaking, [...] knows what he thinks is acceptable and what isn't acceptable [...] He can make concrete steps to improve things that he doesn't think are acceptable." [...] Cobain reportedly recorded all his vocal tracks in six hours. [...] The band completed recording in six days; Cobain had originally anticipated disagreements with Albini, who the singer heard [...] "was supposedly this sexist jerk", but called the process [...] "the easiest recording we've ever done, hands down". [...] The only disruption occurred a week into the sessions, when Courtney Love arrived because she missed Cobain. [...] The band, Love, and Albini refused to go into specifics, but Weston's girlfriend (who served as the studio's chef) stated that Love created tension by criticizing Cobain's work and being confrontational with everyone present.|$|E

He described how The Surrealists reformed in 2006, for a one-off concert at Azkena Festival, Spain. The Scientists also reunited in 2006 and recorded their performance at Shepherd's Bush, which was issued as a live album, Sedition in the following year.|$|E
