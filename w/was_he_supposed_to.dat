Apropos of what you were saying, Baron, there is one question which I should like to ask you.

6000|$|Lord Beaconsfield {{once said}} at an Academy dinner that {{originality}} {{was the great}} characteristic of English art. So little <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have spoken seriously that another, of whose ceasing to perorate there is no prospect, characterized his criticism in language so strong that it cannot well be repeated. Let us admit that Lord Beaconsfield was either mistaken, or that, like the Consul Aulus, [...] "he spake a bitter jest." [...] Our artists, when they have found their vein, go on working it. They do not wander {{off in search of}} new veins, as a general rule. It would be unkind to draw attention to personal proofs of this truism. He who has done well with babies in fancy dresses will go on doing well with infants in masquerade. There are moments when the arrival of Cronus to swallow the whole family of painted babes, as he did his own, would be not unwelcome; when an artistic Herod would be applauded for a general massacre of the Burlington House innocents. But this may be only the jaundiced theory of a jaded critic. The mothers of England are a much more important set of judges, and they like the babies. Then the bishops, though a little monotonous, must be agreeable to their flocks; while the hunting dogs, and pugs, and kittens, and monks, and Venetian girls--la blonde et la brune--and the Highland rivers of the colour of porter [...] "with a head on it," [...] and the mackerel-hued sea, and the marble, and the martyrs, and the Mediterranean--they are all dear to various classes of our teeming population. The critic may say he has seen them all before, he knows them off by heart; but then so does he know Raphael's infants, and Botticelli's madonnas, and Fra Angelico's angel trumpeters, and Vecelli's blue hills, and Robusti's doges, and Lionardo's smiling, enigmatic ladies. He does not say he is tired of these, but that is only his eternal affectation. He is afraid, perhaps, to say that the old masters bore him--that is a compliment reserved for contemporaries. Let it be admitted that in all ages artists have had their grooves, like other men, and have reproduced themselves and their own best effects. But, as this is inevitably true, how careful they should be that the effects are really of permanent value and beauty! Realistic hansom cabs, and babies in strange raiment, and schoolgirls of the last century, and Masters of Hounds, are scarcely of so much permanent value as the favourite types and characters which Lionardo and Carpaccio repeat again and again. We no more think Claude monotonous than we think [...] "the quiet coloured end of evening" [...] flat and stale. But we may, and must, tire of certain modern combinations too often rehearsed, after the trick has become a habit, and the method an open mystery.|$|E
50|$|Daniel {{returned}} home on July 10, 2008, {{and he found}} out from his girlfriend, Amber, that his mother, Phyllis Summers Newman, {{had been trying to}} break them up by making Amber believe that Daniel had been cheating on her. Soon after, she informed him that she slept with Adrian Korbel out of inadequacy, whereupon he angrily and suddenly broke up with her and left her apartment, much to her devastation. He struggled to get over the break-up via rebound dates with Colleen Carlton. On October 15, 2008, Amber and Daniel got back together.In early 2009, Daniel started his painting and drawing with Amber at his side as a fashion designer. In mid 2009, Daniel was asked to make a fake copy of a 'Terroni,' and he would get paid a sum of money for it. Later, it is believed that he and Jana Hawkes, Kevin's wife, killed the man who asked him to do this in an alley. Daniel managed to stay out of jail long enough to meet Deacon Sharpe, Amber's ex-lover and father of Amber's adopted child, Eric Sharpe, when she was in Los Angeles. Then, Daniel was put in jail, leaving Amber {{to get him out of}} jail herself. While Daniel was in jail, he received a phone call from Deacon, claiming to be Michael, Daniel's lawyer. On the other end, he heard Amber and Deacon having sex. When Amber visited him later, he yelled at her, asking her why she did that and what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do now that he was going to propose to her. Amber and Daniel consequently broke up. Daniel was soon released, due to the DVD that Deacon sent to the A.D.A, Heather Stevens.|$|E

How <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> keep a flame-breathing dragon with razor-sharp teeth and out-of-control appetite in his bedroom? If the playful baby dragon is ever to grow up to become a magnificent beast of myth and legend, it needs Jeremy. And though he doesn't know it yet, Jeremy needs a dragon.|$|R
40|$|The past {{is always}} with us, but it 2 ̆ 7 s really always with politicians. Once you put {{yourself}} up for office, and particularly national office, everybody and his brother {{is going to start}} digging into your past {{to see what kind of}} 2 ̆ 7 dirt 2 ̆ 7 they can find. It 2 ̆ 7 s true now, and it was true when Thomas Jefferson was running for president in the late eighteenth century. Jefferson had had an eventful, largely public life, so there was a lot of 2 ̆ 7 material 2 ̆ 7 to be mined by his foes. Most of the accusations 2 ̆ 7 didn’t stick, 2 ̆ 7 but one that did was that he was a coward. Jefferson was the governor of Virginia during a good portion of the Revolutionary War and, as such, charged with defending the place (and the Revolution) against the British. As Michael Kranish shows in his terrific book Flight from Monticello: Thomas Jefferson at War (Oxford UP, 2010), he had a rough time of it. Jefferson had no military experience, didn 2 ̆ 7 t like 2 ̆ 7 standing 2 ̆ 7 armies, and received only tepid support from his continental allies. The British invaded, invaded, and invaded again. Jefferson fled, fled, and fled again. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do? His political opponents didn’t care if he had no choice but to run or not—the fact that he didn 2 ̆ 7 t stand and fight was enough to prove he was a 2 ̆ 7 coward. 2 ̆ 7 This charge wounded Jefferson deeply and he fought it for much of his life. The episode sort of reminded me of a certain presidential candidate a few years back and (shameful, in my opinion) questions about his military service...|$|E
