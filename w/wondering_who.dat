25|$|During the attack, an Iraqi {{doctor who}} was {{next door to}} the police station was alerted to the fact of the six RMPs being under siege and drove to the edge of town in an {{ambulance}} where a Major from 1 Para had established an Incident Control Point (ICP). He informed the Paratroopers of the RMPs plight at about midday local time and conveyed to the Paratroopers that the RMPs were being held hostage. At 12:30pm, Dr. Fasal returned to the ICP and informed Major Kemp that three of the British were dead. By now, with all 1 Para troops accounted for, the staff in the Ops Room were <b>wondering</b> <b>who</b> they could be and realized that they must be the six-man RMP section. By the time the doctor had returned to the police station, all of the RMPs were dead, and for a third time, he returned to the checkpoint with the bad news. Later, Dr. Fasal brought all of the bodies out to the checkpoint and handed them over to the British.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout this period, Eddington lectured on relativity, and was {{particularly}} {{well known for}} his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific. He collected many of these into the Mathematical Theory of Relativity in 1923, which Albert Einstein suggested was [...] "the finest presentation of the subject in any language." [...] He was an early advocate of Einstein's General Relativity, and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment: Ludwik Silberstein, a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity, approached Eddington at the Royal Society's (6 November) 1919 meeting where he had defended Einstein's Relativity with his Brazil-Principe Solar Eclipse calculations with some degree of skepticism, and ruefully charged Arthur as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory (Silberstein, of course, was including himself and Einstein as the other).

2500|$|Of {{the episodes}} from 6 August, All About Soap said that [...] "the finger of {{suspicion}} [...] is pointing firmly [...] Michael Moon this fortnight." [...] Following {{the scene of}} Michael snapping at Janine and leaving her with their baby, the magazine thought he could be seeking comfort from Kat, and Janine also overhears Michael arranging to meet someone, which they thought could be Kat. Kat also tells Janine that Michael was having doubts on their wedding day, which they thought could be [...] "Kat's sly way of telling her nemesis that Michael would rather be with another woman", and when Janine sees Michael taking cash from her safe, he could be using it to fund the flat. The same week, Janine telephones Michael, but when he answers his phone, Kat is also calling her lover, which Inside Soap says would leave viewers <b>wondering</b> <b>who</b> he had answered the phone to. After Ray was eliminated as a suspect, Inside Soap said that Michael seemed to become the front-runner, as there had been looks between him and Kat, and Kat seemed distraught, and when Kat {{had a conversation with}} Janine, Kat told Michael that she did not tell her [...] "everything". Jack had become involved with Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) and Max had his own problems.

2500|$|Several {{attempts}} by Muslims to capture this citadel in some single combats failed. [...] The first {{attempt was made}} by Abu Bakr who took the banner and fought, {{but was unable to}} succeed. [...] Umar, then charged ahead and fought more vigorously than Abu Bakr, but still failed. [...] That night Muhammad proclaimed, [...] "By God, tomorrow I shall give it [...] to a man who loves God and His Messenger, whom God and His Messenger love. Allah will bestow victory upon him." [...] That morning, the Quraysh were <b>wondering</b> <b>who</b> should have the honor to carry the banner, but Muhammad called out for Ali ibn Abi Țalib. [...] All this time, Ali, son-in-law and cousin of Muhammad, was ill and could not participate in the failed attempts. Ali came to Muhammad, who cured him of his ophthalmia, an inhibitive inflammation of the eyes, by spitting in Ali's eye. The apostle sent him with his flag and Ali, with new vigor, set out to meet the enemy, bearing the banner of Muhammad. When he got near the fort the garrison came out and he fought them. During the battle, a Jew struck him so that his shield fell from his hand and Ali lost his shield. In need of a substitute, he picked up a door from the wall and used it to defend himself. The door was said to be so heavy that it took eight men to replace it on its hinges. In some Shi'ite sources it is also said that, when the time came to breach the fortress, he threw the door down as a bridge to allow his army to pass into the citadel and conquer the final threshold. The Apostle revived their (his followers) faith by the example of Ali, on whom he bestowed the surname of [...] "the Lion of God" [...] (Asadullah).|$|E
