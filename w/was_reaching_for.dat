25|$|In August 1992, Otter {{was pulled}} over on Interstate 84 near Meridian for {{suspicion}} of {{driving under the}} influence. He said the arresting officer observed him swerving as he <b>was</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> his cowboy hat, which had been blown off by the wind in his open car. Otter offered several explanations for failing the field sobriety test including: his stocking feet were stung by weeds and gravel, he had run eight miles (13km) and his knee hurt, he was hungry, {{and that he had}} soaked his chewing tobacco in Jack Daniel's. A jury convicted Otter in March 1993, and he was sentenced to 72 hours of community service and 16 hours at an alcohol treatment program, fined $700, and had his license revoked.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Happiness" [...] starts at {{a train station}} (Roma Street railway station in Brisbane) with a boy and girl {{stepping}} off a train. As the pair leave the train, the boy turns and tries to reach for something, but the girl pulls him back. It is shown that he <b>was</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> a [...] slinky. The slinky leaves the train, and passes Middleton busking in the train station. The slinky ventures to find the boy, facing a range of challenges along the way; these include avoiding fruit falling on it and riding a skateboard. In {{the middle of the}} music clip, the slinky is shown making its way through a music room in which Powderfinger are performing [...] "My Happiness". It rests on the bar and the band finishes playing, while the background music continues. As Powderfinger leaves, the slinky is picked up by Haug. He gets into a car and places the slinky on the car's dashboard, but it falls out the window as the car turns a tight corner. It lands outside the gate of a house and is picked up and brought inside to the boy.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time as the police handed control over to the SAS, they began making {{arrangements}} for the IRA operatives once they were in custody, including finding a police vehicle in which to transport the prisoners. A patrol car containing Inspector Luis Revagliatte and three other uniformed officers, apparently on routine patrol and with no knowledge of Operation Flavius, was ordered to return to police headquarters as a matter of urgency. The police car was stuck in heavy traffic travelling north on Smith Dorrien Avenue, close to the roundabout where it meets Winston Churchill Avenue. The official account states that at this point, Revagliatte's driver activated the siren on the police car in order to expedite the journey back to headquarters, intending to approach the roundabout from the wrong side of the road and turn the vehicle around. The siren apparently startled McCann and Farrell, just as Soldiers [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] were about to challenge them, outside the Shell petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue. [...] "Soldier A" [...] stated at the inquest that Farrell looked back at him and appeared to realise who [...] "A" [...] was; [...] "A" [...] testified that he was drawing his pistol and intended to shout a challenge to her, but [...] "events overtook the warning": that McCann's right arm [...] "moved aggressively across the front of his body", leading [...] "A" [...] to believe that McCann <b>was</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> a remote detonator. [...] "A" [...] shot McCann once in the back; [...] "A" [...] went on to tell the inquest that he believed Farrell then reached for her handbag, and that he believed Farrell may also have been reaching for a remote detonator. [...] "A" [...] also shot Farrell once in the back, before returning to McCann—he shot McCann a further three times (once in the body and twice in the head). [...] "Soldier B" [...] testified that he reached similar conclusions to [...] "A", and shot Farrell twice, then McCann once or twice, then returned to Farrell, shooting her a further three times. Soldiers [...] "C" [...] and [...] "D" [...] testified at the inquest that they were moving to apprehend Savage, who was by now [...] south of the petrol station, as gunfire began behind them. [...] "Soldier C" [...] testified that Savage turned around while simultaneously reaching towards his jacket pocket at {{the same time}} as [...] "C" [...] shouted [...] "Stop!"; [...] "C" [...] stated that he believed Savage <b>was</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> a remote detonator, at which point he opened fire. [...] "Soldier C" [...] shot Savage six times, while [...] "Soldier D" [...] fired nine times. All three IRA members died. One of the soldiers' bullets, believed to have passed through Farrell, grazed a passer-by.|$|E

Rains said, [...] "Mr. Grant was actively, actively, actively resisting arrest." [...] He said that some witnesses heard Mehserle say, [...] "Get back, I'm gonna taze him."

They were married in LaPorte on April 1, 1902; just {{one week after the}} ceremony, Peter's infant daughter died (of uncertain causes) while alone in the house with Belle. In December 1902, Peter himself met with a [...] "tragic accident." [...] According to Belle, he <b>was</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> his slippers next to the kitchen stove when he was scalded with brine. [...] She later declared that part of a sausage-grinding machine fell on to him from a high shelf, causing a fatal head injury. A year later, Peter's brother, Gust, took Peter's older daughter, Swanhild, to Wisconsin. [...] She is the only child to have survived living with Belle.|$|E

This was on account of Brown's character--great generosity and kindliness, but complicated with unusual shyness and diffidence, particularly in the presence of ladies. There was his love for Mary, in a hopeful state but not yet secure--just in a condition, indeed, where its affair must be handled with great tact, and no mistakes made, no offense given. And there was the mother wavering, half willing-by adroit and flawless diplomacy to be won over, now, or perhaps never at all. Also, there were the helpless Old People yonder in the woods waiting-their fate and Brown's happiness to be determined by what Brown should do within the next two seconds.
