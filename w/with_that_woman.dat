2500|$|News of the Clinton–Lewinsky {{relationship}} {{broke in}} January 1998. On January 26, 1998, Clinton stated, [...] "I {{did not have}} sexual relations <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>woman,</b> Miss Lewinsky" [...] in a nationally televised White House news conference.

2500|$|Otello laments {{his fate}} (Dio! mi potevi scagliar tutti i mali / [...] "God, {{you could have}} thrown every evil at me" [...] ). When Iago calls out [...] "Cassio is here!" [...] Otello hides as Iago and Cassio enter. Cassio says {{he had hoped to}} see Desdemona here, for he wanted to know whether she had been {{successful}} with Otello (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Vieni; l'aula è deserta / [...] "Come, the hall is deserted"). Iago asks him to tell of his adventures <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>woman.</b> Cassio asks which woman, and, softly, so that Otello cannot hear, Iago says [...] "Bianca" [...] (the name of Cassio's actual lover). As Cassio laughs about his romantic adventures, Otello assumes he is speaking of Desdemona. In a conversation only partially heard, Cassio seems to be telling Iago that another woman, a secret admirer, left him a handkerchief as a token. At Iago's urging, Cassio produces it, whereupon Iago seizes it—for it is Desdemona's—and holds it out where he knows Otello can see it. He then returns it to Cassio and teases him, while in his hiding place Otello fumes (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Questa è una ragna dove il tuo cuor casca / [...] "This is a spiderweb in which your heart is caught").|$|E
