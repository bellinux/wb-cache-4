50|$|The <b>Windsor</b> <b>knot</b> is {{especially}} suited for a spread or cutaway collar that can properly accommodate a larger knot. For correct wear, the tie {{used for a}} <b>Windsor</b> <b>knot</b> should be about 4 cm longer than a conventional tie.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Windsor</b> <b>knot,</b> also {{referred}} to as a Full Windsor or as a Double Windsor to distinguish it from the half-Windsor, is a method of tying a necktie. The <b>Windsor</b> <b>knot,</b> compared to other methods, produces a wide symmetrical triangular knot.|$|E
50|$|The Pratt knot {{is unusual}} in that its {{starting}} position is 'reverse side out', like the Nicky knot, a self-releasing variant of the Pratt. It uses less length than the half-Windsor or <b>Windsor</b> <b>knots,</b> and so is well suited to shorter ties or taller men. Unlike the four-in-hand knot, the Pratt method produces a symmetrical knot. It is of medium thickness.|$|R
5000|$|The small knot, or oriental knot or Kent knot, is the {{simplest}} method of tying a necktie, though some claim the simple knot is an alternate {{name for the}} four-in-hand knot. The small knot is not very well known despite its simplicity.One of the reasons {{may be that the}} small knot is not self-releasing, and may annoy people accustomed to four-in-hand and <b>Windsor</b> <b>knots</b> who pull at the tie to untangle the knot. Additionally, some prefer that, if the thin end of the tie should become visible, that it not be [...] "inside out", and the small knot will be this way (this can be remedied by twisting the tie one half turn while tying).|$|R

50|$|The half-Windsor knot, {{also known}} as the single <b>Windsor</b> <b>knot,</b> is a way of tying a necktie which {{produces}} a neat, triangular knot. It is larger than the four-in-hand knot and Pratt knot, but smaller than the <b>Windsor</b> <b>knot.</b> The half-Windsor is derived from the Windsor in that it is only brought up around the loop on one side rather than both. It works well with light- and medium-weight fabrics.|$|E

However, the <b>Windsor</b> <b>Knot</b> is often frowned upon in other Armed Services or Regiments of the British Forces through its association with the Duke of Windsor, who became a potential pretender to the throne following his abdication. The Windsor and four-in-hand knots are authorized for use by all services of the Canadian Forces.|$|E

50|$|The knot {{is often}} {{thought to be}} named after the Duke of Windsor (King Edward VIII before his abdication). It is likely, however, that it was invented by his father, George V. The Duke {{preferred}} a wide knot and had his ties specially made with thicker cloth {{in order to produce}} a wider knot when tied with the conventional four-in-hand knot. The <b>Windsor</b> <b>knot</b> was invented to emulate the Duke's wide knot with ties made from normal thickness cloth.|$|E
5000|$|Altogether, as seen later on, the <b>Windsor</b> <b>knot</b> {{had served}} its purpose. It made Bond {{think he was}} faced {{with the kind of}} Englishman he disliked, which distracted from glimpsing the truth - that it was in fact a Soviet agent sent to kill him. Later, when the killer reveals his {{identity}} and gloats over the trapped Bond, he says: [...] "These clothes are from the wardrobe department. They said I'd get by like this - and I did, didn't I?" ...|$|E

He then won the Solario Stakes with Raven's Pass, breaking the track record. “I think he’s a good horse and I like him a lot”, said Gosden afterwards, comparing him favorably to two other horses he’d won the race with, Foss Way and <b>Windsor</b> <b>Knot.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In Ian Fleming's novel [...] "From Russia, with Love", Chapter 25 is {{entitled}} [...] "A tie with a Windsor knot". James Bond, travelling on the Orient Express, is {{met by a}} supposed fellow British agent, who wears [...] "the dark blue and red zigzagged tie of the Royal Artillery, tied with a Windsor knot". Fleming describes in detail Bond's reaction: [...] "Bond mistrusted anyone who tied his tie with a <b>Windsor</b> <b>knot.</b> It showed too much vanity. It was often {{the mark of a}} cad". However, [...] "Bond decided to forget his prejudice".|$|E
