Lake wrote Earp that he planned to send portions of the book to his New York agent, but Earp objected because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it first. After Earp's death on January 13, 1929, Josephine continued to try to persuade Lake to leave her and Earp's former wife, Mattie Blaylock, out of the book, even threatening legal action. Lake finally published Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal in 1931, two years after Earp's death.|$|E
5|$|Norio Tsukudani based Himegoto on {{an earlier}} four-panel manga she drew for fun during her time as a student. At that time, the main {{characters}} {{that make up the}} student council were instead members of the drama club. However, Tsukudani decided to change this when developing Himegoto to be serialized in Ichijinsha's Waai! magazine, and she decided {{it would be easier to}} manage a cross-dressing character if he was in the student council. Before creating Himegoto, Tsukudani read various works of fiction that featured cross-dressing boys, but many of them featured the boys being paired with other boys. When she proposed the idea of Himegoto, she wanted to pair a cross-dressing boy with girls, which Tsukudani herself <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> In this way, she thought that a variety of different people would enjoy it.|$|E

Similar to Elseworlds, All Star is not restricted to continuity and establishes a fresh perspective for the latest generation of readership.

And once you've decided these subjects matter, it's hard to turn round and say: 'Actually, you know what? This isn't much cop.'" [...] He recalls his experience as music editor for The Guardian, where he has [...] "been commissioning those pieces, knowing they will be read ... if no one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> about Taylor Swift, you would never see another thinkpiece about her. Instead, we enter an arms race of hyperbole, as we credit her with forcing Apple to change its streaming terms, dismantling the musical patriarchy, creating new paradigms in music and society." ...|$|E

[...] The church was more [...] "laid-back" [...] than the one that Primus attended as a child and he, with the rest of his family, became regular churchgoers in 2001. Trish's depression was lifted and Primus converted to Christianity later that year. [...] "In my heart I felt whole and complete, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the Bible at every opportunity." [...] According to his autobiography, Primus is able to speak in tongues.|$|E

Michael notes that {{he was forced to}} read Newsweek in the waiting room at his dentist's office because some [...] "kid had the magazine I wanted to read", hinting that the magazine Michael <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> was the children's magazine Highlights for Children. Andy sends Darryl a text that only reads [...] "Megan Fox", a reference to the actress. Creed notes that he understands, but cannot speak, Pirate slang. Andy attempts to motivate Michael with a pep talk taken from the 1979 movie Rocky II. During Michael and Oscar's discussion {{in the lobby of the}} office building, a copy of Call of Duty can be seen behind the counter. Fans have speculated that this may be a reference to the third season episode [...] "The Coup", which used the game as a plot device.|$|E

500|$|The Independents radio critic Robert Hanks was unimpressed with Kneale's {{script for}} the {{dramatic}} sections, but praised {{the performance of}} Andrew Keir in the title role. [...] "Lesser actors would treat Kneale's downbeat script with a certain detachment, but Keir is prepared to charge even the most banal lines with a terror that's both a treat and a lesson." [...] Hanks also felt that The Fifties season as a whole, as demonstrated by The Quatermass Memoirs, had a somewhat misleading focus. [...] "You {{get the sense that}} a vogue for science fiction is being interpreted as the spirit of the Fifties, with emphasis being put on a handful of sci-fi films. If you really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the age through its movies, you'd have to include Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, late Ealing and early Norman Wisdom, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. It's a lot to accommodate; perhaps sticking to terror is just less intimidating." ...|$|E

[...] William Robinson then <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> a prepared statement about being called by the Lord to Boston, but the governor would not allow it to be read, and Robinson was sent back to prison. [...] Marmaduke Stephenson, being less vociferous than Robinson, was allowed to speak, and though initially declining, he ultimately spoke his mind, and then was also sent back to jail.|$|E

When asked about leaving Hassle to form their own record label, the band stated [...] "We were questioning what we were doing for our label that we couldn't do ourselves. We've always been very proactive with the running of our band and we've never given away much freedom." [...] The band announced in early February 2012 that both Joseph Thorpe and Joe Nicholson had left the band. This was because Joe Nicholson <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> chemistry at university, while Thorpe's reasons were related to personal differences. The band replaced both with Chris Cayford, who is the current frontman and former guitarist of No Coast, and Nathan Fairweather, who plays in Brontide, making this the first release with the new line-up.|$|E

500|$|As the {{political}} {{aspects of the}} controversy intensified, Governor Vane was unable to prevent the Court from holding its next session in Newtown, where the orthodox party {{of most of the}} magistrates and ministers stood a much better chance of winning if the elections were held away from Boston. During election day, 17 May 1637, Governor Vane <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> a petition in defense of Wheelwright, but Winthrop and his party insisted the elections take place first, and then the petition be heard. Following clamor and debate, the majority of freemen, wanting the election to take place, went with Winthrop {{to one side of the}} Newtown common and elected him governor in place of Vane. After this, additional measures were taken against the free grace advocates, and in the election of magistrates, those who supported Wheelwright were left out. In addition, the Court passed a law that no [...] "strangers" [...] could be received within the colony for longer than three weeks without the Court's permission. Winthrop declared this law as being necessary to prevent new immigrants from being added to the number of his [...] "free grace" [...] opponents.|$|E

2500|$|At times, various vice Rectors of the Josephinum (the apostolic {{delegate}} to the United States was the nominal rector) would feel under the gun {{to clamp down on}} the student's access to [...] "worldly literature." [...] One such episode occurred after a visit of Bishop Joseph Mark McShea of Allentown, PA that led to a new vice Rector, Ralph Thompson, and some strict new rules, among them a [...] "book policy" [...] that limited what students could read. [...] Beyond spiritual and classroom books, students had to have a permission slip signed by a professor for any book in their college rooms. [...] One college student went to see Fick and asked him to sign a slip for John Dos Passos' trilogy [...] "USA" [...] and with great sadness Fick told him that while he was greatly pleased that this student <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> such a great work of American literature in three volumes, he didn't want his signature on a permission slip for such an author given the repressive atmosphere then in place at the Josephinum. [...] Fick sadly told the student to wait until summer, buy the book and read it during the vacation period. [...] Former Fick students who appreciated Fick's love of literature can only imagine what it took out of him to thus deny a student who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> a good book. [...] This experience in censorship and mild repression had a profound influence on some students who never forgot what a powerful institution can do to an individual's spirit and went on to fight various institutions throughout their lives remembering Fick's resignation to powers over which a young English teacher had little influence.|$|E
