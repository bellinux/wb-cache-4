5|$|In 2013, {{ten years}} since its implementation, TfL {{reported}} that the congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network {{in order to improve}} the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E
25|$|In that case's {{majority}} opinion, Harry Blackmun {{conceded that}} the facts no longer supported the exemption and that baseball was indeed interstate commerce, but echoed Clark in suggesting that the consequences of overturning the previous decisions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> than letting it stand.

25|$|Emancipation {{remained}} by {{no means}} a foregone conclusion {{at the start of the}} war, though events soon began to move against slaveholding interests in Maryland. On December 16, 1861 a bill was presented to Congress to emancipate enslaved people in Washington, D.C., and in March 1862 Lincoln held talks with Marylanders on the subject of emancipation. Marylanders like Representative John Crisfield resisted the President, arguing that freedom <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> for the slaves than slavery, though such arguments became increasingly ineffective as the war progressed.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, at {{the time}} of the Pakistan Resolution, Maududi taught that Pakistan was destined to be an Islamic missionary nation. This was in {{comparison}} to scholars of the Indian Congress who promoted the formation of a sub-continent united against British rule. To Maududi, a united sub-continent <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> than British rule. He likened the Congress to Robert Clive, and Arthur Wellesley, and Muslim followers of the Congress to collaborators like Mir Jafar and Mir Sadiq. He compared nationalism and communism to the Shuddhi movement. Maududi criticised Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, alleging that he opposed religion, was an enemy of any division on basis of faith and planned to merge Islam into the Hindu faith.|$|E

25|$|Later it was {{discussed}} that a separate branch should {{be created in}} order to handle everything pertaining to the anti-Castro movement. The White House division organized Branch 4 (WH/4)as the new task force to run Cuban Operations. The task force included 40 personnel, with 18 at headquarters, 20 at the Havana station, and 2 at Santiago base. The state department was concerned that if Castro was overthrown then the people to come after him <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> than him. These people were Che Guevara and Raul Castro. So they proposed {{a way of getting}} a better leader that they approved of in his place. The CIA began to worry that their involvement with the anti-Castro movement would lead to an anti-US movement. On March 14 of 1960, Dulles presented a “General Covert Action Plan for Cuba” that would focus only on the Cuban problems. Guerrilla capacity in the anti-Castro groups {{both in and out of}} Cuba {{was discussed}}.|$|E

25|$|TfL {{reported}} in January 2014, that despite {{a reduction of}} traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, {{as well as an}} increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower levels of congestion reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite tracking data from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable overall picture, with some improvements in the past two years. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E
500|$|Redding's {{body was}} {{recovered}} {{the next day}} when the lake was searched. The family postponed the funeral from December 15 to December 18 so that more could attend. The service took place at the City Auditorium in Macon. More than 4,500 people came to the funeral, overflowing the 3,000-seat hall. Johnny Jenkins and Isaac Hayes did not attend, fearing their reaction <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> than Zelma Redding's. Redding was entombed at his ranch in Round Oak, about [...] north of Macon. Jerry Wexler delivered the eulogy. Redding died just three days after recording [...] "The Dock of the Bay". He was survived by Zelma and three children, Otis III, Dexter and Karla. Otis, Dexter and cousin Mark Lockett later founded the Reddings, a band managed by Zelma. She also maintained or worked at the janitorial service Maids Over Macon, several nightclubs and booking agencies. On November 8, 1997, a memorial plaque was placed on the lakeside deck of the Madison convention center, Monona Terrace.|$|E
500|$|The Bermudian {{government}} {{closed its}} {{schools and the}} Bermuda International Airport on September20 and 21 in anticipation of Igor. No evacuation plans were put in place, although a local high school was converted into a shelter for residents who felt unsafe in their homes. Residents boarded up structures with plywood {{in order to protect}} windows. Tourists on the island wanting to escape the storm left more than a week before Igor's arrival. Additionally, a British Royal Navy vessel and helicopter were stationed offshore to assist with recovery efforts once the storm passed. Prior to Igor's arrival, there were fears that the enormous hurricane <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> than Hurricane Fabian in 2003 and could [...] "flatten" [...] the territory. These fears resulted from forecasts from the National Hurricane Center which indicated the storm would strike Bermuda as a Category3 hurricane.

500|$|Among the prisoners, Seaman First Class Joseph Randolph [...] "Joe" [...] Small, a winch {{operator}} in Division Four and a natural leader who called cadence when his division marched, {{was asked by}} officers to assemble a handful of reliable men as a team of acting petty officers {{and to keep the}} other prisoners on good behavior. On August 10, there had been conflicts between the prisoners and their guards as the prisoners were marched to the mess hall for meals. There was also a brief fight in the mess hall, and some prisoners were seen sharpening spoons into makeshift knives. Small sensed a general air of rebelliousness among the prisoners. To counteract the rising tension and offset the disaster he saw coming, Small convened a short meeting that evening aboard the crowded barge and told the prisoners to [...] "knock off the horseplay", stay out of trouble and obey the shore patrol guards (who were black) and the officers, because the alternative (white Marines as guards) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse.</b> He said to the men, [...] "We've got the officers by the ballsthey can do nothing to us if we don't do anything to them.

500|$|Due to his Catholic background, Thảo {{was able}} to recruit Diệm loyalists such as Phát. With Khánh's grip on power shaky, an {{anonymous}} source said that Thảo was worried about how he would be treated if someone else took over: [...] "Thao acted first, {{out of fear that}} if he did not, the other generals would overthrow Khanh and get rid of him as well. He knew that if the others overthrew Khanh his fate <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> than Khanh's." [...] During this time, Thảo kept in touch with elements of the CIA in an attempt to get American backing. Meanwhile, Khiêm had been putting pressure on Khánh for over two months by charging him and the Buddhists of seeking a [...] "neutralist solution" [...] and [...] "negotiating with the communists". At the same time, Khánh's relationship with the Americans—particularly Ambassador and retired General Maxwell Taylor—had broken down over a series of policy disputes and personal arguments, and the Americans were trying to encourage Khánh's colleagues to overthrow him so that more hawkish policies could be enacted. The other generals wanted to overthrow Khánh and were aware that Thảo—who was widely distrusted—was planning to make a move. They anticipated trouble in trying to keep their subordinates, who were becoming impatient with Khánh's ongoing tenure, from joining Thảo. Between January and February, Thảo continued to finalize the details of his own counter-coup, using the contacts he had cultivated over the past decades.|$|E
500|$|In late December 1964, Thảo {{was summoned}} back to Saigon by Khánh, who {{correctly}} suspected him and Khiêm of plotting together in Washington. Thảo believed Khánh {{was attempting to}} have him killed, so he went underground upon returning to Saigon, and began plotting in earnest, unfazed {{by the prospect of}} being charged for desertion. The ruling junta appealed to Thảo in newspaper advertisements and broadcasts to follow orders to report, but he ignored them. Due to his Catholicism, Thảo was able to recruit Diệm loyalists such as Phát. In mid-January 1965, the regime called for him to report to his superiors in the ARVN, warning that he would be [...] "considered guilty of abandoning his post with all the consequences of such a situation" [...] if he failed to do so. At this time, it was still not known that Thảo was a communist agent who was deliberately trying to cause infighting within South Vietnam at every opportunity. With Khánh's hold on power shaky, an anonymous source said Thảo was worried about how he would be treated if someone else took over: [...] "Thảo acted first, out of fear that if he did not, the other generals would overthrow Khánh and get rid of him as well.

500|$|Eventually, Clark {{is forced}} to find all three stones, which results in the {{creation}} of the Fortress of Solitude in the season five premiere. There, Jor-El informs Clark he needs to begin his training in order to complete his destiny, but Clark interrupts the training to go back to Smallville, which forces Jor-El to strip Clark of his powers. When Clark is killed in his mortal body in season five's [...] "Hidden", Jor-El resurrects Clark with his powers; as a result, Jonathan's life is traded for Clark's in the episode [...] "Reckoning". Clark's consistent disobedience forces Jor-El to imprison his son in a block of ice in the season seven episode [...] "Blue", but after learning a clone of Clark has returned to Smallville in [...] "Persona", Jor-El frees his son so he can take care of the creature. When Clark thinks a world without him would be better, Jor-El sends Clark to an alternate reality to show him the world <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> if he did not exist in it. By the start of season nine, Jor-El begins fully training Clark for his ultimate destiny. As part of that training, Jor-El informs Clark he needs to tune his Kryptonian intuition. To do so, Jor-El gives Clark the ability to read people's thoughts, only to take it away at an important moment and force Clark to apply what he has learned about human behavior. A clone of Jor-El is released on Earth in the episode [...] "Kandor", but he is murdered before he can fully reunite with Clark and is only able to share a single moment with his son before dying.|$|E
