40|$|In this study, {{the failure}} {{behavior}} of a levee under overflow conditions was investigated by conducting centrifuge tests {{on a small scale}} model for the Janghyun levee in Kangrung, Kangwon-do, and based on the test results a levee protection method using <b>waterproof</b> <b>mat</b> was proposed. The model levees were constructed by scaling down the prototype levee to 1 : 50, where LVDT and pore-pressure sensors were installed to monitor the behavior of the levees during overflow. Overflow tests were carried out in three different conditions depending on where the <b>waterproof</b> <b>mat</b> was installed; 1) no <b>waterproof</b> <b>mat,</b> 2) installed in upper slope and crest of the levee, 3) installed in the entire levee. The centrifuge test results indicated that the application of the <b>waterproof</b> <b>mat</b> reduced erosion and soil loss in the levee. Especially, it was found that under overflow, the levee breach could be avoided with the <b>waterproof</b> <b>mat</b> installed in upper slope and crest only, although soil loss occurred in downstream slope inevitably. It is expected that levee failures occurred frequently in rainy season may be effectively prevented by using <b>waterproof</b> <b>mat</b> if overflo...|$|E
60|$|AFTER {{my return}} from Gilolo to Ternate, in March 1858, I made {{arrangements}} for my long-wished-for voyage {{to the mainland}} of New Guinea, where I anticipated that my collections would surpass those which I had formed at the Aru Islands. The poverty of Ternate in articles used by Europeans was shown, by my searching in vain through all the stores for such common things as flour, metal spoons, wide-mouthed phials, beeswax, a penknife, and a stone or metal pestle and mortar. I took with me four servants: my head man Ali, and a Ternate lad named Jumaat (Friday), to shoot; Lahagi, a steady middle-aged man, to cut timber and assist me in insect-collecting; and Loisa, a Javanese cook. As I knew I should {{have to build a}} house at Dorey, where I was going, I took with me eighty cadjans, or <b>waterproof</b> <b>mats,</b> made of pandanus leaves, to cover over my baggage on first landing, and to help to roof my house afterwards.|$|R
