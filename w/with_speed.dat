5|$|The {{first test}} for the flying {{sequences}} involved simply catapulting a crash test dummy out of a cannon. Another technique had a remote control cast of Superman flying around.

5|$|The {{other major}} factor {{that helped the}} All Blacks to success was their {{superior}} fitness. In New Zealand each half was 45 minutes, not 35 like in Britain. As well as that, the All Blacks spent much time on fitness. This enabled them to play <b>with</b> <b>speed</b> much longer than their opposition.|$|E
5|$|In Fig.2, the {{corresponding}} {{part of the}} revolving orbit is mn with s as its centre of force. Assume that initially, {{the body in the}} static orbit starts out at right angles to the radius <b>with</b> <b>speed</b> V. The body in the revolving orbit must also start at right angles and assume its speed is v. In the case shown in Fig. 1., v > V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v < V. Also, the force may be directed away from the centre.|$|E
50|$|Polarization scramblers usually {{vary the}} {{normalized}} Stokes vector of the polarization state {{over the entire}} Poincaré sphere.

5|$|Johnson {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner, <b>with</b> <b>Speed</b> behind him. Two laps later, Harvick had moved into fourth position; Jamie McMurray, who began the race in eleventh, had moved up four positions to seventh place. By lap six, Ambrose began to reduce the lead of Johnson, and Martin got loose on the same lap but regained control of his car. On lap nine, Stewart passed Martin for fourth. One lap later, Ambrose passed Johnson to become the new race leader. On lap 13, Johnson retook the lead off Ambrose. After having made three positions early, Harvick moved up into second position by passing Ambrose. On lap 16, Ambrose's car suffered a flat tire and came into the pit road.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was SI.com's Midseason 2007 NFL Draft Projection #1pick, though Johnson had {{stated that}} he {{intended}} to earn his degree from Georgia Tech. On January 8, 2007, Johnson declared himself eligible for the NFL Draft, bypassing his senior season at Georgia Tech. He was regarded as the best athlete {{to come out of the}} draft and was the #1player on most draft boards. Johnson was said by ESPN to be able to be productive as a rookie, much like receiver Randy Moss was as a rookie. In a mid-February workout <b>with</b> <b>speed</b> and conditioning coach Mark Pearsall, Johnson clocked a 4.33-second 40-yard dash, recorded an 11-foot standing broad jump, and had a vertical leap of 43inches.|$|E
5|$|On 23 December 2013, a {{landslip}} at Wadhurst was {{the first}} in a series of landslips up to February 2014 which led the line between Wadhurst and St. Leonards Warrior Square being closed and reopened three times, <b>with</b> <b>speed</b> restrictions in place following repairs. The train service was replaced by buses during closures. Southeastern was criticised by Hastings and Rye MP Amber Rudd over poor customer service during this period. By 12 March, the section between Wadhurst and Robertsbridge had reopened, with full service being restored on 31 March.|$|E

5|$|The Bedouin {{way of life}} {{depended}} on camels and horses: Arabians were bred to be war horses <b>with</b> <b>speed,</b> endurance, soundness, and intelligence. Because many raids required stealth, mares were preferred over stallions as they were quieter, and therefore would not give away {{the position of the}} fighters. A good disposition was also critical; prized war mares were often brought inside family tents to prevent theft and for protection from weather and predators. Though appearance was not necessarily a survival factor, the Bedouin bred for refinement and beauty in their horses as well as for more practical features.|$|E
5|$|The French 7th Army, on the {{northern}} flank of the Belgian line, protected the Bruges–Ghent–Ostend axis and, covering the Channel ports, had advanced into Belgium and into the Netherlands <b>with</b> <b>speed.</b> It reached Breda in the Netherlands, on 11 May. But German parachute forces had seized the Moerdijk bridge on the Hollands Diep river, south of Rotterdam, {{making it impossible for}} the French to link up with the Dutch Army. The Dutch Army withdrew north to Rotterdam and Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|The German High Command did {{not want}} to exploit the victory at Sedan and Bulson until the German {{infantry}} divisions had caught up with the three Panzer divisions. To Guderian, this was madness and would throw away the victory at Sedan and allow the enemy time to recover and reorganise his still formidable armoured units. Guderian decided to push for the Channel, even if it meant ignoring the High Command and Hitler himself. Guderian ordered the 10th Panzer Division and Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment to hold the Sedan bridgehead, while the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions struck north west, towards the Channel. Now that they were pushing largely at an 'open door', the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions advanced into the undefended French rear <b>with</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E

5|$|Three years later, Italian count Eugenio Brunetta d'Usseaux {{proposed}} that the IOC stage a week of winter sports included {{as part of the}} 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden. The organisers opposed this idea because they desired to protect the integrity of the Nordic Games and were concerned about a lack of facilities for winter sports. The idea was resurrected for the 1916 Games, which were to be held in Berlin, Germany. A winter sports week <b>with</b> <b>speed</b> skating, figure skating, ice hockey and Nordic skiing was planned, but the 1916 Olympics was cancelled after the outbreak of World War I.|$|E
5|$|Saddlebreds are {{popularly known}} as show horses, with horses being shown saddle seat in both three-gaited and five-gaited classes. The former are the three common gaits seen in most breeds, the walk, trot and canter. The latter {{includes}} the three regular gaits, plus two four-beat ambling gaits known as the slow gait and the rack. The slow gait today is a four-beat gait in which the lateral pairs of legs leave the ground together, but strike the ground at different times, the hind foot connecting slightly before the forefoot. In the show ring, the gait should be performed with restraint and precision. The rack is also a four-beat gait, but with equal intervals between each footfall, making it a smooth gait to ride. In the show ring, the gait is performed <b>with</b> <b>speed</b> and action, appearing unrestrained. Historically, the slow gait could be either a running walk, the stepping pace, or the fox trot, however, the modern five-gaited Saddlebred usually performs the stepping pace.|$|E
