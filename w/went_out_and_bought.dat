To compete against that perennial powerhouse squad of legends and hated rivals, New Westminster Salmonbellies, Con Jones <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> the best player in Canada that money could buy: Newsy Lalonde.|$|E

He explained: [...] "I <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> all the music I grew up on that I didn't already have and spent three months listening to only that. Only stuff from before I started making records, so it was pre-1989—Waylon, Willie, Buck Owens, Haggard, Don Williams, Jim Croce. And what I discovered was a simplicity in song that I had moved away from. It was quite an emotional journey because these were all the songs that moved me and inspired me to do what I've been doing ever since." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott and Charlene had {{problems}} {{during their first}} 12 months together and they broke up several times. One such break-up occurred after Charlene's mother thought she should date other boys, while Scott had to repeat his final year of school without her. Scott was initially unsure how to win Charlene back, but after speaking with his grandmother, Helen (Anne Haddy), who mentioned that her husband gave her a friendship ring, Scott <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> one for Charlene. While they were enjoying a barbecue at Charlene's caravan by Lassiter's lake, the couple argued about Charlene spending time with Warren Murphy (Ben Mendelsohn) and Scott decided to leave. When Charlene started to go after Scott, she found herself trapped by a fire that had been accidentally started by Greg Davis (Alex Papps). Greg had been storing petrol under the caravan and spilled it as he was removing the cans, causing the petrol to head towards the still burning barbecue. Scott rescued [...] "a terrified" [...] Charlene from the flames, but an explosion threw them both {{to the ground and}} Charlene was knocked unconscious.|$|E

[...] "I'm not {{proud of the way}} this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|R

500|$|Although {{a gifted}} {{engineer}} Brindley had {{no formal education}} and rarely, if ever, committed his designs to paper. When questioned by the parliamentary committee about {{the composition of the}} puddle he frequently referred to in his evidence, he had a mass of clay brought into the committee room. He then formed the clay into a trough and showed how it would only form a watertight seal if it had been worked with water to form puddle. [...] "Thus it is" [...] said Brindley [...] "that I form a watertight-trunk to carry water over rivers and valleys wherever they cross the path of the canal." [...] Later, when asked to produce a drawing of the bridge or aqueduct he proposed to build, he replied that he had no representation of it on paper but would demonstrate his intention by use of a model. He then <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> a large round of Cheshire cheese, which he divided into two equal halves saying [...] "Here is my model". Then, to the amusement of the committee, he used the two halves of cheese to represent the semicircular arches and laid a long, rectangular object over the top to demonstrate the position of the river flowing under the aqueduct and the canal flowing over it.|$|E

When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters. Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to [...] " [...] her baby." [...] Rowling admitted that she [...] "was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves," [...] but recalled her initial meeting with him: [...] "The first time I met him, he said to me, 'You know who my favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And I just kind of melted."

60|$|There was, however, no {{more real}} harm in Valencia, {{than there is}} in every child of Adam. Town frivolity had not {{corrupted}} her. She was giddy, given up to enjoyment of the present: but {{there was not a}} touch, of meanness about her: and if she was selfish, as every one must needs be whose thoughts are of pleasure, admiration, and success, she was so unintentionally; and she would have been shocked and pained at being told that she was anything but the most kind-hearted and generous creature on earth. Major Campbell, who was her Mentor as well as her brother's, had certainly told her so more than once; at which she had pouted a good deal, and cried a little, and promised to amend; then packed up a heap of cast-off things to send to Lucia--half of it much too fine to be of any use to the quiet little woman; <b>and</b> lastly, <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> fresh finery for herself, and forgot all her good resolutions.

Watford goalkeeper Tony Coton broke a finger {{two weeks before the}} game leaving manager Graham Taylor needing to find cover for Steve Sherwood after the transfer deadline. In desperation, Taylor suggested to Eddie Plumley that they sign his son, who had by then retired from football. Plumley signed, Sherwood dislocated a finger, so Plumley played; Tottenham Hotspur won the match 4-1. No fee had been agreed at the time but Graham Taylor wanted to pay Plumley. A few weeks later he received a cheque <b>and</b> <b>went</b> straight <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> a fridge with it. They called it the Watford fridge.|$|R

2500|$|Hoppus and {{his girlfriend}} at this time lived in a {{basement}} apartment, barely scraping together funds to pay rent. With money in savings, Hoppus <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>bought</b> his first professional equipment: a new amp and bass cabinet. He came home {{and his girlfriend}} proceeded to argue with him, angry that he spent money on something they did not need. [...] "I just kept telling her {{that this was what}} mattered to me, this was my life," [...] Hoppus recalled. She demanded he make a choice between the band and her, which resulted in Hoppus leaving the band shortly after formation. Shortly thereafter, DeLonge told Hoppus he had borrowed a four track recorder from a friend and was preparing to record a demo tape, which prompted Hoppus to break up with his girlfriend and return to the band. Flyswatter—a combination of original songs and punk covers—was recorded in Raynor's bedroom and landed the band their first shows. Three more demos were recorded over the course of 1993 and the band began performing its irreverent live show at local all-ages venue SOMA, which alerted local independent label Cargo Music. Cargo signed the band on a trial basis, and Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract, as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a minor. During this time, Hoppus lived at home in San Diego at his mother's, where the band would prepare cassette demos and the entire family would fold cassette inserts. Raynor, whose parents moved to Reno, Nevada, stayed with Hoppus in summer 1994.|$|E

Her last words at parting (as they were repeated {{to me by my}} mother) had expressed the hope that I should not think hardly of her in the future. How could I assure her that I should think of her tenderly to the end of my life? My mother's delicate tact and true sympathy showed me the way.
