Tina is excited, but Louise, who dislikes boy bands, only agrees {{to go at}} the insistence of her mother Linda (John Roberts). Gene has qualified for a regional tablescaping competition, which Bob (H. Jon Benjamin) and Linda escort him to. Louise rejoices after a pet emergency leaves Gayle unable to bring the sisters to the concert, but reluctantly agrees to help find another ride after seeing Tina's disappointment. They hitch a ride with Zeke (Bobby Tisdale) and his older cousin Leslie (Jack McBrayer), <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to the concert to sell bootleg T-shirts and hot dogs. Bob and Linda later meet the arrogant father of a fellow competitor named Oscar Anthony, which drives them to push Gene to win.|$|E

25|$|The Going Home Song - A song sung {{every day}} (except Fridays {{due to the}} Official Chart) at 16:10, with three people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> home singing {{to the tune of}} Nut Rocker by B.

The feature has created some controversy on Rage Against the Answer Machine, with some saying 16:10 is too early for people to be going home, to which Greg responds that they cannot do lots of different Going Home Songs throughout the whole show. In May 2016, singer Craig David recorded his own version of the Going Home Song.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins as}} Gandalf (voiced by Jim Ward) {{arrives in the}} Shire to invite Bilbo Baggins (Michael Beattie) on an adventure. Bilbo declines, but invites Gandalf to tea the next day. When Gandalf returns, he is {{accompanied}} by thirteen dwarves <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on a quest to the Lonely Mountain to win back their kingdom. Led by Thorin Oakenshield (Clive Revill), they plan to reclaim their treasure from the dragon who stole it, Smaug. Gandalf tells them they will need a thief to complete their mission, and he volunteers Bilbo, who promptly faints. When he is unconscious, Bilbo dreams of the possibilities of heroism in such a quest, and upon waking, decides to join the dwarves.|$|E
25|$|Silas is not put {{on trial}} as he is moved to a mental {{institution}} when he is deemed insane. In July 2012, Lynsey is strangled by an unseen person in similar circumstances to Silas' victims. When Silas demands to see Texas in relation to possible information on Lynsey's murder, Texas visits him {{in the mental health}} institution where he is serving his sentences. Silas taunts Texas by explaining how he killed her sister India. He tells Texas that another young woman will die the following day. Texas visits him again a few days later, and tells Silas that she is no longer frightened of him. Silas warns her that another copycat killing will soon occur. He explains that to prevent this he will tell her the identity of the killer if she gives him India's ring. Texas agrees and he tells her that the killer is Will Savage (James Atherton). Texas snatches the ring back, angering Silas. When on a routine appointment at the hospital, Silas fakes a heart attack. He escapes and visits Lynsey's body in the mortuary. Silas sees an apparition of Lynsey who he compliments, telling her she played a good game. Lynsey taunts him saying his game is over as he did not get to what he most wanted as someone else killed her. Silas tells her his game is not over. Silas kidnaps Texas in her flat and leads Texas to believe he will kill her before telling her that he will bide his time and then kill her, this way she will be living in fear of him. Silas then boards a bus, full of young women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to a hen party.|$|E

500|$|Horses {{also provide}} {{psychological}} benefits to people whether they actually ride or not. [...] "Equine-assisted" [...] or [...] "equine-facilitated" [...] therapy {{is a form}} of experiential psychotherapy that uses horses as companion animals to assist people with mental illness, including anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, behavioral difficulties, and those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> through major life changes. There are also experimental programs using horses in prison settings. Exposure to horses appears to improve the behavior of inmates and help reduce recidivism when they leave.|$|E

500|$|On April 5, 1967, {{the same}} day the Apollo1 {{investigation}} released its report on the fire, Armstrong assembled with 17 other astronauts for a meeting with Deke Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, [...] "The guys <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room." [...] According to Eugene Cernan, Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned to be a medium Earth orbit test of the Lunar Module-Command/Service Module combination. After design and manufacturing delays in the Lunar Module (LM), Apollo9 and Apollo8 swapped crews. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong would command Apollo11.|$|E

Cherry opined that the character [...] "can legitimately rival Mike for [...] affections." [...] Daily commented on the storyline, saying: [...] "Talk about dark comedy — we're trying to find the humor in these two people bonding over the fact that they each have a partner in a coma."

Believing she is depressed, her mother Frannie urges her to attend a weekly cancer patient support group to help her make friends with individuals <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> through the same thing. There Hazel meets Augustus Waters, a charming teenager who lost a leg from bone cancer but has since apparently been cancer-free. He invites Hazel to his house where they bond over their hobbies and agree to read each other's favorite book. Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels her experience, and Augustus gives Hazel Counter Insurgence. They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer. After Augustus finishes the book, he expresses frustration with its abrupt ending (it ends {{in the middle of}} a sentence). Hazel explains that the novel's mysterious author, Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe), retreated to Amsterdam following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{himself said}} {{he decided to}} open the film in December {{so that it would}} have less {{competition}} from then to January. Titanic capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998. Additionally, Avatar established itself as a [...] "must-see" [...] event. Gray said, [...] "At this point, people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to see Avatar are going to see Avatar and would even if the slate was strong." [...] Marketing the film as a [...] "novelty factor" [...] also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theatres. [...] "It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home," [...] stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com. The [...] "Oscar buzz" [...] surrounding the film and international viewings helped. [...] "Two-thirds of Titanics haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly...Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them", and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than before.|$|E
500|$|In March 1967, the United States Senate Committee on Labor's Subcommittee on Poverty held {{a series}} of hearings, as part of the ongoing [...] "War on Poverty." [...] One of the testifying {{witnesses}} was Marian Wright, a 27 year-old Yale Law School graduate working with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund in Mississippi. She told the subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in the Mississippi Delta. In addition to this, two-parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits, and most counties in Mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps. With little to no income, most households could not produce the necessary funds. As a result, Wright argued, Mississippians were [...] "starving. They're starving, and those who can get the bus fare to go north are trying to go north... I wish that [...] would have a chance to go and just look at the empty cupboards in the Delta and the number of people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> around and begging just to feed their children." ...|$|E

500|$|Between 07:30 and 08:30 {{elements}} of G/16, E/16, and E/116 came together {{and climbed the}} bluffs at Easy Red, between WN-64 (defending the E-1 draw) and WN-62 (the E-3 draw). At 09:05, German observers reported that WN-61 was lost, and that one machine gun was still firing from WN-62. 150 men, mostly from G/16, having reached the top hampered more by minefields than by enemy fire, continued south to attack the WN-63 command post {{on the edge of}} Colleville. Meanwhile, E/16, led by Second Lieutenant John M. Spalding and Captain Robert L. Sheppard V, turned westward {{along the top of the}} bluffs, engaging in a two-hour battle for WN-64. His small group of just four men had effectively neutralized this point by mid-morning, taking 21 prisoners—just in time to prevent them from attacking freshly landing troops. On the beach below, the 16th RCT commander, Colonel George Taylor had landed at 08:15. With the words [...] "Two kinds of people are staying on this beach, the dead and those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to die – now let's get the hell out of here!" [...] he organized groups of men regardless of their unit, putting them under the command of the nearest non-commissioned officer and sending them through the area opened up by G/16. By 09:30, the regimental command post was set up just below the bluff crest, and the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 16th RCT were being sent inland as they reached the crest.|$|E
