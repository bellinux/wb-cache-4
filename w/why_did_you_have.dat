[...] In response to his rhetorical question, he explained salary and office allowances for senators. He went through different ways that political expenses could be met. One way was to be rich, but the senator stated {{that he was not}} rich. Another way was to put one's spouse on the Congressional office payroll, as, he stated, his Democratic rival, Senator John Sparkman, had done. Nixon did not feel comfortable doing that himself with so many deserving stenographers in Washington needing work, though Pat Nixon was a [...] "wonderful stenographer" [...] and sometimes helped out in the office as a volunteer. At this point, the camera turned from Nixon {{for the first time to}} reveal Pat Nixon sitting alongside the desk. The senator indicated he could not continue his law practice, as some Congressmen did, due to the distance to California, and in any event he felt that practicing law while a lawmaker was a conflict of interest. Thus, he indicated, he had found that the best way to pay for political expenses not within his means was to allow contributors to do so. Nixon proffered the legal and accounting opinions as proof of his statements.|$|E

2500|$|The chief {{administrative}} officer in Changshan recommended Zhao Yun {{to serve in the}} government. Zhao Yun then led a small group of volunteers to join Gongsun Zan, a warlord in You Province who was nominally a General of the Household (中郎將) under the Han central government. Around the time, another warlord Yuan Shao was recently appointed as the Governor (牧) of Ji Province and his fame was steadily rising, so Gongsun Zan was worried that many people in You Province would choose to serve under Yuan instead of him. When Zhao Yun came to join him, he mocked Zhao, [...] "I heard that all those in your home province wanted to serve the Yuans. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a change of heart, and decide to correct your mistake?"
