It relates very closely to 'Don't Hate Me', which is a song again about someone who's obsessed with someone from afar. 'Don't Hate Me' is an even more extreme version, because here this person actually begins to follow and make phone calls and, you know, it becomes very unhealthy. 'Slave Called Shiver' is slightly less extreme. It's about someone who's very much in love and obsessed <b>with</b> <b>somebody</b> else.

Other artists who have used the 808 include Damon Albarn, Diplo, Fatboy Slim, Talking Heads, David Guetta, and New Order.
