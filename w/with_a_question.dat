25|$|The {{question}} mark motif was common throughout the 1980s, {{in part as}} a branding attempt.

In the 1978 serial The Invasion of Time, the Fourth Doctor is asked to sign a document; although the signature itself is not directly seen on screen, his hand movements clearly indicate that he signs it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> mark.

25|$|Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood (also {{known as}} Ode, Immortality Ode or Great Ode) is {{a poem by}} William Wordsworth, {{completed}} in 1804 and published in Poems, in Two Volumes (1807). The poem was completed in two parts, with the first four stanzas written among a series of poems composed in 1802 about childhood. The {{first part of the}} poem was completed on 27 March 1802 and a copy was provided to Wordsworth's friend and fellow poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who responded with his own poem, , in April. The fourth stanza of the ode ends <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> and Wordsworth was finally able to answer it with 7 additional stanzas completed in early 1804. It was first printed as Ode in 1807, and it was not until 1815 that it was edited and reworked to the version that is currently known, Ode: Intimations of Immortality.|$|E

Their eyes may actually close, their bodies tend to become immobile (a form of catalepsy), certain reflexes (e.g., swallowing, respiration, etc.) may be suppressed, and they seem momentarily oblivious to their surroundings until they have completed their inner search on the unconscious level for the new idea, response, or frames of reference that will restabilize their general reality orientation. We hypothesize that in everyday life consciousness is in a continual state of flux between the general reality orientation and the momentary microdynamics of trance...|$|E
