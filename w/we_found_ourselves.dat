25|$|I had, by then, {{already taken}} my first walk {{for three and}} a half years as a free man. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> in a Thai village on the edge of the jungle. In the little café our hosts politely turned on the English programme. Yes, we were at Old Trafford, and a gentleman called Cristofani was getting a hundred....|$|E
25|$|Just as I {{was pushing}} {{one of our}} men back into the ranks I saw him fall at my feet from a sabre slash. I turned round instantly– to see English cavalry forcing their way into our midst and hacking us to pieces. Just as it is difficult, if not impossible, for the best cavalry to break into {{infantry}} who are formed into squares and who defend themselves with coolness and daring, so {{it is true that}} once the ranks have been penetrated, then resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves. This what happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up and stretched out their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal to our own men as to the English. And so <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> defenceless against a relentless enemy who, in the intoxication of battle, sabred even our drummers and fifers without mercy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fayfield Junction, my Lady, {{change for}} Elveston!" [...] the guard announced, flinging {{open the door}} of the carriage: and <b>we</b> soon <b>found</b> <b>ourselves,</b> with all our {{portable}} property around us, on the platform.|$|R
60|$|The {{exquisite}} {{good taste}} {{with which the}} Prince had answered our question served to put us entirely at our ease, and <b>we</b> presently <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> chatting with His Highness with the greatest freedom and without the slightest gene or mauvaise honte, or, in fact, malvoisie of any kind.|$|R
60|$|Our earlier plans {{had been}} so sadly upset that <b>we</b> now <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> without food or drink, and I alone was armed. We {{therefore}} urged our beasts to a speed that must tell on them sorely before we could hope to sight {{the ending of the}} first stage of our journey.|$|R
500|$|The Cherrytree Sessions is {{a series}} of EPs first envisaged by Cherrytree Records label head and {{producer}} Martin Kierszenbaum in order to promote his artists. With the assistance of Tony Ugval, Kierszenbaum was able to secure footage and music recordings of several performances from artists on the label's roster. Following requests from fans of the label's music, Kierszenbaum decided to release them commercially, and stated that [...] "before long, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> with an extraordinary collection of recordings: intimate at times, unexpected at others." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{happened}} to be at Cambridge. I was sent there by the [...] government on a government grant. And I'd read some of Ted's poems in this magazine and I was very impressed and I wanted to meet him. I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met... Then we saw {{a great deal of}} each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other. Then it just grew out of that, I guess, a feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.|$|E
500|$|According to Bart Millard, {{the lead}} vocalist for MercyMe, the band enjoys the Christmas season greatly and had {{recorded}} songs for compilation albums like [...] and had liked {{the process of}} taking older Christmas songs and altering them; Millard said that the band [...] "had so much fun doing it that <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> wishing we had a Christmas record of our own". After the band released their third studio album Undone in early 2004, they decided {{to take some time}} off, and realized they could record a Christmas album over that period. Although MercyMe had started as a rock band, they become associated with the adult contemporary genre after their single [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] became successful. In creating The Christmas Sessions, the band incorporated more elements from rock music and other genres; Millard described it as [...] "the most 'rock' album we've done" [...] and noted they did not concern themselves with the album's direction, saying [...] "we didn’t have to worry about which direction we went. We just made the record we wanted to make".|$|E
6000|$|His betrothed shuddered; {{and asked}} him earnestly if he indeed felt that they ought not to go in cold blood and sign that life-undertaking again?

30|$|<b>We</b> thus <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> {{faced with}} {{two types of}} {{pedagogical}} developments: a “spontaneous pedagogy” and an “oriented pedagogy”. In both, participants advance {{based on their own}} experience or knowledge, but it would seem that in the “spontaneous pedagogy”, participants feel freer to enrich the dialogue through personal references, be they autobiographical, disciplinary, professional, or ethno-cultural.|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tim Minear and [...] Vince Gilligan, and {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist. While in prison, he would have heard the voice of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man, and then he would have suddenly found himself mystically transferred out of the prison. Although the police would be after him, only Mulder would believe he was working for the greater good. Minear noted that [...] "I pitched it and I was going to do it, eventually, until <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> at a point in the year where we needed a script really fast." [...] Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Minear that the [...] "convicted atheist" [...] should actually be Robert Modell from the third season episode [...] "Pusher". After this was decided, Minear put aside the [...] "Word of God" [...] story, as it was called, teamed up with Gilligan, and the two wrote the final script.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, {{placed the}} murder of fictional character, Mr. Garcia, in and around Esher in his Sherlock Holmes mystery, [...] "The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge".

50|$|On the 2nd day <b>we</b> again <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> at Smyrna {{amongst the}} plague, which had increased, 400 persons having died in our absence.

I also visited the Armenian, and Greek hospitals, where numbers were dying daily of the plague (p. 55).|$|R

After the game Hampshire's captain, Shane Warne, said, [...] "We believe we can win from any position and it's so important to win your first few games. It was a tremendous team effort and everyone pulled their weight. This is the type of game you never forget. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> behind the eight ball at the start of every day but I always felt we were in with a chance if we could remove their openers." ...|$|E
2500|$|At daybreak of September 26 <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> {{forced to}} abandon our {{dwelling}} for fear lest the roofs come down upon us {{under the weight}} of ashes and stones which had fallen upon them during that hapless night. In fact, some weaker buildings collapsed. The depth of the layer of ashes and stones exceeded two [...] "cuartas" [...] (45 centimeters), and the result was that there was neither tree nor other plant which it did not ruin or crush, giving to the whole region an aspect as if a devastating conflagration had swept over it. After this the volcano calmed down considerably, though not sufficiently to offer any prospect of tranquility.|$|E

I’m a real cat, I’m from the streets. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> in rooms where we were like, ‘You know what? These people fake as hell in here.

Since student protests began on Feb. 4, more than 1,500 protesters have been detained, more than 30 have been killed, and more than 50 people have reported that they were tortured while in police custody,” thus exposing “the depth of this government's criminalization of dissent.” ...|$|E

2500|$|... 26 March - The New York Times {{published}} an op-ed by Leopoldo López {{under the headline}} “Venezuela’s Failing State.” where he explained he wrote, “from the Ramo Verde military prison outside Caracas,” lamenting that for the past fifteen years, “the definition of ‘intolerable’ {{in this country has}} declined by degrees until, to our dismay, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> with one of the highest murder rates in the Western Hemisphere, a 57 percent inflation rate and a scarcity of basic goods unprecedented outside wartime.” María Corina Machado arrived in Venezuela protected by three representatives of the Congress of the Republic of Peru, Martín Belaúnde, Luis Galarreta and Cecilia Chacón, with Galarreta saying, [...] "We came to support María Corina Machado by this unusual and unacceptable arbitrariness that you want to do".

60|$|Somehow {{or other}} <b>we</b> all <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> {{in the court}} of the Louvre, {{strongly}} lighted by flambeaux, and by the windows of the building.

60|$|THE mild blue weather {{we enjoyed}} {{after leaving the}} Marquesas {{gradually}} changed as we ran farther south and approached Tahiti.

2500|$|In a long {{retrospective}} [...] "How I Acted Like A Pundit And Screwed Up On Donald Trump," [...] {{published in}} May 2016 after Trump {{had become the}} likely nominee, Silver reviewed how he had erred in evaluating Trump's chances early in the primary campaign. Silver wrote, [...] "The big mistake is a curious one for a website that focuses on statistics. Unlike virtually every other forecast we publish at FiveThirtyEight – including the primary and caucus projections I just mentioned [...] – our early estimates of Trump’s chances weren’t based on a statistical model. Instead, they were what we [...] 'subjective odds' – which is to say, educated guesses. In other words, we were basically acting like pundits, but attaching numbers to our estimates. And we succumbed {{to some of the}} same biases that pundits often suffer, such as not changing our minds quickly enough in the face of new evidence. Without a model as a fortification, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> rambling around the countryside like all the other pundit-barbarians, randomly setting fire to things".|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} first shown on April 10, {{at which time}} the {{controls}} were demonstrated. IGN were impressed; [...] "The pointing function works really well in Scarface. Just like the PC version's mouse control, players now have near pin-point weapon precision {{that makes it easier}} and more intuitive to gun down the opposition with the huge assortment of firepower within the experience. You can still target individuals to tighten up your aim using the Z button on the nunchuk, but because the Wii Remote's pointer already does a great job with its precision it's rare that <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> using it." [...] GameSpot were less impressed; [...] "When you're wielding the chainsaw, its movement will be tied to that of the Wii Remote, and by slashing in different directions and at different heights you'll be able to target enemies' heads, legs, and individual arms. With practice you'll purportedly be able to remove all of the aforementioned extremities before the torso hits the ground, but the associate producer showing us the game on this occasion never managed to pull it off." ...|$|E
2500|$|While it was Massoud's stated {{conviction}} {{that men and}} women are equal and should enjoy the same rights, he also had to deal with Afghan traditions which he said would need a generation or more to overcome.
