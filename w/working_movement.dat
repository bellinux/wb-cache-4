50|$|In 1959, President Sukarno {{introduced}} {{his concept of}} Guided Democracy, in which so-called functional groups would {{play a role in}} government in place of political parties. The Indonesian National Armed Forces supported its creation because it believed these groups would balance the growing strength of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). In 1960, Sukarno awarded sectoral groups such as teachers, the Armed Forces and the Indonesian National Police, workers and artists seats in the Mutual Cooperation - People's Representative Council. As some of the members of these functional groups were linked to political parties, this gave political influence to the National Armed Forces. The TNI then established an anti-PKI trade union, the Central Organization of Indonesian Workers, or Soksi (Sentral Organisasi Karyawan Swadiri Indonesia), and used this as the core of an Armed Forces-led Joint Secretariat of Functional Groups, or Sekber Golkar, which was officially established on October 20, 1964. By 1968 there were almost 250 organizations under the Sekber umbrella. On November 22, 1969 they were organized into seven main organizations, or Kino (Kelompok Induk Organisasi), namely Soksi, Kosgoro (Union of Mutual Cooperation Multifunction Organizations), MKGR (Mutual Assistance Families Association), Gerakan Karya Rakyat (People's <b>Working</b> <b>Movement),</b> Ormas Hankam (Defense and Security Mass Organizations), Professi (professional organizations), and Gerakan Pembangunan (Development Movement).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to optimise {{the position of}} an "on-the-go" soil sensor installed on a variable rate (VR) granular fertiliser application system. Optimisation {{was carried out by}} measuring the lag time between acquiring the information on soil phosphorus (P) from the soil sensor and changing the fertiliser rate on the fertilisation system. The sensing system consisted of a soil sensor coupled with a Ziess spectrophotometer (CORONA fibre VISNIR 1. 7). The applicator was a four-row planter- applicator from AMAZONE (ED 302). The overall lag time consisted of a series of sub lag times consisting of the times required to collect soil spectra, compile data, change the fertiliser rate and the travel time of granules from the fertiliser metering devices to furrow openers. The static and dynamic tests were carried out to measure these lag times. For the dynamic test, a hydraulic shaker (Four Poster Vibratory Stands) was used to simulate the <b>working</b> <b>movement</b> under field conditions. The results revealed that the important factor for positioning the soil sensor {{at the front of the}} "on-the-go" fertiliser application system is tractor speed. The results showed that the soil sensor should be installed at the front of the tractor and an extra time delay should be artificially included. (c) 2008 lAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In 1935 the party board decided to give the task of designing the monument to the much renowned artist Carl Eldh. A national fund-raising campaign for the monument was also initiated. In 1942 the model of the monument was completed, but because of the war it was stored in a shelter. On June 2, 1952 the monument was inaugurated with great ceremony.

At that time W. Churchill was {{at the head of the}} government. He stood on the position of active resistance to German fascism. But former supporters of policy appeasement with Hitler (“munichs”) yet remained in the government. The unemployment was considerable as before, strikes were forbidden because of the war. Working masses were burdened with war hardships, while capitalists received vast profits. In this situation the Communism Party of Great Britain (CPGB) headed the People’s Convent Movement. The party demanded the creation of People’s Convent government, the dismissal of “munichs” from the government, the renewal of trade unions rights, the alliance with the USSR, and war termination. The representatives of different working class parties and democratic organizations took part in this movement. For example, the participants included a number of big trade unions, the unemployed, big number of Labour Party representatives, communists. The Movement had the great public resonance. The influence of the Communism Party grew considerable. nBut the leadership of the Labour Party appeared sharp against the People’s Convent Movement. So, the majority ofntrade unions did not take participate in it. Due to this fact, the movement was doomed to failure.

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on the issues of {{controllability}} of machine-tractor units based on wheel-type tractors during their non-straight driving on the soil surface, which is positioned at an angle to the horizon. There were obtained analytical expressions for the determination of the actual indicator of control λd, including both the power and the design parameters of the machine-tractor unit, which affect the abovementioned indicator in the longitudinal vertical plane. These expressions are obtained for the tractor driving on both road and also driving during field operation. In addition, the paper discusses the conditions under which there may occur the cross-slip of the tractor steering wheels in the transversal horizontal plane. As a result of this review, there were obtained the analytical expressions for determining the required indicator of the controllability λd of machine-tractor unit in the horizontal plane, excluding the possibility of lateral sliding of the unit by turning its steering wheels at a certain angle. These expressions are obtained for the two modes of the machine-tractor unit: for driving during transport on the road and during the operation in the field. The machine-tractor unit based on the wheel-type tractor with rear mounted 3 -mouldboard plough was analytically investigated. By means of computer calculations, there was observed the fact that when moving in non-straight direction on the soil surface, inclined to the horizon at an angle of 12 °, the machine-tractor unit is controllable only when the angles of the steering wheel of the given tractor do not exceed 9 °. During the <b>working</b> <b>movement</b> (ploughing) of the given machine-tractor unit on an inclined field surface, its controllability will be preserved on condition that the angle of the tractor steering wheels does not exceed 11 °. According to obtained results, it can be stated that the controllability of the machine-tractor unit is determined by the indicator of controllability, taking into account the value of the vertical load acting on the tractor steering wheels, the possibility of their turning in the horizontal plane, as well as the withdrawal of the machine-tractor unit from rectilinear motion and its movement on the field surface, inclined at an angle to the horizon...|$|E

SC, as an aspect of the yellow trade unionism for the promotion of workers' social acquiescence and education. The purpose of this text is to show how workers were ideologically co-opted by the Unions, officially coordinated and monitored by theMinistry of Industry and Commerce (1931). From a materialistic historical perspective, we aim atanalyzing the concepts of Education and Work through the writings of Marx, Gramsci and Mészáros. From the ontological apprehension of the work category, we search for the fundamental idea for thecomprehension of the social relations and educational practices that, in movements of workers?representations in union organizations, have multiple determinations which historically constitutefundamental structures for the maintenance or overcoming of class struggle and social division ofwork. The historical research referred to the documentary survey of the union institutions for analysis and demonstration of the New State?s strategies used for the insertion and propagation of authoritative intentions. Comparing the documentary sources with the implementation of workingpolicies, we concluded that the New State aimed at the workers? education for the control anddominion of the Estate in service of the capital, consolidating the industrialization in Brazil.

40|$|Esta tese tem por objetivo analisar as relações entre o governo estadual, o patronato e o operariado no decorrer das principais greves ocorridas em Porto Alegre entre os anos de 1917 e 1919. Buscou-se compreender as estratégias e identidades construídas e utilizadas por esses diferentes agentes em tais ocasiões. No primeiro capítulo, foram averiguadas as greves deflagradas na cidade durante os “anos vermelhos” – 1917 a 1919 –, um período de {{particular}} importância para os estudos relativos ao mundo do trabalho. Procurou-se enfatizar, especialmente, as greves de 1918 e 1919 em virtude da escassez de trabalhos acadêmicos dedicados a seu estudo. Pretendeu-se descrever os eventos ocorridos nos anos citados a fim de proporcionar uma visão abrangente dos referidos movimentos paredistas. O segundo capítulo buscou avaliar as estratégias adotadas e as identidades construídas pelo Partido Republicano Rio-Grandense (PRR), instituído em governo no Rio Grande do Sul, durante estes movimentos. Observou-se a postura do governo deste estado em cada um dos movimentos estudados, problematizando-se a questão do chamado “paternalismo borgista” (referência ao governador do estado, Borges de Medeiros). Foram analisadas, ainda, as identidades construídas pelo e para o Estado através do jornal A Federação bem como de outros periódicos, operários ou não. No terceiro capítulo, as estratégias utilizadas pelos operários em suas lutas sindicais foram o objeto de análise. Portanto, foram abordadas as ações desenvolvidas por esses agentes com o intuito de obter o atendimento de suas reivindicações frente ao patronato e ao Estado, enfatizando-se, ainda, as relações dos operários grevistas com os trabalhadores que não aderiam aos movimentos. Do mesmo modo, foram enfocadas as identidades construídas e veiculadas pela imprensa operária para instrumentalizar os trabalhadores na disputa simbólica envolvida nas mobilizações paredistas, assim como as representações divulgadas pela grande imprensa sobre os operários grevistas. No último capítulo, foram estudadas as estratégias adotadas pelo patronato da capital com o intuito de confrontar o movimento operário organizado e suas associações. Tratava-se de uma disputa entre interesses evidentemente antagônicos, durante a qual os patrões foram, gradativamente, estruturando-se como classe a fim de enfrentarem o repertório de ações coletivas do operariado informado por uma longa tradição militante. Foram analisadas, ainda, as representações construídas pela imprensa – tanto a operária quanto a burguesa – sobre os patrões e sua relação com as greves. This thesis aims at analysing {{the relations}} among state government, patronage and workers during the strikes in Porto Alegre from 1917 to 1919. The {{objective is to}} understand the strategies and identities built and used by these different agents in such occasions. In the first chapter, the strikes which occurred {{in the city of}} Porto Alegre during the “red years” – 1917 to 1919 – were analysed, a period of particular importance to the studies on the world of work. This work will try to emphasize, especially, the strikes of 1918 and 1919 due to the already mentioned lack of academic work dedicated to their study up to the moment. The events that happened in the mentioned years were described in order to present a comprehensive view of the reported striking movements. The second chapter tried to analyse the adopted strategies and the identities built by the Partido Republicano Rio-Grandense (Rio-Grandense Republican Party – PRR) constituted in government in Rio Grande do Sul state during these movements. The state government posture in each of the studied movements was analysed, putting in doubt the “borgista paternalism” matter. The identities built by and for the State through the newspaper A Federação (The Federation) as well as other periodicals were also analysed. In the third chapter, the strategies used by the workers in their union fights were the focus of the analysis. Therefore the actions developed by these agents aiming at having their claims fulfilled in relation to the patronage and the State were discussed, emphasizing, yet, the relationship between the workers on strike and the ones who did not follow the movements.
