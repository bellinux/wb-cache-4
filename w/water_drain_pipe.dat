50|$|A water {{detector}} is {{an electronic}} device {{that is designed}} to detect the presence of water and provide an alert in time to allow the prevention of water damage. A common design is a small cable or device that lies flat on a floor and relies on the electrical conductivity of water to decrease the resistance across two contacts. The device then sounds an audible alarm together with providing onward signalling in the presence of enough water to bridge the contacts. These are useful in a normally occupied area near any infrastructure that has the potential to leak water, such as HVAC, <b>water</b> <b>pipes,</b> <b>drain</b> <b>pipes,</b> vending machines, dehumidifiers, or water tanks.|$|R

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} columns concealing PVC <b>drain</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> {{have been}} used widely {{in the construction of}} multi storey buildings. The purpose of the investigation is to study thedeficiencies caused in the strength and load carrying capacity of these columns through experimental and numerical analyses. A total number of 28 columns have been cast and only the appropriate ones which were without defects, have been tested under the axial compressive load. An approximate method of alignment for constructed columns has been developed and the alignment of the alignment of the columns has been carried out before their testing. The study shows these columns have huge reduction in their load carryingcapacities. The investigation showed that concealing <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> inside these columns had significant effects on their strength and mode of failure. Three-dimensional finite element analysis of the above mentioned columns have also been carried out to investigate the effects of <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> on load carrying capacities of the columns. The numerical investigation predicts higher factors of safety than the experimental results. In conculsions, the factors of safety obtained from experimental study shows that, the performance of the columns are in a critical level and could be hazardous to the safety of the building. Therefore, an improved method of positioning the <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> outside the columns as well as the replacement of the PVC pipes by steel has been proposed. ...|$|R

Introduction: The subject of home building is important to every American. The modern home should have a distinct character particularly its own. It should have architectural beauty and attractiveness {{as well as all}} the modern requisites for utility. It is the work of the architect to consider carefully the needs of the housekeeper {{in order to make a}} convenient arrangement which will afford economy and ease, thus there is a distinct relation between the, work of the architect and that of the housekeeper. The housekeeping requirements depend upon the floor plan of the house and economy of work to the housekeeper depends upon its good construction. Interior construction and decoration are greatly related to the economy of work of the housekeeper. While it is well to consider the artistic qualities, these should not be elaborate. The term household conveniences is a somewhat modern one. "Those arrangements and appliances which make it possible for people to live more comfortable and in larger houses without seriously increasing the cares which they had in smaller ones" and making them more easily accomplished, "are called modern conveniences", or anything which saves labor may be regarded as a modern convenience. In the modern kitchen and laundry may be found the conveniences which are most appreciated by the housekeeper. Among some of these are: the arrangements for dish washing, the kitchen sink with faucets for hot and cold <b>water,</b> <b>drain</b> boards and <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> attached to sink. The modern laundry has the stationary wash tubs, <b>water</b> faucets and <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> with adjoining drying room which may be used during cold or stormy weather...|$|R

50|$|The Heart-Shaped Tub: The Trap - The contestants must {{install a}} trap {{as part of}} the tub installation. Two drains must be {{installed}} for the tub: one for the main drain and another for the overflow, and both must connect to only one trap, which must be installed in the hotel's basement and connected to the hotel's existing system. Due to there only being two drills available for all the contestants, only Dan and Charlene have first access to the drills; Ajay, denied a drill by Natasha, instead grabs a jackhammer and uses the coring bit to cut a hole through the concrete floor, damaging both the floor and the bit, and cutting a hole too big for his <b>drain</b> <b>pipe.</b> Furthermore, he attaches his pipes to the tub before installing his drains in the basement, and he places his trap too far away from his drains (by Ontario's codes, the trap may only be at most 60 cm from his drain). On top of all that, his pipes leak when tested. Needless to say, he fails. Matt originally misinterprets his notes from the lesson taught by Geoff (who will also test the traps by pouring a bucket of <b>water</b> into the <b>drain</b> <b>pipes),</b> but he eventually finishes his connection. However, beyond the trap his connection to the hotel's existing system runs uphill, so he fails. Neither Dan nor Rob encounter any issues in installing their drains to an acceptable quality, and both pass. Charlene runs out of time, and fails.|$|R
40|$|To reduce P {{losses from}} {{agricultural}} soils to surface water, mitigation options {{have to be}} implemented at a local scale. For a cost-effective implementation of these measures, an instrument to identify critical areas for P leaching is indispensable. In many countries, P-index methods are used to identify areas at risk for P losses to surface water. In flat areas, where losses by leaching are dominant, these methods have their limitations because leaching is often not described in detail. PLEASE is a simple mechanistic model designed to simulate P losses by leaching at the field scale using {{a limited amount of}} local field data. In this study, PLEASE was applied to 17 lowland sites in Denmark and 14 lowland sites in the Netherlands. Results showed that the simple model simulated measured fluxes and concentrations in <b>water</b> from <b>pipe</b> <b>drains,</b> suction cups, and groundwater quite well. The modeling efficiency ranged from 0. 92 for modeling total-P fluxes to 0. 36 for modeling concentrations in groundwater. Poor results were obtained for heavy clay soils and eutrophic peat soils, where fluxes and concentrations were strongly underestimated by the model. The poor performance for the heavy clay soil {{can be explained by the}} transport of P through macropores to the <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> and the underestimation of overland flow on this heavy-textured soil. In the eutrophic peat soils, fluxes were underestimated due to the release of P from deep soil layers...|$|R

Forty-four percent of the time, ratios of fecal coliforms to fecal streptococci at this site were above 4. 0 indicating human waste contamination. The presence of pathogens in the water is another clue to the quality of the surface water. Salmonella and Shigella are associated with gastro-intestinal diseases that may be spread by ingestion of water contaminated with these bacteria. Salmonella and Shigella were isolated on several occasions from the <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> behind the trailer courts. Salmonella paratyphi was found on the December 28 sampling date.

50|$|The {{finished}} floor is typically raised off the concrete basement floor. In {{countries such as}} Canada, laminate flooring is an exception: It is typically separated from the concrete by only a thin foam underlay.

It is recommended that the basement walls be insulated to the frost line. In Canada, the walls of a finished basement are typically insulated to the floor with vapor barriers to prevent moisture transmission. However, a finished basement should avoid wood or wood-laminate flooring, and metal framing and other moisture resistant products should be used. Finished basements can be costly to maintain due to deterioration of waterproofing materials or lateral earth movement etc. Below-ground structures will never be as dry as one above ground, and measures must be taken to circulate air and dehumidify the area.|$|R
