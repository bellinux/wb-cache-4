50|$|Furthermore, {{the most}} of the {{available}} <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> are not very flexible when it comes to routing lines with varying diameters. That causes higher acquisition and storage costs. The installation of the single <b>cable</b> <b>clamps</b> can take a lot of mounting time, depending on the laying length of the lines. Strain relief plates are therefore a more flexible solution which allows a parallel routing of several lines with varying diameters.|$|R
40|$|Damping due to {{internal}} friction in taut <b>wire</b> <b>cables</b> undergoing bending vibrations is negligible in many cases. Slack cables, however, exhibit significant flexural hysteresis resulting from interstrand friction. This type of static hysteresis is utilized in various applications where <b>wire</b> <b>cables</b> {{are used in}} damping of mechanical vibrations. Stockbridge dampers in overhead transmission lines are one example where short <b>wire</b> <b>cables</b> are used in damping wind-excited oscillations due to vortex shedding. The present work deals with {{the analysis of the}} dynamic behavior of such cables. The local mechanical properties of a <b>wire</b> <b>cable</b> are identified experimentally. In particular, the moment-curvature-relationship is determined experimentally at every location of the <b>wire</b> <b>cable</b> which is subjected to dynamic flexural deformations. A simple device for measuring the local curvatures of short <b>wire</b> <b>cables</b> was constructed specifically for this purpose. As expected, the effective bending stiffness, as well as the hysteretic properties, varies {{along the length of the}} cable. The experimental results are presented and the applicability of the local models is discussed. In addition, a mathematical description is given in terms of local MASING elements and the relevant parameters of these elements are identified. The local properties of a cable are used to determine the overall behavior of a short cable undergoing bending vibrations. It is shown that such an approach can be applied succesfully in the design of damping devices such as Stockbridge dampers...|$|R

Electrical <b>wire</b> <b>cables</b> are available at home and are easy to insert. However, after they coil in the patient’s bladder, they are difficult to remove. In February 2013, a 30 -year-old man presented {{to the emergency room}} of SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center with a urethral foreign body. He had inserted an electrical <b>wire</b> <b>cable</b> into his urethra for the purpose of masturbation, despite having a regular sex partner and no underlying disease. A kidney-ureter-bladder radiography showed a tangled wire in his bladder and urethra. On the next day, we tried to remove the wire cystoscopically, but this proved to be impossible because of complex coiling and the slippery surface of the wire. A Pfannenstiel incision was made to remove the foreign body. No postoperative complications were noted.

40|$|AbstractThe {{flexural}} damping of <b>wire</b> <b>cable</b> {{due to the}} flexural hysteresis {{influences the}} dynamic behavior of slacking <b>wire</b> <b>cables</b> significantly. However, {{the details of the}} local model, accounting for the flexural hysteresis between the wire strands, are quite challenging to include in large-scale engineering applications. This paper addresses these difficulties by modeling the flexural damping of slacking <b>wire</b> <b>cables</b> using homogenized Rayleigh damping. By using the nonlinear finite element method and high-speed imaging technique, three aspects of the work were examined. First, the mechanical properties of the slacking cable were identified experimentally. Second, a sample cable was fixed at one end and allowed to vibrate freely at the other end. The shapes of the vibrating cable were captured by a high-speed digital camera and processed by photogrammetry. The cable demonstrated a high flexural damping at zero tension and its damping was measured to be as high as 37. 7 % of the critical damping. Third, the cable was modeled and analyzed using our newly developed nonlinear curved beam element with the Rayleigh damping. The finite element predictions of the cable motion agree well with the experimental measurement. These predictions demonstrate that the new element is capable of describing the dynamic response of the cable and that the Rayleigh damping is sufficient to model the flexural damping of slacking <b>wire</b> <b>cables...</b>|$|R
