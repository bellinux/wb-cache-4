Also, the patient may <b>want</b> an unnecessary treatment, as can be the case in hypochondria or with cosmetic surgery; here, the practitioner may be required to balance the desires of the patient for medically unnecessary potential risks against the patient's informed autonomy in the issue. A doctor may <b>want</b> to prefer autonomy because refusal to please the patient's self-determination would harm the doctor-patient relationship.|$|E

40|$|Rationale: {{incentive}} sensitisation theory (IST) {{claims that}} the mechanism of reward is comprised of separate neurobiological systems of <b>wanting</b> and liking, that dependent drug use {{occurs as a result}} of sensitisation of the system controlling <b>wanting,</b> and that the two systems can be dissociated. Objective: to test the IST prediction that <b>wanting</b> and liking for alcohol can be dissociated in humans. Methods: measures of <b>wanting</b> and liking for alcohol were obtained in three experiments. Experiment 1 examined whether liking for alcohol was associated with levels of <b>wanting,</b> as indexed by self-reported weekly alcohol intake. Experiments 2 and 3 also assessed the association between liking and <b>wanting</b> but in these experiments <b>wanting</b> was also indexed by alcohol consumption in the laboratory. Experiment 2 increased <b>wanting</b> for alcohol using an alcohol priming dose to determine whether liking would be similarly affected. Experiment 3 reduced liking for alcohol by adulterating drinks with Tween to see whether <b>wanting</b> would also be reduced. Results: little evidence for an association between liking and <b>wanting</b> for alcohol was found in Experiments 1 – 3 but, collapsing across all experiments, a weak positive correlation between liking and <b>wanting</b> was found. However, in Experiment 2, <b>wanting</b> was increased by the alcohol priming dose whereas liking was not and in Experiment 3 liking was reduced without a concurrent reduction in <b>wanting.</b> Conclusions: although correlations between <b>wanting</b> and liking can be observed these results support the contention of the IST that <b>wanting</b> and liking for alcohol can be dissociated in human participants...|$|R

50|$|An {{assumption}} {{often made}} in mainstream neoclassical economics (and methods {{that try to}} solve the economic problem) is that humans inherently pursue their self-interest, and that the market mechanism best satisfies the various <b>wants</b> different individuals might have.
