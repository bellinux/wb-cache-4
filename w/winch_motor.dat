25|$|Squid jiggers – have {{single or}} double drum jigger winches lined along the rails around the vessel. Strong lamps, up to 5000 W each, {{are used to}} attract the squid. These are {{arranged}} 50–60 centimetres apart, either as one row in {{the centre of the}} vessel, or two rows, one on each side. As the squid are caught they are transferred by chutes to the processing plant of the vessel.

50|$|Hoist (<b>winch)</b> <b>motors</b> {{are either}} fixed speed or {{variable}} speed. Fixed speed motors are used at heavy-load and/or slow-speed line sets (e.g., electrics and orchestra shell line sets). Variable speed motors are used at line sets requiring dynamic motion {{that may be}} viewed by the audience (e.g., drapery and scenery line sets). Scenery hoists commonly allow travel at rates of hundreds of feet per minute.|$|R
50|$|The station {{features}} a pneumatic animatronic character known as Marcel playing at a Gothic pipe organ. The animatronic was originally programmed {{in time to}} the musical soundtrack, appearing to play to the organ, however this has not been maintained for many years. In 2014 the graveyard canopy was demolished following years of little maintenance. The station chandeliers were also removed, due to the <b>winch</b> <b>motors</b> used to lower them for inspection being left to seize up. Little of the attraction's original show design and scenery now exists as how it was intended.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a 9 {{degree of}} freedom seaweed {{harvester}} dynamical model is presented. The model presented describes the coupled dynamics of a vessel and a harvesting device, lifted by a winch, subject to sea waves disturbances. In order to find an appropriate harvesting path, which minimizes the harvester motions, the model response is simulated for different encounter angles. This 9 DOF seaweed harvester model is defined by merging the unified ship model, given in Fossen [1], Perez [2], including the seakeeping fluid memory effects, and the Nielsen [3], Fard [4] 9 DOF shipcrane model, which includes an elastic coupling between the vessel and the harvester, and computes the harvester hydrodynamics, as in [5]. For the ship-harvester elastic coupling, a linear stiffness matrix, based on Shashikala et al [6], has been computed. The model obtained also includes {{the effects of the}} vessel forward speed, the wave and current loads, the ship propellers and motion control forces, and the <b>winch</b> <b>motor</b> dynamics. The motor dynamic is based on the control-oriented models of Messineo et al [7]. A mathematical formulation is first presented, and its assumptions are discussed. Then, a model simulation, obtained by modifying the Fossen et al [8] Simulink MSS Toolbox, and its results, are discussed. The harvester position variance and the RMSE index are compared, for the simulation results of different harvesting paths, and a compromise solution is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{leading cause}} of serious weight-training {{injuries}} and death among bodybuilders and weight-lifters is training with heavy barbells without {{the assistance of a}} human 'spotter ' or gym partner. A spotter can identify lack of progress or nearness of muscle failure and provide additional force to assist with the lift, so that the lift can progress slowly prior to complete muscle failure, allowing the maximum benefit to be gained from the exercise. This paper briefly describes the modeling, design and performance of a computer-controlled mechatronic system that automates the 'spotting ' process for horizontal barbell exercises, which includes exercises such as squats, bench press, overhead shoulder press, barbell triceps extensions and bicep curls. The system employs a unique pulley system attached to a strong structural frame, a solenoid-activated locking brake, optical position sensors and a low-cost embedded microcontroller system that drives a display screen, control panel, a geared electrical <b>winch</b> (<b>motor)</b> and cables attached to a standard barbell. Known as the ‘Smart Gym’, the basic system design, its different modes of operation and important safety features are described. This system also has the potential to save the lives of many people each year by preventing barbell suffocation (asphyxiation due to neck compression) and fatal injuries caused by heavy, free-falling barbells. Several fitness equipment manufacturers have already shown interest in using concepts described in this paper for implementation in current and future gym equipment.

40|$|On January 6, 2016 at El Paso, the Guppy <b>winch</b> <b>motor</b> was changed. After {{completion}} of the operational checks, the load bar was being reinstalled on the cargo pallet when the motor control FORWARD relay failed in the energized position. The pallet was pinned at all locations (each pin has a load capacity of 16, 000 lbs.) while the winch was running. The wire rope snapped before aircraft power could be removed. After disassembly, the fractured wire rope was shipped to ES 4 lab for further characterization of the wire rope portion of the failure. The system was being operated without {{a clear understanding of}} the system capability and function. The proximate cause was the failure of the K 48 -Forward Winch Control Relay in the energized position, which allowed the motor to continuously run without command from the hand controller, and operation of the winch system with both controllers connected to the system. This prevented the emergency stop feature on the hand controller from functioning as designed. An electrical checkout engineering work instruction was completed and identified the failed relay and confirmed the emergency stop only paused the system when the STOP button on both connected hand controllers were depressed simultaneously. The winch system incorporates a torque limiting clutch. It is suspected that the clutch did not slip and the motor did not stall or overload the current limiter. Aircraft Engineering is looking at how to change the procedures to provide a checkout of the clutch and set to a slip torque limit appropriate to support operations...|$|E
40|$|Overhead {{tasks such}} as those {{frequently}} found in aircraft manufacturing pose health risks to the workers due to the strain imposed on the shoulders. To {{reduce the risk of}} injury, a set of supernumerary robotic limbs (SRL) were designed to perform these overhead tasks. The SRL is designed with limits in the hardware and software to protect the human and prevent collisions between robot and operator. The arms are designed to have a workspace above and in front of the head of the user free from singular configurations so the robot is free to operate where the tasks will be performed. To further protect the human, the mount that attaches the SRL to the shoulders was redesigned to be lighter and to better distribute the load. In this manner, the shoulders will become less fatigued from the static load of carrying the SRL To complete the task of positioning cables and routing them through the ceiling of an airplane, a winch end effector was designed to latch onto the fuselage arches and pull the cable through these arches. In order to control the SRL, the concept of principal components analysis was used to reduce the input space. This concept was specifically used to map the motion of the operator's hands onto the appropriate speed for the <b>winch</b> <b>motor</b> to operate. In this manner, the winch would pull the cable at the same rate that the human fed the cable. The human would then be able to control the speed of the winch simply by executing the task at whatever pace they so desired. by Jay McKenna. Thesis: S.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of ice core drilling is {{to obtain the}} highest quality core while minimizing the effort needed. This requires a control system with precision control and convenient operation. An intermediate-depth portable ice core drilling system designed and constructed at the Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) has been tested during four expeditions under different working conditions. Several design options were tested to both control and monitor performance of the winch, thermal and electro-mechanic drills. An attempt {{has been made to}} develop a universal controller that can be used with either thermal or electro-mechanical drills and with various power sources, ranging from a conventional alternating current (AC) portable generator, custom high voltage direct current (DC) generator or an array of solar panels. Currently, controller system built in two configurations : (1) to operate a 500 m winch, dry hole electro-mechanical (EM) drill and fluid electro-thermal (ET) drill at low (1 kW) power, and (2) to operate a 500 m winch, EM and ET drills at high power (400 Vdc and 6. 0 kW). To allow the use of different power sources and different drills a modular design was chosen. The control system includes three modules : (1) for measuring and indicating drill depth, drill rate, and cable tension, (2) for driving reversible winch and drill motors at the same time (225 Vdc, 2. 25 kW), and (3) for driving a high power (400 Vdc, 20 kW) drill or <b>winch</b> <b>motor.</b> The controllers are built around industrial servo-amplifiers (SA) for DC brush motors and have over-voltage and over-current protection. This design permits convenient positioning of each module on the winch frame. This paper describes the details of the design and functional options of an ice drill control system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{nonlinear}} model predictive control (NMPC) scheme for a <b>winch</b> servo <b>motor</b> to overcome the sudden peak tension in the lifting wire caused by a lumped-mass payload {{at the beginning of}} a lifting off or a lowering operation. The crane-wire-payload system is modeled in 3 degrees of freedom with the Newton-Euler approach. Direct multiple shooting and real-time iteration (RTI) scheme are employed to provide feedback control input to the winch servo. Simulations are implemented with MATLAB and CaSADi toolkit. By well tuning the weighting matrices, the NMPC controller can reduce the snatch loads in the lifting wire and the winch loads simultaneously. A comparative study with a PID controller is conducted to verify its performance...|$|R
40|$|The US Coast Guard {{approached}} NIOSH {{about an}} increase in the number of winch entanglement injuries being reported among commercial shrimp fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico. In August of 2012, a 15 year-old boy, fishing on a shrimp boat, died when his clothing became caught in an operating deck winch. This fatality received widespread coverage within the industry and further highlighted the need for action. Using the NIOSH Commercial Fishing Incident Database (CFID), researchers at the Alaska Pacific Office began studying the incidence of shrimp winch entanglements and found a total of 35 severe work-related injuries, including eight fatal injuries, caused by deck winches reported in the Southern shrimp fleet from 2000 - 2011. NIOSH has developed a prototype system that will allow a victim of a try-net winch entanglement to shut off electrical power via a bumper switch. Bumper switches mounted to the winch frame provide an alternate method to turn off the electric winch. The prototype auxiliary-stop circuit is not an emergency-stop device that will arrest the momentum of the drum, but an alternate device to de-energize the <b>winch</b> <b>motor.</b> NIOSH believes that the auxiliary-stop circuit control is a feasible and cost-effective interim safety measure until a more comprehensive retrofit that will immediately stop the drum can be implemented. NIOSH formed partnerships with boat owners from various cultural groups to collaborate with the auxiliary-stop testing. Three prototype systems were installed on the F/V Daytin and Destin of Dulac, LA, the F/V Lucky CJ of Port Arthur, TX and the F/V Miss Opal of Brownsville, TX. Feedback from the fishermen will be used to refine the prototype design to make it robust enough to reliably withstand the harsh fishing environment. Researchers and industry collaborators will also strive to make the auxiliary-stop circuit compatible with most electrical systems used on side-trawl shrimping vessels fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Upon the successful completion of the field-testing, NIOSH will seek partners to promote this system to shrimp fishermen. Through collaborations and partnerships with shrimper associations and safety groups, the successfully tested auxiliary-stop design plans will be made available to shrimpers via various internet websites. NIOSH plans to release the information in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese to better reach the target audience. NIOSHTIC No 2004721...|$|E
50|$|Typically, windjammers are {{equipped}} with semi-mechanized rigging, steel profile masts and yards and steel cables as running rigging where possible. Often also the running rigging was handled by <b>motor</b> <b>winches</b> instead of manpower. Since the windjammer hull is optimized for good hydrodynamics because of sail handling, they were (and still are) capable of sustained high cruising speeds; most four-masted barques were able to cruise at 15 kn on plausible winds, some logged 18 kn regularly and Herzogin Cecilie {{is known to have}} logged 21 kn.|$|R

25|$|In many cases, a dimmer can be {{replaced}} by a constant power module (CPM), which is typically a 20- or 50-ampere breaker in a dimming module casing. CPMs are used to supply line voltage to non-dimming electrical devices such as smoke machines, chain <b>winches,</b> and scenic <b>motors</b> that require constant operating voltage. When a device is powered by a CPM, it is fully energized whenever the CPM is turned on, independent of lighting console levels. CPMs must be used (in lieu of dimmers) to power non-dimming devices that require specific line voltages (e.g., in the US, 110 V, 60Hz power) in order to avoid damage to such devices. Dimmers are seldom used to control non-dimming devices because even if a dimmer channel is trusted to always operate at full power, it may not be controlled when communications are disrupted by start up and shut down of the lighting control surface, noise interference, or DMX disconnects or failure. Such a loss of control might cause a dimmer to dim a circuit and thus potentially damage its non-dimming device.|$|R
5000|$|In 1967 Hydranautics, now Bardex Corporation, designed, patented, {{manufactured}} {{and delivered}} the first shiplift using chain instead of wire rope. These Shiplifts differ distinctly {{in the use}} of hydraulic Chain Jacks and Stud Link Anchor Chain to lift commercial ships, naval vessels and submarines. [...] The five distinct advantages to the Bardex Chain Jack Shiplift are: 1) Chain is inherently less susceptible to corrosion and bending fatigue as any chain corrosion is visible on the outside surfaces as opposed to wire rope. For this reason, Lloyd’s shipping register requires 20% of wire ropes to be removed and destructively tested each year with all wire ropes to be replaced every 5-10 years. Lloyd’s does not stipulate any specific duty life limitations for chains which have been known to last for over 20 years in operation.2) Traditional wire rope shiplift systems rely on synchronous <b>motors</b> powering the <b>winches.</b> These <b>motors</b> cause a large power demand on the system when started. Hydraulic systems start at no load so there is no excessive inrush current demand.3) The use of dual chains for redundancy in lieu of a single wire rope at each hoist provides extra safety and reliability.4) Use of chain allows incremental mechanical synchronization of the entire lift operation. The chain links are made to very tight fabrication tolerances so that after each jacking stroke, the platform is set down on the next set of chain links and the level has been “reset”. Wire rope hoist by comparison can become cumulatively unsynchronized over the duration of a lift requiring the operation to stop and be adjusted.4) At all times the shiplift and the vessel are mechanically held by chain resting on support pins not relying on a braking system. 5) Holding the rigid shiplift platform at the correct elevation for Transfer Operations is a locked mechanical function as the chain is pinned in position without the deflection inherent in wire rope systems. A Bardex Shiplift has never dropped a vessel.|$|R
