40|$|The signal {{channels}} that link high speed processors to memory {{and various other}} peripherals, are limited by the inherent characteristics of the printed circuit board. These are what ultimately connect information to the outside world. One limiting factor {{is the effect of}} nonuniformity of the glass fiber distribution in the printed circuit substrate material, also known as fiber <b>weave</b> <b>effect</b> (FWE). FWE introduces signal skew and timing errors which place an upper limit on bit rate and trace length. Using unique fabrication techniques and a proprietary low dielectric constant glass composition, a revolutionary glass fabric is presented that is essentially free of fiber <b>weave</b> <b>effect</b> while demonstrating inherently improved resistance to conductive anodic filament (CAF) formation. Improved laminate performance is demonstrated with finite element modeling and HyperLynx simulations, and corroborated with dielectric property measurements on prototype substrates. A printed circuit board using this material demonstrates superior signal integrity performance over the traditional glass-based solution. By uniformly distributing glass fibers the maximum surface area becomes available to bond with the resin, which is enhanced by direct application of a finish to provide a high quality interface between glass and resin. Two high profile performance issues, fiber <b>weave</b> <b>effect</b> and CAF, are addressed by a unique laminate reinforcement. Introduction to Fiber Weave Effec...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Structure {{property}} correlation is {{a critical}} textile research area explored by various researchers and many factors have been proposed {{over the years to}} predict/compare/design the woven fabrics. Cross-over firmness factor (CFF) and floating yarn factor (FYF) have been recently proposed as parameters to understand <b>weave</b> <b>effect</b> on fabric properties (Morino, H., Matsudaira, M. and Furutani, M.

Redefined CFF and FYF factors using fabric fields in terms of interlacement index (I) and float index (F), respectively have been proposed in this article. This new approach provides better understanding of the interlacements and floats in the woven structure and further they are applied on multilayer interlocked fabrics to quantify the structural influence on the properties.

40|$|Corridor {{traffic control}} {{in the form of}} ramp {{metering}} is an effective strategy for alleviating the congestion on freeways. Due to capacity drop arising from the <b>weaving</b> <b>effects,</b> a <b>weaving</b> section often constitutes a typical bottleneck of heavy congestion on urban freeways during peak hours. This paper investigates the corridor control problem considering the <b>weaving</b> <b>effects</b> with fixed demand. The operational capacity of a weaving section link is introduced and assumed to decrease linearly with volume ratio, which is related to the adjacent on-ramp and off-ramp flows. Asymmetric flow interactions emerge among links {{as a result of the}} operational capacity for calculation of link travel times. A mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) is used to represent the corridor control problem. The objective is to minimize the total travel cost subject to the traffic equilibrium with queuing as well as the queue length constraints at on-ramps and flow capacity constraints on freeway main sections. A sensitivity analysis based algorithm is adopted to solve the corridor control model and its convergence is demonstrated with numerical examples. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Textile-reinforcement behavior during the forming process is very important since the appearance of defects (for example wrinkles, yarn misalignment or breakage) can significantly affect the mechanical properties of the final part. Experimental characterization of the mechanical behavior of textile-reinforcements is expensive, time consuming, and a large scattering of results is often observed. To overcome this, meso-scale modeling is an interesting method to study and understand the textile behavior at the unit cell level. To perform realistic simulations, an accurate modeling and, therefore, knowledge of the yarn mechanical behavior are needed. In this paper, a simple protocol is proposed and validated in order to investigate the tensile behavior of commingled polypropylene/glass yarns.

A comparison of tensile behavior of yarns before and after weaving is carried out in order to evaluate the <b>weaving</b> damage <b>effect.</b> Finally, a model describing the commingled yarn behavior is proposed.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{a series}} of freeway and arterial traffic modeling, estimation and control methodologies. First, it investigates the Link-Node Cell Transmission Model's (LN-CTM's) ability to model arterial traffic. The LN-CTM is a modification of the cell transmission model developed by Daganzo. The investigation utilizes traffic data collected on an arterial segment in Los Angeles, California, and a link-node cell transmission model, with some adaptations to the arterial traffic, is constructed for the studied location. The simulated flow and the simulation travel time were compared with field measurements to evaluate the modeling accuracy. Second, an algorithm for estimating turning proportions is proposed in this dissertation. The knowledge about turning proportions at street intersections is a frequent input for traffic models, but {{it is often difficult}} to measure directly. Compared with previous estimation methods used to solve this problem, the proposed method can be used with only half the detectors employed in the conventional complete detector configuration. The proposed method formulates the estimation problem as a constrained least squares problem, and a recursive solving procedure is given. A simulation study was carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. In addition to addressing arterial traffic modeling and estimation problems, this dissertation also studies a freeway traffic control strategy and a freeway and arterial coordinated control strategy. It presents a coordinated control strategy of variable speed limits (VSL) and ramp metering to address freeway congestion caused by <b>weaving</b> <b>effects.</b> In this strategy, variable speed limits are designed to maximize the bottleneck flow, and ramp metering is designed to minimize travel time in a model predictive control frame work. A microscopic simulation based on the I- 80 at Emeryville, California was built to evaluate the strategy, and the results showed that the traffic performance was significantly improved. Following the freeway control study, this dissertation discusses the coordinated control of freeways and arterials. In current practice, traffic controls on freeways and on arterials are independent. In order to coordinate these two systems for better performance, a control strategy covering the freeway ramp metering and the signal control at the adjacent intersection is developed. This control strategy uses upstream ALINEA, which is a well-known control algorithm, for ramp metering to locally maximize freeway throughput. For the intersection signal control, the proposed control strategy distributes green splits by taking into account both the available on-ramp space and the demands of all intersection movements. A microscopic simulation of traffic in an arterial intersection with flow discharge to a freeway on-ramp, which is calibrated using the data collected at San Jose, California, is created to evaluate the performance of the proposed control strategy. The results showed that the proposed strategy can reduce intersection delay by 8 %, compared to the current field-implemented control strategy. Transportation mobility can be improved not only by traffic management strategies, but also through the deployment of advanced vehicle technologies. This dissertation also investigates the impact of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) on highway capacity. A freeway microscopic traffic simulation model is constructed to evaluate how the freeway lane flow capacity change under different penetration rates of vehicles equipped with either ACC or CACC system. This simulation model is based on a calibrated driver behavioral model and the vehicle dynamics of the ACC and CACC systems. The model also utilizes data collected from a real experiment in which drivers' selections of time gaps are recorded. The simulation shows that highway capacity can be significantly increased when the CACC vehicles reach a moderate to high market penetration, as compared to both regular manually driven vehicles and vehicles equipped with only ACC...|$|R
