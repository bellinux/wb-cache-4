5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> for assuming that {{they are also the}} consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E

[...] In an article originally published in 1999, Kevin Coogan also mentioned Vikernes' alleged intent to [...] "destroy an Oslo-based punk anti-fascist squat called Blitz House," [...] and stated [...] "Vikernes may have felt that {{he had no choice but}} to kill Euronymous before bombing Blitz House because 'the Communist' would almost certainly have opposed such an act."

2500|$|Although most sources {{indicate}} that Chandragupta was of east-Indian origin, alternative theories {{have been proposed}} by scholars. Some relate Sandrocottos (or Androcottos) to Sisicottos of classical literature. Sisicottos was the ruler of Paropamise (Hindu Kush) who helped the last Persian satrap (Bessus of Bactria) against Alexander, later co-operating with the latter during the Sogdian campaigns. During Alexander's campaigns in Kabul and the Swat River valley, Prince Sisicottos helped him defeat several principalities of the Ashvakas. During a battle at the fortress of Aornos in which Alexander faced stiff resistance from the local population, Sisicottos was put {{in command of the}} strategically important fort and Arrian refers to Sisicottos the governor of Assakenoi. However, it is unclear whether Sisicottos was Sandrocottos or if they were related. J. W. McCrindle and H. R. Gupta hypothesize that [...] "they both possibly belonged two different branches of the Ashvakas". Meri may have been another political centre of the Mor (Meros) people. The name [...] "Moriya" [...] (or Maurya) may have come from Mor (Koh-i-Mor; [...] "Mor hill), the ancient Meros of classical literature in the Paropamisade region between the Kunar and Swat Rivers in the land of Ashvakas. (This name, [...] refers to the Meru mountain of Chitral, Tirich Mir; there is also a Deva-Meru in modern Diamar). It is claimed that since Chandragupta Maurya could have belonged to Mor, he [...] "was called Moriya or Maurya after his motherland". Spooner observes, [...] "After Alexander's death, when Chandragupta marched on Magadha, it was with largely the Persian army (Shaka-Yavana-Kamboja-Parasika-Bahlika) that he won the throne of India. The testimony of the Mudrarakshasa is explicit on this point, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to doubt its accuracy in matter of this kind". This theory contradicts the Mudrarakshasa, which examines Malayketu's alliance with the Persians (not Chandragupta). According to the Mudrarakshasa, Malayaketu, Rakshasa (the last minister of Nanda) and his Persian allies wanted to invade Pataliputra, the capital of Chandragupta. Their alliance was undone by Chanakya, who attracted Rakshasa to the Maurya side.|$|E
