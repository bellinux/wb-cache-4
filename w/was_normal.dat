An angiogram revealed an obstruction in the distal subclavian and axillary arteries of the right arm.

In recent decades, several countries have realized the value of blast furnaces as a part of their industrial history. Rather than being demolished, abandoned steel mills were turned into museums or integrated into multi-purpose parks. The largest number of preserved historic blast furnaces exists in Germany; other such sites exist in Spain, France, the Czech Republic, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Mexico, Russia and the United States.|$|E

5|$|After the explosion, as {{the rescue}} {{operations}} commenced, the fleet was alerted {{and the area}} was searched for Allied submarines, but no traces were found. To avert the potential damage to morale {{from the loss of}} a battleship so soon after the string of recent setbacks in the war effort, Mutsus destruction was declared a state secret. Mass cremations of recovered bodies began almost immediately after the sinking. Captain Teruhiko Miyoshi's body was recovered by divers on 17 June, but his wife was not officially notified until 6 January 1944. Both he and his second in command, Captain Ono Koro, were posthumously promoted to rear admiral, as <b>was</b> <b>normal</b> practice. To further prevent rumours from spreading, healthy and recovered survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean. Some of the survivors were sent to Truk in the Caroline Islands and assigned to the 41st Guard Force. Another 150 were sent to Saipan in the Mariana Islands, where most were killed in 1944 during the battle for the island.|$|E
5|$|Although {{meteorologist}} David Roth {{assessed the}} storm as making landfall on August19 at Isle Dernière {{to the west}} of New Orleans, a research paper from the American Meteorological Society estimated that the hurricane moved ashore about 40mi (60km) southeast of New Orleans. Modern research suggests the storm was the equivalent of a major hurricane (a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale), or with winds of at least , when it made landfall. It passed just southwest of the city, becoming the closest major hurricane to New Orleans. The wind diameter was average to slightly below-average, and the forward speed <b>was</b> <b>normal.</b> Due to its movement, the hurricane likely maintained much of its strength after making landfall and by the time it affected New Orleans. The hurricane gradually weakened over land, passing near Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Natchez, Mississippi on August20. Heavy rainfall was reported in eastern Ohio beginning on August21, potentially from the remnants of the storm merging with a cold front.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} of Operation Overlord, German forces were of an unknown {{quantity}} and quality, but the division would be confronted by elements of Germany's 711th Infantry Division, {{a part of the}} 15th Army. The 711th was composed of the 731st and the 744th Grenadier Infantry Regiments, together with artillery and other supporting arms. Even before the invasion the German division had not been considered a front line formation, but rather a static division on anti-invasion duties, and many of its units had not been at full strength. Furthermore, many of its troops were older than <b>was</b> <b>normal</b> in a first line division, or were conscripted foreigners from Poland and Russia. Being a static division, it was hampered further by having almost no transport of its own, and what was available was mostly horse drawn.|$|E

5|$|During Linnaeus' time it <b>was</b> <b>normal</b> for {{upper class}} {{women to have}} wet nurses for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing {{campaign}} to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast-feeding by mothers. In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student, based on their experiences. In {{the tradition of the}} period, this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer (prases) expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus' dissertation was translated into French by J.E. Gilibert in 1770 as La Nourrice marâtre, ou Dissertation sur les suites funestes du nourrisage mercénaire. Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the child care practices of the Lapps and pointed out how healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed out how none of them denied their newborns their breastmilk. It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms.|$|E
5|$|Henry had a {{considerable}} sexual appetite and enjoyed {{a substantial number}} of sexual partners, resulting in a large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported. It <b>was</b> <b>normal</b> for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of these relationships occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. Henry had a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, but the evidence to support this theory is limited.|$|E
5|$|In 1681, King Charles II gave Penn a {{large piece}} of his newly {{acquired}} American land holdings to repay a debt the king owed to Admiral Sir William Penn, Penn's father.

Penn put together a colonial expedition and fleet, which set out for America {{in the middle of the}} following summer. Penn, sailing in the vanguard, first set foot on American soil at the colony at New Castle, Delaware. An orderly change of government ensued, as <b>was</b> <b>normal</b> in an age used to the privileges and prerogatives of aristocracy and which antedated nationalism: the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new Proprietor.

5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>normal</b> in fleet {{actions of}} the 18th century for the two lines of battle to pass one another sedately, exchanging fire at long ranges and then wearing away, often without either side losing a ship or taking an enemy. In contrast, Howe was {{counting}} on the professionalism of his captains and crews combined with {{the advantage of the}} weather gage to attack the French directly, driving through their line. However, this time he did not plan to manoeuvre in the way he had during the two previous encounters; each ship following in the wake of that in front to create a new line arrowing through his opponent's force (as Rodney had done at the Battle of the Saintes 12years earlier). Instead, Howe ordered each of his ships to turn individually towards the French line, intending to breach it at every point and rake the French ships at both bow and stern. The British captains would then pull up on the leeward side of their opposite numbers, cutting them off from their retreat downwind, and engage them directly, hopefully forcing each to surrender and consequently destroying the French Atlantic Fleet.|$|E

The concert's success tempted Sony officials to use it as some form of an album. However, Carey and Afansieff were already making headway on a new album set tentatively for release in 1993. This being so, Sony decided to release it as an EP, selling for a reduced price due to its shorter length.|$|E
