50|$|Placing spark <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> {{back into}} their {{separators}} or holders during replacement helps {{to keep them in}} place despite engine vibration, extending their life. A common problem with spark <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> is corrosion of the metal end terminals. Better-quality spark <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> usually have brass terminals, which are more resistant to corrosion than other metals used.|$|R
50|$|When simple {{on-premises}} wiring is color-coded, two-wire telephone plugs or {{the first}} pair of a multi-pair connector commonly have the tip wire coded green and ring coded red.

For larger cable assemblies more complex schemes such as the 25-pair color code are used.|$|R

50|$|Organ tones are {{sounded in}} one of three ways; in 'normal' mode, by {{pressing}} any string onto a fret; in 'percussion' mode, by fretting any string and touching the included brass plectrum (connected to a short <b>wire</b> <b>plugged</b> into a socket on the scratchplate) onto any metal part of the guitar; or by pressing one of the six 'open string' buttons. There is an option to silence the lowest two strings, and the organ section, as a whole, can also be switched off. There is a four-position octave selector, a six-position effect selector, a four-way selector for the percussion and a flute selector.|$|R

50|$|In 1944, the Luftwaffe {{introduced}} a plugboard switch, called the Uhr (clock), {{a small box}} containing a switch with 40 positions. It replaced the standard plugs. After connecting the plugs, as determined in the daily key sheet, the operator turned the switch {{into one of the}} 40 positions, each producing a different combination of <b>plug</b> <b>wiring.</b> Most of these plug connections were, unlike the default plugs, not pair-wise.

50|$|Initially {{the system}} had one channel that was {{transmitted}} as direct audio. The <b>wires</b> and <b>plugs</b> {{for the system}} {{were the same as}} for standard power <b>wires</b> and <b>plugs</b> which could cause receivers to burn out by attaching to mains socket. During World War II, all RF receivers were confiscated , but cable radio continued operating and, in particular, was used to transmit warnings of aerial bombing. The 1960s saw an enhancement with the addition of two additional channels, using AM on carrier frequencies of 78 and 120 kHz. The installation of this system became mandatory for all new buildings. The system, along with usual broadcasting, was created to inform people of emergencies.|$|R

5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side of}} the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 <b>wire</b> <b>plug</b> and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|R

50|$|GM {{recalled}} 1.5 million {{vehicles with}} this engine on April 14, 2009 due to risk of fire from engine oil leaking under the valve cover gaskets onto hot exhaust manifolds. The fire could {{spread to the}} nearby plastic spark <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> retainers on the valve cover {{and then to the}} rest of the engine compartment. GM fitted the affected vehicles with redesigned spark <b>plug</b> <b>wire</b> retainers. These engines were noted for having problems with the plastic upper intake manifold cracking around the EGR passage. The engine would then hydrolock. The lower intake gaskets and upper intake manifolds were revised, correcting all these issues.|$|R

40|$|The authors {{present their}} {{prototype}} {{of a system}} for electric conduction at contact with laparoscopic tools, devised, designed and produced by them at the Politecnico di Torino, Department of Mechanical Engineering.

The Authors used the instrument with surgical tools with a metallic handle, during three cholecystectomies. Nowadays all standard laparoscopic tools have the chance and the need to be electrified. Now the way commonly used to electrify a laparoscopic tool is using a <b>wire</b> <b>plugged</b> to a fixed conducting point of the instrument. This prototype has been devised and produced to avoid some discomforts met during the numerous manoeuvres of connecting and disconnecting the wire at the time of a surgical intervention. This device permits the direct transfer (by contact) of electric energy from the wire to surgical tools. The advantage is to be more rapid in changing surgical tools obtaining, immediately an electrified instrument in your han...|$|R
50|$|Automotive spark <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> are {{insulated}} {{by multiple}} layers of silicone to prevent sparks from jumping to adjacent wires, causing misfires. Silicone tubing is sometimes used in automotive intake systems (especially for engines with forced induction).|$|R
5000|$|Spark <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> have {{an outer}} {{insulation}} several times thicker than the conductor, {{made of a}} very flexible and heat-resistant material such as silicone or EPDM rubber. The thick insulation prevents arcing from the cable to an earthed engine component. A rubber [...] "boot" [...] covers each terminal. Dielectric grease {{can be used to}} improve insulation; a small amount can be applied in the inside of the rubber boot at each end of each wire to help seal out moisture. Printing on spark <b>plug</b> <b>wires</b> may include a brand name, insulation thickness (in millimeters), insulation material type, cylinder number, and conductor type (suppressor or solid wire).|$|R
25|$|Electronic analog {{computers}} {{typically have}} front panels with numerous jacks (single-contact sockets) that permit patch cords (flexible <b>wires</b> with <b>plugs</b> at both ends) {{to create the}} interconnections which define the problem setup. In addition, there are precision high-resolution potentiometers (variable resistors) for setting up (and, when needed, varying) scale factors. In addition, there {{is likely to be}} a zero-center analog pointer-type meter for modest-accuracy voltage measurement. Stable, accurate voltage sources provide known magnitudes.|$|R
50|$|UK {{electrical}} wiring standards are largely harmonised with the regulations in other European {{countries and the}} international IEC 60446 standard. However {{there are a number}} of specific national practices, habits and traditions that differ significantly from other countries, and which in some cases survived harmonisation. These include the use of ring circuits for domestic and light commercial fixed <b>wiring,</b> fused <b>plugs,</b> and for circuits installed prior to harmonisation, historically unique wiring colours.|$|R
5000|$|Stereotactic {{surgery is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to aid in}} several different types of animal research studies. Specifically, {{it is used to}} target specific sites of the brain and directly introduce pharmacological agents to the brain which otherwise {{may not be able to}} cross the blood-brain barrier. [...] In rodents, the main applications of stereotactic surgery are to introduce fluids directly to the brain or to implant cannulae and microdialysis probes. Site specific central microinjections are used when rodents do not need to be awake and behaving or when the substance to be injected has a long duration of action. For protocols in which rodents’ behaviors must be assessed soon after injection, stereotactic surgery can be used to implant a cannula through which the animal can be injected after recovery from the surgery. These protocols take longer than site-specific central injections in anesthetized mice because they require the construction of cannulae, <b>wire</b> <b>plugs,</b> and injection needles, but induce less stress in the animals because they allow for a recovery period for the healing of trauma induced to the brain before injection. [...] Surgery can also be used for microdialysis protocols to implant and tether the dialysis probe and guide cannula.|$|R
