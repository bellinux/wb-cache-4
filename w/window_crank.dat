25|$|Early 1980-1985 models {{featured}} butterfly opening windows, round side indicators, only {{a single}} set of tail lights {{on each side of}} the car, no rear defroster, and usually a black interior with a black dashboard, and many metal trim pieces such as <b>window</b> <b>crank</b> handles and door handles. Since around 1985, the cars received more comfortable seating, a blue or brown dashboard, two-part tail lights on each side, square side signals, rear defroster, redesigned instrument cluster, and butterfly windows that did not open. In 1990, a fuel filler flap was added instead of a twist cap, and some minor interior and instrument cluster changes were implemented. In 1991, the dashboard was redesigned first for the Yugo GVX and then for the European model, side butterfly windows were removed, and a bigger tank was introduced. In 2000, the car received a new front fascia with new bumpers, rear spoiler, a redesigned dashboard, and seats. The latest changes were in 2007, with the introduction of a new instrument cluster.|$|E
2500|$|The 1980 Caprice Classic saw {{its first}} major {{revision}} since the 1977 downsizing. To further improve the fuel {{economy of the}} car, {{efforts were made to}} reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. The Caprice received all new exterior sheet metal, without drastically changing the look of the car. To improve aerodynamics the hood was tapered lower, while the trunk area was higher. The grille was now an egg crate style while the tail-light panel featured three separate square lights per side. All the doors and components within were redesigned to be lighter, including the <b>window</b> <b>crank</b> mechanisms, which now used a tape drive mechanism. Greater use of aluminum including in-bumper reinforcement and in-sedan/coupe radiators helped to further reduce the overall weight of the vehicle. 1980 models were approximately [...] lighter than 1979 models.|$|E
50|$|Power windows {{have become}} so common that by 2008, some {{automakers}} eliminated hand crank windows from all their models. So many vehicles now have power windows that some people no longer understand the (formerly) common sign from another driver of using their hand to simulate moving a <b>window</b> <b>crank</b> to indicate that they wish to speak with someone when stopped at a light or in a parking lot. The 2008 Audi RS4 sold in Europe, however, still has roll-up windows for the rear doors although its counterpart sold in the U.S. has power windows for all doors.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea was}} to attract racers {{who did not have}} the budgets that were {{required}} in the GT category as well as an emphasis on compact sedans such as the AMC Gremlin and the Opel Manta. There were two classes from 1970 through 1973: Class A for under two liters and under 1.6 liters with overhead cam and Class B for over 1.6 L with overhead cam and over two liters up to the largest permitted engine being the 232 cuin L AMC Gremlin. In 1974 all cars were placed in one class, with the only parity for the smaller engines being free carburetion for under 1.6 liters. Limited preparation was permitted, and since the entrants were meant to be street-driven race cars, the original rules required the retention of headlights, seats, upholstery, <b>window</b> <b>cranks,</b> stock brakes and original springs and radial tires. Only the exhaust systems and shock absorbers were free. Later rules regarding headlights, seats, upholstery, <b>window</b> <b>cranks,</b> original springs, and other stock elements were loosened up somewhat. From the beginning, engine modifications similar to Sports Car Club of America B Sedan were permitted, with the main difference being that over-boring cylinders was not allowed, and stock carburetors being required, but modifications allowed. In addition, springs and alignment were free. The series was loosely based on rival SCCA Trans-Am's Two-Five Challenge rules.|$|R
50|$|The 1972 {{models were}} {{very similar to the}} 1971 models, with the only change being the rear view mirror was glued to the {{windshield}} rather than bolted to top of the cab, and metal or vinyl-covered flat door panels were no longer available; all trim level door panels were molded plastic with integral armrests and wood grain inserts on Cheyenne and Sierra trim levels. For restoration, {{it should also be noted}} that the door and <b>window</b> <b>cranks</b> were slightly longer due to the molded plastic door panels, and the vent windows were now secured with a single screw on the inside of the door, thus differentiating it from the 1971 model year.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1967, {{a number}} of {{additional}} changes were incorporated to accommodate stricter safety regulations and US emission laws. The safety improvements included a collapsible steering wheel and padded wheel hub, concave control knobs, elastic black rubber heater levers (instead of rigid colored translucent plastic), and softer, rounded dash top padding. Door handles, locks, and <b>window</b> <b>cranks</b> were modernized and less protruding, the door pockets were elastic, the rear-view mirror frame was chrome instead of black plastic, and the side view mirrors became more angular. Essentially, the 1967 250 SL retained the more classic [...] "chrome" [...] interior of the 230 SL, whereas the 1968 250 SL introduced the modernized [...] "safety" [...] interior of the 280 SL.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{initially}} {{used the}} trade name of [...] "Atlas" [...] for the accessory and supply segment, producing vehicle lights, signaling equipment, fuel and oil canisters, jacks and air pumps. In October 1926, the company patented its crank drive for lowerable windows. After buying {{the rights to}} use the patent for the wrap sling brake from the American company Ternstedt, series production of mechanical window regulators started in 1928. Commonly {{referred to as a}} <b>window</b> <b>crank</b> apparatus, this device was also manufactured for buses, trains and streetcars. Windshields and ventilation systems expanded the range of products in the years following.|$|E

5000|$|Ford began {{production}} of the model year 1983 Ranger on January 18, 1982 at the Louisville Assembly Plant, hitting showrooms in March. Available engines were the [...] 2.0 L and [...] 2.3 L OHC four-cylinders, a four-cylinder [...] 2.2 L Mazda/Perkins diesel, and a [...] 2.8 L Cologne V6. In 1985, a Mitsubishi-built 2.3 L turbo-diesel with [...] replaced the Mazda diesel engine, and in 1986, the 2.8-liter engine was replaced with a [...] 2.9 L Cologne V6. The Super-cab was introduced in 1986, offering an extra 17 in of storage space behind the front seats, {{with a pair of}} jump seats available as an option. Also in 1986, the gauge cluster was modified to allow fitment of a factory tachometer. A lot of the parts of the interior such as the steering wheel, door handles, and the <b>window</b> <b>cranks</b> were similar to those in other Ford vehicles like the Bronco, Escort, and the F-Series.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1980 s, “outsourcing ” {{typically}} {{referred to the}} situation when firms expanded their purchases of manufactured physical inputs, like car companies that purchased <b>window</b> <b>cranks</b> and seat fabrics from outside the firm rather than making them inside. But in 2004, outsourcing took on a different meaning. It referred now to a specific segment of the growing international trade in services. This segment consists of arm’s-length [or what Bhagwati (1984) has called “long-distance”] purchase of services abroad, principally, but not necessarily, via the electronic mediums such as the telephone, fax and Internet and includes, for example, phone call centers staffed in Bangalore to serve customers in New York and x-rays transmitted digitally from Boston to be read in Bombay. 1 Thus, in February 2004, the members of President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers stated: “Outsourcing of professional services is a prominent example of {{a new type of}} trade ” (Mankiw, Forbes, and Rosen, 2004). The chair of the CEA, Gregory Mankiw, made a similar point in a press interview (Andrews, 2004) : ''I think outsourcing is a growing phenomenon, but it's something that we should realize is probably a plus fo...|$|R
50|$|Ratan asks Sheela out for dinner, Sheela accepts {{and books}} a trunk call to Gahota. Pratap argues with Avinash that the said {{incidents}} did happen {{and that he}} has taken pictures. Pratap takes Avinash to Regent photo studio, whose owner Balram is his friend. Balram hands over the developed photos to Pratap, but those are not what Pratap handed over to him four days back. Furious Pratap dashes into the dark room, he is restrained and roughed up by Avinash who is frustrated with him. Later at Pratap's home, Avinash goes through the photos and discovers that they are taken today and not four days back. Avinash visits the photo studio, again, alone in a taxi and asks the driver to wait for him. Balram's assistant confesses that he switched them as directed by Balram. A black car (Hindustan Contessa) is seen moving through Gahota mysteriously at night with devil's symbol hanging from IRVM. Black car bumps the taxi and engraves the symbol on it. Taxi driver becomes possessed by devil and removes the <b>window</b> <b>crank</b> handles and cuts the fuel line. Avinash returns, a scuffle ensues between him and taxi driver. A match is thrown from inside the black car which ignites the fuel trail. Taxi driver is seen laughing hysterically and Avinash kills him. Taxi blows up killing Avinash. Inspector Vanshi orders the locals to remove the evidences and book a return ticket for Avinash from Gahota. Pratap watches all this and flees from Gahota in his car with Inspector Vanshi pursuing him. Pratap's car runs out of fuel and he stops at a petrol pump. He calls his daughter Sheela, informing her that he is coming to meet her in Mumbai and cautions her not to come to Gahohta ever, even for his funeral if he dies.|$|E
50|$|We {{wanted to}} build a music service that {{combined}} the freedom of an on-demand subscription service—unlimited, uninterrupted streaming and downloads of tens of millions of songs - but layer on top features that would give you that feeling only music that moves you can give. The right song at the right time will give you a chill. Make you pull someone close. Nod your head. Sing in the mirror. Roll down the car <b>window</b> and <b>crank</b> the volume to the right.|$|R

5000|$|For the 1986-1993 model years, {{there were}} mainly three trim levels {{available}} in North America: Base, SE-5, LX, and LE-5. The base model came with standard 14-inch steel wheels {{and not much}} else besides the basics (this did not include a rear step bumper). The SE-5 was the [...] "sporty" [...] trim level, with added features such as a tachometer, side-mounted truck mirrors, a rear step bumper, an AM/FM stereo, sporty white/black wheels, white-lettered Bridgestone SF Radial tires (which have long since been discontinued), and a prominent stripe graphic kit, the latter being the most easily distinguishable feature of the SE-5. The LX was the more luxurious trim level, with standard features that made it the most well-equipped trim line of the bunch. Such added features included air conditioning, power steering, power brakes, cruise control, AM/FM stereo with cassette deck and equalizer, center console, locking glove box, and chrome trim throughout (interior door handles and <b>window</b> <b>cranks,</b> taillight bezels, chrome added trim {{on the sides of the}} body, a chrome rear step bumper, a chrome strip on the front bumper, and the same steel wheels that came with the SE-5 but with a chrome finish). For the 1990 model year, the LX trim level was replaced with the LE-5, which combined a hybrid of styling and features from both the LX and SE-5.|$|R
5000|$|Jeopardy was {{critically}} lauded, {{and received}} full 5-star reviews from three major music publications: NME, Sounds and Melody Maker. Steve Sutherland of Melody Maker wrote: [...] "Jeopardy {{is one of}} those records that makes me want to throw all the <b>windows</b> open, <b>crank</b> it up to full volume and blast it out to the world. It clears my head of boredom, strips away the gloom and single-handedly restores my belief in the power of pop to make people stop, think and question. ... Jeopardy has got more spirit, more soul and more downright honesty about it than any other record I've heard this year".|$|R
5000|$|Racing {{equipment}} includes tubular exhaust headers, {{an electric}} fuel pump, altered rear suspension with heavy-duty traction control bars and asymmetrical leaf springs, heavy-duty trunk-mounted battery, locking differential, auxiliary gauges, special drag race wheels and tires supplied both by Goodyear and Mickey Thompson (himself {{a recipient of}} one of the first ten cars) and an aluminum scatter shield designed to contain the clutch in case of disintegration under load. The claimed compression ratio was 13.5:1. Other weight-saving measures include the elimination of such street items as the sunvisors, radio, heater, wheel covers, passenger side windshield wiper, arm rests, rear <b>window</b> <b>cranks,</b> mirrors, sound deadening material, carpeting, trunk mat, lug wrench, jack and spare tire. Front seats were either lightweight units from Ford's police package vehicles or rudimentary bucket seats from the Econoline van; the carpeting was replaced with a black rubber mat. The rear seat was a standard Fairlane unit. The high-beam headlights were eliminated as well and in their place were mesh-covered air intakes which ran directly to a special air cleaner atop the 427. Like the street version, the Thunderbolt's outer high-low 5.75 inch (146 mm) headlights of the type normally used with a four-lamp system were selectable with a standard foot-operated switch. Though it was technically a street legal automobile, these modifications and deletions along with a final drive ratio of 4:57.1 for the four-speed cars and 4:44.1 for the automatics make the Thunderbolt impractical for street use.|$|R

This segment consists of arm’s-length, or what Bhagwati (1984) called “long-distance, ” purchase of services abroad, principally, but not necessarily, via electronic mediums such as the telephone, fax and the Internet. Outsourcing can happen both though transactions by firms, like phone call centers staffed in Bangalore to serve customers in New York and x-rays transmitted digitally from Boston to be read in Bombay, or with direct consumption purchases by individuals, like when someone hires an offshore firm to provide plans for redesigning or redecorating a living room.

In 1914, Motor Cycle magazine reported on a Zenith motorcycle supplied with the 'new' 964cc (8HP) V-twin Green engine, of 85mm bore and stroke.

The Ion's instrument panel was mounted on the top center of the dashboard, rather than behind the steering wheel. The Ion is available in sedan level 1, 2, or 3; level three signified a more user friendly setup with power windows and power locks, while lower levels included <b>crank</b> <b>windows</b> and plastic wheel covers. Other extras included fog lights, sunroof, and spoiler. The Saturn Ion Quad Coupe has half-sized rear suicide doors while the sedan has conventionally hinged doors.|$|R

On a single enclosed mount, he sits below and just outboard of the Pointer's seat. Under the Pointer's seat, {{and in front}} the Fuse Setter, is the Fuse Indicator Regulator. (pictured) It is a box with a <b>window,</b> a hand <b>crank,</b> and a selector lever. On a twin mount, he and his Fuze Indicator Regulator sit next to the Sight Setter between the guns. When the mount is put in Automatic control, he flips the selector lever to Auto, and this electrically powered Fuze Indicator Regulator automatically follows the fuze setting orders sent from the Fire Control System by synchro. In Local Control, he follows the Mount Captain's fuze orders by spinning the hand crank until the dials in the window read the correct fuze time.|$|R
