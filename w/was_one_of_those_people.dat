2500|$|The {{poet and}} essayist Alexei Tsvetkov remembered him with these words:...he had very few {{friends in the}} {{commonly}} accepted {{sense of the word}} – that is, people who could climb into each other's skin. He <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> who protect their own territory very well. Yet at the same time, as strange as it might seem, it was easier to talk with him than with many in this traditional [...] "subcutaneous" [...] category.|$|E
2500|$|The album took {{eighteen}} months to complete, the longest Jackson had spent recording an album. Its {{initial stages of}} [...] "hard-hitting dance music" [...] were inspired by Zero 7 and Télépopmusik, who later produced the album's interludes. [...] "Some of the songs have a definite sort of ambient quality to them," [...] said producer Jimmy Jam. Jam added [...] "There's some house stuff, which there always is [...]" [...] "There {{is going to be}} some more guitar-flavored things" [...] "happy up-tempo songs, the very funky tunes, the very sensual, sexy ballads." [...] Dallas Austin considered it [...] "easily the most sexy thing she's done." [...] "To me, this is her Dirty Mind," [...] Austin explained. [...] "It's a really sexy record, but not in a sensual way. It's bold, it's fun, it's really positive. Nobody's sad, nobody's mad. It's just really fun songs where she happens to be talking frankly about sex." [...] The sensual direction originated from the aura Jackson exuded to Austin while recording. [...] "Guys won't {{know what to do with}} themselves after this," [...] said Austin, laughing at the prospect. [...] "It's one of the best records she's made." [...] Then-newcomer Kanye West exclaimed his sessions with Jackson were [...] "unbelievable," [...] having previously expressed desire to collaborate. Songwriter Sean Garrett described being [...] "starstruck," [...] calling the session an [...] "essential" [...] part of his early career. [...] "I thought working with Janet would change my life and it definitely did. [...] She <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> that I really wanted to work with." [...] Anders Bagge of BAG & Arnthor commented [...] "That's my dream, she's the one I would give anything to work with. The ultimate female artist," [...] Arnthor Birgisson adding, [...] "let's just say we will definitely be prepared if and when that happens." ...|$|E

500|$|Vanilla Ice {{stated that}} [...] "It's {{unbelievable}} how {{this whole thing}} just came about. I really {{believe that it was}} an action of God. God pushing my wave and riding it.

6000|$|...

60|$|It was not {{altogether}} forgetfulness. Psmith <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> {{who like to}} carry through their operations entirely by themselves.
