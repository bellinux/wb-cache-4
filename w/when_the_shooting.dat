5|$|On December 1, 1884, a town sheriff named Elfego Baca came {{face-to-face}} against 80 gunmen {{which became}} known as the Frisco shootout. The battle started when Baca arrested a cowboy who had shot him. In turn the cowboy called upon 80 of his associates to murder Baca. Baca took refuge in an adobe house, and {{over the course of a}} 36-hour siege, the gunmen put 400 bullet holes in the house (some accounts say a total of 4,000 shots) without touching Baca. He in turn killed 4 of them and wounded 8. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> was over as the attackers finally ran out of ammo, Baca strolled out of the house unscathed. Baca went on to a distinguished career as a lawyer and legislator and died in his bed in 1945, age 80.|$|E

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> began, {{the terrorists}} told their hostages to lean {{forward in the}} theater seats and cover their heads behind the seats. Hostages {{reported}} that {{some people in the}} audience fell asleep, and some of the gunmen put on respirators. As the terrorists and hostages alike began to fall unconscious, several of the female terrorists made a dash for the balcony but passed out before they reached the stairs. They were later found shot dead. Two of the Alpha Group were also overcome by the gas.|$|E

40|$|Banana shoot tips {{extracted}} from in vitro grown plant materials were encapsulated {{in different types}} of alginate beads. The results obtained after conservation for one month at 4 ?C indicated that single layered synseeds (where <b>the</b> encapsulated <b>shoot</b> tip was covered by one layer of the artificial endosperm) containing activated charcoal were the best construction in stimulating conversion of synseeds, where they expressed the highest; conversion frequency, number of shoots/synseed, length of shoot and fresh weight/shoot cluster. These parameters decreased <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> tips were encapsulated within two layers of endosperm, except the ex vitro conversion. Conversion of banana synseeds was influenced by explant orientation inside the alginate beads, the highest conversion frequency was obtained <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> tip was directed upward inside the synthetic endosperm. Synthesis of seed coats around the artificial endosperm improved the conversion frequency, number of shoots/synseed and shoot length...|$|R

25|$|Will Hutchins as Coley. As Gashade's dimwitted friend, Hutchins {{was cast}} in the same burst of {{inspiration}} that Hellman had when he also thought of Warren Oates and Millie Perkins for the other lead roles in the film. Like Oates, <b>when</b> <b>The</b> <b>Shooting</b> began production Hutchins was already fully identified with the western genre, having starred for several years in the ABC-TV television series Sugarfoot, which ran from 1957 to 1961. Both Perkins and Hellman later recalled the actor as being a funny and charming man who never complained about the often adverse filming conditions.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigator}} later {{testified that}} 146 spent shell casings were recovered inside the building. Another 68 casings were collected outside, {{for a total}} of 214 rounds fired by the attacker and responding police officers. A medic who treated Hasan said his pockets were full of pistol magazines. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> ended, he was still carrying 177 rounds of unfired ammunition in his pockets, contained in both 20- and 30-round magazines. The incident, which lasted about 10 minutes, resulted in 13 killed12 soldiers and one civilian; 11 died at the scene, and two died later in a hospital; and 30 people wounded.|$|E
25|$|Janković {{was then}} {{taken to the}} Staff Headquarters of the VRS 22nd Brigade in Kneževo, where he spoke to two survivors, Medo Sivac and Midhat Mujkanović, who told him how they had managed to survive by jumping down <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> started. He drove them {{personally}} to Banja Luka and later on they were transferred to the Islamic Humanitarian Association Merhamet.

30|$|During cultivation, rice {{seeds are}} germinated {{in early spring}} at the {{appropriate}} temperature (usually 32 °C), and the germinated seeds are then sown in <b>the</b> field <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> are approximately 5 mm long. Thus, rice seedlings {{are more likely to}} encounter cold stress after sprouting than during germination. Therefore, seedling survival rate (%) is a more practical criterion for the evaluation of cold tolerance than are traits that are assessed at the germination stage.|$|R
25|$|Farook and Malik {{left their}} six-month-old {{daughter}} with Farook's mother at their Redlands home {{the morning of}} the attack, saying they were going to a doctor's appointment. Farook, a health inspector for the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, attended a departmental event at the banquet room of the Inland Regional Center. The event began as a semi-annual all-staff meeting and training event, and {{was in the process of}} transitioning into a department holiday party/luncheon <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> began.

25|$|After the {{operation}} MGR's voice changed. Since {{he had been}} shot in his ear MGR lost hearing in his left ear and had ringing in the ear problems. These further surfaced in 1983 when he had kidney problems. When Sinnappa Devar paid his first visit to see MGR at the hospital after the shooting incident he paid MGR an advance for the next MGR's movie. After getting released from the hospital and finishing Arasakattalai MGR acted in Devar's movie Vivasaayee against doctors' advice. Due to {{the operation}}, MGR's speaking parts in the movie Kaavalkaaran were reduced. This was the only movie MGR spoke with old and new voices between scenes: MGR was acting in the film Kaavalkaran in 1967 opposite J. Jayalalithaa <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> occurred.|$|E

60|$|The first {{purpose of}} the {{spontaneous}} revolving movement, or, more strictly speaking, of the continuous bowing movement directed successively to all points of the compass, is, as Mohl has remarked, to favour <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> finding a support. This is admirably effected by the revolutions carried on night and day, a wider and wider circle being swept as <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> increases in length. This movement likewise explains how the plants twine; for when a revolving shoot meets with a support, its motion is necessarily arrested {{at the point of}} contact, but the free projecting part goes on revolving. As this continues, higher and higher points are brought into contact with the support and are arrested; and so onwards to the extremity; and thus <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> winds round its support. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> follows <b>the</b> sun in its revolving course, it winds round the support from right to left, the support being supposed {{to stand in front of}} <b>the</b> beholder; <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> revolves in an opposite direction, the line of winding is reversed. As each internode loses from age its power of revolving, it likewise loses its power of spirally twining. If a man swings a rope round his head, and the end hits a stick, it will coil round the stick according to the direction of the swinging movement; so it is with a twining plant, a line of growth travelling round the free part of <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> causing it to bend towards the opposite side, and this replaces the momentum of the free end of the rope.|$|R
50|$|Apical {{dominance}} occurs <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> apex inhibits <b>the</b> {{growth of}} lateral buds {{so that the}} plant may grow vertically. It {{is important for the}} plant to devote energy to growing upward so that it can get more light to undergo photosynthesis. If the plant utilizes available energy for growing upward, it may be able to outcompete other individuals in the near vicinity. Plants that were capable of outcompeting neighboring plants likely had higher fitness. Apical dominance is therefore most likely adaptive.|$|R
500|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{shooting}}</b> stopped, {{about fifty}} protesters started praying on the road, and few {{stood in front}} facing the army with their hands in the air. The army opened fire for a third time. The period of each shooting was short, because [...] "people immediately started running away", witnesses said. After that, riot police intervened, firing tear gas and birdshot to disperse protesters, inflicting more injuries among them.|$|E

500|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> {{between the}} battle lines resumed around 18:00, the Japanese {{concentrated}} their fire upon Imperator Aleksandr III and Borodino. Imperator Alexandr III sheered out of line to port around 18:30 and capsized, but did not sink until 19:07; there were no survivors. Borodino lasted {{a little while longer}} under concentrated Japanese fire. Two 12-inch hits by the battleship [...] at 19:18 started a massive fire and both the ship's 12-inch gun turrets were knocked out. Ten minutes later, after Tōgō ordered his ships to cease fire and disengage, the battleship [...] fired her already-loaded 12-inch guns before turning away. One of these hit Borodino beneath her starboard forward six-inch turret and ignited the ready-use ammunition in the turret. The fire spread and caused a catastrophic detonation in several magazines that blew open her hull. Borodino quickly capsized and sank with only one crewman from her crew of 855 being rescued.|$|E

500|$|The {{morning after}} the shootings, the {{officers}} argued that they acted in self defense, stating that they ordered the activists to surrender, at which time the activists started shooting at them and they returned fire. Initially, the taxi driver said he was under the dashboard of his cab <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> started and could not see who shot first, although he contradicted his statement {{a few days later}} {{in an interview with the}} San Juan Star, a local newspaper, stating that he ducked under the dashboard of the car after the three men (the two activists and the undercover agent) left the car, and that he saw [...] "10 heavily armed men" [...] approaching. When he emerged from the car, he saw the three men alive and two of them were being beaten by the armed men, who were later identified as policemen. Then-Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barceló (PNP) praised the officers in a televised address by calling them “heroic”, stating that they acted in self-defense and stopped a terrorist attack.|$|E
500|$|On November 11, Ortega-Hernandez {{parked his}} vehicle on Constitution Avenue, [...] {{directly}} {{south of the}} White House. He aimed his semi-automatic rifle from the car's passenger seat and fired. Gunfire was reported around 9pm. One bullet hit an antique window on the White House's second floor near the first family's formal living room; however, it did not penetrate the bulletproof glass on the inside. One bullet lodged in a window frame, and others ricocheted off the roof, causing small pieces of wood and concrete to fall to the ground. At least seven bullets struck the second floor, causing $97,000 worth of damage. A woman in a taxi nearby witnessed the shooting and wrote on Twitter, [...] "Driver {{in front of my}} cab STOPPED and fired 5 gun shots at the White House. It took the police a while to respond." [...] President Obama, his wife Michelle, and their oldest daughter Malia were not home {{at the time of the}} shooting, although their younger daughter Sasha and Michelle's mother Marian Shields Robinson were. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> occurred, Malia was coming home and was expected to arrive at any moment.|$|E
500|$|Butler {{was aware}} of the uphill {{struggle}} he faced, and called for a primary for senator, with all Democratic legislators committed to vote to elect the winner. Tillman, who had already finalized his plans to win in the legislature, refused. The series of debates that marked a campaign summer in South Carolina began on June 18, 1894. Butler believed he could still win by appealing to the electorate {{in the same manner as}} Tillman; the senator thought he understood the lessons of 1876 as well as anyone. In the debates, Butler and Tillman matched slander for slander, with Butler claiming that at Hamburg, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> started, Tillman was [...] "nowhere to be found". Tillman shot back that when Butler had testified before Congress about Hamburg, he had downplayed his role in the events. According to Kantrowitz, [...] "their struggle over the legacy of 1876 was in part over who could more legitimately claim to have murdered" [...] African Americans. Tillman's partisans shouted down Butler when he tried to speak at some debates. Although this tactic had been used by Butler and other Democrats against the Republicans in 1876, Butler now decried it as [...] "not Christian civilization to howl anyone down".|$|E
50|$|More simply stated, {{lateral bud}} {{formation}} is inhibited by <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> apical meristem (SAM). The lateral bud primordium (from which the lateral bud develops) is located below SAM. <b>The</b> <b>shoot</b> tip {{rising from the}} SAM inhibits {{the growth of the}} lateral bud by repressing auxin. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> is cut off, the lateral bud begins to lengthen which is mediated by a release of cytokinin. Once the apical dominance has been lifted from the plant, elongation and lateral growth is promoted and the lateral buds grow into new branches. When lateral bud formation prevents the plant from growing upward, it is undergoing lateral dominance. Often, lateral dominance can be triggered by decapitating the SAM or artificially decreasing the concentration of auxin in plant tissues.|$|R
50|$|Native groups {{occasionally}} {{used the}} nuts {{as a food}} supply <b>when</b> <b>the</b> acorn supply was sparse; after boiling and leaching the toxin out of the nut meats for several days, they could be ground into a meal similar to that made from acorns. The nectar of the flowers is toxic to the Asian/European honeybee, so the trees should not be planted near apiaries. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> are small and leaves are new, they are lower in toxins and are grazed by livestock and wildlife.
