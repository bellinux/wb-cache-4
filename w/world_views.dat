5|$|Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, often {{working with}} naturalists, were also {{interested}} in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail and contributing {{to the growth of}} anatomical knowledge. The traditions of alchemy and natural magic, especially in the work of Paracelsus, also laid claim to knowledge of the living world. Alchemists subjected organic matter to chemical analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral pharmacology. This {{was part of a larger}} transition in <b>world</b> <b>views</b> (the rise of the mechanical philosophy) that continued into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor of nature as organism was replaced by the nature as machine metaphor.|$|E
5|$|In this, the milieu is {{interested}} in developing unified <b>world</b> <b>views</b> to discover {{the nature of the}} divine and establish a scientific basis for religious belief. Figures in the New Age movement—most notably Fritjof Capra in his The Tao of Physics (1975)—have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of mysticism, thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science. Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single living organism, although have expanded this idea to include the idea that the Earth has consciousness and intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The {{theological}} {{concerns were}} twofold: first, putting {{man at the}} same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created in the image of God (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept. The conflict between <b>world</b> <b>views</b> that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation–evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.|$|E

5|$|The {{affiliation}} of the Assemblies of God {{with the}} National Association of Evangelicals in 1942 signaled the AG's alignment with evangelicalism and {{its opposition to}} mainline Protestantism and the ecumenical movement. The AG and its evangelical partners agreed on most issues and shared similar <b>world</b> <b>views</b> though the AG's Pentecostal distinctives—Spirit baptism and the operation of spiritual gifts—were not embraced by most evangelical Christians. The AG's response then to the charismatic movement {{that began in the}} 1960s was a cautious one, affirming the move of the Holy Spirit yet urging that all revival must be judged by scripture. For the first time, beliefs and practices which had largely remained confined to the classical Pentecostal denominations began to impact mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic churches on a large scale. The fact that this occurred in these churches (which were historically seen by Pentecostals as suspect), the multifaceted nature of the movement owing to the many different traditions its participants came from, and the perception by Pentecostals that the movement was based too much on experience and not on biblical teaching led some in the Assemblies of God to see it in relation to the ecumenical movement.|$|E

Chapter III elucidates the Romantics' use of mystic myths and noetic symbols.

Supporting theories include those of Henri Bergson, Martin Buber, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and M. H. Abrams.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 236 - 249. This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} nature, construction, and {{operation}} of human <b>world</b> <b>view</b> systems. Using a comparative dialogue with Mahatma Gandhi, Leo Tolstoy, and Religious Studies I aim to develop a definition of <b>world</b> <b>view</b> that explores the pivotal <b>world</b> <b>view</b> universals of identity, orientation and belonging and how these combine and interact in <b>world</b> <b>view</b> systems. I also explore various possibilities of how a sense of identity arises within human awareness and how this in turn structures individuals' understanding of their vocations and modes of active engagement with the world. I hypothesise that this process of identity and <b>world</b> <b>view</b> formation occurs in two paradigmatically different ways which structure the totality of individuals thinking, feeling and acting in the world, whether they are psychologically integrated, and whether their socio-political interactions tend toward violence or nonviolence. Using the theoretical resources of the comparative study of mysticism and religious experience, I set out to define the precise analytical contours of my two paradigms of human awareness and <b>world</b> <b>view.</b> It is in fact the study of mysticism that enables one to more clearly understand what is simultaneously the most crucial and yet neglected facet of human psychology and existence - love. I therefore not only attempt to analyse the construction and operation of <b>world</b> <b>view</b> universals in Gandhi's <b>world</b> <b>view,</b> but also to reinterpret the pivotal Gandhian notions of unity, love, truth and nonviolence as they converge in a personal inner experience of faith. Theoretical resources which I develop, applied to case studies of Gandhi and Tolstoy, are combined to enable general reflections about the nature of conceptual functioning by means of conceptual models or maps, as well as the existential basis of personal empowerment in contexts of violence and death. This thesis confirms the importance of securing a sense of identity, orientation, and belonging - the tension between part and whole - in any <b>world</b> <b>view</b> system, but lays greater stress on the crucial psychological and existential need to overcome a sense of separation, which is a pivotal factor in distinguishing two broad possibilities of human awareness and action as well as two paradigms of <b>world</b> <b>view.</b> The possibility of overcoming the sense of separateness, I suggest, is perhaps the central existential factor determining whether human social interactions are basically violent or nonviolent. It is within the basically nonviolent paradigm of <b>world</b> <b>view,</b> identity and action that one can locate and so better understand Gandhi's religious <b>world</b> <b>view</b> at both its individual and corporate levels...|$|R
40|$|Most {{quantitative}} {{studies that}} survey nurses’ attitudes toward euthanasia and/or assisted suicide, also attempt {{to assess the}} influence of religion on these attitudes. We wanted to evaluate the operationalisation of religion and <b>world</b> <b>view</b> in these surveys. In the Pubmed database we searched for relevant articles published before August 2008 using combinations of search terms. Twenty-eight relevant articles were found. In five surveys nurses were directly asked whether religious beliefs, religious practices and/or ideological convictions influenced their attitudes, or the respondents were requested to mention the decisional basis for their answers on questions concerning end-of-life issues. In other surveys the influence of religion and <b>world</b> <b>view</b> was assessed indirectly through {{a comparison of the}} attitudes of different types of believers and/or non-believers toward euthanasia or assisted suicide. In these surveys we find subjective religious or ideological questions (questions inquiring about the perceived importance of religion or <b>world</b> <b>view</b> in life, influence of religion or <b>world</b> <b>view</b> on life in general, or how religious the respondents consider themselves) and objective questions (questions inquiring about religious practice, acceptance of religious dogma’s, and religious or ideological affiliation). Religious or ideological affiliation is the most frequently used operationalisation of religion and <b>world</b> <b>view.</b> In 16 surveys only one religious or ideological question was asked. In most articles the operationalisation of religion and <b>world</b> <b>view</b> is very limited and does not reflect the diversity and complexity of religion and <b>world</b> <b>view</b> in contemporary society.

In the darkness, Firs wanders into the room and discovers that they have left without him and boarded him inside the abandoned house to die. He lies down on the couch and resigns himself to this fate (apparently dying on the spot). Offstage we hear the axes as they cut down the cherry orchard.|$|E
