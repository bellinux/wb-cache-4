At the same time, {{the estimation of}} the airborne sound insulation of timber frame structures is a complex procedure which includes the prediction of several resonances and the analysis of a significant decrease of the transmission loss in the low frequency range. Three case studies are presented in the paper. The emphasis is put on the transmission loss in 1 / 3 octave frequency bands of double leaf structures with gypsum panels, <b>wood</b> <b>studs</b> and a well-damped cavity. Methods of Sharp and Davy are used for the transmission loss prediction. Particular issues are discussed for an asymmetrically sheathed timber frame structure, <b>wood</b> <b>studs</b> with resilient channels and staggered studs. The paper also presents that the weighted sound reduction index is not sufficient quantity for characterizing the airborne sound insulation of timber frame structures. Various methods are employed for the calculation of the transmission loss of a traditional structure on a silicate base. Characteristic differences between a silicate based structure and a timber frame structure are highlighted. The usage of the spectrum adaptation terms is encouraged. The paper intends to be helpful {{in the field of}} the transmission loss estimation of double leaf structures with <b>wood</b> <b>studs.</b> Since the acoustic {{behavior of}} double leaf structures with <b>wood</b> <b>studs</b> is certainly a complex phenomenon, there is a further need for an improvement of methods for the transmission loss estimation and single number quantities for the evaluation of the sound insulation...|$|R
40|$|To {{save energy}} it’s popular to build houses with low energy loss. In these houses {{the walls are}} keeping a lower {{temperature}} in the external side {{which leads to a}} higher relative humidity. In addition more material, such as <b>wood</b> <b>studs,</b> are used which means that there is more moisture to dry.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate what is a reasonable moisture content in <b>wood</b> <b>studs</b> in four different well-insulated exterior walls. It has also been investigated how moisture rearrangements effect the exterior walls. The software Wufi 2 D, which does moisture-simulations, was used to collect data. The results have been analyzed in Wufi Bio which showed that the moisture content should be somewhere between 12. 5 to 18. 5 %, depending on how the wall is built.

When asked to rate their acoustical performance, people often describe these walls as [...] "paper thin." [...] They offer {{little in the way of}} privacy.

These double-stud walls vary in sound isolation performance from the mid STC-40s into the high STC-60s depending on the presence of insulation and the gypsum wallboard type and quantity. Commercial buildings are typically constructed using steel studs of varying widths, gauges, and on-center spacings. Each of these framing characteristics have an effect on the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees.|$|R
50|$|The main {{interior}} partitions were masonry, other {{walls were}} <b>wood</b> <b>studs</b> with <b>wood</b> lath. The walls were then plastered. Ceilings were constructed of lath and plaster.

Also important are the construction details of the framing with steel studs, wider stud spacing, double studding, insulation, and other details reducing sound transmission.

5000|$|Posse reappeared in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. Shortly {{before the}} race a half-share in the colt was sold for $1 million to the Derisley <b>Wood</b> <b>Stud,</b> {{despite the fact that}} he was still a maiden after four races. At Ascot he was again opposed by Last Fandango and Final Straw, but the lightly-raced Dalsaan was made the odds-on favourite, with Posse {{starting}} the 11/2 third choice in the betting. Eddery rode the colt with great confidence, restraining him towards the back of the field and he was still only in fifth place with a furlong and a half to run. Posse then moved up on the outside, and produced what Timeform described as a [...] "dazzling turn of speed" [...] to overtake Final Straw well inside the final furlong and win very easily by one and a half lengths. In the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in July, Posse was matched against older horses for the first time, but Final Straw appeared to be his most serious opponent and he was made the 8/13 favourite. Eddery again held the colt up for a late challenge but in the straight he appeared unlikely to obtain a clear run as he was trapped on the inside. In the closing stages Posse was switched to the outside and again produced a striking burst of acceleration to catch Final Straw in the last stride and win by a head. There was considerable anticipation of a race between Posse and either Known Fact or Kris the leading miler of 1979, both of whom had missed the summer with training problems. Shortly after his win at Goodwood however, Posse contracted a respiratory infection from which he failed to recover sufficiently for him to take part in the major autumn races.

5000|$|Adding {{absorptive}} {{materials to}} the interior surfaces of rooms (e.g. fabric-faced fiberglass panels, thick curtains) {{will result in a}} decrease of reverberated sound energy within the room. However, absorptive interior surface treatments do not significantly improve the sound isolation from one room to another through demising partitions over the typical frequency range measured currently. Installing absorptive insulation (e.g., fiberglass batts, blow-in cellulose, mineral fiber batts) into the wall or ceiling cavities affects the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees, depending on the framing configuration and joist or stud depth. For example, the presence of type of insulation in single 2x4 <b>wood</b> <b>stud</b> framing spaced 16" [...] (406 mm) on-center results in only a few STC points. In contrast, adding standard fiberglass insulation to an otherwise empty cavity in light-gauge (25-gauge or lighter) steel stud partitions can result in a nearly 10 STC-point improvement. As the stud gauge becomes heavier, the presence and type of insulation matters less.|$|E

The main {{feature of the}} house was to be a music room with excellent acoustic properties that could accommodate Mrs. Lipetz’s Bechstein Grand piano and up to twenty guests. Soriano designed the north end of this 15 ft x 32 ft room as a semi circle with continuous windows, creating a real-life backdrop of the vast San Gabriel Mountain Range, for Mrs. Lipetz’s performances. The site itself is on the pinnacle of a hill overlooking Silver Lake. Several hundred music albums were accommodated in shelves placed under built-in seating areas, and much of the other furniture in the house was also built-in. The music room comprised nearly one third of the total 2300 sq ft area of the two-bedroom house. The design is in the International Style, built with traditional <b>wood</b> <b>stud</b> construction, similar to Richard Neutra’s frame, but with one innovate technological detail - steel beams supported the ground floor.
