5|$|Ip {{figures out}} that Lin was beaten {{and killed by}} the Japanese after an earlier fight. Barely able to contain his rage, Ip demands a match with ten karateka at once. Despite having not practiced Wing Chun since the Japanese {{occupied}} their town (to conserve energy and thus food for his family), he mercilessly defeats all of them with a brutal and effective barrage of blows, showing none of the restraint he exhibited in earlier matches. His skill arouses the interest of General Miura, who wants {{to learn more about}} Ip and <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> fight again.|$|E
5|$|Julia's suspicions {{regarding}} Macrinus' {{involvement in}} the death of Caracalla led to her championing the case of her grandson, Elagabalus, as the rightful emperor. At the time Elagabalus was the chief priest of the Phoenician god Elagabal in Emesa. The soldiers nearby frequently visited the temple where Elagabalus was chief priest, to <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> perform his rituals and ceremonies. At one of these visits, Julia Maesa took the opportunity to inform the soldiers, it is not known whether truthfully, that Elagabalus was Caracalla's son. Simultaneously, she may have seen the opportunity to use her family's wealth and prestige to set in motion her plot.|$|E
5|$|Kesler's {{success as}} a player has been {{attributed}} to his competitiveness and desire to outwork opposing players. Kesler has recognized, however, that his competitive drive has often caused him to lose his composure. In the 2010 off-season, Canucks management encouraged him to play with more focus, maintaining his emotions and decreasing physical and verbal confrontation with opposing players. During the subsequent 2010–11 campaign, he gained media attention for changing his play accordingly while enjoying the best season of his career. Kesler has also credited the change with his role as a father, wanting to set a mature example for his children when they <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> play.|$|E

5|$|Malick's {{unconventional}} filming techniques included shooting {{part of a}} scene {{during a}} bright, sunny morning only to finish it weeks later at sunset. He {{made a habit of}} pointing the camera away during an action sequence and focus on a parrot, a tree branch or other fauna. Malick's reputation and working methods commanded great respect among the actors, with both Woody Harrelson and John Savage staying on for an extra month after they finished all of their scenes just to <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> at work.|$|E

5|$|A {{student at}} Van Meter High School, Feller was a {{starting}} pitcher for the school's baseball team. During {{this time he}} continued {{to play on the}} Farmers Union team in the American Amateur Baseball Congress, and had 19 wins and four losses for Farmers Union one season. He also was the starting center for the high school basketball team. By the age of 16, Feller possessed what critics judged a high quality fastball; major league scouts traveled to Dayton, Ohio to <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> in the annual national baseball tournament. After the game, several big league clubs offered signing bonuses with their contract offers, but he had already been signed to a professional contract with the Cleveland Indians.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{had been}} invited to stay at Tranby Croft, Yorkshire, the home of Arthur Wilson and his family. Among Edward's party were his advisers, Lord Coventry and Lieutenant-General Owen Williams; Gordon-Cumming, a friend of the prince, was also invited. On the first night the guests played baccarat, and Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming {{illegally}} adding to his stake. Stanley informed other members of the Wilson family, and they agreed to <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> on the following evening. Gordon-Cumming was again seen to be acting in a suspicious manner. The family members asked the advice of the royal courtiers who, with the agreement of the prince, confronted Gordon-Cumming and pressured him into signing a document that declared he would never play cards again, in exchange for the silence of the guests.|$|E
5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 the Rollins Band {{signed a}} {{distribution}} deal with Imago Records and {{appeared at the}} Lollapalooza festival; both improved the band's presence. However, in December 1991, Rollins and his best friend Joe Cole were accosted by two armed robbers outside Rollins's home. Cole was murdered by a gunshot to the head, Rollins escaped without injury but police suspected him in the murder and detained him for ten hours. Although traumatized by Cole's death, as chronicled in his book Now <b>Watch</b> <b>Him</b> Die, Rollins continued to release new material; the spoken-word album Human Butt appeared in 1992 on his own record label, 2.13.61. The Rollins Band released The End of Silence, Rollins's first charting album.|$|E

5|$|In March 2015, Meredith {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} play for the Australia national team. Australia coach Ange Postecoglou said {{at the time that he}} was open to selecting a number of new players to the national team, including Meredith. Meredith was first called up by Australia for a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Jordan on 8 October 2015, for which he was an unused substitute as Australia lost 2–0. Meredith debuted for Australia on 12 November 2015, after being selected in the starting line-up for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Kyrgyzstan, which the team won 3–0 at home. He only learned he would be starting on the morning of the match, and his family flew to Canberra from Melbourne to <b>watch</b> <b>him.</b> He made a second start in a win over Bangladesh four days later.|$|E
5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, {{one of their}} most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so that people can <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> perform for them. The temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto the roof to watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.|$|E

5|$|The New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League {{played their}} home games at Downing Stadium for two seasons, {{starting}} in 1974. In 1975, the team signed Pelé, officially recorded by FIFA as the world's greatest soccer player, to a $4.5million contract, drawing a capacity crowd of 22,500 to <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> lead {{the team to}} a 2–0 victory. The playing pitch and facilities at Downing Stadium were in dreadful condition though and as the team's popularity grew they too left for Yankee Stadium, and then Giants Stadium. The stadium was demolished in 2002 {{to make way for}} the $45million, 4,754-seat Icahn Stadium, which includes an Olympic-standard 400-meter running track and, as part of Pele's and the Cosmos' legacy, includes a FIFA-approved floodlit soccer stadium that hosts matches between the 48 youth teams of a Manhattan soccer club.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Rivera joined Panamá Oeste, a local amateur {{baseball}} team, {{as their}} shortstop. Scout Herb Raybourn watched him {{play in a}} baseball tournament but did not project {{him to be a}} major league shortstop. A year later, Panamá Oeste's pitcher performed so poorly in a playoff game that Rivera was asked to replace him, and despite no experience at the position, he pitched well. Teammates Claudino Hernández and Emilio Gáez consequently contacted Chico Heron, a scout for the New York Yankees. Two weeks after his pitching debut, Rivera was invited to a Yankees tryout camp run by Heron in Panama City. Raybourn, who had returned to Panama to scout as the Yankees' director of Latin American operations, received a tip about Rivera. Raybourn was surprised to hear he had switched positions but decided to <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> throw. Although Rivera had no formal pitching training, weighed just , and threw only , Raybourn was impressed by his athleticism and smooth, effortless pitching motion. Viewing Rivera as a raw talent, Raybourn signed the amateur free agent to a contract with the Yankees organization on February17, 1990; the contract included a signing bonus of US$2,500 ($ today), according to Major League Baseball (MLB) records.|$|E
