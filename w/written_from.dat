5|$|Hieroglyphic writing {{dates from}} c. 3000BC, and is {{composed}} of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically <b>written</b> <b>from</b> right to left), hieratic was always <b>written</b> <b>from</b> right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, Demotic, became the prevalent writing style, {{and it is this}} form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.|$|E

5|$|Doctor Francisco Layna Serrano {{of nearby}} Ruguilla {{had for years}} tried to save the monastery but had failed to {{interest}} {{the government in the}} expensive preservation proposal. Realizing that this was his last chance to document the place as its stones were being removed, he wrote a monograph of its history and included a site plan of the layout of buildings, <b>written</b> <b>from</b> memory. As a result of his efforts, on June 3, 1931, Santa María de Óvila was listed as a National Monument of Spain, or Bien de Interés Cultural (Cultural Property). Layna Serrano published his monograph in 1932. In 1933, the monastery's historic cartulary was brought to the University of Madrid and published; the original was archived at the University of Oviedo.|$|E

30|$|At {{the moment}} {{there is no}} rubric for marking students’ writing. Teachers award marks {{according}} to their own criteria.

So, even though he is <b>writing</b> <b>from</b> memorisation, he is getting better marks than the first one.|$|R
