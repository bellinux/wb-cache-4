500|$|Verity never {{spun the}} ball very far, {{particularly}} after his second tour to Australia, and preferred {{to concentrate on}} bowling a good length. However, critics {{did not think that}} Verity posed enough of a threat to batsmen and could be dull to watch. By the middle of his career, he had a reputation for being ineffective on good batting pitches, and was occasionally dropped from the England team for his lack of effectiveness. Even so, he only missed one Test against Australia and one against South Africa, the two strongest Test playing teams, after he made his debut. Verity believed his performances in unfavourable conditions for his bowling had greater merit than his successes in favourable ones. He once said: [...] "Do not praise me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken 8 for 20 on a sticky wicket, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got 2 for 100 on a perfect wicket." [...] At times, Verity almost seemed bored when bowling and performed less effectively, particularly if his side were winning without needing his contribution. Bowes once told the Yorkshire captain, Brian Sellers, that the way to get the best out of Verity was to tell him that everything depended on him.|$|E

The subsequent court ruling went in her favour, and on December 13, 2002, she became only the second person in the Republic of Korea to legally change their sex. Speaking of the difficulties she had previously encountered, Harisu has said: [...] "My most embarrassing moments were <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had to show my personal identification card in public... I couldn't get a passport, visa or even my own bank accounts because I was legally a man".|$|E

Bagwell and Riggs walked to the ring shortly after Bischoff's statement, with Bagwell looking to join and Riggs trying {{to talk him out of}} it. Bagwell decided to join the nWo, turning on Riggs and dissolving the team in the process. In a scripted interview, Bagwell stated, [...] "Who needs Riggs anymore <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the nWo?!" [...] He also later stated that the team's lack of success after their first title reign was the fault of Riggs' ineptitude, stating [...] "I couldn't make up for all his weaknesses." ...|$|E
500|$|Sibelius was {{not easily}} stirred from his exile; {{friend and fellow}} {{composer}} Wilhelm Stenhammar, then Artistic Director and chief conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Sibelius repeatedly {{to persuade him to}} conduct a concert of his works in Gothenburg. Believing himself duty-bound to premiere a [...] "major work" [...] in Sweden, such as a symphony, Sibelius—to Stenhammar's chagrin—delayed each scheduled trip. He withdrew from planned concerts for March 1914, writing to Stenhammar, [...] "My conscience forces me to this. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> some new works ready next year, as I hope, it would give me great joy to perform them in Gothenburg". New arrangements were made for February 1915, but these, too, Sibelius canceled in December 1914. In the end, the indefatigable Stenhammar prevailed and new concerts were set for March 1915 ("I see yet again your great sympathy for my music. I shall come".).|$|E
500|$|Although {{critical}} {{reception of}} Barbara Gordon's evolution into Oracle {{have been mixed}} among critics and other observers, according to John Ostrander: [...] "We have, over the years, on those occasions <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> worked with the character, gotten some letters {{from those who have}} disabilities of one stripe or another and all have been very supportive. I feel very proud for my part in creating Oracle." [...] Supporters of Oracle argue that the Barbara Gordon character provides a greater service to DC Comics and its readers as a disabled character, regardless of the events that caused her paralysis. In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon {{is not limited to the}} Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe. DC Senior Vice President Dan DiDio comments, [...] "Some stories... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime. The DCU would be a lesser place without Barry's sacrifice, or the crippling of Barbara at the hands of the Joker." ...|$|E

In an {{interview}} for Toronto Star, she said, [...] "Every time I'm in Canada I feel more Swedish, and every time I'm in Sweden I feel more Canadian. I belong in both places and I love them both equally." [...] She holds both Swedish and Canadian passports. Apart from speaking fluent English and Swedish, she also speaks French and Spanish. She describes herself as a feminist as she believes in equal treatment for both sexes, but also considers that [...] "We [...] are different", adding that she [...] "embrace those differences." [...] She has revealed that she is dyslexic and said that it took her [...] "a long time" [...] to learn her lines. [...] "I get horrified <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to do table reads with the whole cast, because there’s a lot of stuttering coming from me, so I {{have to do a lot}} of prep", she explained. Because of this, she prefers to improvise her lines.|$|E
500|$|While {{squadron}} armourers {{and mechanics}} repaired the faulty machine-gun synchroniser on {{his most recent}} S.E.5 mount, A8898, Ball had been sporadically flying the Nieuport again, and was successful with it on 6 May, destroying one more Albatros D.III in an evening flight to raise his tally to 44. He had continued to undertake his habitual lone patrols, but had of late been fortunate to survive. The heavier battle damage that Ball's aircraft were now suffering bore witness to the improved team tactics being developed by his German opponents. Some time on 6 May, Ball had visited his friend Billy Bishop at the latter's aerodrome. He proposed that the pair attack the Red Baron's squadron at its airfield at dawn, catching the German pilots off guard. Bishop agreed {{to take part in}} the daring scheme at the end of the month, after he returned from his forthcoming leave. That night, in his last letter to his father, Ball wrote [...] "I do get tired of always living to kill, and am really beginning to feel like a murderer. Shall be so pleased <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> finished".|$|E
500|$|The series {{features}} numerous song covers sung onscreen by the characters. Ryan Murphy {{was responsible}} for selecting all of the songs used, and {{has said that he}} strove to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: [...] "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important—the balancing of that." [...] According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, [...] "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along." [...] In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that [...] "there have been a couple of times <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> gone to Ryan Murphy (Glee creator) and told him {{a couple of things that}} have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don’t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us." [...] For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 18–49 demographic.|$|E

500|$|Lindwall's {{emergence}} {{after the}} Second World War {{along with his}} new ball partner Keith Miller heralded {{a new era in}} cricket. The pair were regarded as the two best fast bowlers of their era, and signalled a change in the cricket landscape, which had been dominated during the interwar period by batsmen. Together the pair formed a new ball fast-bowling combination {{regarded as one of the}} best in Test history. During the 1948 tour of England, the hosts had agreed to have a new ball available every 55 overs, and the Australians used this to unleash Lindwall and Miller on the Englishmen with a shiny new ball. The pair often targeted the leading opposition batsmen, particular England's Len Hutton and Denis Compton with large amounts of short-pitched bowling, raising fast bowling to a new standard. Hutton's battles with Lindwall were regarded as one of the key match-ups in Anglo-Australian battles of the time, and Hutton said his opponent had the ability to [...] "strike at will". Hutton felt that Lindwall's bouncers were the best that he faced, saying of their accuracy:"You had to play them or be hit". Lindwall refused to bowl bouncers at tailenders, saying that [...] "If the day ever came <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to bowl bouncers at tailenders then I won't deserve to play for Australia". When England developed quality pace bowlers of their own in the 1950s, Hutton was captain and he implemented a similar strategy to that executed by Lindwall and Miller. In retirement, Lindwall went on to mentor Lillee, who went on to break the Test world record for wicket-taking.|$|E
