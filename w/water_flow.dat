5|$|As {{a result}} of efforts to control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of {{water out of the}} southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{construction}} of the Canning Dam, among other drinking water supply dams, <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> into the Canning River has been reduced by up to 96%. A number of freshwater fish species which are endemic to the south-west of Western Australia are found in the Canning River system, however studies of fish and fish habitats in the area have shown that fish numbers are low due to a loss of habitat and a loss of linkage between breeding areas due to low flows, preventing fish migrating upstream and reaching important breeding and nursery grounds. Stagnant water caused by a lack of <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> has provided a suitable habitat for successful breeding of an introduced pest, the mosquitofish.|$|E
5|$|A common {{parasite}} of bowfin is {{the anchor}} worm (Lernaea). These small crustaceans infest {{the skin and}} bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk Megalonaias gigantea lays eggs in the bowfin gills, that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing in the <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes.|$|E
25|$|There was a tidemill. When {{the tide}} was rising, <b>water</b> <b>flowed</b> into the mill pond driving a mill, when {{the tide was}} falling, <b>water</b> <b>flowed</b> back into the river, driving the mill.|$|R
50|$|Osmosis is {{the process}} in which <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> from an area with a low solute concentration, to an {{adjacent}} area with a higher solute concentration until equilibrium between the two areas is reached. All cells are surrounded by a lipid bi-layer cell membrane which permits the <b>flow</b> of <b>water</b> {{in and out of}} the cell while also limiting the flow of solutes. In hypertonic solutions, <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> out of the cell which decreases the cell's volume. When in a hypotonic solution, <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> into the membrane and increases the cell's volume. When in an isotonic solution, <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> {{in and out of the}} cell at an equal rate.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to numerous springs, <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> into Murphy Lake {{from the northeast}} from Arrowhead Lake. <b>Water</b> <b>flows</b> out of Murphy Lake via a creek {{on the south side}} and flows into the Hanson Lake chain of lakes.|$|R
5|$|Damming of the Canning caused {{dramatic}} flow reductions {{that significantly}} altered downstream aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. The lack of <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> has {{also resulted in}} a poor flushing effect below the dam wall. An excessive amount of nutrients from fertilizers and animal waste has caused algal blooms and eutrophication.|$|E
5|$|Sponges have unspecialized {{cells that}} can {{transform}} into other types and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges {{do not have}} nervous, digestive or circulatory systems. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} {{increased}} <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in Kitchen Creek, {{which has been}} cutting the falls in the glens since. The gradient or slope of Kitchen Creek was fairly stable for its flow when it had a much smaller drainage basin, as Phillips Creek still does. The increased basin size means that Kitchen Creek in the glens is too steep for its present amount of <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> As Kitchen Creek continues to cut into the rock and erode it up the Allegheny Front, the creek's slope will decrease and become less steep. In the future, the creek's flow and slope are predicted to become {{similar to those of}} other nearby creeks with similar size drainage basins. This process could take so long that a new glacial period might occur before the transformation is complete.|$|E
5000|$|Memristor : A {{needle valve}} {{operated}} by a <b>flow</b> meter. As <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> through in the forward direction, the needle valve restricts <b>flow</b> more; as <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> the other direction, the needle valve opens further providing less resistance.|$|R
50|$|Pınargözü Cave is {{an active}} cave meaning that <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> within it. It is {{considered}} an outflow cave, as the <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> out of the cave's mouth from a spring inside. The source of the spring {{has yet to be}} located.|$|R
50|$|The Roman street fountains were {{free-standing}} stone blocks {{connected to}} lead pipes beneath the street; <b>water</b> <b>flowed</b> through the pipes and then upward to spouts in the blocks, pushed by water {{pressure from the}} higher sources {{of the water and}} drawn by the siphon effect of the <b>water</b> <b>flowing</b> out of the spigots. The water emerged from the mouth of a mask shaped like an animal or human face. The <b>water</b> <b>flowed</b> continually, was collected into pots or jars, and was taken home.|$|R
5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} to the United States from South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle and two other biological controls were released in Florida, greatly reducing the amount of land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{bivalves}} in {{the order}} Unionoida have a different lifecycle. Sperm is drawn into a female's gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female's shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host. After several weeks they drop off their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate. An advantage of this to the molluscs {{is that they can}} disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts, rather than being constantly swept downstream by the <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.|$|E
50|$|In this mode, {{the feed}} <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> {{straight}} through the electrodes, i.e. the <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> directly through the interparticle pores of the porous carbon electrodes. This approach has the benefit of ions directly migrating through these pores, hence mitigating transport limitations encountered in the flow-by mode.|$|R
50|$|The storage {{facility}} {{was meant to}} harness excess flood <b>water</b> <b>flowing</b> down River Noyyal and draining from the Lower Bhavani Project (LBP) canal to irrigate more than 19,000 acres in Karur district. Usually the excess LBP <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> down the Malayathu Palayam banks only between September and December.|$|R

5|$|Most sponges work {{rather like}} chimneys: they {{take in water}} {{at the bottom and}} eject it from the osculum ("little mouth") at the top. Since ambient {{currents}} are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying the beat of the flagella, and may shut it down if {{there is a lot of}} sand or silt in the water.|$|E
5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C. <b>Water</b> <b>flow</b> over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts are {{exceptionally}} {{important to}} their biome ecologically, but their role in their environment is poorly understood. Because they project out above the surrounding sea floor, they disturb standard <b>water</b> <b>flow,</b> causing eddies and associated hydrological phenomena that ultimately result in water movement in an otherwise still ocean bottom. Currents have been measured at up to 0.9knots, or 48centimeters per second. Because of this upwelling seamounts often carry above-average plankton populations, seamounts are thus centers where the fish that feed on them aggregate, in turn falling prey to further predation, making seamounts important biological hotspots.|$|E
50|$|Coedty dam is {{a balance}} tip dam; <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> from it {{automatically}} {{when it reaches}} high levels. This excess <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> into a spectacular gorge used by outdoor pursuit groups. Gorge walking here, however, can be dangerous because of the sudden releases {{of water from the}} reservoir which can occur.|$|R

5|$|Sponges {{constitute}} the phylum Porifera, {{and have been}} defined as sessile metazoans (multicelled immobile animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with choanocytes, cells with whip-like flagella. However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> systems and the choanocytes. All known living sponges can remold their bodies, as most types of their cells can move within their bodies and a few can change from one type to another.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{soldiers}} {{break the}} two thieves' legs (a procedure designed to hasten {{death in a}} crucifixion), {{but they do not}} break those of Jesus, as he is already dead (John 19:33). In , one soldier pierces Jesus' side with a lance, and blood and <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> out. In the Synoptics, when Jesus dies, the heavy curtain at the Temple is torn. In , an earthquake breaks open tombs. In Matthew and Mark, terrified by the events, a Roman centurion states that Jesus was the Son of God.|$|E
5|$|The Senne {{had long}} since lost its {{usefulness}} as a navigable waterway, being replaced by canals, including the Charleroi Canal. The Senne {{had always been a}} river with an inconsistent flow, often overflowing its banks. In times of heavy rainfall, even the sluice gates were unable to regulate the flow of the river which was often swollen by numerous creeks flowing down from higher ground. Making matters worse, within the city the river's bed was narrowed by encroaching construction due to demographic pressure. The supports of numerous unregulated bridges impeded <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> and caused water levels to rise even further, exacerbated by a riverbed of accumulated waste.|$|E

5000|$|Flowriders ride on {{artificial}} {{waves that}} are technically called [...] "sheet waves". Powerful pumps project a three-inch layer {{of water at}} speeds ranging from 20 MPH to 30 MPH. [...] The <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> up and over surfaces engineered to replicate the shape of ocean waves. Sheet waves are stationary waves, in that the wave does not move forward, and the movement is derived from <b>water</b> <b>flowing</b> over a stationary surface. Flowriders get their speed from {{the energy of the}} <b>water</b> <b>flowing</b> at them, and can perform basic to sophisticated turns and tricks within a relatively small area.|$|R

5|$|The {{periscopes}} had two problems, {{the first}} of which was shared with the other masts. They were not streamlined; raising a periscope while moving would create enough drag and turbulence to shake the entire submarine. As with many elements of the submarine, there were disagreements as to who was responsible for the problem. It was solved by modifying the masts to redirect the <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> around them (for example, a spiral wrap was fixed around the head of each periscope).|$|E
5|$|The school {{operates}} the F.G. Walton Smith research vessel. Designed to met the school's specifications, the catamaran {{was put on}} water in 2000. It {{is equipped with a}} special sea <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> system that can take samples. The on-board lab can perform chemical analysis of those water samples. It also has transducers for measuring ocean currents, sub-bottom profiling, and deep water bathymetry. In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the vessel was reassigned to environmental monitoring of affected areas and to track underwater plumes of oil.|$|E
5|$|The {{single-celled}} choanoflagellates {{resemble the}} choanocyte cells of sponges {{which are used}} to drive their <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> systems and capture most of their food. This along with phylogenetic studies of ribosomal molecules {{have been used as}} morphological evidence to suggest sponges are the sister group to the rest of animals. Some studies have shown that sponges do not form a monophyletic group, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a common ancestor. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that comb jellies rather than sponges are the sister group to the rest of animals.|$|E
