5|$|In {{the last}} <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> {{the issue of}} Chinese {{immigration}} entered the race. Both major parties (as well as the Greenbackers) pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from China, which native-born workers in the Western states believed was depressing their wages. On October 20, however, a Democratic newspaper published a letter, purportedly from Garfield {{to a group of}} businessmen, pledging to keep immigration at the current levels so that industry could keep workers' wages low. Garfield denounced the letter as a ruse, but not before one hundred thousand copies of the newspaper were mailed to California and Oregon. Once the letter was exposed as a forgery, Garfield biographer Peskin believes it may even have gained votes for the Republican in the East, but it likely weakened him in the West.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} Andrew T. Wood, {{a lawyer}} from Mount Sterling, who had failed in earlier elections for Congress and state attorney general. Concurrently with the gubernatorial election, the state's voters would {{decide whether to}} ratify a proposed new constitution for the state in 1891. The divided Democrats had taken no stand on the document {{as part of their}} convention's platform, and Wood spent much of the campaign trying to get Brown to declare his support for or opposition to it. About six <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> Brown, sensing strong public support for the new constitution, finally came out in favor of it. For the remainder of the race, Wood touted an alleged conspiracy between Brown and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to thwart meaningful corporate regulations, but the issue failed to gain much traction.|$|E
5|$|When American extremists {{loyal to}} the {{terrorist}} group Islamic Caliphate Organization (ICO) kidnap a suburban family, Underwood allows Conway to negotiate with them, making his opponent look like a hero - and then releases NSA data that proves Conway illegally influenced Congress. Soon afterward, however, Underwood is hit with two crises at once: ICO's leader orders his followers to kill one of the hostages, while journalist Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) exposes Underwood's crimes in the Washington Herald. Facing disgrace and possible impeachment, Underwood decides to declare war on ICO and allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create an atmosphere of widespread fear that he and Claire can exploit in the <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E

The {{number of people}} enrolled to vote in Tokushima-Kōchi {{on the day of}} the election was 1,279,900, an increase of 18,800 (1.5%) compared to the annual survey conducted ten months earlier.|$|E
25|$|In December 2014, Richard Desmond, {{proprietor}} of Express Newspapers, donated £300,000 to UKIP. Desmond had previously made the UKIP peer David Stevens his deputy chairman. The donation indicated that Desmond's papers, the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily Star and Daily Star Sunday, would back UKIP in the 2015 general election. Three <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> Desmond gave the party a further £1million.|$|E
25|$|In 1990 Fianna Fáil's nominee in {{the presidential}} {{election}} was Brian Lenihan. A few <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> a scandal broke over the accusation that Lenihan had phoned the President, Patrick Hillery in 1982, asking him not to dissolve the Dáil following the fall of Garret FitzGerald's government. Lenihan had always denied this, but now new evidence had come to light. O'Malley told Haughey that the Progressive Democrats would pull out of the coalition and support a no-confidence motion tabled by the opposition unless Lenihan left the government or Haughey opened an investigation into the incident. Haughey sacked Lenihan.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Hammerschmidt publishes {{his story}} and threatens to end Frank's {{campaign}} <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> Claire urges Frank {{to use a}} heavier hand in the situation, and they decide to fight back by creating chaos. Frank addresses the public declaring that the nation is at total war, ordering {{the full force of}} the military be used to combat global terrorism regardless the cost. The season ends with Frank and Claire watching the live execution of the hostage together, and Claire breaking the fourth wall for the first time by looking into the camera along with Frank.|$|E
25|$|Four <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> analysts {{agreed that}} the climate was very good for the SPÖ {{following}} Faymann's announcement {{that he would take}} measures against rising prices, although they also cautioned that the SPÖ's victory was not yet a done deal. The FPÖ was seen as strongly increasing their share of the votes when compared to the 2006 election and the BZÖ was seen as having secured its stay in the National Council. The Greens were seen to be stagnating, while the extraparliamentary parties faced difficulties with entering parliament, with the chances of LIF and the FRITZ intact.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} before the election, the party had, as in the 2001 election, {{received}} very high poll results that steadily declined throughout the last weeks. In certain individual polls in late 2008, the party averaged around 30%, which at that point made it the most popular party in Norway, Hence the actual election result was relatively disappointing. During the election campaign in the four <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> the party dropped 3.5% in the poll. Most of these losses went to the Conservative Party, which had run a successful campaign. The Progress Party increased {{its share of the}} vote by 0.9%, a slight gain from the previous election and the best election result in the party's history.|$|E

25|$|In March 2004, {{an interim}} {{constitution}} was created, called the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period. The document {{called for the}} creation of an elected National Assembly to take place no later than January 2005. The question of the election calendar became a matter of importance for Iraq and the U.S.: while a quick election would legitimise the Iraqi government and shed a favourable light on the U.S.-led occupation of the country, the prospect of violence delayed it. It was finally set for 30 January 2005. Though then-President Ghazi Al-Yaouar asked the United Nations to reconsider the electoral schedule several <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> the legislative election was held on time, creating the Iraqi National Assembly.|$|E
25|$|Altmire {{served for}} six years, from 2007 to 2013. He {{had never before}} been a {{candidate}} for public office when he left UPMC in June 2005 to run against three-term incumbent Republican U.S. Congresswoman Melissa Hart of Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district, who was considered by most observers to be invulnerable. In May 2006, Altmire won the Democratic primary, defeating millionaire businesswoman Georgia Berner, 55%–45%. In the 2006 general election, Altmire campaigned relentlessly and raised over $1 million to help fund his race against Hart. After polling well behind Hart early in the race, he eventually closed the gap heading into the final <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> Altmire defeated Hart, 52%–48%. In 2008, Hart ran again in a rematch. He defeated her, 56%–44%, even as John McCain carried the district by almost 11 points.|$|E
25|$|Representative Cunningham {{resigned}} on November 28, 2005, as {{a result}} of a bribery scandal. An open special election was held on April 11, 2006. The top vote getter was Democrat Francine Busby, who won 44% of the vote. The second-place finisher was Republican Brian Bilbray, who won 15% of the vote. Paul King was the top Libertarian party vote getter, with 0.6% of the vote. Since no candidate received a simple majority, the top vote-getters in each party competed in a runoff or special general election on June 6, 2006 (the same day as the statewide California primary). Bilbray was sworn in on June 13, based on unofficial counts, two <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> was certified. As a consequence of this action, a court challenge to the election results filed by voters was denied on jurisdictional grounds. This decision is being appealed.|$|E

25|$|The 2005 German federal {{elections}} were held on 18 September. After the elections, neither Schröder's SPD-Green coalition nor the alliance between CDU/CSU and the FDP led by Angela Merkel achieved {{a majority in}} parliament, but the CDU/CSU had a stronger popular electoral lead by one percentage point. Since the SPD had been trailing the CDU by more than 15 points only <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> this outcome was a surprise and was mainly attributed to Schröder's charisma and prowess as a campaigner; polls consistently showed that he was much more popular with the German people than Merkel. On election night, both Schröder and Merkel claimed victory and chancellorship, but after initially ruling out a grand coalition with Merkel, Schröder and Müntefering entered negotiations with her and the CSU's Edmund Stoiber. On 10 October, {{it was announced that}} the parties had agreed to form a grand coalition. Schröder agreed to cede the chancellorship to Merkel, but the SPD would hold the majority of government posts and retain considerable control of government policy. Merkel was elected chancellor on 22 November.|$|E

Mrs. Harrison's terminal illness and the fact that both candidates had served in the White House called for a low key campaign, and resulted in neither of the candidates actively campaigning personally.|$|E
500|$|The final {{environmental}} impact statement for the project was published by the City of Seattle Department of Engineering on January 24, 1972, two <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> It included three alternatives, all elevated between Valley and Mercer streets from Aurora Avenue to I-5. Construction would begin the following spring, with a completion date in early 1975. A rapid transit alternative was deemed [...] "not probable in the near future" [...] for the corridor, though express bus service was considered. A depressed roadway was rejected outright, as it could only achieve a grade of 6% at , required a larger amount of right-of-way acquisition and relocation of utilities, and it was located below the water table, making it too expensive to be feasible.|$|E
5000|$|On 13 March 2006, a <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> presidential <b>election</b> {{that would}} usher in Lukashenko's third term, BDG, Narodnaya Volya, and Tovarishch had their print runs {{abruptly}} cancelled by their Smolensk supplier.

500|$|Two <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> the Orr {{campaign}} {{discovered that}} Dresner Sykes, their media-consulting firm, had charged {{the campaign for}} television advertising time that was never purchased. [...] A World-Herald analysis after the election determined that Creative Media, the firm's advertising placement agency, had charged the campaign $34,860 for October advertising on Omaha station KMTV, while actually purchasing $6,115 worth of time, or 17.5% of that ordered. [...] A similar pattern obtained on other stations in Omaha, Lincoln, North Platte, and Sioux City, with Creative Media actually purchasing between 12% and 88% of the time ordered by the campaign. [...] Although the campaign had ordered advertisements placed on Omaha television stations every day during the period October 5–22, nothing ran on at least four days of the period. [...] Dresner Sykes reimbursed the Orr campaign with a $50,000 check and with the cancellation of unpaid bills; but Orr could not recover the lost advertising time in the past, {{and found that the}} most desirable advertising times {{for the rest of the}} campaign's duration were already taken.|$|E
500|$|Shiller and Turley {{challenged}} Axelrod in 1979. An extra alarm fire {{early on}} Friday, February 9, 1979, <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> caused extensive {{damage to the}} building containing Shiller's campaign headquarters and left 15 homeless. The Chicago Tribune endorsed Axelrod. Shiller (6,852 votes; 46%) bested Axelrod (6,088 votes; 40%), but, as no candidate received {{a majority of the}} vote in the three-way race, a run-off was forced. The Chicago Tribune and Turley endorsed Axelrod in the run-off. The Chicago Tribune wrote that [...] "Ms. Shiller's program shares many elements with that of the Black Panthers and appears to be based on hopes of an eventual [...] "revolution" [...]" [...] Turley described Axelrod as [...] "the lesser of two evils in the race now." [...] Axelrod enlisted 40 volunteer attorneys and 200 off-duty policemen to challenge ghost voting in a project he called [...] "Operation Safeguard." [...] Axelrod challenged 1,060 voter registrations on the ward's rolls, 931 of which were upheld by the Chicago Board of Elections Commissioners. Axelrod defeated Shiller in the run-off by 247 votes. Shiller later recalled the campaign: ...|$|E
500|$|The United States {{government}} was convinced Chamorro could not win without measures to [...] "level the field". The George H. W. Bush administration wanted Congress to waive {{the prohibition of}} using National Endowment for Democracy funds to support a candidate and to approve a $9 million aid plan in addition to granting $3 million outright in assistance to UNO. Congress refused, as direct aid to candidates or parties was prohibited by law. Congress finally agreed to the $9 million package, only as per the legal requirements—meaning funds could only be used for election monitoring and observers, drives to increase voter turnout and must be fully disclosed. These funds were earmarked for building voting infrastructure, for vehicles and gasoline, salaries, poll watchers, office equipment, trips abroad to train poll workers and those registering voters, election monitoring teams, and as per the provision of foreign donations, $2 million was paid into the Nicaraguan Supreme Electoral Council run by the government. In addition, the CIA covertly paid close to $500,000 (USD) to nearly a hundred Nicaraguans living abroad so they would return home to vote. The aid package ran into difficulties though: one month before the elections, only $400,000 of the money had been sent and it was deposited in accordance with Nicaraguan law into an account at the government-run Central Bank. The vehicles which were provided for in the aid package arrived in Nicaragua, but due to the customs director's vacation, the vehicles were not cleared, nor were tags issued for their use. Three <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> UNO officials reportedly had received only around $250,000 dollars and accused Ortega's administration of delaying tactics and taking a share off the top. The government countered {{that the history of}} the Iran–Contra affair was a basis for caution and that the US itself was creating delays. Since the United States invasion of Panama had frozen Panamanian currency, a spokesperson for the Central Bank of Nicaragua stated that the Ortega Administration had no access to their funds which were deposited in Panamanian banks.|$|E
