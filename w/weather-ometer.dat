30|$|Accelerated ageing was {{conducted}} on polyurethane sample HS 464. Artificial ageing {{was conducted}} using an Atlas Ci 4000 <b>Weather-Ometer</b> and the conditions used are given in Table  3. The xenon light source used had full spectrum from 200  nm to 750  nm with a CIRA inner, and a soda lime and float glass outer filter to provide a cut-off at 300  nm. The irradiance measured at a wavelength of 420  nm was 1 Wm- 2 (approximately 0.4 Wm- 2 at 340  nm); samples PU 2 and PU 4 were protected from the light using an additional UV filter. The polyurethane fragments were attached to acid free conservation grade cardboard, mounted in brackets and hung inside the <b>Weather-Ometer.</b> After ageing, the samples were analysed using the same ATR-FTIR instrument and conditions outlined above and the spectra were compared to reference spectra collected from an unaged fragment of HS 464.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} highlights key {{findings from}} this reporting period: while {open_quotes}standard cure{close_quotes} A 9918 P ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulant, laminated between low iron glass, shows significant yellowing after 17 weeks in a xenon-arc <b>Weather-Ometer,</b> {open_quotes}neat{close_quotes} EVA with no additives shows little or no yellowing after the same exposure; when similar laminates were prepared and exposed in the <b>Weather-Ometer,</b> using A 9918 P with the Lupersol 101 crosslinker removed from the encapsulant, color development after 10 weeks was reduced by approximately 2 / 3. This result strongly implicates Lupersol 101 in the discoloration of EVA encapsulant; similar <b>Weather-Ometer</b> aging studies of other laminates, prepared using EVA with various combinations of the A 9918 P additives, suggests that EVA discoloration arises primarily from Naugard P and an interaction of Lupersol 101 with Cyasorb UV- 531. Transformation products of these additives appear to be giving rise to yellowing, rather than the Elvax 3185 resin itself; when Lupersol TBEC was substituted for Lupersol 101 in the encapsulant (i. e. {open_quotes}fast cure{close_quotes} 15295 P formulation rather than the {open_quotes}standard cure{close_quotes} A 9918 P), the rate of yellowing was reduced {{by a factor of}} approximately 2. 5; use of a cerium-oxide containing low-iron glass superstrate reduced the rate of yellowing of A 9918 P EVA by approximately 75 %. When laminates were prepared and exposed using 15295 P EVA and cerium-oxide containing glass superstrate, there was no visible yellowing. Analytical results show no measurable loss of acetic acid from very browned, field-aged EVA and no evidence of conjugated unsaturation; analysis also reveals the loss of Cyasorb UV- 531 in both field-aged and laboratory U. V. aged samples, but only in the presence of Lupersol 101. This result supports the finding of an interaction of Lupersol 101 with UV- 531 as contributing to color formation in the presence of U. V...|$|E

40|$|Soft denture-lining {{materials}} {{are an important}} treatment option for patients who have chronic soreness associated with dental prostheses. Three distinctly different types of {{materials are}} generally used. These are plasticized polymers or copolymers, silicones, or polyphosphazene fluoroelastomer. The acceptance of these materials by patients and dentists is variable. The objective {{of this study is}} to compare the tensile strength, percent elongation, hardness, tear strength, and tear energy of eight plasticized polymers or copolymers, two silicones, and one polyphosphazene fluoroelastomer. Tests were run at 24 hours after specimen preparation and repeated after 900 hours of accelerated aging in a <b>Weather-Ometer</b> device. The data indicated a wide range of physical properties for soft denturelining materials and showed that accelerated aging dramatically affected the physical and mechanical properties of many of the elastomers. No soft denture liner proved to be superior to all others. The data obtained should provide clinicians with useful information for selecting soft denture lining materials for patients...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method to}} simulate reactions in a cross-linked polymer is developed {{and applied to}} the photodegradation process of polyester-urethane clearcoats during artificial exposure in a <b>Weather-Ometer.</b> This coarse-grained simulation method, {{which is based on}} a kinetic Monte Carlo scheme, is verified with experimental data on the depth-resolved changes in optical properties and chemical composition that have been previously determined. By modelling the depth-dependency of physical processes that occur in the coating, such as the absorption of photons and the diffusion of oxygen, the experimentally observed evolution of depth gradients in chemical composition can be well described by the simulation. A sensitivity analysis of individual simulation input parameters with respect to a set of resulting observables is performed and the results provide insight into the influence of specific reaction mechanisms on the overall degradation process and help to distinguish essential from less important processes. The values of input parameters that result in the most accurate simulation of the experimental data are determined with an optimisation procedure. In this way, the numerical values of several kinetic and physical parameters that are difficult to determine directly in an experimental way, such as various reaction rate constants, can be obtained from the simulations...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of {{representatives of the}} most popular types of concrete bridge deck sealers was conducted using a two-pronged approach: performance testing via accelerated weathering coupled with water immersion, and indirect testing using instrumental and analytical techniques. The goals of the project were to assess the ability of the sealers to protect embedded reinforcing steel from corrosion and to develop an effective test procedure for screening commercial products for use by the Department on new construction. The following classes of sealers were evaluated: silanes and siloxanes, water-based epoxy, polyester, aluminum stearate, silicate, and linseed oil. The silane and siloxane group performed best in all phases of testing. Linseed oil performed nearly as well; however, some questions were raised concerning its long term durability due to its limited depth of penetration and to the reactivity of the oil in the alkaline environment of fresh concrete. Based on these results, it is recommended that TEXAS STANDARD SPECIFICATION Item 428 be supplemented to permit the use of silane and siloxane-based sealers on new construction. The most effective screening procedure was shown to be a combination of accelerated weathering and indirect test methods including <b>Weather-Ometer</b> weathering coupled with 28 days of saline immersion, infrared spectroscopy, percent residue determination and depth of penetration testing.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} ability of seven {{ultraviolet}} (UV) absorbers to reduce fading of nylon colored with nine synthetic acid dyes applied at 0. 5 % and 0. 05 % owf concentrations. By including two concentrations, we could evaluate the influence of depth of shade on the absorbers’ effectiveness. Specimens were treated with UV absorbers using one of two application methods: an exhaust bath at 100 °C or an immersion treatment at room temperature. After treatment, specimens were exposed to 160 AFUs of light in a xenon-arc <b>Weather-Ometer,</b> then evaluated instrumentally to {{determine the amount of}} color change. The UV absorbers examined here provided only very limited beneficial effects. Only two had no detrimental effects on all dye/shade combinations to which they were applied, and their beneficial effects were limited to four to seven of the eighteen dye/shade combinations evaluated. Based on this research, we cannot make general recommendations regarding UV absorber use because some of the acid-dyed nylon specimens treated with UV absorbers exhibited no improvement in lightfastness, while other treated specimens actually exhibited greater fading or color change than their respective untreated controls. Further testing is needed {{to determine the effects of}} specific absorbers on specific dyes not examined in this study, because the effectiveness of each absorber appears to be dye and shade specific...|$|E
40|$|Natural and {{accelerated}} weatherings were studied {{to inspect the}} effect of antioxidants to protect low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films for commercial application as greenhouse covering materials in Saudi Arabia. In this investigation, six different formulations of LDPE film with incorporation of antioxidants were prepared and compared with neat LDPE. The samples were extruded and blown into a film using twin-screw extruder and film blowing machine. The LDPE films were exposed for outdoor weathering in Riyadh {{during the period of}} 90 days (mid of June to mid of September) while the accelerated tests were performed by <b>Weather-Ometer.</b> The film having 0. 2 wt% Alkanox- 240 (AN- 0. 2) stabilizers showed the highest tensile strength among all samples during natural and 100 -hour accelerated weathering (10. 9 [*]MPa and 21. 8 [*]MPa, resp.). The best elongation at break was witnessed in 0. 2 % Good-rite antioxidants which were 64 % in natural weathering; however, 0. 5 % Good-rite antioxidants showed 232 % in accelerated weathering. The film having 0. 5 wt% Good-rite 3114 (GR- 0. 5) antioxidant could withstand 70 days during natural exposure before the tensile strength values were reduced to 2 / 3 rd of the initial. The present study suggested that the addition of antioxidants Good-rite, Anox, and Alkanox can improve the mechanical strength, film’s life, effectiveness, and stability and they are suitable to be incorporated in LDPE for commercial greenhouse films...|$|E
40|$|The {{goals of}} the NREL PVMaT program are, among others, to reduce module {{manufacturing}} costs and improve the quality, and we might add here the reliability, of manufactured PV products. One component critical to the service life of PV modules is the useful life of the EVA resin-based encapsulant which is employed extensively by module manufacturers on a worldwide basis. This pottant has been in commercial use since 1982, and over that time {{has proven to be}} a dependable material from the standpoint of production, module fabrication, and end-use. But despite the widespread acceptance of the EVA resin-based A 9918 and similar formulations for PV encapsulation, some module producers, end-users, and investigators have reported a yellowing or browning phenomenon with EVA resin-based encapsulants in the field. Wile the incidence of this discoloration/degradation appeared at comparatively few sites at the time that this present program was conceived, it raised serious concern as to the long term reliability of EVA resin-based encapsulation systems. Consequently, under the NREL PVMaT program, Springborn Laboratories proposed a comprehensive study of the EVA aging and discoloration problem and its possible solution(s). During the first year of this program, accelerated U. V. aging methods were surveyed. On careful review of the various types of accelerated U. V. aging equipment available, an Atlas Ci 35 A <b>Weather-Ometer</b> Xenon Exposure System was selected as appropriate equipment for this work. The following report summarizes how this accelerated aging technique has been used to develop a family of solutions to the discoloration problem, the most significant of which is a series of EVA-based encapsulants which are resistant to discoloration...|$|E
40|$|Aim and Objective: To {{compare and}} {{evaluate}} the effect of ultraviolet (UV) stabilizers (Chimassorb 81 and Uvinul 5050) on the color change of pigmented elastomer. Materials and Methods: Two pigments - Red (P 112 Brilliant Red) and Yellow (P 106 Yellow) and two UV stabilizers Chimassorb 81 and Uvinul 5050 were studied. A total of six groups of 10 samples each were fabricated {{using a combination of}} the above colors and stabilizers: Group A 1 - Red control, Group A 2 - Red + Chimassorb 81, Group A 3 - Red + Uvinul 5050. Group B 1 - Yellow control, Group B 2 - Yellow + Chimassorb 81, Group B 3 - Yellow + Uvinul 5050. All samples were subjected to ageing in an accelerated weathering chamber (<b>Weather-Ometer).</b> Color values L, a, and b were measured at 500 and 1000 h for all samples before and after weathering and change in color (Delta E) was calculated. Results: All groups showed a significant color change. At 500 h, Chimassorb 81 showed a statistically significant lesser change in both colors (red - 3. 66 and yellow - 2. 8) compared to their control groups (red - 5. 19 and yellow - 4. 9). At 1000 h, both UV stabilizers showed lesser color change (A 2 - 5. 49, B 2 - 4. 28, A 3 - 7. 47 and B 3 - 4. 09) as compared to their respective control groups (A 1 - 9. 57 and B 1 - 5. 91). Overall, the change in the color with Group A was more than Group B. Conclusion: Addition of UV stabilizers helped the reduction of color change. Chimassorb 81 showed a greater reduction in color change in both colors consistently at 500 and 1000 h...|$|E
40|$|Fiber artists, {{as well as}} museum personnel, have {{attempted}} to reduce fading and/or deterioration in textiles by 1) using lower levels of lighting, 2) using incandescent lights instead of fluorescent lights, and 3) using ultraviolet filters on fluorescent lights. However, in many public buildings and in some daylighted museum galleries, textiles may be displayed without protection from light {{by any of the}} above measures. Therefore, many contemporary textiles are subjected to unusually high levels of lighting because most North American buildings are well lighted by fluorescent lamps and/or daylight through large expanses of window glass that emit or transmit sizable amounts of ultraviolet radiation. Ultraviolet radiation is particularly damaging to textiles, paper and other organic materials because it is capable of inducing photochemical changes that result in fading and strength loss. This study examined ultraviolet absorbers as an alternative method for reducing light-induced fading and degradation. Most ultraviolet absorbers commercially available in the United States were initially screened for potential use on textiles on the basis of color, toxicity, solubility, and ability to reduce fading. After preliminary evaluations, four benzophenone-based absorbers were selected for further study. The UV absorbers were applied to colored wool textiles plus undyed cotton, linen, silk and wool by an immersion procedure. After treatment the specimens were exposed to light in a xenon-arc <b>Weather-Ometer,</b> an accelerated lightfastness testing instrument. Total color change was instrumentally measured using a HunterLab tristimulus colorimeter. Strength loss was evaluated by breaking strength tests using a CRE Scott Tester. Results showed that three of the UV absorbers modestly reduced fading in approximately fifty percent of the dyed wool specimens and slightly suppressed degradation in the undyed fibers. The treatment shows promise for use on wool textiles such as tapestries colored with natural dyes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if selected contemporary quilting materials, specifically marking pens and ink removal treatments, quilt basting sprays, fusible webs, and fusible battings, contribute to the degradation or discoloration of quilt fabrics over time as there are no published results of the long-term effects of these products. Marked fabrics (marking pens) and fabric assemblies (fabric and batting) incorporating quilt basting spray adhesives, fusible webs, and fusible battings were evaluated for color differences and percent change in breaking strength following light exposure or accelerated ageing. Fabric assemblies containing adhesive products were also evaluated for changes in stiffness following light exposure or accelerated ageing. ^ Accelerated ageing to simulate natural ageing was performed according to AATCC modified protocols for 6 - and 36 -hour levels of accelerated ageing to predict the lifespan of quilting materials. Artificial light exposure in an Atlas Xenon-Arc <b>Weather-Ometer</b> simulated sunlight exposure through window glass. Marking pen specimens were exposed to 20 and 40 AFUs of light exposure, while adhesive product fabric assemblies were exposed to 40 and 80 AFUs of light. ^ Air-soluble marking pen ink did not “disappear” as manufacturers claimed. Water immersion was the most effect means of ink removal, while eraser pen ink removal treatments had the most dramatic and detrimental effect of color change. ^ Fusible battings exhibited less color change than other adhesive products. Some polyvinyl acetate-based adhesive sprays exhibited more yellowing than others. Both polyamide and polyvinyl alcohol-based fusible webs exhibited undesirable ageing characteristics. Knowing basic chemical classification of a product was not sufficient to predict product performance; additives negatively affect the performance of products during the ageing process. ^ The results promise to be useful to museum professionals. Based on this research, curators and conservators may wish to advise against acquisition of quilts, apparel or fiber art incorporating these products. Furthermore, this research indicates that quilters desiring to make heirlooms should refrain from using temporary fabric marking pens and select products without adhesives. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{scanning}} electron {{and transmission}} electron microscope study of wood substrate anatomy and ultrastructure, involving over one thousand micrographs, was made on weatherboards of two endemic timbers of New Zealand and one exotic timber, to determine their response to eight different coating systems currently recommended for exterior use. Dacrydium cupressinum Lamb. (rimu), Podocarpus dacrydioides A. Rich. (kahikatea) and Pinus radiata D. Don. (radiata pine) were the taxa chosen and three water based primer systems, four solvent based primer systems and a specially formulated Ti 02 tagged alkyd novel coating system were used to demonstrate wood/coating relationships. The key elements present in the coatings were detected by energy dispersive X-ray analysis and used for tracing coating penetration in the weatherboards. The primer coated weatherboards were studied in transverse section. Penetration limit of the seven primers was three cells deep. Ti 02 tagged alkyd coated weatherboards were also examined longitudinally as they exhibited much deeper substrate penetration than the primers. behaviour of this substrate coating system. The essence of this thesis is therefore the The entire cross-sectional length of each weatherboard was photographed under the microscope and quantitative information on the diverse nature of the coating was obtained by {{counting the number of}} filled cells along rows of tracheids inwards from the coating interface, measuring the slope of the tracheid lengths relative to the board surface, determining the influence of the tracheid cell growth directions and cut of board as seen in profile view. Statistical analyses showed that with reference to combination comparisons of the two types of mounted weatherboard profiles, namely, 'u'-type and 'n'type cuts, the mean gross coating penetration depth was significantly different among the three taxa. The maximum gross coating penetration limit recorded along the top surface for D. cupressinum ' 0 ' and 'n'-type boards is nine cells; and for P. dacrydioides it is six cells in 'u'-type and thirteen cells in 'n'-type boards. Coating penetration appears shallower for P. radiata, with the maximum depth being eight cells for 'u'-type and four cells for 'n'-type boards. Extreme maximum penetration occurred along the sides of coated weatherboards. The mean angle made by the tracheid cell length and the substrate face is greater in 'u'-type boards than 'n'-type boards. The performance of the Ti 02 tagged alkyd coating and the wood substrates were tested using accelerated weathering techniques involving the Xenon-arc <b>Weather-Ometer.</b> Coated and uncoated boards were weathered for one thousand, two thousand and three thousand hours. Coating durability and substrate behaviour were qualitatively assessed microscopically. Spectrocol orimetrican d spectroscopic techniques including the L *a* b* and chromaticity colour systems, fourier transform infrared and attenuated total reflectance methods were used to obtain supplementary quantitative information. Theories on observed coating/substrate behaviour are discussed...|$|E
