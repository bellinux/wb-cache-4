2500|$|The Metrodome's {{air-supported roof}} was {{designed}} by the inventor of air-supported structures, David H. Geiger, through his New York-based Geiger Berger Associates, and manufactured and installed by Birdair Structures. An air-supported structure supported by positive air pressure, it required 250,000ft³/min (120 m³/s) of air to keep it inflated. The air pressure was supplied by twenty 90-horsepower fans. The roof was made of two layers: the outer layers were Teflon-coated fiberglass and the inner was a proprietary acoustical fabric. By design, the dead air space between the layers insulated the roof; in winter, warm air was blown into the space between layers to help melt snow that had accumulated on top. At {{the time it was}} built, the [...] of fabric made the roof the largest expanse ever done in that manner. The outside Teflon membrane was 1/32 of an inch thick and the inner liner of <b>woven</b> <b>fiberglass</b> was 1/64 of an inch thick. The entire roof weighed roughly 580,000 pounds.

40|$|Zodiac Aerospace {{currently}} employs {{finite element}} analysis (FEA) computer models to predict the material behavior of its composite products. The objective of this project {{was to develop a}} testing protocol for obtaining detailed material property data to use in these FEA models. With accurate material data, FEA models can reduce the need for expensive physical testing and achieve timely troubleshooting when testing complex components. The specific material characterized in this project was an 8 -satin <b>weave</b> <b>fiberglass</b> phenolic pre-preg used as the facesheet material in many of Zodiac’s sandwich panel composites. The developed testing protocol involved mechanical testing of lamina and laminate samples in tension, shear, and compression. Relationships between fiber orientation, sample tabbing, and sample thickness were examined using multiple full factorial experimental designs. Results indicated that nominal fiber orientation was significant in determining the mechanical properties of all samples, while tabbing was not significant for any sample. Sample thickness was less influential in determining tensile and shear properties but more influential in determining compressive properties. The resultant testing protocol therefore recommends that samples used to determine the mechanical properties of pre-preg materials be laminate samples manufactured without tabs, with minimized slenderness ratios, and with differing fiber orientations. Additional parameters of the protocol include surface roughness analysis via profilometry to determine accurate sample thicknesses, and end-cutting of samples via diamond saw to ensure flush sample surfaces. The finalized protocol is intended {{to be used in the}} characterization of current and future pre-preg materials produced by Zodiac...|$|R

50|$|Mid-range {{drivers are}} usually cone types or, less commonly, dome types, or {{compression}} horn drivers. The radiating diaphragm of a cone mid-range unit is a truncated cone, {{with a voice}} coil attached at the neck, along with the spider portion of the suspension, and with the cone surround at the wide end. Cone mid-range drivers typically resemble small woofers. The most common material used for mid-range cones is paper, occasionally impregnated and/or surface-treated with polymers or resins {{in order to improve}} vibrational damping. Other mid-range cone materials include plastics such as polypropylene, Cobex, Bextrene, <b>woven</b> Kevlar, <b>fiberglass,</b> carbon fiber, or light metal alloys based on aluminium, magnesium, titanium, or other alloys. The radiating surface of a dome mid-range is typically a 90-degree section of a sphere, made from cloth, metal, or plastic film, with its suspension and voice coil co-located at {{the outer edge of the}} dome. Most professional concert mid-range drivers are compression drivers coupled to horns. A very few mid-ranges are electrostatic drivers, planar magnetic drivers, or ribbon drivers.|$|R

40|$|Application Note As {{data rates}} increase, {{designers}} are increasingly {{moving away from}} wide parallel buses to serial buses with differential signaling. Differential signaling uses two output drivers to drive two independent transmission lines, one line carrying one bit and the other line carrying its complement. The difference of the two signals measured between the two traces carries the information. A differential pair {{is a pair of}} transmission lines with some amount of coupling between the two legs of the pair. The issues with parallel buses include signal breakout, source-synchronous timing margins, and termination strategies while differential signaling centers on intra- and inter-pair skew, via stubs, dielectric material properties, and impedance discontinuities. This application note is for printed circuit board (PCB) designers planning to use the high-speed transceivers available in Stratix ® II GX and Stratix IV GX devices and addresses two key design topics: Dielectric material selection Additional skew introduced in differential pairs because of local variations in dielectric constant (Er), resulting from the <b>fiberglass</b> <b>weave</b> pattern in a dielectric material.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the effect of}} the stacking sequence and fiber orientation on a composite sandwich panel subjected to static in-plane bolt loading. Six plates were constructed with laminates of unidirectional carbon fiber and cross ply <b>weaves</b> of <b>fiberglass.</b> The orientations that were examined included 0, +/- 45, and 90 degrees. Half of the plates had fiberglass lamina {{on the outside of the}} laminate while the other three plates had the carbon fiber on the outside. Experimental and analytical tests were performed to determine the best orientations and stacking sequence. For the numerical analysis, plates with fibers oriented at +/- 45 degrees showed the highest strength. The experimental data also showed high strengths for the +/- 45 degree plates. However the experimental data also showed high strengths for the 90 degree laminate but with very high displacements. These high displacements would not allow the joint to maintain its relative position to the adjacent part. The discrepancy between the strength of the FEA models and the experimental data is attributed to inaccurate strength properties. The effect of in situ strength and compression strength was found to have a significant effect on the accuracy of the FEA solution. Good correlation was found between the FEA and experimental data in predicting the trend of the stiffness of the plates...|$|R

Tensile test and water absorption test were conducted in order to study the properties of polymer matrix composite (PMC) when the alignment of reinforcement material was varied. For this project, <b>woven</b> roving <b>fiberglass</b> {{was used as the}} fiber and unsaturated polyester resins as its matrix material. Hand layup process was used to fabricate the laminated composite. The specimens were divided into four major categories with different alignment and thickness of fiber and matrix which were 5 layers bidirectional, 5 layers multidirectional, 7 layers bidirectional, and 7 layers multidirectional. Tensile test showed that bidirectional alignment was better in term of mechanical properties compared to multidirectional alignment. The 5 layers bidirectional have a higher tensile strength compared to 5 layers multidirectional. While 7 layers bidirectional have a higher tensile strength compared to 7 layers multidirectional. The modulus of elasticity of bidirectional alignment was higher than multidirectional alignment. Bidirectional alignment was better because the external tensile load was equally distributed on all the fibers and transmitted along the axis of the fibers. Whereas in case of multidirectional alignment, fiber axes was non-parallel to load axis, resulting in off axis pulling of fibers and increased stress concentration causing the earlier failure of laminates. Water absorption test showed that multidirectional alignment absorbs more quantity of water compared to bidirectional alignment. Therefore, multidirectional alignment was not suitable for underwater application such as boat, canoe and yacht.

50|$|Multilayer {{insulation}} (MLI) is {{the most}} common passive thermal control element used on spacecrafts. MLI prevent both heat losses to the environment and excessive heating from the environment. Spacecraft components such as propellant tanks, propellant lines, batteries, and solid rocket motors are also covered in MLI blankets to maintain ideal operating temperature. MLI consist of an outer cover layer, interior layer, and an inner cover layer. The outer cover layer needs to be opaque to sunlight, generate a low amount of particulate contaminates, and be able to survive in the environment and temperature to which the spacecraft will be exposed. Some common materials used for the outer layer are <b>fiberglass</b> <b>woven</b> cloth impregnated with PTFE Teflon, PVF reinforced with Nomex bonded with polyester adhesive, and FEP Teflon. The general requirement for the interior layer is that it needs to have a low emittance. The most commonly used material for this layer is Mylar that is aluminized on one or both sides. The interior layers are usually thin compared to the outer layer to save weight and are perforated to aid in venting trapped air during launch. The inner cover faces the spacecraft hardware and is used to protect the thin interior layers. Inner covers are often not aluminized in order to prevent electrical shorts. Some materials used for the inner covers are Dacron and Nomex Netting. Mylar is not used because of flammability concerns. MLI blankets are an important element of the thermal control system.|$|R
