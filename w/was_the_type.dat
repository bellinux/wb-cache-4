5|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle a spiritualist who {{supported}} the mediumship of Home stated that he was unusual in that he had four different types of mediumship: direct voice (the ability to let spirits audibly speak); trance speaker (the ability to let spirits speak through oneself); clairvoyant (ability to see things {{that are out of}} view); and physical medium (moving objects at a distance, levitation, etc., which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of mediumship in which he had no equal).|$|E
5|$|In August 2001, an {{expedition}} {{headed by the}} marine archaeologist and author Clive Cussler announced that they had found {{the remains of a}} ship embedded in the Rochelois reef. Only a few pieces of timber and some metal artifacts could be salvaged, the remainder of the wreckage being lost within the coral. Initial tests on the wood indicated that it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of Mary Celestes 1872 refit, and it seemed the remains of the Mary Celeste had been found. However, dendrochronological tests carried out by Scott St George of the Geological Survey of Canada showed that the wood came from trees, most probably from the US state of Georgia, that would still have been growing in 1894, about ten years after the Mary Celestes demise.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions that specify land grants, {{rights and}} {{ownership}} were descriptive of {{the boundaries of}} demarcation using natural features such as rivers, streams, water channels, hillocks, large boulders, layout of the village, location of forts (kote) if any in the proximity, irrigation canals, temples, tanks and even shrubs and large trees. Also included <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of soil, the crops meant to be grown and tanks or wells to be excavated for irrigation. Inscriptions mention wet land, cultivable land, forest and waste land. There are numerous references to hamlets (palli) belonging to the hunter communities who resided in them (bedapalli). From the 6th century onwards, the inscriptions refer to feudal lords by the title arasa. The arasas were either brahmins or from tribal background who controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king. The velavali who were loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors under oath (vele). They moved with the royal family and were expected {{to fight for the}} master and be willing to lay down their lives in the process. If the king died, the velavali were required to self immolate on the funeral pyre of the master.|$|E

5|$|Later botanists, such as Philip Miller in 1754, divided cacti {{into several}} genera, which, in 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu placed in his newly created family Cactaceae. By the early 20th century, botanists came to feel Linnaeus's name Cactus {{had become so}} {{confused}} as to its meaning (was it the genus or the family?) {{that it should not}} be used as a genus name. The 1905 Vienna botanical congress rejected the name Cactus and instead declared Mammillaria <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> genus of the family Cactaceae. It did, however, conserve the name Cactaceae, leading to the unusual situation in which the family Cactaceae no longer contains the genus after which it was named.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June 2011, Chopra penned {{a three-year}} deal with Ipswich Town signing for an {{undisclosed}} fee, which was reported by East Anglian Daily Times to be £1.5 million. Manager Paul Jewell revealed that he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of player the club was searching for. After signing, Chopra {{said that he was}} hungry for goals. He started his Ipswich years with a bang scoring twice in his debut against Bristol City. He also scored a goal in each of the two match =es against his former club Cardiff City. He ended the season as the club's top scorer with 14 goals. However, Chopra had a lackluster second season with the club, where he scored five times in thirty six matches. Unhappy with his performance, manager Mick McCarthy said that he was not in his plans for going forward and they were free to look for another club. Nevertheless, he found the winner goal in the dying minutes of a match against Watford. Though he missed a couple of chance earlier in the match, he was successful in converting Carlos Edwards low cross in the last minute of the encounter.|$|E
5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} {{was placed in}} the genus Pitohui with five other species, and the genus was thought to reside within the Australasian {{whistler}} family (Pachycephalidae). A 2008 examination of the genus, however, found it to be polyphyletic (meaning that the genus contained unrelated species), with some purported members of the genus not actually falling within the whistlers. The hooded pitohui and the closely related variable pitohui were both found {{to be related to the}} Old World orioles (Oriolidae). A 2010 study by the same team confirmed that the hooded pitohui and variable pitohui were orioles and indeed were sister species, and that together with the figbirds they formed a well defined basal clade within the family. As the variable pitohui <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> species for the genus Pitohui, the hooded pitohui was retained in that genus and the four remaining species were moved to other genera.|$|E

5|$|The murder notes {{had been}} {{analyzed}} before at the extraordinary motion hearing. Handwriting expert Albert S. Osborn reviewed the previous {{evidence at the}} commutation hearing and commented, for the first time, that the notes were written {{in the third person}} rather than the first person. He said that the first person would have been more logical since they were intended to be the final statements of a dying Phagan. He argued this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of error that Conley would have made, rather than Frank, as Conley was a sweeper and not a Cornell-educated manager like Frank.|$|E

25|$|The only {{aircraft}} produced {{under the}} Blériot {{name to be}} produced in any quantity <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 127, initially designed in 1925 as the Type 117 escort fighter, and later adapted to become a bomber. 42 examples were bought by the French air force.|$|E
25|$|The twin-engined CANT Z.1011 {{was one of}} two bombers {{of about}} the same size and powered by the same engines, {{designed}} by Filippo Zappata in the mid-1930s. The other was the three-engined CANT Z.1007, which in the end <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> preferred by the Regia Aeronautica.|$|E
25|$|While {{unsuitable}} as a fighter, {{the success}} of the engine installation of the Jupiter Fighter resulted in the decision to produce an advanced trainer version, to supplement the Siddeley Puma-engined Bristol Tourers already in use in this role.

25|$|AIPC {{grew out}} of an idea from its founder, Rick Barsness. When Barsness was a hockey player in high school, his team reached the state championships, but his father never {{attended}} a game. His father's absence nurtured a boyhood dream of a place where families could eat and have fun together. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of place Barsness wished he could have spent time with his father.|$|E
25|$|In response, a {{new series}} of tanks based on an {{improved}} Type 97 design was conceived. The first of this new series <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 1 Chi-He. Work on the design began in 1941. However, production did not begin until 1943, due to the higher priority of steel allocated to the Imperial Navy for warship construction. A total of 170 units were built from 1943–44, and they did not see any combat.|$|E

25|$|Following the Sino-Soviet {{split and}} the {{withdrawal}} of Soviet aid, the Wuhan-based No. 701 Institute began reverse-engineering the Type 01 in 1962. The result <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 065. It {{was based on the}} Riga hull with the flush deck replaced by a long forecastle. This modification was needed to accommodate a large medium-speed diesel powerplant; the civilian diesel was a substitute for the Rigas compact high-pressure steam turbine powerplant that the Chinese were unable to replicate. The first Type 065, 529 Haikou, was laid down at Huangpu in August 1964 and commissioned by August 1966.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{their range}} and beyond, the Mierzanowice and Strzyżów {{cultures}} (and the more {{southern part of}} the Iwno culture) were replaced by the Trzciniec culture. It was named after Trzciniec near Puławy and lasted from 1700 to 1100 BC, that is throughout the second and third periods of the Bronze Age. It was probably made up of diverse post-Neolithic populations, whose common characteristic <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of pottery – large vessels with a thickened upper edge and a horizontal decorative protrusion around the neck, first found around northern Germany {{at the beginning of the}} millennium. Their own production of bronze objects came late and only in the western part of this culture's range.|$|E
25|$|Most PLAN surface combatants in {{the class}} of {{destroyer}} and frigate operate a main gun (mostly a forward turret, and many ships have an aft turret as well). Anti-surface artillery has been primarily based on Soviet designs of 76mm to 130mm designs. The Type-76 130mm twin mount is the main artillery mount on the Luda class destroyers. A more indigenized ship artillery gun system <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 79 dual 100mm gun (as well as single versions). The gun can be operated with one operator or completely automatically guided by radar or optronic aiming. These guns can achieve accurate fire at roughly 25 rounds a minute. A new indigenous 100mm mount is available on the latest combatants; this is a single rapid fire weapon similar to the French Creusot-Loire weapon. Newer indigenous 130mm gun systems are also under development.|$|E
