5|$|Shortly afterwards, Jack Matlock, United States {{ambassador}} to the Soviet Union, told Gorbachev {{of the possibility of}} a coup attempt against him, and the Soviet leader became worried when Anatoly Chernyaev informed him of mysterious troop movements outside Moscow. On 21 June, four days after Pavlov's speech, Gorbachev addressed the Supreme Soviet and told delegates that there were no differences in opinion between him and Pavlov. Even when {{he had been able to}} secure his position, Gorbachev's power within the system was already faltering, although he succeeded in getting the enhanced powers previously given to the Cabinet of Ministers reversed. The power struggle between Gorbachev and Pavlov was not over, <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> promising Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev that Pavlov, along with Dmitry Yazov, Minister of Defence, and Vladimir Kryuchkov, the Chairman of the KGB, would be removed from their posts following the signing and ratification of the New Union Treaty.|$|E
25|$|During Yuri Andropov's {{tenure as}} general {{secretary}} (1982–1984), Gorbachev {{became one of}} the Politburo's most visible and active members. With responsibility over personnel, working together with Andropov, 20 percent of the top echelon of government ministers and regional governors were replaced, often with younger men. During this time Grigory Romanov, Nikolai Ryzhkov, and Yegor Ligachev were elevated, the latter two working closely <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> Ryzhkov on economics, Ligachev on personnel.|$|E
25|$|After the summit, Bush {{would seek}} {{cooperative}} relations <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> throughout {{the remainder of}} his term, believing that the Soviet leader was the key to peacefully ending the Soviet domination Eastern Europe. When Lithuania declared independence from the USSR in 1990, Bush avoided criticizing Gorbachev out of the fear of undermining or alienating the Soviet leader. He did, however, pressure Gorbachev to begin negotiations with the Lithuanian government.|$|E

25|$|At {{the crucial}} {{moments of the}} August Coup, arguably the last attempt by the Soviet hardliners to prevent {{the breakup of the}} state, some {{military}} units did enter Moscow to act against Boris Yeltsin but ultimately refused to crush the protesters surrounding the Russian parliament building. In effect, the leadership of the Soviet military decided to side <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> and Yeltsin, and thus finally doomed the old order.|$|E
25|$|After 's {{ascension}} in 1985, Bronfman's New York Times message {{began to}} {{resonate with the}} public. In early 1985, Bronfman secured {{an invitation to the}} Kremlin and on September 8–11, visited Moscow, becoming the first World Jewish Congress President to be formally received in Moscow by Soviet Officials. Carrying a note from Shimon Peres, Bronfman met <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> and initiated talks of a Soviet Jewish airlift. It is said that Peres' note called on the Soviet Union to resume diplomatic relations with Israel.|$|E
25|$|While Brezhnev {{never had}} a clear heir apparent, Kulakov {{was seen as a}} likely {{successor}} due to his age. His most notable competitors, Kirilenko and Suslov, were older than Brezhnev and therefore not seen as likely candidates. Despite this widespread belief, in the prestige order voted by the Supreme Soviet in 1975, Kulakov was ranked seventh. During the latter part of his life, Kulakov's relations with Brezhnev, Chernenko, and other leading officials seemed to have shifted in tone, leading Kulakov to be excluded from the 1978 Central Committee plenum on Agriculture. It has been presumed that Kulakov had shifted his allegiance from Chernenko's faction to that of Kirilenko and Andropov. Another incident was that Kulakov had argued <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> before his death.|$|E

50|$|The {{collapse}} of the European governments <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> tacit consent inadvertently encouraged several Soviet republics to seek greater independence from Moscow's rule. Agitation for independence in the Baltic states led to first Lithuania, and then Estonia and Latvia, declaring their independence. Disaffection in the other republics was met by promises of greater decentralization. More open elections led to the election of candidates opposed to Communist Party rule.|$|R

500|$|Thatcher {{was one of}} {{the first}} Western leaders to respond warmly to reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Following Reagan–Gorbachev summit {{meetings}} and reforms enacted by Gorbachev in the USSR, she declared in November 1988 that [...] "We're not in a Cold War now", but rather in a [...] "new relationship much wider than the Cold War ever was". She went on a state visit to the Soviet Union in 1984 and met <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> and Council of Ministers Chairman Nikolai Ryzhkov.|$|E
500|$|Momentum {{towards a}} {{comprehensive}} ban reemerged under Mikhail Gorbachev and President Ronald Reagan, <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> initiating a testing moratorium in 1985. In December 1986, the US indicated {{support for the}} [...] "long-term objective" [...] of a comprehensive ban, followed by the commencement of testing negotiations between the US and Soviet Union in November 1987. In December 1987, the US and Soviet Union agreed to a joint program of experiments on detecting underground tests. In August 1988, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Sri Lanka, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia petitioned to transform the PTBT into a comprehensive ban by extending the treaty to underground tests. At a conference on the plan in January 1991, the US indicated it would not permit efforts to achieve a comprehensive ban by consensus with amendments to the PTBT.|$|E
500|$|By 1988 Ryzhkov {{increasingly}} {{sided with}} Leonid Abalkin, {{one of the}} few economists who advocated fiscal responsibility. At the 19th Conference of the Central Committee, Abalkin was severely criticised by Gorbachev, and accused of [...] "economic determinism". Several conference delegates agreed <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> but Ryzhkov's support remained solid. Abalkin was ordered to deliver a report to the Presidium of the Council of Ministers by December, which as things turned out, put financial stability at the top of its agenda. Gorbachev disliked Abalkin's report and rejected Ryzhkov's requests that he support it. Ryzhkov was then forced to create an even more conservative reform plan for 1989 in which price reform was to be postponed until 1991. When the Abalkin report was proposed at the Central Committee plenum, the majority of delegates indirectly attacked Gorbachev for his indecisiveness {{when it came to the}} implementation of price reform. In April 1990, after submitting a draft to the Presidential Council and the Federation Council, Ryzhkov's price reform was initiated. However, a short while later it was once more put on hold following severe criticism from Boris Yeltsin and several pro-Gorbachev intellectuals. The economic turmoil which hit the Soviet Union in 1990 was blamed on Ryzhkov, even though it was Gorbachev who had delayed Ryzhkov's proposed reform.|$|E
50|$|This period {{experienced}} {{a continuation of}} the previous era’s endorsement of foster care and adoption. Perestroika and glasnost ended press censorship, exposing the decrepit state of orphanages to the public. Journalists contrasted the spiritual warmth of family life to cold institutions. This, in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev’s</b> partial marketization in 1987, spurred the creation of private children’s charities. Adoption was now the favored solution to child homelessness, providing children with permanent and stable homes.|$|R

500|$|Entering the {{presidency}} in 1981, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His supply-side economic policies, dubbed [...] "Reaganomics", advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth, control of the money supply to curb inflation, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term he survived an assassination attempt, spurred the War on Drugs, and fought public sector labor. Over his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4%, and an average annual growth of real GDP of 3.4; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending, tax cuts and increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall, even after adjustment for inflation. During his re-election bid, Reagan campaigned {{on the notion that}} it was [...] "Morning in America", winning a landslide in 1984 with the largest electoral college victory in American history. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including ending of the Cold War, the bombing of Libya, and the Iran–Contra affair. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an [...] "evil empire", and during his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate, President Reagan challenged Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to [...] "tear down this wall!". He transitioned Cold War policy from détente to rollback, by escalating an arms race with the USSR while engaging in talks <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> which culminated in the INF Treaty, shrinking both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan's presidency came during the decline of the Soviet Union and just ten months after the end of his term, the Berlin Wall fell, Germany reunified the following year, and on December 26, 1991, nearly three years after he left office, the Soviet Union collapsed.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2000 with Mikhail Gorbachev (the leader of the Soviet Union from 1985–91), the following statement was posed to him: [...] "In the 1980s, you warned about the unprecedented dangers {{of nuclear weapons and}} took very daring steps to reverse the arms race", <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> replying [...] "Models made by Russian and American scientists showed that a nuclear war would result in a nuclear winter that would be extremely destructive to all life on Earth; the knowledge of that was a great stimulus to us, to people of honor and morality, to act in that situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev had {{achieved}} closer relations during Reagan's second term, but Bush was initially skeptical of Soviet intentions. In 1989, {{just after the}} fall of the Berlin Wall, Bush met <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> in a conference on the Mediterranean island of Malta. The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets, but not all initially found the Malta Summit to be a step in the right direction; Scowcroft, among others, was apprehensive about the meeting, saying that it might be [...] "premature" [...] due to concerns where, according to Condoleezza Rice, [...] "expectations [...] set that something was going to happen, where the Soviets might grandstand and force [...] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States." [...] But European leaders, including François Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher, encouraged Bush to meet <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> something that he did December 2 and 3, 1989. Though no agreements were signed, the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one; when asked about nuclear war, Gorbachev responded, [...] "I assured the President of the United States that the Soviet Union would never start a hot war against the United States of America. And we would like our relations to develop in such a way that they would open greater possibilities for cooperation.... This is just the beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our road, long road to a long-lasting, peaceful period." ...|$|E
50|$|Many historians compare Khrushchev's Thaw and {{his massive}} efforts {{to change the}} Soviet society and move away from its past, <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> perestroika and glasnost during the 1980s.

Both efforts lasted {{only a few years}} and were supported by the people, while being opposed by the hard-liners. Both leaders were dismissed, albeit with completely different results for their country.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the late}} 1980s as the Soviet Union descended into crisis, Shevardnadze became {{increasingly}} unpopular {{and was in}} conflict with Soviet hard-liners who disliked his reforms and his soft line with the West. He criticised a campaign by Soviet troops to put down an uprising in his native Georgia in 1989. In protest over the growing influence of hardliners under Gorbachev, Shevardnadze suddenly resigned in December 1990, saying, [...] "Dictatorship is coming". A few months later, his fears were partially realised when an unsuccessful coup by Communist hardliners precipitated {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union. Shevardnadze returned briefly as Soviet Foreign Minister in November 1991 but resigned <b>with</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> the following month, when the Soviet Union was formally dissolved.|$|E
2500|$|While {{she was the}} Director of the Liaison Office (1983–85), {{there were}} {{conflicts}} with the staff of Reagan's Chief of Staff James A.

After careful consideration, she declined the nomination. A judicial appointment would have effectively removed her from the public policy and political arena, which she did not wish. [...] She had taken the job of Public Liaison because of [...] "a profound sense of obligation to the grassroots voters who had elected Reagan believing {{him to be a}} man of deep principle and traditional faith." [...] Infighting in the White House continued, however. [...] She eventually decided to return to Switzerland after Donald Regan became Chief of Staff, replacing James A. Baker. Whittlesey resumed her duties representing the U.S. in Bern for a second term in 1985.
