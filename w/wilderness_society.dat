5|$|Since its founding, The <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society</b> {{has helped}} pass many bills for {{preservation}} and conservation of public lands. It has also purchased lands for preservation, contributing {{a total of}} 109millionacres (421,000km2) to the National Wilderness Preservation System. Marshall's dream of permanent wilderness protection became a reality 25years after his death when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Wilderness Act into law on September 3, 1964 in the Rose Garden of the White House. The ceremony was attended by Alice Zahniser and Mardy Murie, the widows of two prominent members of The <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society.</b>|$|E
5|$|Defining {{wilderness}} as {{a social}} {{as well as an}} environmental ideal, Marshall promoted organization of a national group dedicated to the preservation of primeval land. In 1935, {{he was one of the}} principal founders of The <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society</b> and personally provided most of the Society's funding in its first years. He also supported socialism and civil liberties throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{development}} {{plans for the}} park, including expansion at Sunshine Village, were under fire with lawsuits filed by Canadian Parks and <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society</b> (CPAWS).

5|$|Bob Marshall's {{mother died}} of cancer in 1916. In 1929, his father Louis died in Zürich, Switzerland at the age of 72. The four {{children}} inherited most of their father's estate, which was worth several million dollars. Although Marshall became financially independent, he continued to work throughout his life. He used his wealth to support causes, such as The <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society,</b> which he essentially supported in its early years, and to pursue his interests.|$|E
5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, The <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society</b> helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined {{wilderness}} areas of the United States and protected some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society,</b> Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E

Jarrah Records, the record label that John Butler co-founded with The Waifs and Phil Stevens, worked in partnership with The <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society</b> to stage the free event that also featured the band Ball Park Music and Dr Bob Brown, former leader of the Australian Greens Party. A march to protest the proposed gas refinery construction at James Price Point accompanied the free concert and campaign supporters were photographed with banners and placards.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, {{expansion}} of Sunshine Village ski resort was approved, with added parking, hotel expansion, {{and development of}} Goat's Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan {{was approved by the}} government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, the Canadian Parks and <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society</b> (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.|$|E
5|$|Commercial logging {{had also}} been {{operating}} for years in the Trinity River country, {{but most of the}} timber produced was used locally. After World War II, logging greatly increased both due to high demand for housing domestically and abroad, and the introduction of more advanced technologies. In 1959 alone, loggers took 439 million board feet from Trinity County. The rate dropped after that, but logging continued at 200–300 million board feet per year well into the 1980s. Many logged areas were on steep mountains, and improper construction of roads and skid trails exposed slopes to erosion and landslides. In 1988 several environmentalist groups including the <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society,</b> Audubon Society and Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service, preventing the cutting of 18.4 million board feet of salvage lumber in an area with particularly high erosion risk. This generated pushback in the local timber industry, whose decline has partly been attributed to more stringent environmental regulations.|$|E
50|$|The {{death of}} the tree, which had already {{been used as a}} symbol in the <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society's</b> {{campaign}} against logging, brought national and international media attention. The destruction of El Grande became a symbol for the destruction of Tasmanian forests. Scrutiny intensified the use of Tasmania's forests for wood chip exportation, and the processes involved.|$|R

5|$|Marshall's {{last years}} were productive. By May 1937, he was {{appointed}} {{as director of the}} Forest Service's Division of Recreation and Lands. Over the next two years, Marshall worked on two major initiatives: an effort to extend national forest recreational opportunities to people with lower incomes (as well as dismantling discriminatory barriers against ethnic minorities), and a program to preserve more wilderness within the national forests. His biographer James Glover asserts that Marshall was probably the first high-level official to seriously fight ethnic discrimination in Forest Service recreational policies, at a time when racial segregation of public facilities was law throughout the Southern states and in some other states. During this time, Marshall continued to financially support The <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society,</b> as well as various civil rights, labor, and socialist organizations.|$|E

5000|$|The Wilderness Act is {{considered}} one of America's bedrock conservation laws and was written by The <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society's</b> former Executive Director Howard Zahniser.
