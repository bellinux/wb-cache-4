Shearer, Reiner, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest {{received}} {{a deal to}} write a first draft of a screenplay for a company called Marble Arch. They decided that the film could not be written and instead filmed a 20-minute demo of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> It was eventually greenlighted by Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio at Embassy Pictures. The film satirizes the wild personal behavior and musical pretensions of hard rock and heavy metal bands, {{as well as the}} hagiographic tendencies of rockumentaries of the time. The three core members of the band Spinal Tap—David St. Hubbins, Derek Smalls and Nigel Tufnel—were portrayed by McKean, Shearer and Guest respectively. The three actors play their musical instruments and speak with mock English accents throughout the film. There was no script, although there was a written breakdown of most of the scenes, and many of the lines were ad-libbed. It was filmed in 25 days.|$|E

J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E

In an interview with The Courier Mail, Fanning noted that the song was a very simple one, stating [...] "the actual style of song is quite different as it has very little movement. There are literally only three chords in the song.""

At the time, Middleton had been playing with Sonic Tapestry, and another band named Pirate. After seeing his band perform, Powderfinger invited Middleton to join them, and he accepted. Middleton described Powderfinger's early days as highly influenced by other popular heavy metal bands at the time, especially Pantera. Despite the band's members all having come from casual projects, the band's meetings were highly serious, according to Middleton, although he admitted they were [...] "confused" [...] in exactly <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Powderfinger generally performed covers of The Rolling Stones, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, and Steppenwolf, as well as Neil Young in their early days, in similar clubs to those in which Middleton had first played.|$|E

In January 1995, Chris Herbert booked the group's first professional songwriting session with the producers at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, East London. Rowe remember feeling similarly to Stannard when he first met the group, [...] "I love them. Immediately. [...] They were like no one I'd met before, really." [...] The session was productive as the duo seemed to get along with the group, together they discussed about the songwriting process and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the record.

Parts of the video were filmed at The Fireside Bowl, where Rise Against played some of their first concerts.

According to co-creator Shugo Takahashi, the series was conceived {{as a way for}} Nintendo to compete against Sony's Playstation console, which dominated the role-playing game market at the time. As a handheld title, Golden Sun was originally planned as a single game, but due to both the hardware limitations of putting the entire game on a single Game Boy Advance cartridge and the developers' own desire for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the game, it was expanded to become two successive games, Golden Sun and [...] The Takahashi Brothers had previously designed Shining Force III, where the story involved playing through the perspectives of both the [...] "good" [...] side and the [...] "bad" [...] side of the characters.

The director of Valkyria Chronicles II, Takeshi Ozawa, returned to that role for Valkyria Chronicles III. Development work took approximately one year. After {{the release of}} Valkyria Chronicles II, the staff {{took a look at}} both the popular response for the game and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> next for the series. Like its predecessor, Valkyria Chronicles III was developed for PlayStation Portable: this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for Valkyria Chronicles II, and they had not come up with the [...] "revolutionary" [...] idea that would warrant a new entry for the PlayStation 3. Speaking in an interview, it was stated that the development team considered Valkyria Chronicles III to be the series' first true sequel: while Valkyria Chronicles II had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move, the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of Valkyria Chronicles II due to being on the same platform. In addition to Sega staff from the previous games, development work was also handled by Media.Vision. The original scenario was written Kazuki Yamanobe, while the script was written by Hiroyuki Fujii, Koichi Majima, Kishiko Miyagi, Seiki Nagakawa and Takayuki Shouji. Its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor.|$|E
500|$|In May 1969, U.S. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird began {{publicly}} questioning North Vietnamese {{treatment of}} U.S. prisoners. [...] On June 5, 1969, a United Press International report described a Radio Hanoi broadcast that denied any such mistreatment. The broadcast used excerpts from McCain's forced [...] "confession" [...] {{of a year}} before, including a statement where {{he said he had}} bombed [...] "cities, towns and villages" [...] and had received [...] "very good medical treatment" [...] as a prisoner. [...] In late 1969, treatment of McCain and the other POWs suddenly improved. [...] North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh had died the previous month, possibly causing a change in policy towards POWs. [...] Also, a badly beaten and weakened POW who had been released that summer disclosed to the world press the conditions to which they were being subjected, and the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, which included McCain's brother Joe, heightened awareness of the POWs' plight. [...] In December 1969, McCain was transferred back to the Hoa Lo [...] "Hanoi Hilton"; his solitary confinement ended in March 1970. [...] When the prisoners talked about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> once they got out, McCain said he wanted to become President. [...] McCain consented to a January 1970 interview outside Hoa Lo with Spanish-born, Cuban psychologist , that was published in the official Cuban newspaper Granma. McCain talked about his life and expressed no remorse for his bombing North Vietnam, and Barral proclaimed him [...] "an insensitive individual without human depth." [...] The POWs issued an edict forbidding any further such interviews, and despite pressure from his captors, McCain subsequently refused to see any anti-war groups or journalists sympathetic to the North Vietnamese regime.|$|E
