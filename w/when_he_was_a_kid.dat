25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told {{a story about how}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E
25|$|After {{trying to}} escape the dollhouse in the season five finale, Charles punishes Emily, Hanna, Spencer, Aria, and Mona, {{subjecting}} them to various types of torture while Alison, Ezra, Caleb, and Toby {{try to find a}} way to help find the girls. Andrew becomes a suspect after being reported missing. Realizing what Charles is planning to do with Alison, the Liars hatch a plan to get out of the dollhouse by setting his vault on fire. The plan worked successfully, and the girls get out of the dollhouse where they are met by Alison, Ezra, Caleb, Toby, and the police. Andrew is arrested and accused of kidnapping the girls. However, the girls are far from okay, as they all suffer from PTSD from their time in captivity. Another girl, Sara Harvey, who went missing the same time Ali did, is found in the dollhouse, reportedly having been held there for two years. Unable to deal with her home life, she runs away and stays with Emily for a while. Meanwhile, Ali tries to get answers out of her dad about Charles DiLaurentis, but he insists there is no one of that name in their family; however, Jason remembers Charles as his imaginary friend <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid.</b> Later, Andrew is released from police custody because of lack of evidence, and the Liars realize that he isn't Charles after all.|$|E

500|$|While {{shooting}} the episode, Jorge Garcia noted [...] "the {{group on the}} beach has been quite big. They laid out the most cast chairs I've ever seen at one time since the pilot and it's been fun." [...] Garcia previewed his character's flashback in a New York Post interview, [...] " [...] the kind of relationship Hurley has {{with his father and}} how it's changed from <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> now that he's an adult and a lottery winner. He finds something on the island that brings him back to that time and that's how it all gets started". Actor Josh Holloway was told that an emotional undercurrent of the episode concerned his failed relationship with Kate. Holloway commented that Sawyer is thinking I have [...] "my beer... but I don't have my girl. He's worried, and drowning it with beer".|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} way the season reveals the name Daredevil, DeKnight {{explained}} that several options had been brought up, such as [...] "one of the versions in the comics where <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> people used to taunt him with the name Daredevil", which did not fit {{in the world of the}} series, or having Ben Urich give the character the name, but the timing for that did not work due to Urich's death before the final Daredevil suit was introduced. It was decided that instead of having the name Daredevil said onscreen, it would be easier to introduce it through the media as a newspaper headline. On why this was not done for Wilson Fisk as Kingpin, DeKnight stated that he felt it would [...] "get a little bit silly.... we went, 'Oh they called him Daredevil! Oh they called him Kingpin!'," [...] and was unable to come up with another natural way for the name Kingpin to come up, so it was decided to leave that for a later time.|$|E
500|$|When {{the agents}} track down Chantara, whose face is pixelated, {{she claims that}} her pimp {{attacked}} Ricky and fears that he will kill her. She pleads with the agents for protection. Mulder and Scully have Wetzel guard Chantara while they assist the police in the raid of a crack house. However, the two are drawn back outside when Wetzel [...] encounters the entity, wildly shooting at it. Inside a police car, the agents find Chantara with her neck broken. When Mulder questions Wetzel, {{he admits that he}} thought he saw the [...] "wasp man", a monster his older brother told him about <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid.</b> Though other deputies express skepticism, Mulder finds flattened bullets; indicating they physically impacted something, though no trace is found of what they struck. Mulder formulates a theory that the entity changes its form to correspond with its victims' worst fears. Wetzel, Ricky, and Chantara all expressed fear shortly before their run-ins with the entity; it was visible to them, but not to others. The agents think that Steve and Edy may be the entity's next target because they were in the vicinity of Ricky's attack. They head to their house, only to find the couple {{in the middle of an}} argument. After Edy expresses fear of a separation from Steve, the couple reconciles. Based on this situation, Mulder proposes that the entity ignored Steve and Edy because they did not exhibit mortal fear.|$|E

That tickled the bunch, {{and they began to}} egg him on and guy me until I saw that if I didn't want to be mixed up in a common street scrap I'd better retreat, which I did ingloriously. Later I managed to scrape {{acquaintance}} with him, and by making some inquiries I found out that his mother is a widow and he was helping support the family, that he had a reputation as a scrapper and that though he swore like a pirate, smoked and chewed tobacco, as most of these street gamins do, he was strictly honest and was a terror to the bullies of his neighborhood. Also that he'd rather fight than eat. Just by chance I discovered that his ambition was to become a soldier, but he was worried for fear he never would be big enough. He's small for his age, stunted for lack of good food <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> I guess. Next to going into the army {{he wanted to be a}} prize-fighter. I talked scouting to him a little, but he didn't seem interested until one day I happened along in full uniform. That got him. I suppose it looked next best to being a soldier. Then I told him all about my patrol and what we were doing and what scouting stands for, and he gulped it all down like a hard run buck trying to drink a lake dry.|$|E
