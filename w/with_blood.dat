40|$|Objectives: The goal of {{this study}} was to compare the {{cardiovascular}} responses to behavioural stressors of three groups of adolescents who differed in blood pressure status across assessments. Design: Casual blood pressure of adolescents who were identified as having elevated blood pressure during a school screen was re-evaluated in the laboratory. The adolescents were classified into two groups: (i) those <b>with</b> consistently elevated <b>blood</b> pressure across school and laboratory assessments and (i) those <b>with</b> labile <b>blood</b> pressure whose blood pressure in the laboratory was below 130 / 80 mmHg. A comparison group of adolescents <b>with</b> consistently normal <b>blood</b> pressure was also included. Methods: Cardiovascular parameters were assessed during rest and during two behavioural stressors, the evaluated speaking task and the mirror tracing task. Results: Adolescents <b>with</b> elevated <b>blood</b> pressure were more vascularly responsive across stressors than adolescents <b>with</b> labile <b>blood</b> pressure, who, in turn, were more reactive than adolescents <b>with</b> normal <b>blood</b> pressure. Conclusions: These results suggest that vascular reactivity to behavioural stressors may be useful in predicting risk of hypertension because of its sensitivity in distinguishing adolescents <b>with</b> consistently elevated <b>blood</b> pressure from those <b>with</b> labile <b>blood</b> pressure and those <b>with</b> normal <b>blood</b> pressure...|$|R

5|$|During sexual arousal, the {{clitoris}} and {{the whole}} of the genitalia engorge and change color as the erectile tissues fill <b>with</b> <b>blood</b> (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the blood from the spaces in the corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues a steady flow and, having no way to drain out, fills the venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged <b>with</b> <b>blood.</b> This is what leads to clitoral erection.|$|E

5|$|To {{function}} in gas exchange, lungs required a blood supply. In cartilaginous fishes and teleosts, the heart lies {{low in the}} body and pumps blood forward through the ventral aorta, which splits up in a series of paired aortic arches, each corresponding to a gill arch. The aortic arches then merge above the gills to form a dorsal aorta supplying the body with oxygenated blood. In lungfishes, bowfin and bichirs, the swim bladder is supplied <b>with</b> <b>blood</b> by paired pulmonary arteries branching off from the hindmost (6th) aortic arch. The same basic pattern is found in the lungfish Protopterus and in terrestrial salamanders, and was probably the pattern found in the tetrapods' immediate ancestors as well as the first tetrapods. In most other bony fishes the swim bladder is supplied <b>with</b> <b>blood</b> by the dorsal aorta.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Kellner {{suggested}} that the large crests of the pterosaur Tapejara, {{as well as other}} species, might be used for heat exchange, allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature, which also would account for the correlation between crest size and body size.

5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, <b>with</b> <b>blood</b> being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveConventional extracorporeal {{circulation}} {{results in an}} activation of coagulation cascades. Coating of {{extracorporeal circulation}} tubes as well as avoidance of shed blood recirculation {{have been shown to}} reduce these phenomena. We evaluated a new shed blood separation system (AVANT D 970) utilizing a coated cardiopulmonary bypass tube system (PHISIO). MethodsForty patients (62 Â± 10 years) underwent isolated coronary revascularization. Four groups (n = 10 /group) were defined: no extracorporeal circulation, conventional uncoated extracorporeal circulation, uncoated extracorporeal circulation <b>with</b> shed <b>blood</b> separation, and coated extracorporeal circulation <b>with</b> shed <b>blood</b> separation. Thrombin-antithrombin complex and free Hb were analyzed and statistically compared. ResultsConventional extracorporeal circulation exhibited the highest intraoperative activation of coagulation (thrombin-antithrombin complex: extracorporeal circulation, 31. 1 Â± 15. 8 Î¼g/L; uncoated extracorporeal circulation <b>with</b> shed <b>blood</b> separation, 15. 3 Â± 7. 8 Î¼g/L; coated extracorporeal circulation <b>with</b> shed <b>blood</b> separation, 8. 1 Â± 4. 8 Î¼g/L; no extracorporeal circulation, 2. 4 Â± 0. 6 Î¼g/L; P <. 05 extracorporeal circulation vs all others) and red blood cell damage (free Hb: extracorporeal circulation, 16. 8 Â± 11. 4 Î¼mol/L; uncoated extracorporeal circulation <b>with</b> shed <b>blood</b> separation, 10. 3 Â± 3. 5 Î¼mol/L; coated extracorporeal circulation <b>with</b> shed <b>blood</b> separation, 6. 8 Â± 2. 9 Î¼mol/L; no extracorporeal circulation, 3. 4 Â± 1. 1 Î¼mol/L; P <. 05 extracorporeal circulation vs no extracorporeal circulation, coated extracorporeal circulation <b>with</b> shed <b>blood</b> separation). Coated extracorporeal circulation <b>with</b> shed <b>blood</b> separation showed only slight activation and cell trauma, which did not differ significantly from no extracorporeal circulation. ConclusionsCombination of coating and avoidance of shed blood recirculation maintained physiological coagulation levels and markedly reduced red blood cell trauma in extracorporeal circulation procedures. These combined modalities may therefore offer an alternative for off-pump procedures in patients with contraindications for conventional extracorporeal circulation...|$|R
