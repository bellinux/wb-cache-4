5|$|After Liliʻuokalani {{was imprisoned}} in the ʻIolani Palace, she was denied {{literature}} and newspapers, essentially cutting her {{off from her}} people. However, she was not forbidden from having a paper and pencil, so she could continue to compose music <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> confinement.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Love's later musical work is more lyrically introspective. Celebrity Skin and America's Sweetheart are lyrically {{centered}} on celebrity life, Hollywood, and drug addiction, while continuing Love's interest in vanity and body image. Nobody's Daughter was lyrically reflective of Love's past relationships and her struggle for sobriety, {{with the majority of}} its lyrics written <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> rehab in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Ariel's {{original}} design {{was developed by}} animator Glen Keane. Her appearance {{was based on a}} number of inspirational sources, including Glen Kleane's wife, actress Alyssa Milano (who was 16 at the time in addition to hosting the making of the special on Disney Channel,) and model-comedian Sherri Stoner, who provided live-action references for the animators during the development of the film. The movement of Ariel's hair underwater was based on footage of astronaut Sally Ride <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> space. Extra reference was given by filming Stoner swimming in a pool, which also helped guide Ariel's aquatic movement.|$|E
5|$|Disappointed by {{the failure}} to sink {{merchant}} ships in that battle, Adolf Hitler ordered {{the majority of the}} surface warships scrapped, though Admiral Karl Dönitz was able to convince Hitler to retain the surface fleet. As a result, Admiral Hipper was returned to Germany and decommissioned for repairs. The ship was never restored to operational status, however, and on 3 May 1945, Royal Air Force bombers severely damaged her <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Kiel. Her crew scuttled the ship at her moorings, and in July 1945, she was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1948–1952 and her bell is currently on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, she {{was used}} to lay mines in the North Sea, to provide gunfire support to ground troops, and as a convoy escort and {{training}} ship for cadets. She participated in Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway in April 1940, Her wartime career ended in Kiel in April 1945, when British bombers badly damaged the ship <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> dock for repairs. Her crew ran her aground to prevent her from sinking, and ultimately blew her up with demolition charges to prevent the Allies from capturing her in May. The wreck was eventually scrapped in the late 1940s.|$|E

When Kimberley was three years old, {{the family moved to}} Australia's Gold Coast, where she {{attended}} St Hilda's School for the next nine years. The family travelled extensively in Europe, and Kimberley attended a private school in Montreux, Switzerland for four years. While there, she learned to speak French and Spanish. When she returned to Australia, she started a degree in arts and commerce at Bond University, though did not complete it.|$|E
5|$|Love {{continued}} to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as Man on the Moon (1999) and Trapped (2002), before releasing her first solo album, America's Sweetheart, in 2004. The next few years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and drug addiction, {{which resulted in a}} mandatory lockdown rehabilitation sentence in 2005 <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the process of writing a second planned solo album. That project became Nobody's Daughter, which was released in 2010 as a Hole album but without any other members of the former lineups. Between 2014 and 2015, she released two solo singles and returned to acting in the network series Sons of Anarchy and Empire.|$|E

5|$|Madonna became {{interested}} in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Together they developed a number of songs for the album, but {{the basis of the}} development was Pharrell Williams' demos. Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album, which amazed Timberlake. They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song. Later, Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects. However, according to her this was not intentional and happened <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the process of developing the album.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the Regioni class {{served in a}} variety of roles {{throughout}} their careers. Their first decade in service was marked by frequent deployments abroad, interspersed between stints in the main Italian fleet, where they served as scouts for the battleships. In 1895, Etruria and much of the main fleet visited Germany for the opening ceremonies for the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Lombardia was stationed in South America in 1896, when an outbreak of yellow fever killed half of her crew <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Rio de Janeiro. In 1897, Umbria and Liguria were assigned to the Cruiser Squadron of the main fleet. Lombardia was deployed to China in 1901, where she replaced Elba, and to Italian Somaliland in 1903. There, she briefly skirmished with Somali rebels.|$|E
5|$|The {{war ended}} <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the {{dockyard}} and the Admiralty decided to modify her {{for use as}} the Home Fleet's trials and training carrier. In this role she conducted the deck-landing trials {{for most of the}} British postwar naval aircraft in the early 1950s. She was occasionally used to ferry troops and aircraft to and from foreign deployments as well as participating in exercises. In 1951, she helped to transport troops to quell rioting in Cyprus {{after the collapse of the}} Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936. She was paid off in early 1955 and sold for scrap in late 1956.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to {{the east coast of}} the United States in late 1914, Vermont resumed her normal routine of training cruises and exercises. The ship was temporarily placed in reserve from 1 October to 21 November 1916, though after {{returning to}} service she supported a Marine expeditionary force sent to Haiti. This duty lasted from 29 November to 5 February 1917, after which she took part in battle training in Cuban waters. Vermont arrived back in Norfolk on 29 March before proceeding to Philadelphia for maintenance on 4 April. <b>While</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> dry dock, the United States entered World War I be declaring war on Germany. Vermonts overhaul was completed on 26 August, and she was assigned as a training ship for engine room personnel, based at Hampton Roads. On 28 May 1918, the remains of the Chilean ambassador to the United States were brought aboard the ship. The US ambassador to Chile, Joseph Hooker Shea, came aboard the ship on 3 June, and Vermont departed Norfolk that day. She transited the Panama Canal on 10 June, stopped briefly in Tongoy, Chile on the 24th, and arrived in Valparaiso three days later. Admiral William B. Caperton and Ambassador Shea escorted the Chilean ambassadors remains ashore.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1876, Yangwu visited the Australian colonies, {{and later in the}} year the Chinese ambassadors to Great Britain, Kwoh Song Tao and Liu-Si-hung, visited Yangwu via mail steamer in December <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Singapore. Following the visit, she sailed to Manila. When she arrived in February 1877, an {{accident}} occurred as the crew were preparing a gun salute for her entrance to the harbour. As the crewman loaded the charge into one of the guns, it detonated, throwing him from the ship and killing him. The crewman was subsequently buried in the city. Yangwu proved to be a spectacle for the inhabitants of the city, particularly the Chinese, some of whom had sailed out to greet her arrival in small boats and others who watched her from the mound on which the lighthouse sat overlooking the bay.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 President Jimmy Carter pardoned Lolita Lebrón, Irvin Flores, and Rafael Cancel Miranda {{after they}} had served 25 years in prison. Andrés Figueroa Cordero was {{released}} from prison earlier because of a terminal illness. Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barceló publicly opposed the pardons granted by Carter, stating that it would encourage terrorism and undermine public safety. Lebrón received a heroine's welcome by her supporters upon her return to her motherland. Lebrón married Sergio Irizarry Rivera and continued to participate in pro-independence activities. The couple had met <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> prison, when the Nationalist Party ordered him to monitor her health. Their marriage took place eight years {{after they had}} met. They moved into a small house in Loiza. The house possessed few distinctive traits, mostly composed of religious iconography and a large flag of Puerto Rico in the living room.|$|E

5|$|The {{letter to}} Æthelburg {{makes it clear}} that she was already married at the time the news of Eadbald's {{conversion}} reached Rome. This is quite inconsistent with the earlier date Bede gives for Eadbald's acceptance of Christianity, and it has been suggested in Bede's defence that Æthelburg married Edwin substantially earlier and stayed in Kent until 625 before travelling to Rome, and that the letter was written <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Kent. However, it would appear from Boniface's letter that Boniface thought of Æthelburg as being at her husband's side. It also appears that the letter to Justus was written after the letters to Edwin and Æthelburg, rather than before, as Bede has it; Boniface's letter to Edwin and Æthelburg indicates he had the news from messengers, but when he wrote to Justus he had heard from the king himself.|$|E
5|$|Victoria was, however, less {{enthusiastic}} about fulfilling her public role. She avoided answering letters, put off visits to elderly relations whose company {{she did not}} enjoy, and talked to people who amused her at official functions while ignoring people of higher standing whom she found boring. Victoria's inattention to her duties provoked quarrels with Ernst. The young couple had loud, physical fights. The volatile Victoria shouted, threw tea trays, smashed china against the wall, and tossed anything that was handy at Ernst during their arguments. Victoria sought relief in her love for horses and long gallops over the countryside on a hard-to-control stallion named Bogdan. <b>While</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Russia for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II, Victoria's affection for Kirill was also rekindled. She enjoyed flirting {{with him at the}} balls and celebrations that marked the coronation.|$|E
5|$|Angelica tasks Chuckie {{to pick a}} {{dandelion}} {{to decorate}} her sculpture. He is unable to obtain it after being chased by a bee and Stu's malfunctioning Mother's Day invention, which is a vacuum-like machine that destroys {{a majority of the}} lawn. After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother. They open Chaz's box, finding a spade, a journal of pressed flowers, and a photograph of Chuckie's mother. Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chaz the picture of his mother as a Mother's Day present. Chaz decides to talk to Chuckie about his mother, telling him that his mother died of a terminal illness shortly after his birth. He explains that she wrote the diary <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the hospital, and reads a poem aloud that she wrote for Chuckie. The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother is all around in him in nature.|$|E
