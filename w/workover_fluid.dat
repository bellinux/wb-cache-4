Two basic tests, namely the rheological properties and fluid loss, were conducted on the sample. The experimental results of fluid loss tests could reveal {{the ability of the}} sample to control fluid loss, a phenomenon which might lead to the pipe sticking and clay swelling problems, reduction of permeability {{in the vicinity of the}} borehole, etc. In this paper, the importance of executing proper mixing procedures in the research study in order to prevent the formation of fish eyes or the corn starch from settling at the bottom of test cup will also be highlighted...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring well-killing {{operations}} for the workover of low-pressure gas wells, formation pressure should be balanced {{so as to guarantee}} well control safety by preventing natural gas overflow. In this paper, a laboratory evaluation was conducted with fuzzy-ball fluids as killing fluids. The results show that, the fuzzy-ball fluid, with a density of 0. 5 – 1. 5  g/cm 3 and a viscosity up to 78, 50, 000  mPa·s at a low shear rate, realizes controllable performance and forms piston-like plugging slugs of solid-free high structural strength on natural gas wellbore after bonding. During well <b>workover,</b> multiple <b>fluid</b> column pressures were set up by injecting fuzzy-ball fluids with different densities at various rates. Owing to high structural strength of the fluids at a low shear rate, natural gas breaks through only inside the piston-like slug and cannot flow upwards to the ground, so the pathways of natural gas in the wellbore are isolated from the ground surface. Moreover, the fluid can wholly move up and down like a piston-like plug, with the change of formation pressures or the tripping of pipe strings. Like the conventional operations, the production can be restored after the workover, so long as the fluid in wellbore is cleaned by means of gas lift. In a natural gas field in NW China, where the formation pressure coefficient dropped to 0. 60 – 0. 82, three wells were fully filled with fuzzy-ball <b>workover</b> <b>fluids</b> for 7 days and another three wells were treated with the piston-like plugs of fuzzy-ball <b>workover</b> <b>fluids</b> for only 3 days. They all presented better technical results. The technology provides a new way for low-pressure gas well workover...|$|R

40|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, reservoir and drilling engineers always give {{special attention to}} formation damage, which {{is also known as}} wellbore damage. Formation damage can restrict or prevent effective depletion of crude oil from a reservoir. Contact with a foreign fluid is the basic cause of formation damage. This foreign fluid may be drilling mud, completion or <b>workover</b> <b>fluid,</b> stimulation or well treating fluid, or even reservoir fluid itself if the original characteristics are altered. The research study done by Krueger [1] found that most field operations such as well drilling, well completion, production, and well stimulation are potential sources for formation damage. Nowadays, there are various methods can be used to combat formation damage. One of them is acidizing. The oil and gas industry has been acidizing oil and/or gas bearing formations since the 1890 s. Acids may be used to reduce damage near the wellbore in all types of formations. Inorganic, organic, and combinations of these acids are used in variety of well stimulation treatments...|$|E

40|$|Clear brines {{are used}} {{extensively}} as <b>workover</b> <b>fluids</b> {{because of their}} low damage characteristics. This work was conducted to study the physical properties of potassium and zinc bromide brines and the compatibility of these brines with different API gravity Saudi crude oils and formation water. Also, the effect of temperature on brine viscosity was studied. It was found that true crystallization temperature for potassium and zinc bromide brines were (- 14 ºC) and (- 25 ºC), respectively. These brines were found incompatible with the tested Saudi crude oils where stable emulsions were formed but light crude oil (42 ºAPI) was compatible with potassium bromide. Also, potassium bromide brine showed compatibility with formation water while zinc bromide was incompatible with formation water because of NaCl scale precipitation. The tested brines have shown non-Newtonian (dilatants) behavior and the viscosity of brines decrease with increase in temperature. Viscosity – temperature correlations were found for the tested brines with high accuracy...|$|R

Nevertheless, research dealing with applications of laponite in water-based drilling fluids is rarely reported. Rare examples include use of laponite as a viscosifier (Qin et al. 2016) and a component in <b>workover</b> <b>fluids</b> (Mueller et al. 1989). Furthermore, systemic evaluation of the application of laponite as a mud-making material for drilling fluids has not so far been reported.|$|R
40|$|Drilling wells {{throughout}} depleted or {{low pressure}} reservoirs requires low density drilling fluids, often with density less than water. Methods {{to reduce the}} density of drilling fluids have included mixing-in air or nitrogen. However, problems with these approaches include instability of gas bubbles (bubbles collapse or expand) and increased costs. Recently, the use of micro bubbles named aphrons in drilling, completion and <b>workover</b> <b>fluids</b> has proven success in solving many problems related to low pressure reservoirs such as fluid loss control, formation damage, stabilization of multipressure sequences with one fluid and possible differential sticking. Aphrons represent bubble with uniquely structure stabilized with surfactant. Against conventional micro bubbles, aphrons are more stable in downhole conditions and they are generated using standard mixing equipment. Owing to their properties and overpressure in wellbore aphrons penetrate into low pressure layers and set up inner bridging. Depleted wells which are very expensive to drill underbalanced or with other remediation techniques can now be drilled overbalanced. This paper presents description of aphron structure and stability, aphron bridging mechanism, aphron-based fluid composition and properties and field experiences in applying aphron-based fluids...|$|R
40|$|A {{reduction}} in permeability occurring around the wellbore resulting from drilling, completion and /or <b>workover</b> <b>fluids</b> increases the flow {{resistance to the}} petroleum reservoir fluids and is defined as formation damage. Acidizing process removes near-wellbore damage and enhances hydrocarbon production from producing wells. This study investigates {{the effect of adding}} polymer as a retarding agent to acid solutions to slow and control the reaction in matrix acidizing treatment of carbonate rocks. Two different polymers, polyacrylamide (PAA) and polysaccharide (xanthan) and two different acids, acetic acid and formic acid, were used through this study. The results revealed that the presence of PAA did not change the viscosity of the acid solution significantly, while the viscosity of xanthan-acid solutions was decreased with increasing the acid concentration. Additionally, the reaction of polymer-acid solutions with the rock material was monitored under microscope. Original rock samples obtained from Saudi reservoirs containing mainly carbonate were used in the reaction. The PAA-acid solution did not show any decrease in the reaction rate compared to that of acid solution. Thus, the PAA solution applied in this study is not recommended as a retarder. However, xanthan-acid solutions showed a significant decrease in the reaction time. Therefore, xanthan was selected to perform further investigations in Rotating Disk Reactor at different pressures. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was conducted on pretreated and posttreated rock samples. This provides the opportunity to perform {{a detailed description of the}} rock surface and facilitates the identification of the changes occurring due to polymer-acid treatment.

40|$|During {{the process}} of finding and {{producing}} oil and gas in the offshore environment operators generate a variety of liquid and solid wastes. Some of these wastes {{are directly related to}} exploration and production activities (e. g., drilling wastes, produced water, treatment <b>workover,</b> and completion <b>fluids)</b> while other types of wastes are associated with human occupation of the offshore platforms (e. g., sanitary and domestic wastes, trash). Still other types of wastes can be considered generic industrial wastes (e. g., scrap metal and wood, wastes paints and chemicals, sand blasting residues). Finally, the offshore platforms themselves can be considered waste materials when their useful life span has been reached. Generally, offshore wastes are managed in one of three ways [...] onsite discharge, injection, or transportation to shore.

40|$|This Determination of Importance Evaluation (DIE) {{applies to}} the Subsurface Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF), {{encompassing}} the Topopah Spring (TS) Loop from Station 0 + 00 meters (m) at the North Portal to breakthrough at the South Portal (approximately 78 + 77 m), and ancillary test and operation support areas including the Enhanced Characterization of the Repository Block (ECRB) Cross Drift. This evaluation applies specifically to site characterization testing activities ongoing and planned in the Subsurface ESF. ESF site characterization activities are being performed to obtain the information necessary {{to determine whether the}} Yucca Mountain Site is suitable as a geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. A more detailed description of these testing activities is provided in Section 6 of this DIE. Generally, the construction and operation of excavations associated with these testing activities are evaluated in the DIE for the Subsurface ESF (CRWMS M&O 1999 a) and the DIE for the ESF ECRB Cross Drift (CRWMS M&O 2000 a). The scope of this DIE also entails the proposed Unsaturated Zone (UZ) Transport Test at Busted Butte. Although, {{not a part of the}} TS Loop or ECRB Cross Drift, the associated testing activities are Subsurface testing activities. Busted Butte is located to the south south-east of the TS Loop and is outside the Conceptual Controlled Area Boundary (CCAB). These activities provide access to the Calico Hills (CH) geologic structure. In the case of Busted Butte, construction and operation of excavations are evaluated herein (since this activity was not previously evaluated in CRWMS M&O 1999 a). The objectives of this DIE are to determine whether Subsurface ESF testing, and associated activities, could potentially impact site characterization testing and/or the waste isolation capabilities of the site. Controls needed to limit any potential impacts are identified in Section 13. The validity and veracity of the individual tests, including data collection, are the responsibility of the assigned Principal Investigator(s) (PIS) and are not evaluated in this DIE. This DIE focuses on integrating and compiling the evaluations of previous DIEs which were prepared for various ESF subsurface testing activities, including the use of temporary items currently located or being developed for these testing activities (see Table 1. l), and to provide a bounding evaluation for potential future ESF subsurface testing activities that are sufficiently similar to the generic testing activities addressed herein. Subsurface testing activities items/facilities evaluated herein include: ongoing and planned testing in the TS Loop, alcoves, and niches, planned testing in the ECRB Starter Tunnel, borehole drilling and <b>workover,</b> and tracers, <b>fluids,</b> and materials (TFM) usage.
