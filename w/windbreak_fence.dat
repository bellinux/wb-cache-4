In one case, wind drag on a wet sample is {{compared with that}} on a dry sample. Results are compared with loads on an impermeable canvas, {{in order to obtain}} load reduction factors as functions of geometry and porosity. Loss coefficients k, when the flow is confined and forced through the fabric samples, are measured and reported for the different analyzed materials and related to the measured drag coefficients. Results are compared, when possible, with those of other researchers and with different semiempirical models...|$|R
40|$|Trees have a {{windbreak}} effect, so a windbreak {{effect can}} be gained for railways by setting up tree grove zones along railway lines. And for slopes, tree grove zones reinforce and stabilize the ground with their tree root system. Railway forests have thus long been developed and maintained as disaster prevention facilities along railway lines where incidents such as gusts and ground failure are of concern. In view of safe renewal and of being economically independent commercial forests as a future source of income, those railway forests are given a width of 20 m to more than 100 m. Narrow lands such as embankment slopes have therefore not been planted as railway forests; instead, those are protected with <b>windbreak</b> <b>fences</b> and slope protection constructions as needed. As the price of lumber has dropped due to recent social changes, railway forests have lost their feature as commercia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} realize the {{automatic}} welding of pipes in a complex operation environment, an automatic welding system has been developed by use of all-position self-shielded flux cored wires due to their advantages, such as all-position weldability, good detachability, arc's stability, low incomplete fusion, no need for welding protective gas or protection against wind when the wind speed is <  8  m/s. This system consists of a welding carrier, a guide rail, an auto-control system, a welding source, a wire feeder, and so on. Welding experiments with this system were performed on the X- 80 pipeline steel to determine proper welding parameters. The welding technique comprises root welding, filling welding and cover welding and their welding parameters were obtained from experimental analysis. On this basis, the mechanical properties tests were carried out on welded joints in this case. Results show that this system can help improve the continuity and stability of the whole welding process and the welded joints' inherent quality, appearance shape, and mechanical performance can all meet the welding criteria for X- 80 pipeline steel; with no need for <b>windbreak</b> <b>fences,</b> the overall welding cost will be sharply reduced.

One is a railing-integrated type {{that is to}} be installed after removing the existing railing, and the other is a barrier-mounted type {{that is to be}} installed on top of existing railing (Fig. 1). The upper part of each is the <b>windbreak</b> <b>fence,</b> which has perforations to meet the solidity ratio requirement of 60 % (area of the part of the <b>windbreak</b> <b>fence</b> that blocks wind/total area of the <b>windbreak</b> <b>fence).</b> That is the same as with existing windbreak fences. The lower part of the railing-integrated type is railing of a hollow box structure. This can reduce weight of the railing and improve installation workability thanks to its all-in-one structure. Existing windbreak fences have folded plates with holes that have to be attached between steel H-beam supports installed in advance (Fig. 2). As countermeasures against operation disruption due to high wind, we have introduced a wind warning system and windbreak fences. Still, wind considerably affects operation. In order to reduce such effects, we are proceeding with installation of windbreak fences to weaken the wind force on rolling stock in sections in the greater Tokyo area to which many operation control commands due to wind are issued. Cost reduction, though, needs to be studied as such fences are installed over a long distance. In light of the situation, we have addressed development of a <b>windbreak</b> <b>fence</b> that would be lighter and easier to erect with integrated components.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new {{observations of}} deposition of heavy particles (glass beads of gravitational settling velocity 8. 7 cm s 1) within an undisturbed flow {{and within a}} flow disturbed by a porous <b>windbreak</b> <b>fence.</b> These data are then used to diagnose the capability of a Lagrangian stochastic (LS) particle trajectory model, which simulates heavy particle dispersion. The model is based on existing parameterizations and is coupled to a wind model based on a Reynolds stress turbulence closure that provides computed fields of wind statistics. The deposition rates, as simulated by the model, match the observation within E 30 % of accuracy, with E being the root-mean-square error normalized by the peak value on the deposition swath. These {{results suggest that the}} LS model handles properly the heterogeneities of the flow and that the heuristic adjustments made to account for the inertia of heavy particles are useful approximations. The model consequently proves to be a valuable tool to investigate the patterns of dispersion about an obstacle. 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT:To {{enhance the}} {{understanding}} of the impact of obstacle buildings on pollution transportation and dispersion in the atmospheric boundary layer, it is necessary to know the atmospheric flow characteristics over terrains. Wind flow characteristics in a boundary layer over a step-shaped cliff topography model with rough and smooth surfaces were studied numerically using Computational Fluid Dynamics models (CFD). The CFD models that were used for the simulation were based on the steady-state Reynolds-Average Navier-Stoke equations (RANS) with turbulence models; standard and RNG models. The rough surface was modeled using <b>windbreak</b> <b>fence,</b> which was set on the step-shaped cliff model surface. The results of the numerical model were validated against the wind tunnel results in order to optimize the turbulence model. Numerical predictions agreed reasonably with the wind tunnel results. The results indicated that rough surface has a great influence on the turbulent flow characteristics and vortex rotating. The wind velocity for rough surface near the ground level was observed to be lower than that for the smooth surface of the step-shaped cliff model. Large flow separations were formed by the windbreak fences. Distortion of the flow at the windward corner of the step created a steep gradient of velocity and large turbulent mixing.

40|$|Wind {{statistics}} were measured using cup and sonic anemometers, placed upwind and downwind from a porous plastic <b>windbreak</b> <b>fence</b> (height h 5 1. 25 m, length Y 5 114 m, resistance coefficient kr 0 5 2. 4, and porosity p 5 0. 45) standing on otherwise uniform land (short grass with roughness length z 0; 1. 9 cm). Intercomparison with collocated two-dimensional sonic anemometers suggested that, except in strongly stratified winds, cup anemometers (distance constant 1. 5 m), {{subjected to a}} uniform overspeeding correction (here; 10 %), provide a reasonably accurate transect of the mean wind across the disturbed flow region. The measurements, binned with respect to mean wind direction and stratification, establish that the resistance coefficient of a windbreak of this type implies the maximum (or ‘‘potential’’) mean wind reduction, a potential that is realized in neutral, perpendicular flow and for which a semiempirical formula is derived. Obliquity of the approaching wind reduces actual shelter effectiveness below the potential value, as was already known. However, a systematic influence of stratification could only be discriminated in winds that were not too far (say, within about 6308) from perpendicular, under which conditions both stable and unstable stratification reduced shelter effectiveness. The ‘‘quiet zone,’ ’ in which velocity standard deviations (su, sy) are reduced relative to the approach flow, was found to extend farther downwind for the normal velocity component (u) than for the parallel component (y). 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to numerically {{investigate}} how the various intervals of the two-section <b>windbreak</b> <b>fences</b> will affect the flow of wind around it and set a simulation mode. In order to ensure the accuracy of the numerical simulation, this study employed 2 scaled models for wind tunnel experiments. The fences had a height (H) of 9 cm and sectionalized into 2 sections with 4. 5 cm of height. In addition, the wind tunnel experiment is to use a method of testing and verifying the differences in numerical simulation. In each test, 30 % of the <b>windbreak</b> <b>fences</b> will allow ventilation, and we have simulated the test with the Reynolds number (7. 2104), the thickness of the boundary layer (5. 33 H), and the n index of the Power Law (0. 157). After handling and analyzing the data of the test with the software, we then proved the mode is applicable by confirming and verifying the results. Moreover, seven sets of research cases were chosen to test the numerical simulation to study the impact of flow variation on windbreak effect. The conclusions of this study are: 1. 	The difference between two-section type of windbreak and the tradition vertical type depends on the shape variation. The air flow through the upper half grid will be further raised by the air flow through the lower half grid. That will consequently widen the range of low wind speed area, thus will achieve the windbreak effect. 2. 	The windbreak effect of various intervals of the two-section windbreak fence: In case of the interval of two-section type of windbreak increases, the low wind speed zone in lee side becomes longer, which will increase the protection distance and the windbreak effect near the earth surface. In this study, when the interval equals to 2 H, the protection distance reaches its maximum value, which is 1. 48 times longer than that of the single windbreak grid. As the interval decrease to H/ 3, the more the rising air flowing through the lower half grid, the less the air passing through the construction, the reflux area of down-stream is the largest with the best windbreak effect, while the protection index (P. I.) is 1. 18 times than that of the single wind-break grid. 本研究之目的係以數值方法模擬防風柵之流場，並探討兩截式防風柵之間距配置對防風功效之影響；研究中以 2 組高度為 9 公分之模型進行風洞實驗，從中間分為上下兩截，每半截高度為 4. 5 公分，透風率固定為 30 %，並在雷諾數為 7. 2 × 104 、邊界層厚度為 5. 33 H及指數律指數為 0. 157 之狀況下，對不同間距配置進行數值計算，整理並分析流場變化，經由比對與驗證後，證實數值模式之可行性，再選擇 7 組研究個案，從事數值模擬，期能瞭解流場變化對兩截式防風柵構造物防風功效之影響。茲將所得結果整理如下： 1. 	兩截式防風柵與傳統直立柵減風差異，主要受外形導流之影響，將越過上半截柵之氣流，進一步受到越過下半截柵氣流的抬升作用，使背風面低風速區的範圍增大，因而提升防風功效。 2. 	不同間距配置之防風柵構造物其防風效果：兩截式防風柵之間距加大，背風面之低風速區域愈趨扁長，對於鄰近地表處有愈佳之減風效果，其保護距離越長，本研究中當間距配置為 2 H時，有最長的保護距離，其值為單道防風柵的 1. 48 倍；在本研究中，當間距為 1 H時，經下半截防風柵抬昇之氣流愈多，而越過上半截構造物之氣流愈少，使其下游面迴流區形狀最大，防風效果最好，其保護指數(P.

30|$|Noncrop plants {{traditionally}} have been maintained in crop field landscapes for diverse agricultural and land management purposes. For example, hedgerows have been maintained as field boundaries, <b>fences,</b> <b>windbreaks,</b> and sources for various {{products such as}} wood, firewood, and food (Baudry et al. [2000]). From an ecological perspective, hedgerows help to sustain the diversity of birds (Hinsley & [Bellemy 2000]), small mammals (Kotzageorgis & [Mason 1997]), butterflies (Dover & [Sparks 2000]), and other invertebrates (Holland & [Fahrig 2000]). However, the enlargement of crop fields with the modernization of agriculture has threatened the conservation of noncrop woody plants in various agricultural landscapes (e.g., [Baltensperger 1987]; Burel & [Baudry 1990]; Petit et al. [2003]). In European countries, efforts {{have been made to}} conserve noncrop vegetation (Baudry et al. [2000]). To foster the sustainable use and effective preservation of noncrop plants, {{it is important to understand}} their abundance and compositional variation and the management practices used to maintain them. Although such aspects of British hedgerows have been well studied (Barr et al. [2005]; Barr & [Gillespie 2000]; French & [Cummins 2001]; Garbutt & [Sparks 2002]; Petit et al. [2003]), little research has been done on noncrop woody plant usage in other regions.|$|R
40|$|Inverse-dispersion {{techniques}} allow inference of a {{gas emission}} rate Q from measured air concentration. In “ideal surface layer problems, ” where Monin–Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) describes the winds transporting the gas, {{the application of the}} technique can be straightforward. This study examines the accuracy of an ideal MOST-based inference, but in a nonideal setting. From a 6 m 6 m synthetic area source surrounded by a 20 m 20 m square border of a <b>windbreak</b> <b>fence</b> (1. 25 m tall), Q is estimated. Open-path lasers gave line-averaged concentration CL at positions downwind of the source, and an ideal-ized backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLS) dispersion model was used to infer QbLS. Despite the distur-bance of the mean wind and turbulence caused by the fence, the QbLS estimates were accurate when ambient winds (measured upwind of the plot) were assumed in the bLS model. In the worst cases, with CL measured adjacent to a plot fence, QbLS overestimated Q by an average of 50 %. However, if these near-fence locations are eliminated, QbLS averaged within 2 % of the true Q over 61 fifteen-minute obser-vations (with a standard deviation Q/Q 0. 20). Poorer accuracy occurred when in-plot wind measurements were used in the bLS model. The results show that when an inverse-dispersion technique is applied to disturbed flows without accounting for the disturbance, the outcome may still be of acceptable accuracy if judgment is applied in the placement of the concentration detector. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{landscape}} {{is inseparable from}} the history and life of the Great Plains region. The idea encompasses {{the character of the}} physical environment in relation to the social, economic, and cultural changes mankind has wrought upon the land. In the past twenty-five years, and in several apparently disparate disciplines, there has been a convergence of interest in the concept of landscape as geographers, historians, art historians, literary critics, anthropologists, and folklorists have worked to produce a much broader understanding of how landscapes are imagined, represented, created, and viewed by different cultures. Geographers in particular have studied the ways in which human groups have etched their distinctive cultures upon the surface of the land. Other scholars have broadened and enriched the concept to include the ways in which images of newly settled lands are formed in the minds of people and in which landscape preferences are transplanted by culture groups from one region to another. The five essays in this issue were originally presented at the American Pioneer Landscapes symposium sponsored by the Center for Great Plains Studies, April 29 to May 1, 1981. Each treats the ways in which human 3 groups modify the landscape and stamp {{the surface of the earth}} with the marks of their culture. Our own culture, for example, will leave remains of tract housing, irrigation canals, <b>windbreaks,</b> roads, <b>fences,</b> and gravel pits as records of our technology and values. David Lowenthal, the author of the first essay, has been a major contributor to the study of cultural landscapes. An American by birth and training who teaches at University College London, Lowenthal has stressed in his earlier writings the importance of taste in the process of landscape formation. Here he suggests that pioneering was an ambivalent business. Plains pioneers are frequently portrayed as the tamers of nature, but it is far from clear that they saw themselves in that light. Moreover, society was often highly critical of those who went out to conquer the wilderness...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a simulated atmospheric boundary layer, and its application to the specific problem of windbreak aerodynamics. A review is made {{of the state of the}} art in wind tunnel simulation of atmospheric boundary layers. An investigation of the use of grids to simulate atmospheric wind velocity profiles and turbulence in a short tunnel working section, is used to justify the construction of an atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The design and construction of this wind tunnel is described. The main working section of the new facility is 4 ft x 4 ft in cross-section and 40 ft long. The stepwise development of an accelerated growth, neutrally stable, simulated rural atmospheric boundary layer of approximately 1 : 300 linear scale is described. The boundary layer is grown in a distance nine times its final depth by means of an initial coarse grid, followed by trip fences of successively decreasing height and a baseboard of uniform surface roughness. The linear scale of the model flow is larger than in most earlier simulations of the accelerated boundary layer growth type reviewed by the author. An examination of the leeward flow behind model <b>fence</b> <b>windbreaks</b> was chosen as a first application for the simulated boundary layer. The object of this work was to give a clearer picture of the leeward flow field, and quantitatively relate mean velocity and turbulent intensity behind windbreaks. Measurements of mean and fluctuating velocities and energy spectra were carried out in the lee of model shelter fences of 0 %, 20 %, 34 % and 50 % geometric permeability. Results of the tests are comparee with existing field and wind tunnel data, with due regard for the uncertainty of hot wire anemometer measurements in fence wakes. The mean velocity reduction data provide an extensive verification for Jensen’s (1958) Model Law. The 20 % permeable fence was found to give optimum mean wind reduction. The turbulence measurements have identified the regions dominated, respectively, by the bleed flow and by the displacement flow, and simple empirical equations are suggested to relate turbulent intensity and mean velocity in these two regions. Before a windbreak design manual can be compiled, further tests are required at a variety of ‘fence height’ to ‘upstream surface roughness length’ ratios. A basic format for a design manual is suggested...|$|R
