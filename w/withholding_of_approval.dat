However, the Congress of People's Deputies that emerged still contained 87 percent CPSU members. Genuine reformists won only some 300 seats.|$|R

50|$|Government {{efforts to}} {{increase}} allocations to research between 2013 and 2016 were often thwarted by the congressional austerity drive, with Congress <b>withholding</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> the federal government's budget several times.

40|$|Awareness of the morally {{significant}} {{distinction between}} research and innovative therapy reveals serious {{gaps in the}} legal provision for compensation in the UK for injured subjects of medical research. Major problems are limitations inherent in negligence actions and a culture that emphasises indemnifying researchers before compensating victims. Medical research morally requires compensation on a no-fault basis even where there is proper consent {{on the part of}} the research subject. In particular, for drug research, there is insufficient provision in the current patient guidelines of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, since they make "no legal commitment" to paying compensation for injury to patient subjects. There is a need for the provision of both adequate insurance and contractual arrangements for making payments. The solution is for Local Research Ethics Committees (LRECs) to make use of their power to <b>withhold</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> medical research where compensation is not legally enforceable...|$|R

The program's life was short, being closed in 1903 following a veto of state appropriations by New York governor Benjamin Barker Odell, Jr. in response to a conflict over the direction and management of the School's experimental forest in Franklin County, New York. In his veto message Governor Odell said: [...] "The operations of the College of Forestry have been subjected to grave criticism, as they have practically denuded the forest lands of the State without compensating benefits.

50|$|To register, {{groups also}} must report in their charter a valid legal address. In this {{reporting}} period, local officials denied <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> legal addresses {{or did not}} answer such requests, thus preventing religious groups from registering. The MOJ also cited this requirement in explaining local officials' decisions. On May 11, 2007, the Sergely district administration in Tashkent denied <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> a legal address for Tashkent's Jehovah's Witnesses congregation. Over {{the course of this}} reporting period, Jehovah's Witnesses in Samarkand, Kagan (Bukhara Province), Jizzak and Angren also requested <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> legal addresses but received no response. On August 24, 2006, the Ferghana provincial Justice Department deregistered the Jehovah's Witnesses congregation partly for failing to register a change in their legal address. The Ferghana congregation explained to the authorities that they had purchased a new house and {{were in the process of}} registering the new address when their registration was revoked. Members of the congregation were also accused of proselytizing. On June 12, 2007, the Ferghana congregation again requested <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> a legal address, but their request was denied. Some groups, such as the Tashkent International Church, were reluctant to purchase property without assurance that their registration would be approved. Others claimed that local officials arbitrarily <b>withhold</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> the addresses because they oppose the existence of Christian churches with ethnic Uzbek members.|$|R
50|$|The Venetian {{government}} {{structure was}} similar {{in some ways}} to the republican system of ancient Rome, with an elected chief executive (the Doge), a senate-like assembly of nobles, and a mass of citizens with limited political power, who originally had the power to grant or <b>withhold</b> their <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> each newly elected Doge. Church and various private properties were tied to military service, although there was no knight tenure within the city itself. The Cavalieri di San Marco was the only order of chivalry ever instituted in Venice, and no citizen could accept or join a foreign order without the government's consent. Venice remained a republic throughout its independent period, and politics and the military were kept separate, except when on occasion the Doge personally headed the military. War was regarded as a continuation of commerce by other means (hence, the city's early production of large numbers of mercenaries for service elsewhere, and later its reliance on foreign mercenaries when the ruling class was preoccupied with commerce).|$|R
50|$|Bill 115 {{was given}} its first {{reading in the}} Legislative Assembly of Ontario on August 28, 2012, and {{received}} Royal Assent on September 11, 2012. The bill {{was supported by the}} Ontario Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario and opposed by members of the NDP. The result of the vote was 82-15 in favour of the bill. The act took effect immediately after approval and school boards, teachers, and support staff continued to engage in collective bargaining until December 31, 2012. Collective bargaining is ongoing in an attempt to have the government's education partners reach agreements that respect local circumstances while remaining within limitations established in the legislation. The Putting Students First Act is intended to ensure that school contracts fit the government's financial and policy priorities, and aims to prevent labour disruptions during 2013 and 2014.

40|$|The {{publication}} of this second issue of Human–Wildlife Conflicts {{is something of}} a triumph, not only because it reflects the continued support of the journal by contributing authors, but also because it confirms the journal’s ability to survive through lean times. The Jack H. Berryman Institute is dependent on Congressionally directed federal funding passed through USDA/ APHIS/Wildlife Services, but that was disrupted by the power shift that occurred in the U. S. Congress in January. The resolution <b>of</b> Congress to <b>withhold</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> most spending bills until presentation of the fiscal 2008 budget later this year meant that the Berryman Institute’s fiscal 2007 budget did not get passed through to us. That crisis forced our 2 units (BI-West at Utah State University and BI-East at Mississippi State University) to effectively shut down until an interim plan could be made. Thankfully, we have strongly supportive colleagues in Wildlife Services who “passed around the hat” within their own agency and whittled from their own budgets to provide us with the baseline funding we need for the bare essentials, such as the {{publication of}} this issue. Our deep appreciation goes to Bill Clay and everyone else in Wildlife Services for their impressive display of support for the Jack H. Berryman Institute...|$|R

5000|$|In 1980, Congress finally {{conformed}} U.S. {{statutory law}} to the U.N. protocol. But these modifications did not clarify how great a possibiltiy of persecution must exist before the alien can qualify for <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> removal. The statute spoke <b>of</b> <b>withholding</b> if the alien's life [...] "would" [...] be threatened, {{not if it}} [...] "might" [...] or [...] "could" [...] be threatened. Other statutes dealing with the discretionary grant of asylum referred to the well-founded-fear standard; the statutes dealing with <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> deportation, by contrast, did not. The Court thus {{concluded that there was}} some higher standard required for the alien to receive the mandatory relief <b>of</b> <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> removal. The Court assumed, arguendo, that the standard for discretionary relief was lower than that for mandatory relief, and thus held that [...] "an application <b>withholding</b> <b>of</b> deportation be supported by evidence establishing that it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution on one of the specified grounds".|$|R
