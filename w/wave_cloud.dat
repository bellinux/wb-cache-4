2500|$|Several new {{supplementary}} features have been formally {{recognized by the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The feature fluctus can form under conditions of strong atmospheric wind shear and instability when wave-like clouds of the variety undulatus break into regularly spaced crests. This variant is sometimes known informally as a Kelvin–Helmholtz (<b>wave)</b> <b>cloud.</b> [...] This phenomenon has also been observed in cloud formations over other planets {{and even in the}} sun's atmosphere. [...] Another highly disturbed but more chaotic wave-like cloud feature associated with the undulatus variety has been given the Latin name asperitus. [...] The supplementary feature cavum is a circular fall-streak hole that occasionally forms in a thin layer of supercooled altocumulus or cirrocumulus. [...] Fall streaks consisting of virga or wisps of cirrus are usually seen beneath the hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude. [...] This type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes. A murus feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering, rotating cloud base than can lead to the development of tornadoes. A cauda feature is a tail cloud that extends horizontally away from the murus cloud and is the result of air feeding into the storm.|$|E

50|$|In {{an ideal}} model, a <b>wave</b> <b>cloud</b> {{consists}} of {{supercooled liquid water}} at the lower part, a mixed phase of frozen and liquid water near the ridge, and ice beginning slightly below the ridge and extending downstream. However, this doesn't always occur. <b>Wave</b> <b>cloud</b> structure ranges from smooth and simple, to jumbled phases occurring randomly. Often, ice crystals can be found downwind of the waves. Whether this happens depends on the saturation of the air. The composition of the ice is currently an active topic of study. The main mechanism for ice formation is homogeneous nucleation. The ice crystals are mostly small spheroidal and irregular-shaped particles. Ice columns make up less than 1%, and plates are virtually nonexistent.Multi-level mountain wave clouds form when the moisture {{in the air above}} the mountain is located in distinct layers, and vertical mixing is inhibited.|$|E

40|$|The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) {{detected}} clouds {{associated with}} topographic features during the polar night on Mars. While uplift generated from flow over mountains initiates clouds on both Earth and Mars, {{we suggest that}} the Martian clouds differ greatly from terrestrial mountain <b>wave</b> <b>clouds.</b> Terrestrial <b>wave</b> <b>clouds</b> are generally compact features with sharp edges due to the relatively small particles in them. However, {{we find that the}} large mass of condensible carbon dioxide on Mars leads to clouds with snow tails that may extend many kilometers down wind from the mountain and even reach the surface. Both the observations and the simulations suggest substantial carbon dioxide snow precipitation in association with the underlying topography. This precipitation deposits CO 2, dust and water ice to the polar caps, and may lead to propagating geologic features in the Martian polar regions...|$|R
50|$|The {{atmospheric}} internal {{waves that}} form <b>wave</b> <b>clouds</b> are created as stable air flows over a raised land feature {{such as a}} mountain range, and can form either directly above or {{in the lee of}} the feature. As an air mass travels through the wave, it undergoes repeated uplift and descent. If there is enough moisture in the atmosphere, clouds will form at the cooled crests of these waves. In the descending part of the <b>wave,</b> those <b>clouds</b> will evaporate due to adiabatic heating, leading to the characteristic clouded and clear bands. The cloud base on the leeward side is higher than on the windward side, because precipitation on the windward side removes water from the air.|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} for an empirical parameterization (EP) of heterogeneous nucleation of ice crystals by multiple species of aerosol material in clouds was proposed in a 2008 paper by the authors. The present paper reports improvements to specification {{of a few}} of its empirical parameters. These include temperatures for onset of freezing, baseline surface areas of aerosol observed in field campaigns over Colorado, and new parameters for properties of black carbon, such as surface hydrophilicity and organic coatings. The EP's third group of ice nucleus (IN) aerosols is redefined as that of primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs), replacing insoluble organic aerosols. A fourth group of IN is introduced-namely, soluble organic aerosols. The new EP predicts IN concentrations that agree well with aircraft data from selected traverses of shallow <b>wave</b> <b>clouds</b> observed in five flights (1, 3, 4, 6, and 12) of the 2007 Ice in Clouds Experiment Layer Clouds (ICE-L).

The EP predicts a trend between number concentrations of heterogeneously nucleated ice crystals and apparent black carbon among the five <b>wave</b> <b>clouds,</b> observed by aircraft in ICE-L. It is predicted in terms of IN activity of black carbon. The EP's predictions are consistent with laboratory and field observations not used in its construction, for black carbon, dust, primary biological aerosols, and soluble organics.

40|$|Anthropogenicgreenhouse gases {{have become}} widely {{accepted}} {{as the primary}} cause of global warming. With increasing emissions rates, warming is set to continue and baring any drastic change in mitigation policies, the rate of warming is also likely to continue to increase. According to the IPCC, the increase in radiative forcing associated with a doubling of pre-industrial CO 2 concentrations is estimated to be 3. 7 Wm- 2. One method suggested to ameliorate the warming is to increase the eﬀects of short <b>wave</b> <b>cloud</b> forcing (SWCF) via geo-engineering and thus restoring the earth’s radiative equilibrium. The short <b>wave</b> <b>cloud</b> forcing has a cooling eﬀect by reﬂecting solar radiation back into space. Twomey [1977] suggested that by increasing the cloud condensation nuclei in thin to moderately thick clouds the optical depth, and thus the albedo of the cloud would increase. In this study an earth system model is used to explore the eﬀects of deliberately increasing the cloud droplet number concentrations in low level marine clouds. The eﬀects of such increase on the short <b>wave</b> <b>cloud</b> forcing are examined {{as well as on the}} eﬀective radius of cloud droplets. Three diﬀerent geo-engineering cases are presented and compared to a control simulation. The results show that adding CDNC in marine clouds have the desired impact on SWCF. Eﬀects are increasing with with rising CDNC. For a perturbation of 375 the changes in SWCF are large enough to counteract the increase in radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. The lower CDNC perturbation of 50 cm 3 also produce a moderate cooling eﬀect, without completely counteracting the predicted greenhouse gas radiative forcing...|$|E
