25|$|A {{different}} arrangement {{from the}} traditional Sam Browne belt consists of a similar <b>wide</b> <b>belt</b> with two vertical supporting straps, one over each shoulder. The design put {{the burden of the}} gear, with its heavy ammo pouches on the belt and straps, on both shoulders.|$|E
50|$|Oh Dahn - 5th degree - Pyuhng Kwahn Jahng Nim {Master}. Masters are {{presented}} with a wider than normal white belt {{which is similar to}} the extra <b>wide</b> black <b>belt</b> worn by other high ranks, albeit white instead of black to symbolize a new beginning. It is forbidden to wear this extra <b>wide</b> white <b>belt</b> unless all those in the particular training session are of black belt rank, otherwise the extra <b>wide</b> black <b>belt</b> is to be worn instead.|$|R
25|$|Athletic {{accessories}} were {{a massive}} {{trend in the}} early 1980s, and their popularity was largely boosted by the aerobics craze. This included leg warmers, <b>wide</b> <b>belts,</b> elastic headbands, and athletic shoes known as 'sneakers' in the US or 'trainers' in the UK.|$|R

25|$|The park holds {{a remnant}} of the Nigerian lowland forests that once formed a {{continuous}} 50–100km <b>wide</b> <b>belt</b> from the Niger River west to the Dahomey Gap in Benin. To the south and southeast the forest was separated from the coast by mangrove and swamp forests, while to the north it merged into the Guinean Forest-Savanna Mosaic ecoregion. Human pressure is not new. In the Okomu park there is an extensive layer of charcoal and pottery below the forest, indicating that it was cleared and then regenerated over the last 700 years. By {{the start of the}} 20th century the forest survived only in disconnected blocks, which were under intense pressure from human activity. The British colonial administration set up a series of forest reserves to manage what remained, including controlled extraction of valuable trees such as African mahogany.|$|E
500|$|Besides these items, the retiarius wore only a loincloth (subligaculum) held {{in place}} by a <b>wide</b> <b>belt</b> and gaiters or, as images show in lieu of the loincloth, a tunic that left the right {{shoulder}} uncovered. He wore fabric padding on his body to provide minimal additional protection. Artistic depictions show that other options included legbands, anklebands, a headband, and a medallion. All told, the retiariuss equipment weighed 7 to [...] to 17.6lb), making him the lightest of the standard gladiator types. Like other arena combatants, the retiarius fought barefoot.|$|E

50|$|Carpenter jeans {{are usually}} made of blue denim; however, canvas {{may be the}} {{material}} in more durable styles, and colours may vary; white and beige are other popular colours. A 'hammer loop' is usually located on the left leg; although this was originally designed to be useful, most carpenters do not use the loop, because the hammer often falls out or bangs around the leg. Other features include extra pockets, sometimes located on the outer thighs, and extra rivets for durability. Another feature is <b>wider</b> <b>belt</b> loops, to accommodate a <b>wider,</b> thicker <b>belt.</b> Because {{of the weight of}} the tools carried in the pockets and loops, a tightly cinched, wide 'work belt' must be worn by most men.|$|R
40|$|The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (MINER ACT) {{established}} a Technical Study Panel (The Panel) to provide recommendations on {{the utilization of}} belt air and new technology that may be available for increasing the fire resistance properties of conveyor belt used in underground coal mines. The Panel Report recommended use of the Belt Evaluation Laboratory Test (BELT) as the method for testing and approval of flame resistant conveyor belts used in underground coal mines. The research conducted to establish the correlation of the BELT with large-scale belt fire flammability tests was done using 36 - to 42 -in <b>wide</b> conveyor <b>belt.</b> Due to today 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s coal haulage capacity, the mining industry is using 72 -in and <b>wider</b> conveyor <b>belts.</b> The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a study {{to determine if the}} BELT will also qualify <b>wider</b> <b>belts</b> as fire resistant for use in underground coal mines.

500|$|A retiarius (plural retiarii; literally, [...] "net-man" [...] or [...] "net-fighter" [...] in Latin) was a Roman gladiator {{who fought}} with {{equipment}} styled on {{that of a}} fisherman: a weighted net (rete, hence the name), a three-pointed trident (fuscina or tridens), and a dagger (pugio). The retiarius was lightly armoured, wearing an arm guard (manica) and a shoulder guard (galerus). Typically, his clothing consisted only of a loincloth (subligaculum) {{held in place by}} a <b>wide</b> <b>belt,</b> or of a short tunic with light padding. He wore no head protection or footwear.|$|E

500|$|The {{expression}} [...] "asteroid belt" [...] {{came into}} {{use in the}} very early 1850s, although it is hard to pinpoint who coined the term. The first English use seems to be in the 1850 translation (by E. C. Otté) of Alexander von Humboldt's Cosmos: [...] " [...] and the regular appearance, about the 13th of November and the 11th of August, of shooting stars, which probably form part of a belt of asteroids intersecting the Earth's orbit and moving with planetary velocity". Another early appearance occurred in Robert James Mann's A Guide to the Knowledge of the Heavens: [...] "The orbits of the asteroids are placed in a <b>wide</b> <b>belt</b> of space, extending between the extremes of [...] ". The American astronomer Benjamin Peirce seems to have adopted that terminology and to have been one of its promoters.|$|E

[...] They have tight <b>wide</b> <b>belts,</b> and their skirts have a flared and differently coloured element, probably designed to rise up as they spin in dances. A remark of Anna Komnene about her mother suggests that not showing the arm above the wrist was a special focus of Byzantine modesty.|$|R
60|$|Don Arturo sat opposite. He was {{strongly}} built and getting fat. Although {{his hair and}} eyes were very black, he was essentially British. He had known poverty, but now controlled large commercial undertakings and steamship lines. Don Arturo was loved and hated. Some found him strangely generous, and some thought him hard and careless about the tools he used and broke. He made bold plans, and had opened <b>wide</b> <b>belts</b> in Africa to British trade.|$|R
500|$|When Parliament {{convened in}} 1877, the Conservatives were {{confident}} and the Liberals defensive. After the Tories {{had a successful}} session {{in the early part}} of the year, another series of picnics commenced in a <b>wide</b> <b>belt</b> around Toronto. Macdonald even campaigned in Quebec, which he had rarely done, leaving speechmaking there to Cartier. More picnics followed in 1878, promoting proposals which would come to be collectively called the [...] "National Policy": high tariffs, rapid construction of the transcontinental railway (the Canadian Pacific Railway or CPR), rapid agricultural development of the West using the railroad, and policies which would attract immigrants to Canada. These picnics allowed Macdonald venues to show off his talents at campaigning, and were often lighthearted—at one, the Tory leader blamed agricultural pests on the Grits, and promised the insects would go away if the Conservatives were elected.|$|E
500|$|By 2006, astronomers had {{resolved}} dust discs {{thought to}} be Kuiper belt-like structures around nine stars other than the Sun. They appear to fall into two categories: wide belts, with radii of over 50 AU, and narrow belts (tentatively {{like that of the}} Solar System) with radii of between 20 and 30 AU and relatively sharp boundaries. Beyond this, 15–20% of solar-type stars have an observed infrared excess that is suggestive of massive Kuiper-belt-like structures. Most known debris discs around other stars are fairly young, but the two images on the right, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in January 2006, are old enough (roughly 300 million years) to have settled into stable configurations. The left image is a [...] "top view" [...] of a <b>wide</b> <b>belt,</b> and the right image is an [...] "edge view" [...] of a narrow belt. Computer simulations of dust in the Kuiper belt suggest that when it was younger, it may have resembled the narrow rings seen around younger stars.|$|E
500|$|The largest {{fault is}} the Vermilion fault {{separating}} the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces. It has a N40°E trend and {{was caused by}} the introduction of masses of magma. The Vermilion fault can be traced westward to North Dakota. It has had a [...] horizontal movement with the northern block moving eastward and upward relative to the southern block. [...] The junction between the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces has a zone of biotite-rich migmatite, a rock that has characteristics of both igneous and metamorphic processes; this indicates a zone of partial melting which is possible only under high temperature and pressure conditions. It is visible as a [...] <b>wide</b> <b>belt.</b> Most of the flattened large crystals in the fault indicate a simple compression rather than a wrenching, shearing or rotational event as the two subprovinces docked. This provides evidence that the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces were joined by the collision of two continental plates, about [...] Structures in the migmatite include folds and foliations; the foliations cut across both limbs of earlier-phase folds. These cross-cutting foliations indicate that the migmatite has undergone at least two periods of ductile deformation.|$|E

500|$|The Norwegian Bratvaag Expedition, {{studying}} the glaciers and seas of the Svalbard archipelago from the Norwegian sealing vessel Bratvaag of Ålesund, found {{the remains of}} the Andrée expedition on August 5, 1930. [...] Kvitøya was usually inaccessible to the sealing or whaling ships of the time, as it is typically surrounded by a <b>wide</b> <b>belt</b> of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs. However, summer in 1930 had been particularly warm, and the surrounding sea was practically free of ice. As Kvitøya was known to be a prime hunting ground for walrus and the fogs over the island on that day were comparatively thin, some of the crew of the Bratvaag took this rare opportunity to land on what they called the [...] "inaccessible island". Two of the sealers in search of water, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvick, discovered Andrée's boat near a small stream, frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment, including a boathook engraved with the words [...] "Andrée's Polar Expedition, 1896". Presented with this hook, the Bratvaags captain, Peder Eliassen, assigned the crew to search the site together with the expedition members. Among other finds, they uncovered a journal and two skeletons, identified as Andrée's and Strindberg's remains by monograms found on their clothing.|$|E
