5|$|Perot's {{performance}} {{satisfied the}} 5% popular vote threshold for third party candidates, classifying it as successful under the criterion established by scholar Walter Dean Burnham. The legitimacy of this {{success has been}} questioned by scholars who dismiss the label of Perot as a typical third party candidate, {{largely due to the}} availability of campaign funds and financing of grassroots efforts. Others dispute these claims and point out that Perot forced the other candidates to change their rhetoric on the issues to gain the votes of his supporters, indicating an issues campaign. Exit polls revealed that 35% of voters <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for Perot if they believed he could win. Contemporary analysis reveals that Perot could have won the election if the polls prior to the election had shown the candidate with a larger share, preventing the wasted vote mindset.|$|E
25|$|In February 2005, the We Youth Movement, {{a member}} of The Other Russia coalition, started a {{campaign}} to promote Konni for President. It was {{the opinion of the}} group that no matter who won the 2008 Russian Presidential election the operating Head of State would remain the same, and hence Konni would make the best candidate. Georgy Satarov, a key member of The Other Russia, believed that if Putin were to have endorsed Konni as his successor, then 40% of the electorate <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for the Labrador, given that 40% of the people <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for whomever Putin endorsed for the election.|$|E

25|$|Whether {{or not the}} {{election}} meddling of the NIS by way of online posts has actually affected {{the outcome of the}} presidential election is controversial. However, the false announcement by Kim Yong-pan, then chief of the SMPA, has appeared to do so. Had the police announced honestly, 14% of the electorate who voted for Park said they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for Moon Jae-In, the first runner-up of {{the election}}.|$|E
25|$|The {{elections}} for the 47 seats of the National Assembly were planned {{to be held in}} two rounds: In the first round, voters <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for a party. The two parties with the largest share of the national vote would then have been able to field candidates in the 47 constituencies. However, as only two parties successfully registered for the election, the election was held in one round.|$|E

25|$|On December 18, 1860, the Crittenden Compromise was {{proposed}} to re-establish the Missouri Compromise line by constitutionally banning slavery in territories {{to the north}} of the line while guaranteeing it to the south. The adoption of this compromise likely would have prevented the secession of every southern state apart from South Carolina, but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected it. It was then proposed to hold a national referendum on the compromise. The Republicans again rejected the idea, although a majority of both Northerners and Southerners <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> in favor of it. A pre-war February Peace Conference of 1861 met in Washington, proposing a solution similar to that of the Crittenden compromise, it was rejected by Congress. The Republicans proposed an alternative compromise to not interfere with slavery where it existed but the South regarded it as insufficient. Nonetheless, the remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy following a two-to-one no-vote in Virginia's First Secessionist Convention on April 4, 1861.|$|E
500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a positionâ€”on balance, I probably <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Voted</b> for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1928, National League ball clubs {{proposed}} an innovation whereby each team's pitcher, usually the weakest hitter in the lineup, would not bat, but be replaced {{for the purposes}} of batting and base-running by a tenth player.

500|$|In September 2013 Modi {{was named}} the BJP's {{candidate}} for prime minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modi's candidature, including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were [...] "concerned with their personal agendas". Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's election campaign. Several {{people who voted for}} the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for another party.

500|$|Historian R. Hal Williams, in {{his book}} about the 1896 campaign, {{believes}} that the Populist nomination did Bryan little good; most Populists <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for him anyway and the endorsement allowed his opponents to paint him and his supporters as extremists. [...] The vice presidential squabble, Williams argues, worried voters who feared that instability would follow a Bryan victory, and drove them towards McKinley. Populist leader Henry Demarest Lloyd described silver as the [...] "cow-bird" [...] of the Populist Party, which had pushed aside all other issues. The National Silver Party, mostly former Republicans, met {{at the same time}} as the Populists; both conventions were in St. Louis.

He later released a statement declaring that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for the Act and stated [...] "unequivocally... that I will not support any efforts to repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964".
