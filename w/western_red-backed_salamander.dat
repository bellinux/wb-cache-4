40|$|Graduation date: 1997 I {{examined}} the abundance and habitat associations of terrestrial amphibian species and the species richness of terrestrial amphibian communities in riparian buffer strips, clearcuts, and unmanaged riparian forests. The {{study was conducted}} in the western hemlock (Tsuga heteropliylla) vegetation zone of the northern and central Oregon Coast Range. Data were collected on amphibians, vegetation characteristics, and topography at 29 study sites. The abundance of torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton spp.), ensatinas (Ensatina eschscholtzii), <b>western</b> <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Plethodon vehiculum), and Dunn's salamander (Plethodon dunni) was greater in unmanaged forests than in recently harvested clearcuts, but the abundance of each species was similar between unmanaged forests and buffer strips. Amphibian species richness was positively correlated with buffer strip width, however even wide buffers (> 40 m) had fewer species than unmanaged forests. The abundance of each amphibian species was only weakly associated (R 2 < 0. 42) with habitat characteristics that I measured or estimated. I hypothesize that buffer strips 30 - 40 m should adequately protect most amphibian species closely associated with stream-side habitats from effects of timber harvest. Amphibian species that are associated with upslope habitats (e. g., ensatinas) may not benefit from buffer strips...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Thinning has the {{potential}} to increase structural diversity of managed forests for wildlife. During 1994 - 1996, I conducted experimental and observational studies using pitfall trapping to assess short-term and potential long-term effects of thinning on abundance and reproduction of forest-floor vertebrates in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menzeisii) forests of the Oregon Coast Range. Thinning had posititive effects on relative abundances of creeping voles (Microtus oregoni) and Pacific jumping mice (Zapus trinotatus) in both the short term and the long term. In contrast, relative abundance of <b>western</b> <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Plethodon vehiculum) was lower in stands thinned 7 - 24 years previously than unthinned stands, suggesting potential negative effects of thinning in the long term. Relative abundance of <b>western</b> <b>red-backed</b> voles (Clethrionomys calfornicus) decreased within 2 years of thinning but was similar in stands thinned 7 - 24 years previously and unthinned stands. However, reproductive performance of <b>western</b> <b>red-backed</b> voles was higher in thinned than unthinned stands, suggesting potential positive effects of thinning on reproduction of the voles in the long term. In 1994, I investigated the influences of ecological gradients on habitat associations of forest-floor vertebrates at microsite and stand scales in 12 Douglas-fir stands in the stem exclusion stage. I examined various gradients of microclimate, stand structure, plant community composition, and downed wood. Among the ecological gradients I examined, the highest number of species was influenced by red alder/herb conifer/shrub gradient of community composition at both the microsite and stand scales. At the microsite scale, 7 species were associated with red alder/herb communities whereas only 2 species were associated with conifer/shrub communities. Red-alder patches with herb understory, therefore, have a potential role in maintaining biodiversity of forest-floor vertebrate communities in young Douglas-fir dominated stands. Furthermore, I found that habitat associations of 4 shrew species were generally consistent between the microsite and stand scales, whereas those of 3 rodent species were inconsistent between the 2 spatial scales. I hypothesized that this rodent-shrew dichotomy in habitat association occurring at the 2 spatial scales is a result of differences in their ability to explore habitats at multiple spatial scales...|$|R

40|$|While {{many studies}} have {{examined}} the barrier effects of large rivers on animal dispersal and gene flow, few studies have considered the barrier effects of small streams. We used displacement experiments and analyses of genetic population structure {{to examine the effects of}} first-order and second-order streams on the dispersal of terrestrial <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders,</b> Plethodon cinereus (Green, 1818). We marked <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> from near the edges of one first-order stream and one second-order stream, and experimentally displaced them either across the stream or an equal distance farther into the forest. A comparison of return rates indicated that both streams were partial barriers to salamander movement, reducing return rates by approximately 50 %. Analysis of six microsatellite loci from paired plots on the same side and on opposite sides of the second-order stream suggested that the stream did contribute to genetic differentiation of salamander populations. Collectively, our results imply that low-order streams do influence patterns of movement and gene flow in <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders.</b> We suggest that given the high density of first-order and second-order streams in most landscapes, these features may have important effects on species that, like <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders,</b> have limited dispersal and large geographic ranges...|$|R

The red-backed phase is not always red, but may actually be various other colors (e.g., yellow-backed, orange-backed, white-backed, or a rare erythristic morph in which the body is completely red).

Predators can affect ecosystem functions through a combination of top-down trophic cascades and bottom-up effects on nutrient dynamics. As the most abundant vertebrate predator in many eastern US forests, woodland salamanders (Plethodon spp.) likely affect ecosystems functions. We examined the effects of <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Plethodon cinereus) on a variety of forest ecosystem functions using a combined approach of large-scale salamander removals (314 -m 2 plots) and small-scale enclosures (2 m 2) where we explicitly manipulated salamander density (0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4 m 22). In these experiments, we measured the rates of litter and wood decomposition, potential nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates, acorn germination, and foliar insect damage on red oak seedlings. Across both experimental venues, we found no significant effect of <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> on any of the ecosystem functions. We also found no effect of salamanders on intraguild predator abundance (carabid beetles, centipedes, spiders). Our study adds to the already conflicting evidence on effects of <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander</b> and other amphibians on terrestrial ecosystem functions. It appears likely that the impact of terrestrial amphibians on ecosystem functions is context dependent.

40|$|Managing for stand {{structural}} {{complexity in}} northern hardwood forests {{has been proposed}} as a method for promoting microhabitat characteristics important to eastern <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Plethodon cinereus). We evaluated the effects of alternate, structure-based silvicultural systems on <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander</b> populations at two research sites in northwestern Vermont. Treatments included two uneven-aged approaches (single-tree selection and group-selection) and one unconventional approach, termed ‘‘structural complexity enhancement’’ (SCE), that promotes development of late-successional structure, including elevated levels of coarse woody debris (CWD). Treatments were applied to 2 ha units and were replicated two to four times depending on treatment. We surveyed <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> with a natural cover search method of transects nested within vegetation plots 1 year after logging. Abundance estimates corrected for detection probability were calculated from survey data with a binomial mixture model. Abundance estimates differed between study areas and were influenced by forest structural characteristics.

We found no difference in abundance {{as a response to}} treatment as a whole, suggesting that all of the uneven-aged silvicultural systems evaluated can maintain salamander populations after harvest. However, abundance was tied to specific structural habitat attributes associated with study plots within treatments. The most parsimonious model of habitat covariates included site, relative density of overstory trees, and density of more-decayed and less-decayed downed CWD. Abundance responded positively to the density of downed, well-decayed CWD and negatively to the density of poorly decayed CWD and to overstory relative density.

In areas of this species’ range where the Eastern <b>Red-backed</b> <b>salamander</b> Plethodon cinereus, a potential competitor, is absent, surface-active salamander density was hypothesised to decrease at lower elevations due to increased temperatures and lower humidities, which may adversely affect salamander reproductive output and survival rates.

50|$|It is {{relatively}} uncommon to find monogamous relationships in fish, amphibians and reptiles; however, the <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander</b> {{as well as}} the Caribbean cleaner goby practice monogamy as well. However, the male Caribbean cleaner goby fish has been found to separate from the female suddenly, leaving her abandoned. In a study conducted by Oregon State University, it was found that this fish practices not true monogamy, but serial monogamy. This essentially means that the goby will have multiple monogamous relationships throughout its life - but only be in one relationship at a time. The <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamander</b> exhibited signs of social monogamy, which is the idea that animals form pairs to mate and raise offspring, but still will partake in extra pair copulation with various males or females in order to increase their biological fitness. This is a relatively new concept in salamanders, and has not been seen frequently - it is also concerning that the act of monogamy may inhibit the salamanders reproductive rates and biological success. However, the study which was conducted in cooperation by the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, and the University of Virginia showed that the salamanders are not inhibited by this monogamy if they show alternative strategies with other mates.|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial {{salamanders}} {{are major}} components of ecosystems in eastern North America. One species, the <b>Red-backed</b> <b>Salamander</b> (Plethodon cinereus), {{may be the}} most abundant vertebrate throughout its range. <b>Red-backed</b> <b>Salamanders</b> are commonly monitored as indicators of ecosystem health and to assess the effects of forest management practices. In order to address poorly understood aspects of the ecology of <b>Red-backed</b> <b>Salamanders,</b> I conducted a 4 -y mark-recapture study of a population in Maryland, resulting in 2, 745 records of 752 marked salamanders, along with a complementary genetic analysis of six microsatellite loci. I estimated growth rates and age at sexual maturity using a hierarchical Bayesian model fitted by mark-recapture measurements, then measured home range size and seasonal and annual movement distances by immatures and adults, before and after the experimental removal of 98 conspecifics. Males grow and mature more slowly than females, despite reaching slightly larger asymptotic sizes; they may also face greater competition for space: adult males occupy the largest home ranges and show the largest increase in home range size after the removal of conspecifics. The largest between-year movements were made by individuals as they transitioned from immaturity to maturity. Using mark-recapture population models, I found that estimates of survival, detection, and abundance varied temporally along with the age and sex of the individuals present, both within and among seasons. Encounter probability varied among weekly sampling occasions, and models with separate parameters for each sex were strongly preferred. Survival was approximately the same over winters and summers, and lower for males than for females; this may be an artifact of sex-biased dispersal, as the majority of encountered immature individuals were estimated to be males, with models indicating a pulse of emigration in the fall and an influx of immature males onto the study site in the spring. An FST randomization test of multilocus genotypes showed a significant male bias in dispersal. Of salamanders captured repeatedly as both immatures and adults, males moved significantly farther before maturity than females did.
