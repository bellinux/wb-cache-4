40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{proximate}} and phytochemical {{composition of}} Sansevieria liberica Gérôme and Labroy leaves was investigated. The proximate composition includes moisture (56. 10 %), crude fibre (5. 88 % wet <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> 13. 39 % dry weight), total carbohydrate (4. 09 % wet <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> 9. 32 % dry weight), crude protein (21. 88 % wet <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> 49. 84 % dry weight), total ash (2. 95 % wet <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> 6. 72 % dry weight), crude lipid (0. 10 % wet <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> 0. 23 % dry <b>weight)</b> <b>and</b> caloric value (104. 78 % wet <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> 238. 68 % dry weight). The phytochemical screening revealed {{the presence of}} alkaloids, carotenoids, flavonoids (catechins and flavones), phytates, saponins and tannins; with 0. 72 % wet <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> 1. 64 % dry weight carotenoids, 2. 20 % wet <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> 5. 01 % dry weight phytates, 0. 40 % wet <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> 0. 91 % dry <b>weight</b> saponins, <b>and</b> 0. 01 % wet <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> 0. 02 % dry weight tannins.

After the International Prototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproductions, the International Committee for <b>Weights</b> <b>and</b> Measures (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting, the CGPM agreed in principle that the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant. The decision was originally deferred until 2014; in 2014 it was deferred again until the next meeting. There are currently several different proposals for the redefinition (some of which have been abandoned); these are described in the Proposed Future Definitions section below.|$|E
