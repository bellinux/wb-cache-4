5000|$|Zajonc, {{along with}} Greg Markus, {{developed}} the Confluence Model (1975), which provided {{a mathematical model}} {{of the effect of}} birth order and family size on IQ scores.

As families increase in size, the overall IQ of the family drops; children from larger families do have slightly lower IQs. The last child in the family is denied the opportunity to tutor younger children, and there is a slight [...] "extra" [...] detriment for being the youngest child in a family. These effects are theoretically important, but the size of the effects is fairly small (amounting to a range of about 3 IQ points) ...|$|R
