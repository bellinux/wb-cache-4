40|$|AbstractFor a {{membrane}} structure, <b>wrinkles</b> have {{an important}} effect on its mechanical behaviors. <b>Wrinkling</b> level characterizes the development of <b>wrinkles</b> and reflects {{the performance of a}} membrane in its service, and it plays a very significant role in the <b>wrinkling</b> analysis. The shell elements combined with the stability theory would be an ideal solution to the <b>wrinkling</b> problem. However, this approach requires a dense mesh and the computation is very time consuming. Also the <b>wrinkling</b> parameters are very sensitive to the size of shell elements. Existing <b>wrinkling</b> models based on membrane elements are derived from the Tension Field Theory which are incapable of describing fully the <b>wrinkling</b> behaviors. A new <b>wrinkling</b> model adopting the <b>wrinkling</b> strain as a measure of the <b>wrinkling</b> level is proposed in this paper to address these issues. According to the analogy between the <b>wrinkling</b> strain and the elasto-plastic strain, a <b>wrinkling</b> potential surface is assumed to exist and its normal direction defines the direction of the <b>wrinkling</b> strain tensor by virtue of the flow rule. Based on the consistent condition of the <b>wrinkling</b> potential surface, a modified constitutive tensor is obtained. To avoid the switching of the <b>wrinkling</b> state in the numerical solution, a new <b>wrinkling</b> criterion is proposed, in which the predominant influence of the previous state is included. Besides, a new approach to determine the <b>wrinkling</b> orientation is given to improve the efficiency of convergence in the slack region. The objectivity of the <b>wrinkling</b> coordinate frame is also demonstrated as an accompanying set of results. Finally, two benchmark problems are analyzed with the proposed <b>wrinkling</b> model, and their results are compared with those in the literatures. Results indicate that the proposed <b>wrinkling</b> model is valid and accurate to characterize the <b>wrinkling</b> level of a membrane and it exhibits efficient convergence even in the slack region...|$|R
40|$|Skin {{microrelief}} alters progressively with age. <b>Wrinkles</b> do {{not result}} from these changes but are superimposed upon them. <b>Wrinkles</b> result from structural {{changes in the}} epidermis, dermis and hypodermis. Four types of <b>wrinkles</b> can be recognized. Type 1 <b>wrinkles</b> are atrophic. Type 2 <b>wrinkles</b> are elastotic. Type 3 <b>wrinkles</b> are expressional. Type 4 <b>wrinkles</b> are gravitational. Each type of <b>wrinkle</b> is characterized by distinct microanatomical changes and each type of <b>wrinkle</b> develops in specific skin regions. Each is likely to respond differently to treatment. Skin microrelief and skin folds can be identified on histological examination. By contrast, only minimal dermal changes are found beneath permanent or reducible <b>wrinkles</b> compared with immediately adjacent skin.

40|$|A {{buckling}} {{solution and}} a non-linear post buckling solution were employed for the <b>wrinkling</b> {{analysis of a}} tensioned Kapton square membrane.

40|$|AbstractInner flange {{and side}} <b>wrinkling</b> often occur in rotary-draw bending process of {{rectangular}} aluminum alloy wave-guide tubes, {{and the distribution}} and magnitude of <b>wrinkling</b> is related to geometrical parameters of the tubes. In order to {{study the effects of}} geometrical parameters on <b>wrinkling</b> of rectangular wave-guide tubes, a 3 D-FE model for rotary-draw bending processes of thin-walled rectangular aluminum alloy wave-guide tubes was built based on the platform of ABAQUS/Explicit, and its reliability was validated by experiments. Simulation and analysis of the influence laws of geometrical parameters on the wave heights of inner flange and side <b>wrinkling</b> were then carried out. The results show that inner flange <b>wrinkling</b> is the main <b>wrinkling</b> way to rectangular wave-guide tubes in rotary-draw bending processes, but side <b>wrinkling</b> cannot be neglected because side <b>wrinkling</b> is 2 / 3 of inner flange <b>wrinkling</b> when b and h are smaller. Inner flange and side <b>wrinkling</b> increase with increasing b and h; the influence of b on side <b>wrinkling</b> is larger than that of h, while both b and h affect inner flange <b>wrinkling</b> greatly.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} <b>wrinkle</b> {{behavior in}} both flat and cylindrical membranes undergoing shear displacement. The {{goal is to}} establish a relationship between the <b>wrinkle</b> behavior in the two types of membranes and understand how different geometric properties affect the behavior. The analysis is an equilibrium path-tracking analysis using the finite-element method. By applying cyclic boundary conditions to a flat membrane, a degree of similarity in the <b>wrinkle</b> behavior can be established between flat and cylindrical membranes. In both membranes, the initial <b>wrinkles</b> cover the entire membrane. These <b>wrinkles</b> are followed by smaller, localized <b>wrinkles,</b> referred to as collapsed sections. These collapsed sections form on existing <b>wrinkles.</b> The generation of new <b>wrinkles,</b> by splitting the existing <b>wrinkles,</b> is controlled by collapsed sections and is the same in both types of membranes. For the cylindrical membrane, the curved shape results in a more controlled <b>wrinkle</b> behavior. This is represented by fewer bifurcation points that require larger values of shear to occur. Second, the collapsed section frequency and position are fixed with respect to the <b>wrinkle</b> frequency and position. The cause of simplified and controlled <b>wrinkle</b> behavior is analyzed, and the control mechanism is explained...|$|R

5|$|Banksia serrata, {{commonly}} known as old man banksia, saw banksia, saw-tooth banksia and red honeysuckle, is a species of woody shrub or tree of the genus Banksia in the family Proteaceae. Native to {{the east coast of}} Australia, it is found from Queensland to Victoria with outlying populations on Tasmania and Flinders Island. Commonly growing as a gnarled tree up to 16m (50ft) in height, it can be much smaller in more exposed areas. This Banksia species has <b>wrinkled</b> grey bark, shiny dark green serrated leaves and large yellow or greyish-yellow flower spikes appearing over summer. The flower spikes, or inflorescences, turn grey as they age and pollinated flowers develop into large, grey, woody seed pods called follicles.|$|E
5|$|Based on Z. tonsora, queens {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to Gerontoformica based on the mandibular structure; these mandibles have two teeth, {{one of which is}} apical (situated closer to the apex) and the other is subapical (below the apex tooth). Other similar body structures include the large ocelli, short scapes, 12 antennomeres (antenna segments), small eyes, and a clypeal margin that has a row of peg-like denticles (small bumps on a tooth). Queens can be distinguished from Gerontoformica by their flattened, broad heads. They have a broad, concave clypeal margin with a high number of denticles and two short vertical rows of denticles. They have mandibles which are half the length of Gerontoformica and have a dense brush of spicule-like setae. Furthermore, the vertex (the upper surface of the head) has a pair of oval-shaped rugose (<b>wrinkled)</b> patches.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of formation of facial <b>wrinkles</b> {{has not been}} fully clarified due {{to the existence of}} many distinct influential factors. To clarify the relationship between facial <b>wrinkles</b> and structures in the skin, image analysis was performed on the donated cadaveric skin specimens. Specimens were obtained from forehead and lateral canthus region after measuring <b>wrinkle</b> depth. Then tissue slices were prepared to observe dermal thickness, sebaceous gland density, solar elastosis degree, retinacula cutis density and then measured and analyzed in relation to <b>wrinkle</b> depth. The dermis under a <b>wrinkle</b> becomes thinner in association with the progression of <b>wrinkles</b> until the dermis becomes thinner than one-half of its original thickness. When the dermis stops thinning, <b>wrinkles</b> develop further by dermal invagination into the subcutaneous layer. Sebaceous gland density seems {{to be one of the}} multiple factors that prevent <b>wrinkle</b> deepening. Solar elastosis tends to develop with the development of a <b>wrinkle</b> until the <b>wrinkle</b> becomes deeper than 0. 6 mm. This tendency is less evident at <b>wrinkle</b> points than at non-wrinkle points. In addition, specimens with a higher sebaceous gland density tended to have a thicker dermis and/or less solar elastosis. Facial <b>wrinkles</b> seem to develop above sites of reduced lower retinacula cutis density. As a <b>wrinkle</b> develops, the density declines in both the wrinkle-specific and the wrinkle-inclusive areas, while the density difference between those areas vanishes.

40|$|<b>Wrinkling</b> {{occurs when}} a blank is {{subjected}} to compressive stresses during the forming process as in the flange of a cup during drawing. Although the failure limit due to plastic flow localization can be simply defined by the FLC at each point of a continuum, the <b>wrinkling</b> limit cannot be defined with simple variables such as strain, stress, and thickness. <b>Wrinkling</b> is strongly affected by the mechanical properties of the sheet material, the geometry of the tools and blank, and contact conditions.

In this study we explored whether the finger <b>wrinkling</b> test could be a useful test for autonomic dysfunction and whether the clinical evaluation of <b>wrinkling</b> can be improved by digital analysis of photographs. Methods: As much as 20 healthy subjects and 15 patients underwent tilt table testing and finger <b>wrinkling</b> testing. During the finger <b>wrinkling</b> test the right hand was immersed in water at 40 °C. The degree of <b>wrinkling</b> was assessed with a 5 -point clinical scale at baseline, 5, 15 and 30 min of immersion. Photographs were taken at the same intervals. Several features were evaluated using digital analysis: length and gradient of automatically detected <b>wrinkle</b> and mean, maximum, minimum, variance and derivative of grey value of pixels. Results: Clinical scoring of <b>wrinkling</b> allowed differentiation between healthy subjects and patients with a normal and an abnormal response to tilt table testing. Relevant features obtained with digital analysis were mean grey value and the gradient of automatically detected <b>wrinkle.</b> McNemar’s test showed no difference in test results between the tilt table test and the finger <b>wrinkling</b> test with a kappa of 0. 68. Conclusion: The finger <b>wrinkling</b> test {{can be used as a}} screening test before tilt table testing.
