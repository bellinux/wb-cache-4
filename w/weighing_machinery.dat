50|$|During {{the early}} years of World War I, Waitt & Bond hired many {{refugees}} from Belgium. In addition to being expert cigar makers, many of them were socialists. After this, Waitt & Bond clashed with the local unions, who threatened to strike if the company hired more employees, implemented the use of <b>machinery,</b> <b>weighed</b> tobacco, ended the practice of cigar makers using their mouths to shape cigars, or dismissed an employee without the consent of a union committee.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves are}} opened by {{electric}} motors and the <b>machinery</b> <b>weighs</b> about 50 ST and each counterweight consists of 73 ST of concrete. The operator's house {{is at the}} southeast corner of the bridge and the transformers are located to the southeast on the east bank of Round Lake. As the bridge opens, recessed barriers rise to block traffic from driving onto the leaves. Gates also descend and flashing lights warn oncoming traffic. When closed, there is 17 ft of clearance below the bridge.|$|R
50|$|Outbursts may {{range in}} {{severity}} from being barely noticeable, to causing {{the destruction of}} an entire mining panel, and throwing pieces of <b>machinery</b> <b>weighing</b> tens of tonnes several metres. An outburst at Tahmoor Colliery, in NSW, Australia in June 1985 involved the ejection of 350 tonnes of coal and rock and over 3000 cubic metres of gas, resulting in one fatality.http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LA19940412038 Another outburst at the nearby South Bulli Colliery in 1991 resulted in three fatalities, and yet another outburst at Westcliff Colliery in January 1994 involved 300 tonnes of coal and rock and resulted in one fatality.|$|R
50|$|The next day, {{known as}} Syākwa Tyākwa (स्याक्व त्याक्व), is Navami, the ninth {{day of the}} {{fortnight}} in the lunar calendar. Sacred rituals are performed at the shrine room of the tutelary deity. People also make sacred offerings to their tools of the trade, <b>weighing</b> scales, looms, <b>machinery</b> and vehicles. The Taleju Temple located at Kathmandu Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square and Bhaktapur Durbar Square are {{opened to the public}} on this day only, and devotees visit the temple to offer worship to the goddess, who is also the tutelary deity of Nepal's Malla kings of old. The day ends with another grand family feast.|$|R

5000|$|Military utility {{transport}} helicopter, {{powered by}} two Klimov TV3-117VM turboshaft engines and {{equipped with a}} loading ramp instead of the clam-shell doors, an additional door and a new [...] "dolphin nose". First deliveries to the VVS in 2012. Deliveries continued in 2013 and 2014. Russia currently receives improved Mi-8 MTV-5-1s. These helicopters are intended for the transport of goods and <b>machinery</b> <b>weighing</b> up to 4 tons, and these helicopters can be equipped with rocket-cannon armament. New Mi-8 MTV-5-1 comply with the latest standards. In the cockpit installed lighting equipment adapted for night vision goggles, which allows {{to operate in the}} dark at low and extremely low altitudes, and also gives the possibility to make the landing on unprepared sites. Helicopters equipped with modern communication systems. As of June 2017, the manufacturer has supplied 100 Mi-8MTV-5 vehicles out of 140 to the Defence Ministry. 6 Mi-8MTV-5-1 were delivered in July 2017.|$|R
60|$|Captain Phelps was one {{of those}} angry men of iron mould, who appear to take {{pleasure}} in daring Fate to do her worst. On receipt of the letter, he swore with an awful oath that he would now go to sea in the Swordfish, even if he knew she would go to the bottom in twenty-four hours after weighing anchor. Accordingly, having intrenched himself behind a wall of moral adamant, he went about with quiet indifference, and let things take their course. He made no objection whatever when, in addition to the loading already in the ship, the agents added a deck cargo of some massive pieces of <b>machinery,</b> <b>weighing</b> thirty tons, and a supply of coals, the proper receptacle for which below had been filled with iron goods. Neither did he utter a word when--after the vessel had been taken out into the stream by the riggers--he and the owner, agents, pilot, and crew (only six of which last were A.B.'s), were taken off to her in a tug and put on board with orders to sail immediately.|$|R
50|$|A human {{operator}} anticipates errors, {{and can also}} compensate for known lags {{in the operation of}} the system. Mimicking of this behaviour had been achieved for electronic signals and low-power electromechanical systems, but gun control was on a completely different scale, with <b>machinery</b> <b>weighing</b> tons and having significant inertia needing to move at velocities of up to 30 degrees per second, and accelerations of 10 degrees per second2. In 1937, the Admiralty had placed an order with Metropolitan Vickers for a control system for an eight-barrel Pom-Pom gun. Pestarini had developed a similar system for the Italian navy. The original design used a single Metadyne to supply a constant current to the armatures of motors mounted on several guns. Each was then controlled by manually adjusting the field current. Tustin, who did most of the design work, found that the system had a large time constant, due to the inductance of the field windings. In order to improve its response, he supplied the field windings with a constant current, and used a partially compensated Metadyne to control the armature current of each motor. Tustin compared Ward Leonard control systems, Metadynes and Amplidynes, and accepted that each had its merits, but favoured the Metadyne, of which he had several years experience from their use in traction control.|$|R
