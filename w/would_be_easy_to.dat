5|$|Schlesselman and Cowart chatted on the Internet {{about how}} {{to carry out the}} operation. Schlesselman {{suggested}} using a sawed-off shotgun because it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> maneuver; he also said he planned to steal a gun from his father. Prior to their arrest, the men decorated their car with a Swastika and drew the numbers 88 and 14 on their hood using window chalk. Authorities believe the men may have planned to move from state to state to choose their victims. They also planned to wear white tuxedos and top hats during the assassination attempt.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Wang's {{only hope}} for rescue was an {{intervention}} by Dou Jiande, to whom he had sent envoys already in late 620. For Dou, the situation, as presented by his councillor Liu Bin, offered both danger and opportunity: if Luoyang fell, the Tang would next turn against Dou, but if Dou intervened and saved Luoyang, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> oust the weakened Wang and annex Henan to his own Xia state. It was therefore probably by design that Dou waited until April, when Wang's situation was critical, before he began marching west to relieve the siege of Luoyang. Dou's army was a huge force, reportedly over 100,000 strong, and the two earliest sources report 120,000 men. Although possibly exaggerated, an army of this size was well within {{the capabilities of the}} time. The Xia army was accompanied by a similarly large supply train, comprising both carts and boats.|$|E

The Dogpatch restaurant could prepare and serve guests' caught fish, or Dogpatch workers could clean and pack the fish in ice for guests to take home.|$|E
25|$|Many radio {{frequencies}} penetrate Earth's atmosphere quite well, {{and this}} led to radio telescopes that investigate the cosmos using large radio antennas. Furthermore, human endeavors emit considerable electromagnetic radiation as a byproduct of communications such as television and radio. These signals <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> recognize as artificial due to their repetitive nature and narrow bandwidths. If this is typical, one way of discovering an extraterrestrial civilization might be to detect artificial radio emissions from a location outside the Solar System.|$|E

In November 2008, the company announced that it would be offering an Aspen Avionics glass cockpit primary flight display as an option on the DA20. Diamond indicated the Aspen PFD <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> incorporate into the existing instrument panel design because it mounts in a standard round instrument hole.

Opas established that a person who was inexperienced in handling that type of rifle and its cocking-lever rifle, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> jam the rifle and any attempt to clear the jam would result in a live round being ejected.|$|E
25|$|Sultan Selim III was {{concerned}} about the lack of a comprehensive notation system for music and encouraged members of his court to work on a notation system that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> learn and to transcribe in. Two music systems were developed as a result and presented to Selim III, by Hamparsum Limonciyan and Abdulbaki Nasir Dede. Abdulbaki Nasir Dede's system was based on the abjad system, however differs in the ordering of the notes. Hampartsoum Limondjian's notation that he developed in two years between 1813 and 1815 was preferred over the other and became the dominant notation for Turkish and Armenian music.|$|E

25|$|MS {{continued}} {{working with}} the original SQLC standard, retaining many of the advanced features that {{were removed from the}} CLI version. These included features like scrollable cursors, and metadata information queries. The commands in the API were split into groups; the Core group was identical to the CLI, the Level 1 extensions were commands that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> implement in drivers, while Level 2 commands contained the more advanced features like cursors. A proposed standard was released in December 1991, and industry input was gathered and worked into the system through 1992, resulting in yet another name change to ODBC.|$|E
25|$|Within {{two months}} of their introduction, sales at New Zealand {{restaurants}} increase by approximately 10%, and drew the attention of Burger King Holdings. BKH observed the sales trends and market acceptance of the products for several months after the introduction for the possible purpose of extending the concept in other markets. While the concept was tailored for the New Zealand market, TPF executives stated that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> adapt the concept to other regions. Some restaurant industry observers agreed with the TPF assessment of the products and separately stated other sauces and ingredients {{could be used to}} crate variations in the US and other markets. Eventually, the sandwiches were discontinued, with the Sweet Ride and Mango Jammin burgers the first to be removed from the menu.|$|E
25|$|A {{short time}} after Hatteras Island was {{captured}} for the Union, Burnside began {{to promote the}} idea of a Coast Division, to be composed of fishermen, dockworkers, and other watermen from the northeastern states, and used to attack coastal areas. He reasoned that such men were already familiar with ships, and therefore <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> train for amphibious operations. Burnside was a close friend of General-in-Chief George B. McClellan, so he got a respectful hearing. Although Burnside had initially intended to operate in Chesapeake Bay, in the hands of McClellan and the War Department his ideas were soon transformed into a planned assault on the North Carolina interior coast, beginning with Roanoke Island. An unspoken reason for the change of target was the mistaken belief that pro-Union sentiment was being suppressed in North Carolina, and an invasion would allow them to express their true loyalties. When it was fleshed out, the invasion of North Carolina {{came to be known as}} the Burnside Expedition.|$|E

25|$|German forces {{crossed the}} Seine on 9 June, {{cutting off the}} 51st (Highland) Division north of the river, two days after 52nd (Lowland) Division had begun to land and the {{assembly}} of the division was changed to Rennes in Brittany; the 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade which arrived first, was directed to Beaumont near Le Mans, {{the rest of the}} division to follow on. The 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division began its arrival at Brest on 11 June and was sent to Sablé-sur-Sarthe, on the assumption that two fresh divisions would be enough to allow the Tenth Army and attached British troops to retreat through them and take up positions prepared around the Brest peninsula. That day, the Anglo-French Supreme War Council met at Briare and General Charles de Gaulle (Minister of War) was sent to Rennes to survey progress on the redoubt; on 12 June, De Gaulle reported that Quimper would be a favourable place for the government to retreat to, since it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> take ship to England or Africa, since the prospect of maintaining a redoubt in Brittany was non-existent.|$|E
25|$|While the Loch Ness monster {{is often}} {{reported}} as {{looking like a}} plesiosaur, it is also often described as looking completely different. A number of reasons have been presented for why a plesiosaurian identity is unlikely. These include {{the assumption that the}} water in the loch is too cold for a, for the sake of this argument, presumed cold-blooded reptile to be able to survive easily, the assumption that air-breathing animals <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> see whenever they appear at the surface to breathe, the fact that the loch is too small and contains insufficient food to be able to support a breeding colony of large animals, and finally the fact that the lake was only formed 10,000 years ago {{at the end of the}} last ice age, while the latest fossil appearance of plesiosaurs dates to over 66 million years ago. Frequent explanations for the sightings include waves, floating inanimate objects, tricks of the light, swimming known animals, and practical jokes. Nevertheless, in the popular imagination, plesiosaurs have come to be identified with the Monster of Loch Ness. This has had the advantage of making the group better known to the general public, but the disadvantage that people have trouble taking the subject seriously, forcing paleontologists to explain time and again that plesiosaurs really did exist and are not creatures of myth or fantasy.|$|E
25|$|Chief American Horse was a Lakota {{historian}} and authored a “winter count” {{he kept on}} a piece of cloth covering over one hundred years of Lakota history, 1775-1878. Lakota years are conceived as extending from the first snow of a winter to the first snow of the next winter. Years are given names based upon significant or unique event that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> recall. For example, Chief Flying Hawk’s Winter Count for 1866 records the Fetterman Incident during Red Cloud’s War as “Wasicu opawinge wica ktepi” or “They killed one hundred white men.” Likewise, 1876 is “Marpiya llute sunkipi” or “They took horses from Red Cloud” (the U.S. Army did after the Battle of the Little Big Horn), 1877 is “Tasunka witko ktepi” or “When they killed Crazy Horse” and 1890 is “Si-tanka ktepi” or “When the killed Big Foot” (the Wounded Knee Massacre). In 1879, American Horse drew the winter count in a sketchbook at the request of William H. Corbusier, an Army surgeon. Corbusier sent it to the Smithsonian together with an explanation of the years provided by the keeper. American Horse said that the winter count had been kept in his family for generations, passed down from his grandfather, to his father, to him. American Horse was born in the year they stole many horses from the Flatheads, or 1840-41. His death is marked in the No Ears calendar for the year 1908-09.|$|E

Another praised its [...] "honest and heartfelt storytelling" [...] while saying it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> call the episode's pacing [...] "almost too-languid". A fourth reviewer found it to be typical of Adachi anime adaptations, but that the production values were [...] "at best, mediocre and, at times, brushing up against the marginal".|$|E
500|$|The second Arab {{siege of}} Constantinople {{was far more}} {{dangerous}} for Byzantium than the first as, unlike the loose blockade of 674–678, the Arabs launched a direct, well-planned attack on the Byzantine capital, and tried {{to cut off the}} city completely from land and sea. The siege represented a final effort by the Caliphate to [...] "cut off the head" [...] of the Byzantine Empire, after which the remaining provinces, especially in Asia Minor, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> capture. The Arab failure was chiefly logistical, as they were operating too far from their Syrian bases, but the superiority of the Byzantine navy through the use of Greek fire, the strength of Constantinople's fortifications, and the skill of Leo III in deception and negotiations also played important roles.|$|E

[...] The American invasion of Quebec began with the arrival at Île aux Noix of the Continental Army {{under the command of}} General Philip Schuyler on September 4, 1775. [...] Schuyler, who was ill at the time, eventually turned command of the army over the General Richard Montgomery, who ordered the army to besiege Fort Saint-Jean, which they did on September 18.
