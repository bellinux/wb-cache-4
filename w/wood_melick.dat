50|$|Melica uniflora, {{a species}} of grass also known as <b>wood</b> <b>melick.</b>|$|E
50|$|Swedish naturalist Anders Jahan Retzius {{described}} the <b>wood</b> <b>melick</b> in 1779.|$|E
5000|$|The reserve's {{woodlands}} {{support a}} large range of species, including locally uncommon {{plants such as}} broad-leaved helleborine (Epipactis helleborine), <b>wood</b> <b>melick</b> (Melica uniflora), and meadow saxifrage (Saxifraga granulata).|$|E
50|$|Melica uniflora, {{commonly}} known as <b>wood</b> <b>melick,</b> is a species of grass in the family Poaceae that is native to much of Europe, and to parts of South West Asia and North Africa.|$|E
5000|$|This ancient wood is wet ash {{and maple}} on heavy {{calcareous}} clay, with seasonally waterlogged soils, {{and it has}} an extremely diverse flora. A double bank and ditch has <b>wood</b> <b>melick,</b> sweet violet and the nationally restricted spiked star-of-Bethlehem.|$|E
50|$|These ancient woods {{are of the}} ash/maple type, an {{increasingly}} scarce habitat over its range in lowland England. The rich ground flora includes plants indicative of ancient woodland such as <b>wood</b> <b>melick</b> and early-purple orchid. A system of rides provides valuable habitats for invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|These woods {{are one of}} {{the largest}} {{remnants}} of the ancient Royal Forest of Rockingham. They are mainly ash and pedunculate oak on wet calcareous clay soils. The ground flora is diverse, and there are grasses such as tufted hair-grass, rough meadow-grass and <b>wood</b> <b>melick.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{other part}} of the nature reserve, the Hammersta peninsula, {{contains}} some of the richest broad-leaf forest in Stockholm County. The landscape here is characterised especially by several very old oak trees. Notably, several unusual species of grass grows in the area, including Bromus benekenii, <b>wood</b> <b>melick,</b> Poa remota and Hordelymus europaeus.|$|E
50|$|This {{site has}} ash and maple {{woodland}} on heavy clay, a habitat {{which has become}} rare in lowland England. It is biologically diverse, {{with a number of}} rare species. Several plants are indicative of ancient woodland, such as <b>wood</b> <b>melick</b> and wood anemone. Glebe Meadows has a rich variety of species due to its traditional management, and there are also some small ponds and mature hedgerows.|$|E
50|$|On the plateau, brambles, bracken and {{rosebay willowherb}} occupy {{extensive}} patches, {{but a more}} mixed ground flora occurs between these, including creeping soft-grass (Holcus mollis), hairy brome (Bromus ramosus), tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa), wood millet (Milium effusum) and <b>wood</b> <b>melick</b> (Melica uniflora). Pill sedge (Carex pilulifera), hairy wood-rush (Luzula pilosa) and slender St. John's-wort (Hypericum pulchrum) are found in more heathy areas, and the rushes Juncus effusus and J. conglomeratus are present in damper areas.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{woodland}} on {{the site}} is ancient, {{and there are also}} areas of chalk grassland. The wood is principally oak and ash, with some sycamore and wild cherry. There is an understorey of hazel. Flora include dog's mercury, wood millet, <b>wood</b> <b>melick.</b> The site also has a wide variety of insects, including grasshoppers and butterlies. Forty-five species of birds have been recorded, and there are also badgers and roe deer.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{formerly}} the Dancersend estate of the Rothschild family, who developed it as a nature reserve. It has woodland plantations, unimproved chalk grassland and scrub. The woods have few mature trees as most were felled during the 1940s, but a rich ground flora includes plants associated with ancient woodland, such as hairy brome and <b>wood</b> <b>melick.</b> The site {{is important for}} its butterflies and moths, {{and it has a}} diverse population of breeding birds.|$|E
50|$|The wood is a {{surviving}} {{fragment of}} a much larger wood shown on an 1837 map as Great Wood, and it is now surrounded by suburban housing. Until 1990 it was a rubbish dump, but it was then restored as a nature reserve. The main trees are pedunculate oak, ash and horse chestnut. Flowers include bluebells, ramsons and <b>wood</b> <b>melick,</b> and twenty-five species of bird have been recorded, including three species of woodpecker, chiffchaff and tawny owl.|$|E
50|$|Pavis Wood {{is an area}} of {{woodland}} on a hill {{located near}} Hastoe in Tring, north-western Hertfordshire, England. A point on its eastern slopes is the highest point in the county of Hertfordshire at 244 m (801 ft). The area is often considered as ancient woodland containing a wide variety of plants such as the yellow pimpernel and <b>wood</b> <b>melick.</b> A bridleway crosses the woodland which can be accessed throughout the year as well as the Ridgeway National Trail which is dominated mainly by beech, oak and ash.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{distinct}} assemblages of flora are observed at Briarwood Banks. Dominant on lower slopes is wych elm (Ulmus glabra), beneath which are found dog’s mercury (Mercurialis perennis), woodruff (Galium odoratum), <b>wood</b> <b>melick</b> (Melica uniflora), giant bellflower (Campanula latifolia), enchanter’s nightshade (Circaea lutetiana) and wood avens (Geum urbanum). Oak (Quercus petraea) predominates the higher slopes with creeping soft-grass (Holcus mollis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella) and broad buckler-fern (Dryopteris dilatata); and on very acid soil beneath oaks, great wood-rush (Luzula sylvatica), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and common cow-wheat (Melampyrum pratense) are found.|$|E
50|$|The ground flora is {{dominated}} by bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) and dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), whilst in drier areas bramble (Rubus fruticosus) can be found. Supported by the wood's rides, plants of marshy grassland communities are found, such as false fox-sedge (Carex otrubae), angelica (Angelica sylvestris), valerian (Valeriana officinalis), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and pendulous sedge (Carex pendula). Other plants common only in ancient woodlands that are also found in Hanger Wood include herb paris(Paris quadrifolia, a species uncommon in Bedfordshire), wood millet (Milium effusum), <b>wood</b> <b>melick</b> (Melica uniflora), yellow archangel (Lamiastrum galeobdolon), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and wood sedge(Carex sylvatica).|$|E
50|$|Dundonald Woods (NS363343) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{extensive}} areas of elm-dominated woodlands in Ayrshire. Ash, oak and sycamore are also abundant; much of the policies are composed of derelict-coppiced-type growth from trees felled in the Second World War. Some conifer plantations are present. Wetland habitats are also present, including the Collennan Reservoir, springs and a eutrophic loch, contributing to the high biodiversity of the site. Dog's Mercury, <b>Wood</b> <b>Melick,</b> Broad-leaved Helleborine, and Giant Bellflower are amongst the significant plants present.The small loch of Galrigs was located near Laurieston Farm and the ruin of Lochside Farm; it is now evident as a marshy area dominated by rushes. Galrigs was the old name for the lands of Newfield.|$|E
50|$|Dundonald Woods (NS363343) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{extensive}} areas of elm-dominated woodlands in Ayrshire. Ash, oak and sycamore are also abundant; much of the policies are composed of derelict-coppiced-type growth from trees felled in the Second World War. Some conifer plantations are present. Wetland habitats are also present, with springs, an old reservoir near Collennan and a very eutrophic water body, Merklands Loch, all contributing to the high biodiversity of the site. Dog's Mercury, <b>Wood</b> <b>Melick,</b> Broad-leaved Helleborine, and Giant Bellflower are amongst the significant plants present. The policies of Auchans Castle still (2010) contain several ancient sycamores of over five metres circumference. Aught Woods lie on a slope running down towards the Collennan Smallholdings.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the area}} is divided into layers like any natural habitat in the temperate climatic zone. On the field layer are mosses and fungi (penny bun or cep, honey fungus), in addition there is the herbaceous layer, which is characterized by various species depending on the season. In spring when the soil is warmed up quickly by sunlight, spring flowers like hepatica appear, which conjure up blue carpets on the forest floor, followed by anemone. As the temperatures rise, leaves sprout on the trees. The level of sunlight under the trees reduces and species such as Spring Vetchling, Lily of the Valley, May Lily, Moschatel, Herb Paris and Woodruff appear, which flourish under conditions of low light. As the foliage becomes denser, shade-loving summer flowers appear. The first ones are the remaining native orchids of our deciduous forests. On the Streckelsberg: Common Twayblade, Lesser Butterfly-orchid, Bird's-nest Orchid and Red helleborine. Rather less colourful summer flowers in the beech woods are the Small Balsam, Common Figwort, Wood Avens, Wall Lettuce, Baneberry and Enchanter's-nightshade. Characteristic grasses of the herbaceous layer of the beech forest are False Brome, <b>Wood</b> <b>Melick</b> and Giant Fescue. The overlying shrub layer consists of bushes and saplings, such as Elder, Rowan, Fly Honeysuckle, Common Honeysuckle, Dewberry, Raspberry, Blackthorn, Common Ivy, Alpine Currant, Hazel, Goat Willow, Bird Cherry, three species of wild rose, Common Buckthorn and Viburnum. There are also young trees of the species Norway Maple, Sycamore and Silver Birch. The tree layer is dominated by beech trees that are more than 180 years old and, {{on the slopes of}} the hill, by equally ancient Scots Pines.|$|E
