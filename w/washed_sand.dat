5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of <b>washed</b> <b>sand,</b> perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|Rough waves {{destroyed}} {{four and}} damaged two deep-water communication cables between Oahu and Kauai. In Oahu, damage from wind and surf was heaviest {{on the southwest}} coast between Nānākuli and Mākaha. The storm surge <b>washed</b> <b>sand</b> into streets in Waikīkī and flooded cars in areas of basement parking. Wind damage was greatest in areas where winds blew from southerly directions off of mountains. The winds damaged several small aircraft and a Douglas DC-3 plane in Honolulu. Gusty winds shattered glass windows in the Honolulu International Airport, injuring several passengers. Some flights {{in and out of}} the Honolulu airport were delayed, while other domestic airports were temporarily closed. The passage of the hurricane damaged at least 6,391 homes, 21 hotels, and two condominium buildings on the island. Additionally, 418buildings, including 30 businesses, were destroyed on Oahu.|$|E

25|$|Letchworth Croquet Club {{is based}} at Letchworth Sports and Tennis Club in Muddy Lane. Letchworth Garden City Croquet Club was founded in 1987 by {{a small group of}} enthusiasts {{and with the help of}} the (then) {{corporation}} were provided with a venue for their activities on the site of the old Spirella tennis courts adjacent to Willian Way. After much work on the playing surface, including using the ancient heavy roller left behind after the demise of the Spirella Sports Ground two nearly full-sized croquet lawns were created and the club members set about learning the finer points of the game with plenty of assistance from the East Anglian Croquet Association. Very surprisingly, after only two years the club won the Longman Cup, the premier national handicap competition; something that the majority of croquet clubs never achieve! The club moved to Muddy Lane to become part of Letchworth Sports and Tennis Club in Spring 2006. A special event was held with lunch and AC and GC tournaments. Dr Ian Vincent, Chairman of the Croquet Association, officially opened the lawns by running the first hoop. Since moving the club's membership has risen to over 70 people with a wide age range. The club is active in regional and national events and each year hosts the national final of the Croquets Association's Inter Club Golf Croquet Championship. The croquet lawns at Letchworth were constructed with assistance from the Sports Turf Research Institute and were laser levelled and 76 tons of Leighton Buzzard <b>washed</b> <b>sand</b> ameliorated into the top surface. In the ensuing years the club has conducted a rigorous lawn maintenance regime with the result that the two lawns are now amongst the finest in the UK.|$|E

40|$|The {{assemblage}} {{structure of}} harpacticoid copepods inhabiting the soft sediments of littoral and sublittoral areas of Cat Ba archipelago (South China Sea) is analysed. Three basic types of harpacticoid taxocenes {{were observed in}} the upper sublittoral. Main dominant species of taxocenes were Amphiascoides sp., Stenhelia latioperculata, Paramphiascella sp., Phyllopodopsyllus sp., Tisbe sp. 1 and Amphiascoides sp. In addition, the main characteristics of harpacticoid species composition in littoral rock pools are described. A comparative analysis of shallow-water harpacticoid communities from different biotopes of the tropical region is presented, and shows that harpacticoid diversity and abundance are lowest in muddy sediments. Highest diversity and abundance are found in <b>washed</b> <b>sands</b> and silty sands with detritus. In general, the structure of muddy bottom communities is the most homogeneous throughout the tropics. Mangrove forests have no significant influence on harpacticoid taxocene structure. Harpacticoid associations of <b>washed</b> <b>sands</b> and silty sands with detritus demonstrate greater diversity and are region-specific...|$|R
