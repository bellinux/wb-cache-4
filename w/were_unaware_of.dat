5|$|To deter pursuits of marching {{infantry}} or riding cavalry, the Han Chinese made caltrops (barbed iron balls {{with sharp}} spikes sticking {{out in all}} directions) that could be scattered {{on the ground and}} pierce the feet or hooves of those who <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> them.|$|E
5|$|A Covenant army {{attacks the}} academy causing {{confusion}} and panic. Although not made clear in Forward Unto Dawn, the Covenant are a theocratic collection of alien {{species that are}} religiously offended by Humanity and seek to eradicate it. The events portrayed in Forward Unto Dawn {{are some of the}} earliest encounters with the Covenant, and the characters other than Master Chief <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their existence.|$|E

5|$|A poll on {{the issue}} of Scottish {{independence}} conducted by TNS-BMRB in December 2013 gave Lamont an approval rating of 6% among women and 8% among men, compared with 22% and 30% respectively for Salmond. 41% of respondents to that survey <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> her role as Scottish Labour leader, a figure rising to 62% among those aged 16–34.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} almost-collisions in 2005 in similar {{circumstances}} {{in the tunnel}} between Foggy Bottom and Rosslyn stations led to a new test procedure which would have identified the faulty circuit after installation. However, by 2009, Metro engineers <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> this incident or the tests developed to detect the failure condition.|$|E
5|$|Countershading, like counter-illumination, {{has rarely}} been applied in {{practice}} for military camouflage, though not because military authorities <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> it. Both Abbott Thayer in the First World War and Hugh Cott in the Second World War proposed countershading to their countries' armed forces. They each demonstrated the effectiveness of countershading, without succeeding in persuading their armed forces to adopt the technique, though they influenced military adoption of camouflage in general.|$|E
50|$|Cryptic {{pregnancy}} {{is a condition}} in which a pregnant woman <b>is</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> her pregnancy until reaching labor. Reasons women may <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their pregnancies can include being on weight-affecting medication, not noticing or having irregular menstrual bleeding, a lack of pregnancy symptoms, negative urine and blood tests, and the fetus being unusually small.|$|R

5|$|As {{there was}} no defined anti-shipping role in pre-war plans, obtaining {{information}} on the enemy's seaborne commercial traffic did not receive high priority, and once the war started, {{it was difficult to}} establish quickly the means of acquiring this information, especially after the fall of Norway and France in April and May 1940. The extent of the intelligence vacuum at the start of Coastal Command's campaign is demonstrated by the fact that Air Ministry planners <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the heavy anti-aircraft armament being fitted to enemy merchant vessels. Casualty rates, often in excess of 20 percent, clarified matters in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's and the British {{response}} was officially restrained. This {{was due to}} the strong-willed defence of the Belgian defensive campaign presented to the cabinet by Sir Roger Keyes at 11:30am 28 May. The French and Belgian ministers had referred to Leopold's actions as treacherous, but they <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the true events: Leopold had not signed an agreement with Hitler in order to form a collaborative government, but an unconditional surrender as Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Daft Punk were {{scheduled}} {{to appear on the}} episode of The Colbert Report on 6 August 2013 to promote Random Access Memories, but were unable to do so because of contractual obligations regarding the duo's later appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Stephen Colbert, Daft Punk <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> any exclusivity agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. In 2015, Daft Punk appeared alongside several other musicians to announce their co-ownership of the music service Tidal at its relaunch.|$|E
40|$|Surgical {{treatment}} {{may be of}} poor quality {{due to the fact}} that an anesthesiologist <b>is</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the possible scope of surgery and a surgeon <b>is</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> different modes of analgesia.

5000|$|Ignorantia juris non excusat or ignorantia legis neminem excusat (Latin for [...] "ignorance {{of the law}} excuses not" [...] and [...] "ignorance of law excuses no one" [...] respectively) is a legal {{principle}} {{holding that}} a person who <b>is</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> a law may not escape liability for violating that law merely because one <b>was</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> its content.|$|R

State of West Bengal.|$|R
5|$|Gregory also {{instructed}} Augustine {{on other}} matters. Temples {{were to be}} consecrated for Christian use, and feasts, if possible, moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> details of the martyr's life or death. They may have been native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman St Sixtus.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, her {{daughter}} Irène was born. To support her family, Curie began {{teaching at the}} École Normale Supérieure. The Curies {{did not have a}} dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry. The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof. They <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. The School did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.|$|E
5|$|On 13 October, Banksy made {{headlines}} {{when it was}} revealed that the art an older man was selling outside Central Park was actually authentic, signed Banksy canvases, sold for only $60 each. Having not announced this beforehand, tourists and park goers <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the value the paintings had, which the BBC estimated could be upwards of $32,000 each. Banksy posted a video on his website chronicling the surprise sale, which revealed that a total of seven paintings were sold for $420 taking.|$|E

5|$|On May 14, 1832, a {{detachment}} of 275 militia {{under the command}} of Majors Isaiah Stillman and David Bailey, under orders from Illinois Governor Reynolds, were encamped near Old Man's Creek, not far from its confluence with the Rock River. The militia camp was located about three miles (5km) east of the Rock River near present-day Stillman Valley, Illinois, and seven miles (11km) south of the Sauk encampment. It is believed that the militia and its commanders <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their proximity to Black Hawk's British Band.|$|E
5|$|Response to the {{pre-emption}} by {{viewers and}} other critics was negative; the family members of several Jets players <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the game's actual conclusion, while NBC received further criticism for its poor timing in displaying the final score of the game during the Heidi movie. NBC's president Julian Goodman formally apologized for the incident. The Jets and Raiders met again in the AFL Championship Game, with the Jets winning 27–23. They later defeated the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III.|$|E
5|$|The Allies <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> {{this and}} mounted further {{attacks on the}} site {{as part of the}} United States Army Air Forces {{experimental}} Operation Aphrodite, involving radio-controlled B-24 Liberators packed with explosives. Two such attacks were mounted but failed; in the second such attack, on 12 August, Lt Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.– the elder brother of future US President John F. Kennedy– was killed when the drone aircraft exploded prematurely. By the end of the bombing campaign, over 4,100 tons of bombs had been dropped on Mimoyecques, more than on any other V-weapons site.|$|E

5|$|With a large {{construction}} programme, engineers made up 29.3% of Michaelmas Task Force. An Engineer Section headquarters was organised on 24 December 1943, {{only nine}} days before landing, consisting of five officers and five enlisted men. Later a jeep and a driver were {{borrowed from the}} 114th Engineer Battalion to provide transportation. The officers did not know each other and therefore <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> each other's capabilities. As it turned out, {{none of them had}} experience with amphibious operations, and only one had experience in airbase construction, although this was to be their most important task.|$|E
5|$|Between 9 and 10 pm on {{the night}} of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told Revere and William Dawes that the British troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord. Warren's {{intelligence}} suggested that the most likely objectives of the regulars' movements later that night would be the capture of Adams and Hancock. They did not worry about the possibility of regulars marching to Concord, since the supplies at Concord were safe, but they did think their leaders in Lexington <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the potential danger that night. Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and to alert colonial militias in nearby towns.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{case was}} unusual {{as he had}} a fungal infection, Penicillium marneffei, {{which at the time}} had rarely been seen and only in South Asia. It is now known as an AIDS-defining illness, but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS. Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV {{developed}} into AIDS. The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope that he might be different and served as the basis of what he told most people about his illness. He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus—ranging from eating a 1,000-year-old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia. He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma at the time. He wanted to protect his parents, who <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> his homosexual affairs.|$|E
