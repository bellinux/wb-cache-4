5|$|From 2007 to 2012, {{the number}} of round-leaved <b>wintergreen</b> footage {{increased}} by 50 percent. On the other hand, those of man orchid fall suddenly and continually. Whereas 27 plants were counted in 2003, the number reached a peak of 240 in 2006 with the uprooting of the wood small-reed, before collapsing to 13 plants in 2012, despite the continued management. The observation of gnawed seedlings can assume leaf consumption by herbivores. Protection against rodents was established in 2013 and will be evaluated at flowering.|$|E
5|$|The {{peninsula}} features {{thin and}} acidic soil, and hosts plants like witherod, Indian pear, Labrador tea, <b>wintergreen,</b> and blueberry shrubs. It is a woodland area, with birch, tamarack, maple, oak, beech, and white pine trees. Given {{the development of}} the land by the Armdale Yacht Club, plant growth is now largely limited to the hill on which the main clubhouse sits; most of the peninsula was paved in 1971. Fish caught from Melville Island include cod and mackerel. Local birds include grebes, loons, and alcids.|$|E
5000|$|Studies on Pyrolaceae - two {{interesting}} <b>Wintergreens</b> from West Greenland. Botanisk Tidsskrift 57: 28-37. 1961.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a small}} woody {{perennial}} reaching a maximum height and width of about 20 centimeters, including its inflorescence. Its rounded or spade-shaped, woolly, petioled leaves are located {{at the base of}} the plant; their resemblance to the leaves of <b>wintergreens</b> (genus Pyrola) gives the species its name.|$|R
60|$|Owls {{that had}} been {{catching}} mice in the out-houses, rabbits {{that had been}} eating the <b>wintergreens</b> in the gardens, and stoats that had been sucking {{the blood of the}} rabbits, discerning that their human neighbors were on the move, discreetly withdrew from publicity, and were seen and heard no more that day.|$|R
5|$|Twelve of {{them were}} {{inventoried}} in 2003, and their populations have been managed since. The light undergrowth contains common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and round-leaved <b>wintergreen</b> (Pyrola rotundifolia). Liquorice milkvetch (Astragalus glycyphyllos) and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea (Lathyrus sylvestris) {{are present in the}} small herb glade. The population of lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) is located in the pioneer wood. In the glade with Calamagrostide and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow pyramidal orchid (Anacamptis pyramidalis). bee orchid (Ophrys apifera) and man orchid (Orchis anthropophora) grow everywhere, except in the older glade. In the different herbaceous fringes grow wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) and zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). A tall herb fringe hosts common butterbur (Petasites hybridus).|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of the existing diversity {{was the most important}} goal. It required conservation of the heritage plant communities: tall-herb fen with common butterbur, the chasmophytic vegetation with hart's-tongue fern and the woody fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli. The survival of populations of round-leaved <b>wintergreen</b> and of man orchid, the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and pyramidal orchid grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species: common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained. Artificial infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats.|$|E
25|$|It {{can also}} be {{prepared}} by the hydrolysis of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) or methyl salicylate (oil of <b>wintergreen)</b> with a strong acid or base.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the above factors the forest floor ranges from nearly devoid of {{vegetation}} to a dense carpet of feather moss. A sparse community of shade tolerant shrubs exists in this environment. Some species of plants in the understory are Green Alder, low bush cranberry, prickly rose, bunchberry, twinflower, wild lily-of-the-valley, northern Comandra and <b>wintergreens.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Trientalis {{is a small}} genus of {{flowering}} plants containing three species known as starflowers or <b>wintergreens.</b> These plants have the unusual trait of sometimes bearing flower parts in sevens. They may also come in fives and sixes. The roots are tuber-like. They are native to North America and northern Eurasia. Trientalis is Latin for [...] "one third of a foot", which is the approximate height of the plant.|$|R
50|$|Pyrolaceae, {{as part of}} the Ericales produce pollen in anthers which open by apical pores. The pollen {{itself is}} {{produced}} in tetrads and is rather sticky. Not surprisingly, <b>wintergreens</b> are insect pollinated, most commonly by flies. The rather large and complex stigma may be an adaptation to ensure that small insects carrying pollen have an attractive landing place. The flowers are produced in the summer and the rather inconspicuous greenish seed capsules are produced in the autumn. The seeds are numerous and very small.|$|R
25|$|Van Dorn's {{body was}} {{brought back to}} Mississippi and buried at <b>Wintergreen</b> Cemetery in Port Gibson. His father Peter had also been buried there, and Earl Van Dorn was laid to rest beside him.|$|E
25|$|The {{main body}} of water inside the park is Lake <b>Wintergreen,</b> , located east of the ridge. There is also a small fishing pond located near Mountain Road, and a flood control pond located {{at the north end}} of the park.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} the above factors is an {{extensive}} understory of vegetation in the aspen forest. Common shrubs and herbs are: saskatoon, red-osier dogwood, raspberry, wild rose, currants and bracted honeysuckle, wild sarsaparilla, hairy lungwort, asters, and peavine. Twinflower, strawberries, bunchberries, horsetails and <b>wintergreen</b> form an attractive grown cover.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wintergreens</b> prefer {{damp and}} shady {{locations}} in woods or in dune slacks. They are often rather local in distribution {{but can be}} locally common especially in their more northern locations. Occurring often separately from the leaved varieties are the achlorophyllous, leafless forms {{of one or more}} of the typed species. Leaves, if present, can be narrow and reddish. These are myco-heterotrophs and feed parasitically off of {{one or more of the}} local mycelia. Because of this parasitic action, the viability of the non-photosynthetic pyrola relies on the survival of the supporting mycelium. The pyrola group is one of a select few that can live both photosynthetically or not. This differentiation is not understood and if deciphered could explain how other obligate non-photosynthetic forest dwelling plants have crossed that evolutionary threshold.|$|R
5000|$|Prostrate plant forms {{may arise}} from {{deliberate}} breeding and hybridisation, such as the groundcover grevilleas, including Grevillea [...] "Poorinda Royal Mantle", and G. [...] "Bronze Rambler", or by selection of forms of plants growing in exposed areas. The windswept coastal heathlands and cliffs of far southeastern New South Wales have yielded Banksia 'Roller Coaster' and Banksia 'Pygmy Possum'. These are flattened varieties of less than 0.5 m in height of the species Banksia integrifolia and Banksia serrata, respectively, both of which grow to sizeable trees of 10 m (30 ft) or more in height. The origin of others is unclear; Cootamundra Wattle (Acacia baileyana) is a popular and widely used garden plant in Australia, a prostrate form of which is also in cultivation. Its origin is unknown, possibly a chance seedling in cultivation. It itself is a popular garden plant, its cascading horizontal branches good for rockeries. Many species of roses grow as long canes that can spread prostrate on the ground, {{and some of these}} have been hybridized to form climbing and rambling roses that can be allowed to grow on the ground without support, as well as varieties known as [...] "carpet roses" [...] that are intended to be grown as ground covers. Prostrate juniper, Juniperus communis subsp. alpina is a naturally occurring form of a popular evergreen. Many species of Cotoneaster, such as C. apiculatus, are prostrate ornamentals, as are the closely related Pyracanthas, and the humilis variant of sweetbox, Sarcococca hookeriana var. humilis. Heaths (Erica carnea and related species) and heathers (Calluna vulgaris) are prostrate shrubs often featured prominently in rock gardens. <b>Wintergreens</b> such as Gaultheria humifusa and Gaultheria procumbens are also prostrate growers. Although, strictly speaking, herbaceous, the North American bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), a member of the dogwood genus, can appear as a prostrate shrub when growing in the garden. Many daphnes, particularly those derived from Daphne odora, are prostrate growers, including forms that are highly fragrant and have variegated leaves, although they are short-lived. Some forms of the culinary herb rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) form prostrate shrubs when grown in Mediterranean climates, although they die back to the ground when grown where winters are colder.|$|R
25|$|The estate {{woodlands}} contains typical species, such as copper beech, horse-chestnut, yew, bay-laurel, oaks, ornamental pines, {{and a fine}} walnut. Several {{very large}} beeches and sycamores are also present. The Glenfield Ramblers recorded two especially rare species {{in the area of}} the Lainshaw Estate, the lesser <b>wintergreen</b> and the bird's nest orchid. Unfortunately no precise details of the site were recorded.|$|E
25|$|Brackens {{substitute}} {{the characteristics}} of a woodland canopy, and are important for giving shade to European plants such as common bluebell and wood anemone, where the woodland does not exist. These plants are intolerant to stock trampling. Dead bracken provides a warm microclimate for development of the immature stages. Climbing corydalis, wild gladiolus and chickweed <b>wintergreen</b> also seem to benefit from the conditions found under bracken stands.|$|E
25|$|Toothpaste {{comes in}} a variety of colors, and flavors {{intended}} to encourage use of the product. Three most common flavorants are peppermint, spearmint, and <b>wintergreen.</b> Toothpaste flavored with peppermint-anise oil is popular in the Mediterranean region. These flavors are provided by the respective oils, e.g. peppermint oil. More exotic flavors include Anethole anise, apricot, bubblegum, cinnamon, fennel, lavender, neem, ginger, vanilla, lemon, orange, and pine. Alternatively, unflavored toothpastes exist.|$|E

25|$|The city is drained {{by three}} rivers; the West, Mill, and Quinnipiac, named in order from west to east. The West River {{discharges}} into West Haven Harbor, while the Mill and Quinnipiac rivers discharge into New Haven Harbor. Both harbors are embayments of Long Island Sound. In addition, several smaller streams {{flow through the}} city's neighborhoods, including <b>Wintergreen</b> Brook, the Beaver Ponds Outlet, Wilmot Brook, Belden Brook, and Prospect Creek. Not all of these small streams have continuous flow year-round.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Wint-O-Green Life Savers {{were used}} to create soda geysers. The tubes of candies were {{threaded}} onto a pipe cleaner and dropped into the soft drink to create a geyser. At {{the end of the}} 1990s, the manufacturer of <b>Wintergreen</b> Lifesavers increased the size of the mints and they no longer fit in the mouth of soda bottles. Science teachers found that Mint Mentos candies had the same effect when dropped into a bottle of any carbonated soft drink.|$|E
25|$|West Rock Ridge State Park {{occupies}} {{most of the}} ridgeline {{as well as the}} undeveloped Lake <b>Wintergreen</b> on {{the east}} side of the mountain. The park is open daily from 8 a.m. to sunset for a variety of recreational uses, including hiking, bicycling, fishing, car-top boating, horseback riding, dog walking, picnicking, and other passive pursuits. The Park Road to the South Overlook and Judges Cave is open daily to vehicle traffic from Memorial Day through the last weekend in October. Park access is free of charge for all users.|$|E
25|$|P. praelongus is not {{in general}} cultivation, though it is an {{attractive}} plant. Unlike many other pondweeds it remains <b>wintergreen.</b> In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. Its preference for relatively deep water and intolerance of turbid conditions may make it unsuitable for many garden ponds. If possible it should be grown in water at least 70cm deep on a sandy, peaty or silty substrate. Good water quality is needed {{to reduce the risk}} of turbid water or growth of blanket weed. Seed can be encouraged to germinate by immersing dried seed in water for at least a month, exposing them to a cold period, or by scarifying them.|$|E
25|$|The Braunton Burrows {{core area}} {{consists}} of fixed and mobile sand dune systems with geomorphological and successional processes. There are also variable-flooded slacks, grassland and scrub further inland supporting {{a wide variety}} of flowering and lower plants, birds, and insects. It includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities, with over 400 vascular plant species. It is characterised by marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush (Juncus acutus), and willow (Salix) species. On the strandline there is rock sea lavender (Limonium binervosum). The fore and mid dunes are generally sandy yellow dunes, colonised and stabilised by marram grass. Other notable species include sea stock (Matthiola sinuate), sea stork's-bill (Erodium maritimum), sea clover (Trifolium aquamosum), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica), sea spurge (Euphorbia paralias), and white horehound (Marrubium vulgare). Further inland, the stable grey dunes are stabilised by other species such as dune fescue (Vulpia membranacea). The dune slacks, the valleys between the dunes, may flood after heavy rain and are wet and marshy during the winter. They support round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush, round-leaved <b>wintergreen</b> (Pyrola rotundifolia ssp. maritima), early gentian (Gentianella anglica), and many orchid species. Listed as endangered on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee's Vascular Plant Red Data List for Great Britain, the water germander (Teucrium scordium), a perennial plant that lives in the slacks, has just one other population in the UK.|$|E
500|$|Some of Scotland's {{flowering}} plant species have extremely restricted ranges in the country. These include Diapensia lapponica, found {{only on the}} slopes of Sgurr an Utha, Argyll and Mountain Bearberry, recorded at only a few mainland locations, and on Skye and Orkney. The pinewoods of Strathspey contain rare [...] species such as [...] Creeping Lady's Tresses, Twinflower and the One-flowered <b>Wintergreen.</b> Plans to protect the Intermediate <b>Wintergreen,</b> also found here, were introduced in 2008. Other nationally rare species include Tufted Saxifrage, Alpine Catchfly, Sword-leaved Helleborine, Norwegian Sandwort, Dark-red Helleborine, Iceland Purslane, Small Cow-wheat [...] and Yellow Oxytropis.|$|E
500|$|The {{legacy of}} the burial has led it to be {{referenced}} in popular culture. The music video for the song [...] "When I Wake Up" [...] by <b>Wintergreen</b> depicts the band traveling to the landfill site and proceeding to dig up the abandoned cartridges; the video's director Keith Schofield had worked with video game-based music videos before. The novel Lucky Wander Boy by D.B. Weiss features a scene which takes place outside of Alamogordo, in which two of the characters discuss a parking lot which has been built over {{the site of the}} burial. The 2014 film [...] features a plot centered on the burial.|$|E

2500|$|Barbara <b>Wintergreen</b> (Rebecca Front) – {{correspondent}} on The Day Todays American sister channel CBN. Speaking with {{an exaggerated}} American accent, <b>Wintergreen</b> generally {{reports on the}} repeated executions of mass murderer Chapman Baxter (Patrick Marber) at various penitentiaries across the United States, one exception being in episode 4 where she reports on US couples having a prosthetic pregnancy. All her reports make use of convoluted puns and interviews with stereotypical stock characters in American culture (including Steve Coogan as dimwitted Southerner Alvin Holler). Barbara's disturbing reports always end with her attempting a joke (usually drowned out by Chapman Baxter's execution screams) and pouting at the camera. The CBN reports are presented in a noticeably different format to other reports shown in the episodes; her segments are made using different shooting and editing techniques which mimic the appearance of American news, while the content of her reports satirises common British perceptions of the American media. The segments went through excessive processing to accentuate the reduction in picture quality typical of standards conversion of the time. The character of Barbara <b>Wintergreen</b> originated in On the Hour, which also featured a character identical to Chapman Baxter, played by Marber and named [...] "Daimler Jeffries".|$|E

2500|$|The Cascade Crest Montane Forest {{ecoregion}} {{consists of}} an undulating plateau punctuated by volcanic buttes and cones that reach a maximum elevation of about [...] Volcanism in the Pliocene epoch overtopped the existing Miocene volcanics of the Western Cascades Montane Highlands. Later, Pleistocene glaciation left numerous rock-basin lakes throughout the plateau. Sinuous, medium gradient streams cross the subdued, glaciated terrain. The region is extensively forested with mountain hemlock, Pacific silver fir, and subalpine fir, with some grand fir, noble fir, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine, and an understory of vine maple, huckleberry, rhododendron, beargrass, twinflower, and <b>wintergreen.</b> Mountain meadows support sedges, dwarf willows, and tufted hairgrass. The region covers [...] in Oregon and [...] in Washington, running along {{the spine of the}} Cascades; an isolated pocket of this ecoregion can be found on Newberry Volcano southeast of Bend.|$|E
