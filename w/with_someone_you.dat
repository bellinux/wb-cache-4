In 1999, the band also toured with Something for Kate and Alex Lloyd. Collins described the process of choosing who the band would play with as a simple matter of choosing whose music the band preferred, stating [...] "we had played with most of the bands, and if you're going on tour <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> <b>you</b> may as well go <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> <b>you</b> get along with and whose music you enjoy." [...] Despite being fans of Swervedriver, who were renowned for [...] "their capability to reproduce their album sound perfectly in the live setting" [...] according to Beat Magazine's Neala Johnson, Fanning said Powderfinger would never attempt to replicate them, because he believed their live shows to be much more [...] "emotionally powerful" [...] than recordings.|$|E

2500|$|I {{could have}} done lots more, put in much more work and {{developed}} more pictures, but I had also a desire to say what I felt about life. Simple things like a little picture in the window or {{the corner of the}} studio or an old stove in the kitchen have always been fascinating to me. They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, [...] "What have you got to say?" [...] I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> <b>you</b> love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E
