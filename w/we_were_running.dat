500|$|Arsenal {{exited the}} {{competition}} in the semi-finals against Middlesbrough. At Highbury, the setting for the first leg, Juninho scored the only goal of the tie. Arsenal's task of progressing was made more difficult after Keown was sent off in the second leg and Boudewijn Zenden doubled Middlesbrough's aggregate scoreline. Though Edu equalised for Arsenal on the night, Reyes' own goal earnt Middlesbrough the win. Wenger opined of the result: [...] "I don't think we deserved to lose; {{even when we were}} down to 10 men <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{also took}} the {{opportunity}} to mock the franchise itself, with Eurogamer suggesting that the series be made into a sitcom. Regarding the multiplayer, IGN's Greg Miller said, [...] "This mode was so boring I made up my own story. I was the Mommy Predator and Ryan from the IGN News Team was the Daddy Predator. We were protecting our children -- the cars in the large empty lot <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> around -- from the aliens." [...] 1UP.com's Patrick Klepek said, [...] "Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem fails to capitalize on its gaming heritage, instead falling prey to the same substandard licensed schlock we're used to from the films." ...|$|E
500|$|Petrov said he {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} after the race, having been in seventh position before his race-ending crash on lap forty-one. He stated, [...] "I am disappointed to end the race in the wall {{and not in the}} points, but it was encouraging to be running in the top ten". Barrichello, placed fifth before he ran wide on lap fifty-two and was passed by Kubica and Liuzzi, said, [...] "I was lucky with the timing of the safety car and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> in a good position right up until the closing stages. Unfortunately, I just ran out of tyre in the last five laps which cost us two places in the end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have any {{of these}} painted scaramouches {{anchored}} off the harbor towards which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running,</b> {{with the hope of}} cutting us off in entering?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Great gophers, boys, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> {{right into}} a nest of the rebels!" [...] he whispered. [...] "Back with you, {{before it is too}} late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you seen}} this proclamation?" [...] {{one of the}} villagers asked. [...] "You see that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> no little risk, in taking you in." ...|$|R
500|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Junqueira felt {{he could}} have won the race had a caution flag not been displayed. Franchitti was disappointed not to finish: [...] "It's such a shame because I really think we had {{a shot at the}} million dollars. We weren't really stretching the engine, either. We were just cruising along. We didn't want to lead the thing because of fuel consumption. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> in the draft, looking real good." [...] Despite his crash on lap 196, Fernández was pleased with his car as he felt comfortable driving along the race track: [...] "We were having a great race. This {{was one of the best}} cars I have had at a superspeedway." [...] Bräck stated his car experienced oversteer while driving alongside other competitors but felt his car ran efficiently. Tracy said his engine failure was a [...] "disappointment" [...] for his team and felt he had a car that could win the race. He said the event summed up a [...] "season of frustration" [...] but affirmed that his team would refocus and prepare for 2002. Autosport described it as similar to [...] "a NASCAR restrictor plate race" [...] because the cars often drove two or three abreast while racing in packs.|$|E
2500|$|... “At sunrise {{the faint}} {{outlines}} of Gaspar Island {{could be seen}} and as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> with a free wind 6 knots, by daylight were within 15 miles of it on our starboard bow. This is the Island where Capt. Gordon landed from the Memnon on Pulo Leat.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{achieved}} what he wanted, {{with the}} NCU's final acceptance of massed racing on the road, Stallard placed {{the continuity of}} the BLRC over {{the end of the civil}} war that the BLRC and the NCU had conducted. He said: [...] "The NCU were running road races and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> road races and there wasn't any need for amalgamation [...] at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it queer that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> into so many Germans?" [...] remarked Spouter. [...] "First that Herman Crouse on the train, and {{now these}} chaps." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lower the sail," [...] said Midwinter, quietly, [...] "and {{ship the}} oars. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> {{down on her}} fast enough now, {{whether we like it}} or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What think you," [...] {{the earl}} {{said to the}} captain, [...] "of our position? Where <b>are</b> <b>we,</b> and where will the course upon which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> take us?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Recalling his {{involvement}} with Foyt, Hutcherson said that [...] "A.J. had bought a Camaro to run USAC stock cars and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> at Texas World Speedway at College Station. He had gotten mad about what some reporters had written {{about him in the}} days before the race. Well he sat on the pole and was leading the race when he pulled in with just a couple laps to go. I leaned in the car and asked him what was wrong and he said, 'Overheating.' I looked at the gauges which were normal and said, 'Why'd you pull out?' He looked at me and said, 'I didn't want to talk to those reporters in Victory Circle.' We had the race won and he parked the damn car!" ...|$|E
2500|$|After calling at Madras on 13 February, she {{departed}} for Suez; her captain, Captain Kirton, had {{been instructed to}} land at Trincomalee with about £5,000 of Government treasure. Mrs. Inglis had kept a diary of the events during the siege of Lucknow to which she added her account of the wreck:We made good progress all that day (Tuesday). It was eight o'clock, a beautiful night, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> along at a great pace. Finding it very hot in the saloon after tea, [...] had come on deck, and {{were sitting on the}} bulwarks behind the wheel. Suddenly we were startled by a loud grating sound something like the letting down of an anchor, and just then saw a large rock close to us. I said, 'We must have touched that.' Several men rushed to the wheel, and then again we heard the same sound, only louder, and a quivering of the whole ship. She then remained stationary, only heaving backwards and forwards.|$|E
2500|$|After {{moving to}} San Diego {{in the summer}} of 1992, Hoppus was reunited with his sister Anne Hoppus, to whom he {{expressed}} his desire to be in a band. Anne attended Rancho Bernardo High School, and had become friends with new student Tom DeLonge over the summer. In August 1992, Anne introduced the two, and Hoppus and DeLonge immediately began performing music in DeLonge's garage. To impress DeLonge, Hoppus {{climbed to the top of}} a streetlight outside of DeLonge's home – however, he broke both ankles on the way down, resulting in being in crutches for the next few weeks. DeLonge recalled the meeting in 2000: [...] "When I first met Mark, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> around naked, doing weird stuff. We were up skateboarding until late hours of the morning, antagonizing security guards, and we were just always having fun." [...] DeLonge recruited old friend Scott Raynor from his days at Poway to become the drummer for the new band, named Blink.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Mary; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> {{straight}} {{before the}} wind, which is blowing {{right up the}} lake. There {{is nothing to be}} done but to keep straight before it." ...|$|R
6000|$|The encounter, however, {{had taken}} time, and now Ben called upon his {{companion}} to stop running. [...] "We {{want to know}} where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> to first," [...] he said. [...] "Listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{quarter of}} an hour at least," [...] replied Dave. [...] "It will depend {{somewhat}} on how much steam the firemen can get up. I don't believe <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> at full speed now." ...|$|R
60|$|Soon <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> {{through a}} suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship nor boat to be seen.|$|E
60|$|He {{had turned}} the canoe while speaking, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> up stream {{in less than two}} minutes after having sighted the Britishers.|$|E
6000|$|SECRETARY--[Alert and {{suspicious}} {{but with an}} easy laugh.] Think <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> a crap game? That door is never locked. What put that in your nut? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it {{was just}} to show he was run after. I wonder if he thinks <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> after him? Momma, I am tired of him! I wish he wouldn't speak to me any more." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{point of}} this {{objection}} seems to <b>be</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> the risk of watering down {{the meaning of the}} term instance if we thus contend that any minimization problem is an instance of the maximin model.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> behind dreadfully," [...] {{suggested}} Arthur, the bookkeeper, [...] "even since Thursday Smith {{enabled us}} to cut down expenses so greatly. The money that comes in never equals what we pay out. How long can you keep this up, girls?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running,</b> {{we could}} rig up a spinnaker," [...] the {{fisherman}} answered; [...] "but {{the wind has}} come round three points. We can do no more." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{told her}} as well as I could all about the wedding and how wild we were {{to see it and}} why <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> away to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "We had {{a narrow}} squeak of it, Mr. Ryan," [...] {{he said to}} the first-mate. [...] "All the time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> before that gale I had that group of islands on my mind." ...|$|E
60|$|We pelted on steadily, {{keeping the}} cab in sight, through dark mazy streets. God only, I thought, knows why <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> at all, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> hard. Fortunately <b>we</b> {{did not run}} far. The cab pulled up at the fork of two streets and Sir Walter paid the cabman, who drove away rejoicing, having just {{come in contact with}} the more generous among the rich. Then the two men talked {{together}} as men do talk together after giving and receiving great insults, the talk which leads either to forgiveness or a duel--at least so it seemed as we watched it from ten yards off. Then the two men shook hands heartily, and one went down one fork of the road and one down another.|$|R
60|$|Another brutal sea-superstition vindicated. From now on and for always these imbeciles of ours {{will believe}} that Finns <b>are</b> Jonahs. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> {{west of the}} Diego de Ramirez Rocks, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> west at a twelve-knot clip with an easterly gale at our backs. And the {{carpenter}} is gone. His passing, and {{the coming of the}} easterly wind, were coincidental.|$|R
40|$|We run economy {{not knowing}} rules of what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running.</b> Commonwealth maybe {{should be allowed}} to functionate under its own rules that should be discovered, similar to these in physics or biology. By the way, {{quantity}} value of what money measures should be discovered too. Greed in whatever appearance, direct or hidden, should be excluded completely. ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly I {{perceived}} that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> down the incline from Chalk Farm to Euston. I started at this passing of time. I {{turned on him}} with a brutal question, with the tone of Now or never.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not think}} much of her words at the time, but {{afterwards}} they came back to me. So we slipped away together, followed by the dog Koos, and soon <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> over the veldt with our faces set towards the country of the Zulu tribe.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me as if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> {{contrary}} to that which my master would have commanded, and there were tears in my eyes, of which I was not ashamed, when Nathaniel and I, hand in hand, followed Master Hunt out of the house we had helped to build.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{opportunities}} to connect with each other independently from time and space <b>are</b> increasing <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> {{the risk of losing}} control over our own time and get permanently stressed. Peaktime is an application concept that enables us to decide over our reachability and by that gives us the chance to take time off whenever we want...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{an idiot}} I have been," [...] he said, {{knitting}} his brows. [...] "Port, Margharita! The left string! That's right! Now, sit firm, {{and when we}} go down, lean to the other side. You mustn't mind {{if you get a}} little wet. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> in the teeth of the wind, and it will be roughish." ...|$|R
40|$|The science <b>is</b> compelling. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> {{heading in}} the wrong direction, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> out of time. In the {{critical}} period from now until 2020 global emissions must start to decline. The sooner we make the turn, the greater the chance that we can avoid the most dangerous consequences. This paper lays out the steps we can take now to achieve the turn toward safety...|$|R
