5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} {{is caused}} by exposure to oxygen at partial pressures greater than those to <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is normally exposed. This occurs in three principal settings: underwater diving, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, {{and the provision of}} supplemental oxygen, particularly to premature infants. In each case, the risk factors are markedly different.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth or}} proliferative phase, during <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> {{produces}} cells and protein {{to heal the}} puncture and the edges contract around the piercing, forming a tunnel of scar tissue called a fistula. This phase may last weeks, months, or longer than a year.|$|E

25|$|The {{activity}} of proteases is inhibited by protease inhibitors. One example of protease inhibitors is the serpin superfamily. It includes alpha 1-antitrypsin (<b>which</b> protects <b>the</b> <b>body</b> from excessive effects its own inflammatory proteases), alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (which does likewise), C1-inhibitor (<b>which</b> protects <b>the</b> <b>body</b> from excessive protease-triggered activation {{of its own}} complement system), antithrombin (<b>which</b> protects <b>the</b> <b>body</b> from excessive coagulation), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (<b>which</b> protects <b>the</b> <b>body</b> from inadequate coagulation by blocking protease-triggered fibrinolysis), and neuroserpin.|$|R
5|$|Humans evolved {{for life}} in Earth gravity, and {{exposure}} to weightlessness {{has been shown to}} have deleterious effects on the health of the human body. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> adjusts to the new environment. Longer term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise. Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns falls {{ill with}} hypohemia (a fictional {{condition}} in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> naturally {{runs out of}} blood, though it is akin to a real condition called hypovolemia) and needs a blood transfusion. His blood type, double O negative, is very rare, however, {{and none of the}} employees at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant have it. Homer discovers that Bart has double O negative blood and urges his son to donate, promising that he will be handsomely rewarded. Bart reluctantly agrees and his blood donation saves Mr. Burns' life. Mr. Burns is rejuvenated by the blood and he sends the Simpson family a thank you card. Enraged at Mr. Burns' paltry gesture, Homer writes an insulting reply, but Marge convinces him at the last minute not to send it. The next morning, Homer discovers that the letter is gone as Bart has mailed it.|$|E
5|$|Neuroacanthocytosis {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1950 as Bassen-Kornzweig disease, or Bassen-Kornzweig Syndrome, a rare, autosomal recessive, childhood-onset disorder in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> fails to produce chylomicrons, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Symptoms include ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, retinitis pigmentosa {{and other forms}} of nerve dysfunction. It was first noted by the North American physician Frank Bassen, who later partnered with the ophthalmologist Abraham Kornzweig to identify and describe causes and symptoms of the disease. Affected children appear normal at birth but usually fail to thrive during their first year.|$|E

25|$|Each {{locational}} term above {{can define}} {{the direction of}} a vector, and pairs of them can define , that is, lines of orientation. For example, blood can be said to flow in a proximal or distal direction, and anteroposterior, mediolateral, and inferosuperior axes are lines along <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> extends, like the X, Y, and Z axes of a Cartesian coordinate system. An axis can be projected to a corresponding plane.|$|E
25|$|There was {{originally}} a golden coffin inside the mausoleum, {{resting on a}} table with golden supports, inside of <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of Cyrus the Great was interred. Upon his resting place, was a covering of tapestry and drapes made from the best available Babylonian materials, using fine Median workmanship; below his bed was a fine red carpet, covering the narrow rectangular base of his tomb.|$|E
25|$|Transplantation {{medicine}} {{is one of}} the most challenging and complex areas of modern medicine. Some of the key areas for medical management are the problems of transplant rejection, during <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> has an immune response to the transplanted organ, possibly leading to transplant failure and the need to immediately remove the organ from the recipient. When possible, transplant rejection can be reduced through serotyping to determine the most appropriate donor-recipient match and through the use of immunosuppressant drugs.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} risk factors are obesity and older age. Other risk factors include major trauma, scoliosis, and {{certain types of}} surgery. There are two main types: a sliding hernia, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of the stomach moves up, and a paraesophageal hernia, in which an {{abdominal}} organ moves beside the esophagus. The diagnosis may be confirmed with endoscopy or medical imaging. Endoscopy is typically only required when concerning symptoms are present, symptoms are resistant to treatment, or the person is over 50 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Fluid {{movements}}: Flowing, sinuous {{movements in}} <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is in continuous motion, used to interpret melodic lines and lyrical sections in the music, or modulated to express complex instrumental improvisations. These movements require {{a great deal}} of abdominal muscle control. Typical movements include horizontal and vertical figures of 8 or infinity loops with the hips, horizontal or tilting hip circles, and undulations of the hips and abdomen. These basic shapes may be varied, combined and embellished to create an infinite variety of complex, textured movements.|$|E
25|$|The {{cost factor}} {{tends to make}} {{cremation}} attractive. Generally speaking, cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service, especially if direct cremation is chosen, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services. However, for some even cremation is still relatively expensive, especially {{as a lot of}} fuel is required to perform it. Methods to reduce fuel consumption/fuel cost include the use of different fuels (i.e. natural gas or propane, compared to wood) and by using an incinerator (retort) (closed cabin) rather than an open fire.|$|E

50|$|The chief {{types of}} {{inflammatory}} bowel disease are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). Inflammatory bowel diseases fall into the class of autoimmune diseases, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body's</b> own immune system attacks elements of the digestive system.|$|R
50|$|In medicine, mixed {{connective}} tissue disease (also known as Sharp's syndrome), commonly abbreviated as MCTD, is an autoimmune disease in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body's</b> defense system attacks itself. It was characterized in 1972, and {{the term was}} introduced by Leroy in 1980.|$|R
25|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} (a {{condition in}} <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> contains excess amounts of cortisol) may also influence childhood obesity. Researchers analyzed two isoforms (proteins {{that have the}} same purpose as other proteins, but are programmed by different genes) in the cells of 16 adults undergoing abdominal surgery. They discovered that one type of isoform created oxo-reductase activity (the alteration of cortisone to cortisol) and this activity increased 127.5 pmol mg sup when the other type of isoform was treated with cortisol and insulin. The activity of the cortisol and insulin can possibly activate Cushing's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 Geron Corporation {{received}} {{permission to}} resume {{a trial of}} its drug imetelstat for myelofibrosis after addressing FDA concerns over liver toxicity. Geron licensee Merck had approval of an IND for one vaccine type. Imetelstat (GRN163L) binds directly to the telomerase's RNA template. One 2015 study reported that Imetelstat caused partial or complete remission in seven of 33 patients, while a second reported that it decreased blood platelet levels in all 18 study patients with essential thrombocythemia, a disorder in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> overproduces blood platelets, increasing the risk of blood clots.|$|E
