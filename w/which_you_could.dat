25|$|The natives, whose {{presence}} causes so much disgust to you, often {{take pride in}} {{the fact that they are}} Italian subjects. In Libya, Somalia and in the recent war against their homeland, in foreign struggles, they have shielded you with their bodies, and sometimes paid with their lives. I can assure you that it is no exaggeration to say that the natives provided you the means with <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> overcome. The misinterpretation of so many merits and acts of heroism carried out for Italy can only be indicative of an essentially alien and imperial government.|$|E
500|$|Jude Law {{stars as}} Joseph [...] "Joe" [...] Sullivan, a.k.a. Sky Captain: He {{commands}} a private air force {{known as the}} Flying Legion. His personal aircraft is a modified Curtiss P-40. In 2002, producer Jon Avnet showed Law the teaser trailer and the actor was very impressed by what he saw. He remembers, [...] "All I got at that early stage was that he'd used pretty advanced and unused technology to create a very retrospective look." [...] Avnet gave him the script to read and some preliminary artwork to look at. Law: [...] "What was clear was also that at the center was a really great cinematic relationship, <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> put into any genre and it would work. You know, the kind of bickering [...] I always {{like to call it}} The African Queen meets Buck Rogers." [...] Avnet wanted to work with Law because he knew that the actor had [...] "worked both period, who worked both having theatrical experience, who worked on blue screen, who hadn't hit yet as a major action star." [...] The actor had just finished filming Cold Mountain (2003) and was intrigued at going from filming on real locations to working on a movie done completely on a soundstage. [...] Sky Captain would be one of three Jude Law films released by Paramount Pictures in 2004, along with the remake of Alfie (2004) and [...] Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). It also was one of six overall Jude Law films released that year.|$|E
2500|$|Hussain was {{alleged to}} have stated: [...] "More than praying we {{discussed}} work, politics, the war in Iraq ... we always had new films {{of the war in}} Iraq ... more than anything else those in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see Iraqi women and children who had been killed by US and UK soldiers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Frank J. Tipler, {{although}} {{a strong advocate}} for the many-worlds interpretation, has expressed some skepticism regarding {{this aspect of the}} theory. In a 2015 interview he stated [...] "We simply don't know...it might be that the modulus over the wavefunction of that possibility [...] is zero in which case there is no such world...There are universes out there, <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> imagine which...would not be actualized." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter and the Lost Boys {{live in the}} Home Under The Ground, {{which is}} {{accessed}} by sliding down hollowed tree trunks, one for each boy. [...] "It consisted of one large room, ... with a floor in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> dig {{if you wanted to}} go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through, level with the floor." [...] The Home Under the Ground also contains Tinker Bell's [...] "private apartment".|$|E
2500|$|In pre-release {{publicity}} for I have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, Ellison {{said that it}} would be a game [...] "you cannot possibly win". Though the gaming media found that the finished game backed away from this controversial promise, and Sears said that he had convinced Ellison that having a game with only negative endings was a bad idea, in a 2013 interview Ellison insisted that [...] "I created it so you could not win it. The only way in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> [...] "win" [...] was to play it nobly. The more nobly you played it, the closer to succeeding you would come, but you could not actually beat it. And that annoyed the hell out of people too." ...|$|E

50|$|FRESS was {{essentially}} a text-based system and editing links was a fairly complex task unless you {{had access to the}} PDS-1 terminal, in <b>which</b> case <b>you</b> <b>could</b> select each end with the lightpen and create a link with a couple of keystrokes.

50|$|In February 2011, the ASA banned another Betfair advert, that stated “On Betfair, you cut out {{the middle}} man, <b>which</b> means <b>you</b> <b>could</b> win bigger”. The {{regulator}} said that the description “cutting out the middleman” was ambiguous and misleading, because the site takes a commission fee on winnings, which could {{be perceived as a}} middleman role.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{never be}} a casuist!" [...] she exclaimed, {{with a touch of}} vehemence. [...] "You are much too positive.
