25|$|A {{peculiarity}} of the masnavi of the Ottoman {{period is}} that they almost always possess, beneath the literal meaning, a subtle spiritual signification. Many poems, of Mesnevi of Mevlana and the Divan of Aşık Paşha examples of confessedly religious, moral, or mystic but a much larger number are allegorical. To this latter class belong almost all the long romantic mesnevis of the Persian and mid Ottoman poets; in {{the stories of the}} loves of Leyla and Mecnun, Yusuf and Zuleykha, Kusrev and Shavin, Suleyman and Ebsal, and a hundred of like kind, can see pictured, if we look beneath the surface, the soul of man for God, or the yearning of the human heart after heavenly light and wisdom. There is not a character introduced into those romances but represents the passion not an incident but has some spiritual meaning. In the history of Iskender, or Alexander, <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> noble human soul in its struggles against the powers of this world, and, when aided by God and guided by the heavenly wisdom of righteous teachers, its ultimate victory over every earthly passion, and its attainment of that point of divine serenity whence it can look calmly down on all sublunary things.|$|E
500|$|Asked in a {{separate}} interview about the overall process of composing the music {{and how it is}} used in the episode, Djawadi revealed [...] "I sit with David and Dan and we do what's called a spotting session where <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> entire episode and then discuss when music should start and stop. Everybody's very involved with that. And it constantly gets played with. What I love about Game of Thrones is that the positioning of the music is so well done, because it's not overdone. When the music cuts in, it really has something to say." [...] "Light of the Seven" [...] reached No. 1 on Billboard's Spotify Viral 50 chart on its release.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates {{was asked}} if North Korea was helping Syria in the nuclear realm, but replied only that [...] "we are {{watching}} the North Koreans very carefully. <b>We</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> Syrians very carefully." ...|$|E

60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> dragon leap {{and twist}} {{and get the}} knight by the leg: and then perish. <b>We</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> knights burst into <b>the</b> castle. <b>We</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> {{wonderful}} armour-clashing embraces of the delivered knights, Orlando and his bosom friend and the little dwarf, clashing their armoured breasts to the breasts of their brothers and deliverers. <b>We</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> would-be tears flow.--And then the statue of the witch suddenly go up in flames, at which a roar of exultation from the boys. Then it was over. The theatre was empty in a moment, but the proprietors {{and the two men}} who sat near us would not let us go. We must wait for the next performance.|$|R

2500|$|As {{controversy}} has swirled around the map almost since its acquisition, authorities at Yale University {{chose not to}} comment on the authenticity of the parchment document, other than to say they watch the debate with unusual interest. [...] "We regard ourselves as the custodians of an extremely interesting and controversial document," [...] said Yale librarian Alice Prochaska in 2002, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> scholarly work on it with great interest." [...] More recently, Yale's Chester D. Tripp Professor of History, Paul Freedman, has stated that the map is [...] "unfortunately a fake".|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Behindwoods gave {{two and a}} half out of five stars citing that the film had a [...] "loose screenplay" [...] but was compensated by a [...] "power packed performance" [...] by the actors. The reviewer compared Arya and Vishal Krishna saying [...] "Unlike Vishal, Arya doesn’t have much scope over performance, but manages to remain under spotlights with his rib-tickling comedy tracks and dialogue delivery. Although we have the signature as ‘A Film By Bala’ during final credits, it’s worth mentioning that the film completely belongs to Vishal." [...] A reviewer from in.com gave three and half out of five and said that the movie is a [...] "definite watch for Bala's followers and to watch the new Vishal emerge as a performer". Further praising Vishal, the critic stats, [...] "there is no doubt that {{from the beginning of the}} making of the film, there has been so much riding on Vishal's character as he has been playing the role of a squint and has done a fab job." [...] Rohit Ramachandran of nowrunning.com gave it two out of five stars stating that [...] "Avan Ivan, in the end, is Vishal and Arya battling for recognition in the acting arena." [...] Supergoodmovies also gave three and a half stars and concluded that [...] "Avan Ivan will not let down the audience. Though not a typical Bala film, a feel of joy creeps as <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> film. It is one of the best technically made movies by Bala so far." ...|$|E
6000|$|Many {{an evening}} by the waters did <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> stately ships, [...] And our spirits rush'd {{together}} at the touching of the lips.|$|E

60|$|Memory {{is a rare}} ghost-raiser. Like {{a haunted}} house, its walls are ever echoing to unseen feet. Through the broken casements <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> flitting shadows of the dead, and the saddest shadows of them all are the shadows of our own dead selves.|$|E
60|$|We {{all of us}} enjoy a {{story of}} battle and adventure. Some of us delight in the anxiety and {{excitement}} with which <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> various strange predicaments, hairbreadth escapes, and ingenious contrivances that are presented to us; and the mere imaginary dread of the dangers thus depicted, stirs our feelings and makes us feel eager and full of suspense.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes, {{stretched}} {{at ease in}} {{the shade}} of a roadside tree, <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> motions of a labourer in a distant field, and after a time begin to wonder languidly as to what the fellow may be at. <b>We</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> movements of his body, the waving of his arms, we see him bend down, stand up, hesitate, begin again. It may add to the charm of an idle hour to be told the purpose of his exertions. If we know he is trying to lift a stone, to dig a ditch, to uproot a stump, we look with a more real interest at his efforts; we are disposed to condone the jar of his agitation upon the restfulness of the landscape; and even, if in a brotherly frame of mind, we may bring ourselves to forgive his failure. We understood his object, and, after all, the fellow has tried, and perhaps he had not the strength--and perhaps he had not the knowledge. We forgive, go on our way--and forget.|$|E

6000|$|The new Nemesis {{is really}} that which I have just put far from me--namely, that 'modern savages {{represent}} everywhere the Eocene stratum of religion.'

Mr. Max Muller, they represent an early stage in language 'In savage languages we {{see what we can}} no longer expect to see even in the most ancient Sanskrit or Hebrew. <b>We</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> childhood of language, with all its childish pranks.' {120c} ...|$|E
6000|$|The boy {{and girl}} listened to this silently and thoughtfully, for {{although}} the Queen smiled, she spoke with a dignity and authority that made them realize she {{was very much in}} earnest. But seeing that her guests looked serious and troubled, the little lady soon rose from the table, saying more cheerfully as she did so, [...] "It is nearly time for my army to drill, so, if it please you, we will sit upon the balcony and eat our ice cream while <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> soldiers." ...|$|E
6000|$|The exaltation, the sin, and the {{punishment}} of Tyre have been recorded for us, in perhaps the most touching words ever uttered by the Prophets of Israel against the cities of the stranger. But we read them as a lovely song; and close our ears to the sternness of their warning: for the very depth of the Fall of Tyre has blinded us to its reality, and we forget, as <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> bleaching of the rocks between the sunshine and the sea, that they were once [...] "as in Eden, the garden of God." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hst!" [...] I whispered, {{clutching}} at the arm {{that held the}} rein. Crouching low, <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> great Monnerie carriage, with its stiff-necked, blinkered, stepping greys and gleaming lamps sweep by.|$|R

60|$|We English are idealists; and on {{the stage}} {{especially}} reality stinks in our nostrils. The poor are vulgar, and in our franker moments we confess our wish to {{have nothing to do}} with them. The middle classes are sordid; we have enough of them in real life, and no desire to observe their doings at the theatre, particularly when we wear our evening clothes. But when a dramatist presents duchesses to our admiring eyes, we feel at last in our element; <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> acts of persons whom we would willingly meet at dinner, and our craving for the ideal is satisfied.|$|E
