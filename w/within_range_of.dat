5|$|Around 2 pm, the British barges {{carrying}} artillery floated {{down the}} La Chute River, and, contrary to plan, came down a channel between {{an island in}} the La Chute and the shore. This brought them <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> the French left and some of the fort's guns. Fire from cannons on the fort's southwest bastion's sank two of the barges, spurring the remaining vessels to retreat.|$|E
5|$|In June 1998 the SPLA {{captured}} {{the town of}} Ulu, close to the Adar Yale field, and in March 1999 the SPLA 13th battalion defeated a government brigade at the town. With this victory, the Adar Yale oilfield was <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> the SPLA's artillery.|$|E
5|$|The {{objectives}} of the German, Austrian and Ottoman advance were to capture Romani and to then establish a strongly entrenched position opposite Kantara, from which place their heavy artillery would be <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> the Suez Canal. The attacking force assembled in the southern Ottoman Empire at Shellal, north-west of Beersheba, and departed for the Sinai on 9 July 1916; they reached Bir el Abd and Ogratina ten days later.|$|E

50|$|On 1 December 1997, the SET {{introduced}} new {{floor and}} ceiling price limits for trading. The former limits allowed stock prices to fluctuate <b>within</b> a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 10%, while the current limits allow prices {{of a stock}} to fluctuate <b>within</b> a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 30% of the previous closing price on the main board. However, if the market price is less than 1 baht, stock prices may fluctuate <b>within</b> a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 100% of the previous closing price. Ceiling and floor limits apply to each trading board utilizing the AOM system, {{with the exception of}} the foreign board.|$|R
5|$|A last {{option was}} to attack fighter factories, {{which was not}} {{attempted}} on 18 August. Only the Spitfire factory at Southampton and the Hawker factory in Surrey were <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> escorted bombers. Without the Bf 109s, the bombers would suffer heavy casualties attempting to attack factories further north in daylight. Still, {{the attacks on the}} southern factories would require large concentrations of bombers and fighters which would be powerful enough to destroy them without sustaining heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of Ju 87s were also {{retained}} for anti-shipping operations in the Black Sea, a role it had proved so successful in when operating in the Mediterranean. In October 1943, this became evident again when StG 3 carried out several attacks against the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the Leningrad class destroyers Kharkov, Besposhchadny and Sposobny were caught and sunk by dive -bombing. After the disaster, Josef Stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> German aircraft without his personal permission.|$|E
5|$|Australian and Papuan troops {{advanced}} {{along the}} coast of the Huon Peninsula, using infantry, tanks, and air strikes against the Japanese positions, which were generally sited at creek crossings in the jungle. The advancing infantry kept strictly <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> the supporting artillery, which was liberally employed {{in the early stages of}} the operation. Using tactics that exploited the firepower of Australian artillery and armour, the Australian and Papuan troops inflicted heavy and disproportionate casualties on the Japanese as they advanced, ultimately linking up with the American forces at Saidor. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed; thousands more died from disease, malnutrition, exhaustion and suicide. The Allies failed to seize the opportunity to completely destroy the Japanese forces.|$|E

5|$|Because the minelayers were {{operating}} <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> German surface raiders, the American battleships were detailed {{to provide an}} escort for them, along with other units of the Grand Fleet. For the most part, these expeditions proved uneventful, but on two occasions, on 30 June and again on 8 August, lookouts on the battleships reported seeing U-boats or torpedoes in the water, forcing the Division to maneuver accordingly. Like the previous sightings made while escorting the Scandinavian Convoy, subsequent review of German war records revealed that both cases were false alarms.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, RAF Bomber Command firmly believed that air power could win wars {{without the need for}} naval and land fighting. It was thought the bomber would always get through. Tightly flown bomber formations with heavy defensive armament were thought capable of warding off enemy fighters even without fighter escort. However, the RAF lacked a four-engine bomber with adequate defensive protection which could carry heavy bomb loads to German targets. The only possible targets that were <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> British bombers were the industrial regions of the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{from their}} 26-yard line after a kickoff, Clemson {{attempted}} to again cut into Tech's lead. The Tigers, again {{guided by the}} running offense of Spiller and Jamie Harper, advanced to the 37-yard line, where Parker's passing attack took over. Parker completed two passes before Georgia Tech defender Jerrard Tarrant ran {{in front of a}} long throw downfield. He intercepted Parker's pass and returned it 50 yards to the Clemson 28, where Tech's offense began anew. Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a first down but still was <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> a 40-yard field goal from Blair, who extended the Yellow Jackets' lead to 33–20.|$|E

5|$|By 3 March, {{the convoy}} was <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> the air base at Milne Bay, and eight Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers from No. 100 Squadron RAAF {{took off from}} there. Because of bad weather only two found the convoy, and neither scored any hits, but the weather cleared after they rounded the Huon Peninsula. A force of 90 Allied {{aircraft}} took off from Port Moresby, and headed for Cape Ward Hunt, while 22 A-20 Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF attacked the Japanese fighter base at Lae, reducing the convoy’s air cover. Attacks on the base continued throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} {{one of the}} French ships had {{successfully}} escaped, but the other was still under pursuit, Captain Charles Linois of Atalante attempting a number of tactics to drive off his opponent but without success. Eventually, after a chase lasting nearly two days, the French ship came <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> the much larger British 74-gun third rate HMS Swiftsure and despite a brave defence was soon forced to surrender after suffering more than 40 casualties. Although he had surrendered his ship, Linois was widely praised for his actions in defending his ship against such heavy odds.|$|E
5|$|Following the Doolittle Raid, {{the next}} air attacks on Japan were made against the Kuril Islands in mid-1943. The liberation of Alaska's Attu Island in May 1943 during the Aleutian Islands Campaign {{provided}} the USAAF with bases <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> the Kurils. As {{part of the}} preparations for the liberation of Kiska Island in the Aleutians, the Eleventh Air Force {{conducted a series of}} raids against the Kurils to suppress the Japanese air units stationed there. The first of these attacks was made against southern Shumshu and northern Paramushiru by eight B-25s on 10July. The Kurils were attacked again on 18July by six B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, and the unopposed liberation of Kiska (Operation Cottage) took place on 15August.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Determination of {{cathepsin}} D (Cat D) {{concentration in}} serum and urine {{may be useful}} in the diagnosis of bladder cancer. The present study included 54 healthy patients and 68 patients with bladder cancer,  confirmed by transurethral resection or cystectomy. Cat D concentration was determined using a surface plasmon resonance imaging biosensor. Cat D concentration in the serum of bladder cancer patients was <b>within</b> the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 1. 3 - 5. 59 ng/ml, while for healthy donors it was <b>within</b> the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 0. 28 - 0. 52 ng/ml.

Cat D concentration may represent an efficient tumor marker,  as its concentration in the serum and urine of transitional cell carcinoma patients is extremely high when compared with healthy subjects...|$|R
5|$|For {{the next}} year, Pennsylvania {{provided}} shore bombardment during the Battles of Makin, Kwajalein, Eniwetok, and Saipan, {{along with the}} Palau Islands Campaign. The ship also participated in the landings on Leyte and the Battle of Leyte Gulf. During this time, Pennsylvania {{was present at the}} last battle ever between battleships, the Battle of Surigao Strait. The ship did not fire any salvos because the Japanese vessels were turned away or sunk at long range, beyond Pennsylvanias outdated fire control but <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> other, radar-directed battleships.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 the Allies {{lost some}} 8,000,000 tons of shipping, {{and though they}} {{replaced}} 7,000,000 tons, U-boats still managed to sink 1,160 out of the 1,664 Allied ships lost. Most of these sinkings {{took place in the}} mid-Atlantic gap, well <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> long-range Sunderlands and Liberators, only the Command lacked these aircraft in quantity. Following the entry of the United States of America into the war, German U-boats had plenty of targets. Coastal Command found it difficult to maintain strength. Its units now operated from the United States, West Africa, the Mediterranean, Iceland, Russia, Gibraltar, North Africa and the Middle East. Squadrons were also sent to the Pacific Theatre of Operations.|$|E

5|$|In January 1940, the U-boats opened another offensive. Some 21 Submarines sank 42 ships. All were east of 11°W, {{and thus}} <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> the Command’s aircraft. The {{situation}} worsened, {{although it was}} not disastrous until after the collapse of France. The need for long-range aircraft was identified by the first success of Coastal Command. A No. 228 Squadron Sunderland sighted a U-boat, , enable to submerge after sinking three ships. It directed Destroyers to engage it. U-55 was scuttled. Had {{it not been for the}} Sunderland, the submarine would have escaped.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945, XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} to redeploy to the Mariana Islands. The Command ceased its {{attacks on}} Japan and East Asia, {{for which it}} used bases in China to refuel the B-29s en route to their targets, and instead focused on targets in Southeast Asia that could be reached from Kharagpur. As there were few industrial targets <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> Kharagpur, the highest priority was given to attacking shipping in major ports such as Rangoon, Bangkok and Singapore as well as smaller harbours. Attacks were conducted through both conventional bombing and laying naval mines. As part of the transition, LeMay departed for the Mariana Islands on 18 January {{and was replaced by}} Brigadier General Roger M. Ramsey.|$|E
5|$|Nike Zeus was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} straightforward development of the earlier Hercules system giving it the ability to hit ICBM warheads at about the same range and altitude as the maximum performance of the Hercules. In theory, hitting a warhead is no more difficult than an aircraft; the interceptor does not have to travel any further or faster, the computers that guide it simply have to select an intercept point farther in front of the target to compensate for the target's much higher speed. In practice, the difficulty is detecting the target early enough that the intercept point is still <b>within</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> the missile. This demands much larger and more powerful radar systems, and faster computers.|$|E
