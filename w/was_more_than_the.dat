5|$|The {{game was}} {{programmed}} by Tod Frye, who {{was given a}} very limited time frame by Atari to complete the project. The technical differences between the Atari 2600 console and the original's arcade hardware—particularly the amount of available memory—presented several challenges to Frye. Given {{the popularity of the}} property, Atari produced approximately 12million units (which <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> estimated number of Atari 2600 consoles sold at the time), anticipating a high number of sales.|$|E

5|$|Stratton {{continued}} his experiments on perception, branching into studies on pseudoscopic vision, stereoscopic acuity, eye movements, symmetry and visual illusions, how people perceive depth seeing surroundings either one-eyed or two-eyed, acuity {{and limits of}} peripheral vision, apparent motion, afterimages impressed on the eye when a person stares at an object for long and then looks away, and problems with sight in half the visual field (hemianopsia). He both reviewed earlier studies on motion and conducted two of his own, concluding perceiving movement <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> sum of seeing successive sequential images. He also surveyed and reported in reviews in the Psychological Bulletin experiments at various labs, including those in Europe, on matters related to sensation and perception.|$|E
5|$|The BT19 was {{initially}} {{fitted with a}} Hewland HD (Heavy Duty) gearbox, originally designed for use with less powerful 2-litre engines. The greater power of the 3-litre Repco engine <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> gearbox could reliably transmit when accelerating at full power from rest, {{with the result that}} Brabham normally made very gentle starts to avoid gearbox breakages. The HD was later replaced with the sturdier DG (Different Gearbox) design, produced at the request of both Brabham and Dan Gurney's Anglo American Racers team. It later became a popular choice for other constructors.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{repatriation}} {{did not end}} there, though. Upon their return to Australia the effort shifted towards placing the returned soldiers into employment, or education {{and taking care of}} those that were too badly injured to work. In order to meet these needs the Commonwealth established the Repatriation Department, tasked with managing the placement of returned soldiers into employment, training, education, housing. Eventually this also included the colossal task of managing the provision of war pensions, managing repatriation hospitals and convalescent homes and administering the Soldier Settlement Scheme. The total cost of these provisions was considerable, and in June 1935 it was estimated to have cost approximately £238,000,000 which <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> total amount spent on defence during the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Christopher {{was part}} of an optimistic 1945 Athletics team, so much so that coach Earle Mack felt that Christopher, Black, Newsom and Jesse Flores were the best quartet of starting pitchers in the league. He spent most of spring training holding out for a new contract, which was eventually agreed on in the middle of March. He missed the first couple weeks of the season due to injury, and won his season debut on April 18, a 12-inning shutout against the Senators. He followed that up with a victory over the Boston Red Sox, allowing only one earned run in his first 21 innings of the season. In mid-June, Christopher had won ten games, which not only led the league, but <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> seven the rest of the Athletics pitching staff had combined. On July 21, Christopher {{was part of}} a 24-inning game against the Tigers that ended in a 1–1 tie; he went 13 innings in the game while Joe Berry pitched the other 11. Although Christopher had a strong start to the season, he struggled during the second half. He lost seven straight games over a two-month period before winning another on August 19 against the Tigers. He finished the year with a 13–13 record and a 3.17 ERA. He was selected to the American League All-Star team, however the game was canceled as a result of World War II.|$|E
