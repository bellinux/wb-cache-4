5|$|As House Speaker, Gingrich oversaw passage by the House of <b>welfare</b> <b>reform</b> <b>and</b> {{a capital}} gains tax cut in 1997. The poor showing by Republicans in the 1998 Congressional elections, a {{reprimand}} from the House for Gingrich's ethics violation, and pressure from Republican colleagues, resulted in Gingrich's resignation from the speakership on November 6, 1998. He resigned altogether from the House on January 3, 1999.|$|E

Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws. He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated <b>welfare</b> <b>reform,</b> <b>and</b> promoted increased subsidies for childcare. In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.|$|E

40|$|Through {{independence}} the Scottish Government aims {{to reverse}} {{many of the}} UK Government’s <b>welfare</b> <b>reforms,</b> <b>and</b> at the same time, <b>reform</b> the <b>welfare</b> system so that it improves the transition into work. There is an apparent trade-off between the desire to increase redistribution and improve work incentives. However, because different groups respond differently to particular incentives inherent in the tax and benefit system, {{the way in which}} these incentives are structured has important implications for labour market participation and inequality. An effective tax system minimises work disincentives where they matter most – for low earners, families with children, and those {{at the beginning and end}} of their working lives. This paper discusses how the balance between redistribution and work incentives is changing under current UK Government <b>welfare</b> <b>reforms,</b> <b>and</b> how an independent Scottish Government might balance this trade-off differently...|$|R
5|$|Mathias officially {{declared}} his candidacy for the Senate on February 10, 1968, calling for troop {{reductions in the}} Vietnam War, and identifying urban blight, racial discrimination, <b>welfare</b> <b>reform,</b> <b>and</b> improving public schools as major issues. As the campaign drew on, the two primary issues became the war and crime. Mathias argued that the extensive bombing campaigns in North Vietnam should be reduced, while Brewster had argued for increasing bombardment. Brewster adopted a hard line stance on law and order, while Mathias advocated addressing the precipitating causes of poverty and the low standard of living in urban ghettos. Campaign finances were also an issue, with controversy erupting over Brewster's receipt of $15,000 in campaign contributions from his Senate staff and their families. On November 5, 1968, Mathias was elected, garnering 48% of the vote to Brewster's 39% and perennial candidate George P. Mahoney's 13%.|$|E

In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress {{for the first time}} in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Clinton passed <b>welfare</b> <b>reform</b> <b>and</b> the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. Clinton is only the second U.S. president to ever be impeached. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.|$|E

25|$|Watts ran for Congress in 1994 {{to succeed}} Dave McCurdy, who had {{announced}} his retirement from the House of Representatives {{to run for the}} Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and <b>welfare</b> <b>reform,</b> <b>and</b> opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending. After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49percent to Apple's 48percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92percent name recognition in one poll. Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and focused on <b>welfare</b> <b>reform</b> <b>and</b> the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks. Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win. On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction. He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House.

25|$|King was Laurier's chosen {{successor}} {{as leader}} of the Liberal Party, but it was deeply divided by Quebec's total opposition to conscription and the agrarian revolt in Ontario and the Prairies. Levin argues that when King returned to politics in 1919, he was a rusty outsider with a weak base facing a nation bitterly split by language, regionalism and class. He outmaneuvered more senior competitors by embracing Laurier's legacy, championing labour interests, calling for <b>welfare</b> <b>reform,</b> <b>and</b> offering solid opposition to the Conservative enemy. When Laurier died in 1919, King was elected leader in the first Liberal leadership convention, defeating his four rivals on the fourth ballot. He won thanks to the support of the Quebec bloc, organized by his long-time lieutenant in Quebec, Ernest Lapointe (1876–1941). King could not speak French and had minimal interest in Quebec, but in election after election for the next 20 years (save for 1930), Lapointe produced the critical seats to give the Liberals control of the Commons. He was almost co-Prime Minister with King until his death in 1941.|$|E

40|$|A {{qualitative}} {{analysis of the}} geographies of responsibility pertaining to the recently reported increases in demand within the food bank system. Interviews were conducted with fifty volunteers and clients from the Edinburgh food bank community, in order to evaluate their views of responsibility for apparent increased demand for food banks, assuming an intersubjective approach (Savin-Baden and Howell Major, 2013). The UK Government denies any links between <b>welfare</b> <b>reforms</b> <b>and</b> trends of increased poverty, putting emphasis {{on the role of}} civil society in dealing with hunger (through Big Society rhetoric). This idea appears to be universally refuted by the food bank community and members of the opposition (including the devolved Scottish Government). Food bank workers felt a subjective, short-term obligation to their clients, but felt that state intervention was a more appropriate solution. Many saw injustice in the mere presence of food banks in their home town. Food bank clients felt a lack of control in their circumstances and that the moral responsibility and agency in maintaining structural injustice lay with the Government (Braham and van Hees (2012). By holding the state responsible through the recent <b>welfare</b> <b>reforms,</b> civil society puts pressure on the Government to accept responsibility and act accordingly. National pride in the UK Government was missing from all interviews, making it impossible to assign associated “concomitant responsibility” for involvement in the democratic process (Abdel-Nour, 2003). Alternatively, some saw an independent Scotland as the solution to issues of poverty. The Edinburgh food bank community call for politicisation of food poverty through governmental intervention and acceptance of responsibility. If links between <b>welfare</b> <b>reforms</b> <b>and</b> a rise in food poverty are found to be indubitably valid, the state will have to accept attributive responsibility.

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen a {{proliferation}} of writing by feminist economists. Feminist economists are not identified with one particular economic paradigm, yet some common methodological points seem to be emerging.

Its five main components are: incorporation of caring and unpaid labor as fundamental economic activities; use of well-being as a measure of economic success; analysis of economic, political, and social processes and power relations; inclusion of ethical goals and values as an intrinsic part of the analysis; and interrogation of differences by class, race-ethnicity, and other factors. The paper then provides brief illustrations of the use of this methodology in analyses of US <b>welfare</b> <b>reform,</b> gender <b>and</b> development, and feminist ecological economics.
