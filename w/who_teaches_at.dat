500|$|Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute, which {{promotes}} intelligent design, contested this, saying, [...] "the problem for their logic is that ID {{is not an}} arbitrary explanation, because we have much experience with intelligent agents producing the type of informational complexity we see in nature." [...] Columnist Jeff Jacoby wrote in The Boston Globe that intelligent design [...] "isn't primitivism or Bible-thumping or flying spaghetti. It's science." [...] This view of science, however, {{was rejected by the}} United States National Academy of Sciences. Peter Gallings of Answers in Genesis, a Young Earth Creationist ministry said [...] "Ironically enough, , in addition to mocking God himself, are lampooning the Intelligent Design Movement for not identifying a specific deity—that is, leaving open the possibility that a spaghetti monster could be the intelligent designer... Thus, the satire is possible because the Intelligent Design Movement hasn’t affiliated with a particular religion, exactly the opposite of what its other critics claim!" [...] Mark Coppenger, a pastor <b>who</b> <b>teaches</b> <b>at</b> the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, commented, [...] "I'm happy to say I think FSM hurts the evolutionists' program since, by mocking the Christian tradition... it reinforces the correct impression that there is genuine contempt for biblical faith in that camp... Besides, the parody is lame, and there are few things more encouraging than cheap shots from one's opponents." ...|$|E

500|$|Niffenegger is {{an artist}} <b>who</b> <b>teaches</b> <b>at</b> the Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She {{produced}} some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that The Time Traveler's Wife {{would have to be}} a novel: [...] "I got the idea for the title, and when I draw I have this big drawing table covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. So I wrote down this title and after a while I started to think about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, so I decided to write a novel." [...] She was intrigued by the title because [...] "it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel Man and Time: [...] "Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife." [...] Drawing her central theme from this image, she says, [...] "Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time." [...] Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.|$|E

2500|$|A Muslim <b>who</b> <b>teaches</b> <b>at</b> anti-extremism workshops, Hayward {{converted}} to Islam in 2005. He supports Muslims {{serving in the}} British armed forces {{and is a member}} of the UK Armed Forces Muslim Association. He has written regular politics-related columns in Emel and other Islamic magazines. In an article critical of some ostensible Muslim anger seen online, Hayward describes himself as [...] "a moderate and politically liberal revert who chose to embrace the faith of Islam because of its powerful spiritual truths, its emphasis on peace and justice, its racial and ethnic inclusiveness and its charitable spirit towards the poor and needy." [...] In 2010, he wrote the Introduction to Shaykh Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri's Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings (London: Minhaj-ul-Quran International). Hayward, who sharply criticizes all Islamic terrorism in the fatwa's introduction, shares Tahir-ul-Qadri's scholarly assessment [...] "that regardless of any motives, terrorism can never be supported and is in fact condemned by the Holy Quran and the Sunnah." [...] In 2011 Qadri appointed Hayward to a senior role as his (and Minhaj-ul-Quran's) Strategic Policy Advisor, although he ceased that role when he moved to the Middle East. Hayward also wrote and formally signed the [...] London Declaration, a Muslim public statement issued under the auspices of Minhaj-ul-Quran which unequivocally condemns all extremism and terrorism, [...] "because at the heart of all religions is a belief in the sanctity of the lives of the innocent." [...] The Declaration adds: [...] "The indiscriminate nature of terrorism, which has in recent years killed far more civilians and other non-combatants than it has combatants, is un-Islamic, un-Judaic, un-Christian and it is indeed incompatible with the true teachings of all faiths." [...] The London Declaration also [...] "unequivocally condemn anti-Semitism (including when sometimes it is disingenuously clothed as anti-Zionism), Islamophobia (including when it is sometimes disingenuously dressed up as patriotism) and all other forms of racism and xenophobia." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{complexity}} of the Croatian teacher education system lies in its traditional fragmentation into teacher education courses carried out at different higher education institutions. Thus, class teachers, <b>who</b> <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> lower primary school level, are educated at Teacher Colleges/Academies, whilst subject specialists, <b>who</b> <b>teach</b> <b>at</b> upper-primary school level and secondary schools, are educated at specific faculties within the university system. This fragmentation raises many issues regarding the status of teachers at different educational levels, their educational backgrounds, as well as further education and training.
