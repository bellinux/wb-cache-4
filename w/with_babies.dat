5|$|Potbelly sculptures {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{in a variety}} of manners. Investigators have theorised that potbelly sculptures represent dead ancestors. Alternatively, they have been associated <b>with</b> <b>babies</b> or with the poorly understood Fat God of Mesoamerican mythology. Potbelly monuments have also been associated with a group of supernatural entities associated with the domestic hearth. A further interpretation, based on the sculpture found at Teopán in western El Salvador, interprets potbelly figures as pregnant women at full term, possibly in the very act of giving birth.|$|E
5|$|Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George, {{as well as}} future Prime Minister Winston Churchill were in {{attendance}} for the match. The press billed the match as England versus Wales, and noted that the Welsh fans included high numbers of woman as well as mothers <b>with</b> <b>babies.</b> There were special trains laid on for the Cardiff fans, which began arriving at Paddington train station from 4am onwards. The Metropolitan Railway put on additional trains to commute fans from Baker Street station to Wembley Park; one every two minutes. Between 11am to kick off, 30,000 fans per hour travelled this route; some 100,000 fans were expected {{to arrive at the}} ground. The Welsh fans made special excursions across London; some travelled to St. Paul's Cathedral, where they sang Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. Other fans went to The Cenotaph, Whitehall, where they dressed it in Welsh colours to honour the veterans of the First World War.|$|E
25|$|While newborns {{who were}} exposed prenatally to {{drugs such as}} {{barbiturates}} or heroin frequently have symptoms of drug withdrawal (neonatal abstinence syndrome), this does not happen <b>with</b> <b>babies</b> exposed to crack in utero; at least, such symptoms are difficult to separate {{in the context of}} other factors such as prematurity or prenatal exposure to other drugs.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known purely artistic production {{were small}} ceramic figures {{that appeared in}} Tehuacán area around 1,500 BCE and spread to Veracruz, the Valley of Mexico, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas and the Pacific coast of Guatemala. The earliest of these are mostly female figures, probably associated with fertility rites because of their often oversized hips and thighs, {{as well as a}} number <b>with</b> <b>babies</b> in arms or nursing. When male figures appear they are most often soldiers. The production of these ceramic figures, which would later include animals and other forms, remained an important art form for 2000 years. In the early Olmec period most were small but large-scale ceramic sculptures were produced as large as 55cm.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the songs}} {{recorded}} barely resemble their earlier demo versions including [...] "Baby Ate My Eightball", which originally [...] "had this sort of Miami based rhythm <b>with</b> <b>babies</b> crying and glasses smashing" [...] and was [...] "very abrasive". The finished track (which features Huw Bunford [...] "impersonating a police or ambulance siren with the backing vocals") was mixed {{three or four times}} and [...] "barely resembles the original".|$|E
500|$|The {{panorama}} {{books are}} not Potter's best efforts, but do demonstrate {{her ability to}} pare text and illustrations to essentials. [...] She worked best, though, with more complicated plots and characters, and with specific settings rather than generalized backgrounds. [...] Her inexperience <b>with</b> <b>babies</b> and very young children {{is evident in the}} original panorama format itself, for a long strip of paper and a wallet are likely to be mutilated by the very young. The story in its current standard small book format of the Peter Rabbit series is considered to provide very young children with an introduction to books in general and to the world of Peter Rabbit.|$|E

500|$|A Fierce Bad Rabbit {{focuses on}} a {{traditional}} rather than a creative approach to storytelling and reflects Potter's inexperience <b>with</b> <b>babies</b> and very young children. [...] She {{appears to be more}} interested in naming and designating this or that rather than developing plot and exploring character. She names and directs the child's attention to the rabbit's tail, whiskers, and claws, for example, rather than to the animal's facial expression. When the hunter appears, he is blandly introduced with [...] "This is a man with a gun." [...] The gun goes off as expected with the stereotypical [...] "BANG!" [...] instead of a more creative onomatopoeia term Potter would have surely devised had she been writing this book for older children.|$|E
500|$|In the 1930s, David Levy noted a {{phenomenon}} he called [...] "primary affect hunger" [...] in children removed very early {{from their mothers}} and brought up in institutions and multiple foster homes. These children, though often pleasant on the surface, seemed indifferent underneath. He questioned whether {{there could be a}} [...] "deficiency disease of the emotional life, comparable to a deficiency of vital nutritional elements within the developing organism". A few psychiatrists, psychologists and paediatricians were also concerned by the high mortality rate in hospitals and institutions obsessed with sterility to the detriment of any human or nurturing contact <b>with</b> <b>babies.</b> One rare paediatrician {{went so far as to}} replace a sign saying [...] "Wash your hands twice before entering this ward" [...] with one saying [...] "Do not enter this nursery without picking up a baby".|$|E
500|$|WALL-E went undeveloped {{during the}} 1990s partly because Stanton and Pixar were not {{confident}} enough yet {{to have a}} feature length film with a main character that behaved like Luxo Jr. or R2-D2. Stanton explained {{there are two types}} of robots in cinema: [...] "human with metal skin", like the Tin Man, or [...] "machine with function" [...] like Luxo and R2. He found the latter idea [...] "powerful" [...] because it allowed the audience to project personalities onto the characters, as they do <b>with</b> <b>babies</b> and pets: [...] "You're compelled ... you almost can't stop yourself from finishing the sentence 'Oh, I think it likes me! I think it's hungry! I think it wants to go for a walk!'" [...] He added, [...] "We wanted the audience to believe they were witnessing a machine that has come to life." [...] The animators visited recycling stations to study machinery, and also met robot designers, visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to study robots, watched a recording of a Mars rover, and borrowed a bomb detecting robot from the San Francisco Police Department. Simplicity was preferred in their performances as giving them too many movements would make them feel human.|$|E

500|$|On 17–18March the River Trent {{overtopped}} {{its banks}} in Nottingham. Large {{parts of the}} city and surrounding areas were flooded, in which 9,000 properties and nearly a hundred industrial premises were affected– some to first-floor height. The suburbs of Long Eaton, West Bridgford and Beeston suffered particularly badly. Two days later, in the lower tidal reaches of the river, the peak of the flood combined with a high spring tide to flood villages and 2,000 properties in Gainsborough. River levels dropped when the floodbank at Morton breached, resulting in the flooding of some [...] of farmland in the Trent valley. The flooding subsided in the west of the country by 20March but rivers in the east were still rising and the Wharfe, Derwent, Aire and Ouse all burst their banks in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Selby was also badly affected with 70per cent of houses being flooded. More than 100,000 properties were affected by the flooding and the Army worked {{to prevent the spread of}} the floodwater, particularly at pumping plants and power stations. Royal Engineers on national service handed out milk to families <b>with</b> <b>babies</b> and the Australian Red Cross assisted in Gloucester. The people of Canada sent food parcels to villages in Suffolk and the Premier of Ontario, George A. Drew, offered to help distribute them personally. The flooding lasted for about a week, with some waters taking an additional ten days to subside.|$|E

2500|$|Although most {{commonly}} worn by and associated <b>with</b> <b>babies</b> and children, diapers are also worn by adults {{for a variety}} of reasons. In the medical community, they are usually referred to as [...] "adult absorbent briefs" [...] rather than diapers, which are associated with children and may have a negative connotation. The usage of adult diapers can be a source of embarrassment, and products are often marketed under euphemisms such as incontinence pads. [...] The most common adult users of diapers are those with medical conditions which cause them to experience urinary like bed wetting or fecal incontinence, or those who are bedridden or otherwise limited in their mobility.|$|E

2500|$|A {{large group}} of {{approximately}} 70–80villagers was rounded up by 1stPlatoon in Xom Lang, and then led to an irrigation ditch {{to the east of}} the settlement. All detainees were pushed into the ditch and then killed after repeated orders issued by Lieutenant Calley, who was also shooting. PFC Paul Meadlo testified that he expended several M16 magazines. He recollected that women were allegedly saying [...] "No VC" [...] and were trying to shield their children. He remembered that he was shooting into women <b>with</b> <b>babies</b> in their hands since he was convinced at that time that they were all booby-trapped with grenades and were poised to attack. On another occasion during the security sweep of My Lai, Meadlo again fired into civilians side-by-side with Lieutenant Calley.|$|E
2500|$|The IWW {{responded by}} sending Bill Haywood, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn {{and a number}} of other {{organizers}} to Lawrence. Haywood participated little in the daily affairs of the strike. Instead, he set out for other New England textile towns in an effort to raise funds for the strikers in Lawrence. This tactic proved very successful. The union established an efficient system of relief committees, soup kitchens, and food distribution stations, while volunteer doctors provided medical care. The IWW raised funds on a nationwide basis to provide weekly benefits for strikers and dramatized the strikers' needs by arranging for several hundred children to go to supporters' homes in New York City for the duration of the strike. When city authorities tried to prevent another 100 children from going to Philadelphia on February 24 by sending police and the militia to the station to detain the children and arrest their parents, the police began clubbing both the children and their mothers while dragging them off to be taken away by truck; one pregnant mother miscarried. The press, there to photograph the event, reported extensively on the attack. [...] Moreover, when the women and children were taken to the Police Court, most of them refused to pay the fines levied and opted for a jail cell, some <b>with</b> <b>babies</b> in arms.|$|E

Still, you see, Clinton, there is a question whether this woman will consent to part with both the children." ...|$|E
