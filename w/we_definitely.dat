500|$|Barton Fink uses several stylistic {{conventions}} {{to accentuate}} the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward.

His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe (which he has presumably been polishing) suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements– [...] combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence– [...] create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that [...] "the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And <b>we</b> <b>definitely</b> wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling".|$|E

500|$|The song's {{usage of}} the word [...] "ironic" [...] {{attracted}} media attention for an improper application of the term; according to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the song gives a distinct [...] "unironic" [...] sense in its implications. [...] According to the Oxford English Dictionary [...] "irony" [...] is [...] "a figure of speech in which the intended meaning {{is the opposite of}} that expressed by the words used". Thus, lyrics such as [...] "It's like rain on your wedding day" [...] and [...] "A traffic jam when you're already late" [...] are not ironic. Morissette commented about the writing of the song: [...] "For me the great debate on whether what I was saying in 'Ironic' was ironic wasn't a traumatic debate. I'd always embraced the fact that {{every once in a while}} I'd be the malapropism queen. And when Glen and I were writing it, <b>we</b> <b>definitely</b> were not doggedly making sure that everything was technically ironic". In 2014, Michael Reid Roberts penned for Salon.com a defense of the song's use of the term [...] "ironic", as the song cites situational ironies, which is defined as the [...] "state of affairs or event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often [...] amusing as a result", as some of the situations described in the lyrics could in fact be said to be [...] "ironic".|$|E
