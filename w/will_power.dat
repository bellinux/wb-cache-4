During Crash's progression, Coco occasionally hacks into his holograph projector and warns Crash of her uncertainty of Cortex's true intentions. It is not until Crash has gathered the crystals that Coco {{is able to}} reveal Cortex's ultimate plan: with the energy harnessed from the planetary alignment, Cortex <b>will</b> <b>power</b> the gigantic Cortex Vortex built onto his space station and brainwash everyone on Earth into serving his army. Crash manages to defeat Cortex before the crystals can be used, but leaves the Cortex Vortex drifting aimlessly into space. Crash redeems himself by collecting the world's gems for Brio, who reveals that the gems can harness planetary energy as well and invites him to the completion of his laser device; Crash activates the laser and destroys the Cortex Vortex, breaking the space station apart.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{practice}} session, Chip Ganassi Racing driver Scott Dixon recorded the fastest lap, ahead of Team Penske's Ryan Briscoe, the Andretti Autosport car of Tony Kanaan and Briscoe's teammate <b>Will</b> <b>Power.</b> Due to the slippery {{nature of the}} circuit, drivers were caught out and ended up inflicting damage to their cars. Defending series champion Dario Franchitti ventured down the escape road before damaging his suspension against the Turn 8 wall. He ended the session in seventeenth position.

5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were {{held on the}} Friday before the race: each lasted for an hour. A third session, also an hour long, {{took place on the}} Saturday morning prior to qualifying. The first session provided limited opportunities to the drivers due to heavy rain and standing water on the course. As a result, only 11 of the 25 entrants participated in the session, of which Takuma Sato set the fastest time. Conditions improved during the second practice, and all 25 drivers set times. <b>Will</b> <b>Power</b> was quickest; marginally over a tenth of a second faster than Wilson. Ryan Briscoe, Simon Pagenaud and Tony Kanaan completed the top five, all recording times within half a second of Power. In the third practice, Scott Dixon recorded the fastest time, trailed by Power and Ryan Hunter-Reay. Briscoe and Wilson also lapped the track in under 72 seconds to finish among the five quickest drivers.|$|E

5|$|The race, {{the sixth}} of the season, began at 3:30p.m. EST, and was {{televised}} {{live in the}} United States on ABC. Scott Dixon held his lead from pole position, with <b>Will</b> <b>Power</b> behind him. Justin Wilson made light contact with a wall during the first lap of the race, and pitted shortly after due to a flat right-rear tire. The team discovered additional damage to the suspension that required lengthy repairs, but {{he was able to}} return to the race. During the fifth lap, some teams reported that parts of the track were deteriorating, but it was not felt that any action needed to be taken. Three laps later, Rubens Barrichello, who had gained four places started suffering mechanical problems, which forced him to retire from the race after eleven laps. Wilson set the fastest lap of the race during the ninth lap, completing a circuit in 1 minute 12.0651 seconds. On lap 10, Ryan Hunter-Reay blocked Ryan Briscoe from passing him, drawing a warning from race director Beaux Barfield. Sébastien Bourdais, who, along with Alex Tagliani and Oriol Servia, was running his first street race of the season without a Lotus engine, had made it to seventh before suffering mechanical problems which curtailed his race after 24 laps. James Jakes, who was suffering from problems with his brakes throughout {{the early part of the}} race eventually retired on lap 36, having spent ten laps in the pits earlier trying to resolve the issue.|$|E

50|$|Nonetheless, in his {{notebooks}} {{he continues}} to expand {{the theory of the}} <b>will</b> to <b>power.</b> Influenced by his earlier readings of Boscovich, he began to develop a physics of the <b>will</b> to <b>power.</b> The idea of matter as centers of force is translated into matter as centers of <b>will</b> to <b>power.</b> Nietzsche wanted to slough off the theory of matter, which he viewed as a relic of the metaphysics of substance.|$|R
5000|$|Schopenhauer's [...] "Will to life" [...] thus {{became a}} {{subsidiary}} to the <b>will</b> to <b>power,</b> {{which is the}} stronger will.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine Nietzsche's {{relation}} to the life sciences of his time and to Darwinism in particular, arguing that {{his account of the}} <b>will</b> to <b>power</b> in terms of technics eschews three metaphysical prejudices, hylemorphism, utilitarianism, and teleological thinking. Telescoping some of Nietzsche's pronouncements on the <b>will</b> to <b>power</b> with a Bergsonian lens, our reading of the <b>will</b> to <b>power,</b> as an operation productive of time, the future or life, offers an alternative to Heidegger's.

5000|$|Opposed to a {{biological}} and voluntary {{conception of the}} Wille zur Macht, Heidegger also argued that the <b>will</b> to <b>power</b> {{must be considered in}} relation to the Übermensch and the thought of eternal recurrence—although this reading itself has been criticized by Mazzino Montinari as a [...] "macroscopic Nietzsche". Gilles Deleuze also emphasized the connection between the <b>will</b> to <b>power</b> and eternal return. Both Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze were careful {{to point out that the}} primary nature of <b>will</b> to <b>power</b> is unconscious. This means that the drive to power is always already at work unconsciously, perpetually advancing the will of the one over the other. This thus creates the state of things in the observable or conscious world still operating through the same tension. Derrida is careful not to confine the <b>will</b> to <b>power</b> to human behavior, the mind, metaphysics, nor physical reality individually. It is the underlying life principle inaugurating all aspects of life and behavior, a self-preserving force. A sense of entropy and the eternal return, which are related, is always indissociable from the <b>will</b> to <b>power.</b> The eternal return of all memory initiated by the <b>will</b> to <b>power</b> is an entropic force again inherent to all life.|$|R
2500|$|Related to {{his theory}} of the <b>will</b> to <b>power,</b> is his speculation, {{which he did not}} deem final, {{regarding}} the reality of the physical world, including inorganic matter—that, like man's affections and impulses, the material world is also set by the dynamics of a form of the <b>will</b> to <b>power.</b> At the core of his theory is a rejection of atomism—the idea that matter is composed of stable, indivisible units (atoms). Instead, he seems to have accepted the conclusions of Ruđer Bošković, who explained the qualities of matter {{as a result of an}} interplay of forces. One study of Nietzsche defines his fully developed concept of the <b>will</b> to <b>power</b> as [...] "the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation" [...] revealing the <b>will</b> to <b>power</b> as [...] "the principle of the synthesis of forces." [...] Of such forces Nietzsche said they could perhaps be viewed as a primitive form of the will. Likewise he rejected as a mere interpretation the view that the movement of bodies is ruled by inexorable laws of nature, positing instead that movement was governed by the power relations between bodies and forces. Other scholars disagree that Nietzsche considered the material world to be a form of the <b>will</b> to <b>power.</b> Nietzsche thoroughly criticized metaphysics, and by including the <b>will</b> to <b>power</b> in the material world, he would simply be setting up a new metaphysics. Other than aphorism 36 in Beyond Good and Evil, where he raised a question regarding <b>will</b> to <b>power</b> as being in the material world, it was only in his notes (unpublished by himself), where he wrote about a metaphysical <b>will</b> to <b>power.</b> Nietzsche directed his landlord to burn those notes in 1888 when he left Sils Maria for the last time.|$|R
