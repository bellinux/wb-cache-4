The 40-year agreement is a public-private partnership between the BWJV and the city in which the private partners pay off the Bayonne Municipal Utility Authority's (BMUA) $130 million debt and take over the operations, maintenance, and capital improvement of Bayonne's water and wastewater utilities {{in exchange for a}} regulated share of the revenue.

5000|$|On the {{far side}} of the hills to the south of the town a natural dip held a {{freshwater}} lake known as Shaws Water at a level high above the town. The civil engineer Robert Thom from Rothesay prepared a scheme to turn this into a reservoir and create the aqueduct which became known as The Cut. The Shaws <b>Water</b> <b>Joint</b> Stock Company was incorporated on 10 June 1825 with capital of £30,000, and the scheme was officially opened on 16 April 1827. On that day a grain mill, paper mill, power loom manufactory and a sugar refinery made use of the power from the water running north down to the sea for a vertical height of around 170 m, at a rate of about [...] of water per day. In 1845 The Kelly Cut was constructed to bring more water to Loch Thom from the south. Numerous other mills were added in Greenock to make use of the supply, including what became The Merino Mills weaving woollen cloth, and a mill grinding clay for a local pottery works.|$|E
50|$|In December 2012, the {{autonomous}} agency {{entered into a}} water management agreement with the Bayonne <b>Water</b> <b>Joint</b> Venture (BWJV), a partnership between United Water and investment firm Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts. The 40-year concession agreement is a public-private partnership between {{the city and the}} BWJV in which the private partners pay off the BMUA's $130 million debt and take over the operations, maintenance, and capital improvement of Bayonne's water and wastewater utilities in exchange for a regulated share of the revenue. United Water is managing the operations for the partnership, while KKR is providing 90% of the funding. A rate schedule was included in the agreement, and it contained an immediate 8.5% utility rate increase (the first rate increase since 2006), followed by two years without increases, followed by annual increases estimated to range between 2.5% - 4.5%. This partnership was sought for several reasons, including the BMUA's debt, its shortage of skilled employees, and its lagging rate revenue from years without rate increases and reduced demand. Part of this reduced demand stemmed from the closure of the Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne, {{and the fact that the}} subsequent plans to redevelop the site with housing fell short. The BMUA's $130 million debt that was paid off by the BWJV represented over half of Bayonne's overall debt ($240 million) at the time, and in March 2013, Moody's Investors Service upgraded the credit rating of Bayonne from 'negative' to 'stable', citing the water deal.|$|E

40|$|In Tanzania, ongoing land {{insecurity}} is {{a structural}} cause of food insecurity particularly for pastoralists, agro-pastoralists and small-scale crop farmers leading to land use conflicts, compromised {{access to resources}} including grazing and water and rangeland degradation. Land tenure security and management can be improved through village land use planning (VLUP) and land certification – namely the issuing of certificates of customary rights of occupancy (CCROs). In situations where villages share resources such as grazing areas and <b>water,</b> <b>joint</b> village land use planning {{and the provision of}} group CCROs are more appropriate. Due to a lack of resources and capacity the implementation of these has been limited to date and particularly in ‘difficult’ areas where land use conflicts occur. Indeed only about 1. 28 million hectares or 2. 1 % of the 60 million hectares of rangelands is protected as grazing in village land use plans [in 479 villages in 69 districts] (21 regions) (Ministry of Lands 2015). Between 2010 - 2015 the Sustainable Rangeland Management Project (SRMP) assisted nine villages to carry out village land use planning, and successfully piloted the implementation of joint village planning across three of these, leading to the protection through certification of a shared grazing area called OLENGAPA, found in Kiteto District, Manyara Region.
