25|$|The band's sound {{gradually}} took on {{a heavier}} tone as Hoppus and Barker purchased a studio in which to record. Although hotly anticipated by music press, the band's debut, <b>When</b> <b>Your</b> Heart Stops Beating (2006), undersold commercial expectations and received mixed reviews from critics. The group toured worldwide throughout 2006 and 2007, including a summer slot on the Honda Civic Tour alongside Fall Out Boy. Hoppus later began preparing material for a solo album and put plans for a second +44 album on hold in 2008, and the group entered an extended hiatus with the reunion of Blink-182 in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Of the Eucharistic celebration he says: “A sacrament is not 'a magical rite' {{but rather}} the {{instrument}} God has chosen {{in order to continue}} to walk beside man as his travelling companion through life”. In a brief address to liturgists on the anniversary of Musicam Sacram, Francis mentions eight times the importance of the peoples’ active participation in song. In an address to charismatics he reemphasizes this: “You are able to shout out <b>when</b> <b>your</b> team scores a goal, and you cannot sing the Lord’s praises and leave behind your composure a little to sing”. As regards his own singing at Mass, he has pointed out that since he had the upper portion of his right lung removed, he is too short of breath.|$|E
25|$|The {{valuable}} long-range sliders {{have to be}} {{shielded from}} attack by the enemy's much less-valuable steppers by operating from behind your own steppers, or they would get quickly lost through fork attacks. As the steppers start on the back rank, {{they need to be}} developed before you can engage the opponent. This is usually done by pushing the Pawns one rank forward, creating a passage through the 3rd rank by moving up some of the sliders there, and walk Copper, Silver and Leopard to the 4th rank and beyond through the resulting corridor. One of the Side Movers is usually moved up to 4th rank, so that <b>when</b> <b>your</b> own camp empties as a result of launching your attack, the Side Movers prevent entry of the enemy Lion by controlling 3rd and 4th rank.|$|E

25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching <b>when</b> <b>your</b> action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.|$|E

Ahn filed a criminal libel case against the accuser, a British English teacher living in Seoul. The man retaliated by posting the allegations against Ahn publicly on his blog and in ESL teacher forums, starting a social media firestorm of condemnation. Ahn wrote that In Internet forums I was called a [...] "violent pornographer," [...] a 'child molester,' and a 'serial rapist.' I began receiving hate mail. One of my detractors had this to say: [...] "We will have won when you leave this country broken, blacklisted and <b>when</b> <b>your</b> name {{is a symbol of}} deceit, lies and a perfect example of what NOT to be in Korea.

500|$|Leon Eric [...] "Kix" [...] Brooks III {{was born}} May 12, 1955 in Shreveport, Louisiana and {{before moving to}} Nashville in 1979, he played at various venues in Maine. He was also a {{neighbor}} of country singer Johnny Horton. Brooks worked as a songwriter in the 1980s, co-writing the number-one singles [...] "I'm Only in It for the Love" [...] by John Conlee, [...] "Modern Day Romance" [...] by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and [...] "Who's Lonely Now" [...] by Highway 101, plus The Oak Ridge Boys' top 20 hit [...] "You Made a Rock of a Rolling Stone", Nicolette Larson's [...] "Let Me Be the First", and Keith Palmer's [...] "Don't Throw Me in the Briarpatch".

500|$|On {{an unknown}} date in 1702, the 1st Duke of Richmond's XI {{defeated}} an Arundel XI at an unspecified venue in Sussex. The source for {{this game is}} a receipt sent by one Saul Bradley to the Duke on Monday, 14 December 1702. The receipt was for one shilling and six pence paid by the Duke [...] "for brandy <b>when</b> <b>your</b> Grace plaid at Cricket with Arundel men". It is thought the brandy was bought to celebrate a victory. The venue was probably either Goodwood, where Richmond had his estate, or Arundel, possibly on Bury Hill which was used for cricket in later years. Arundel was a prominent centre of cricket in the 18th century.|$|E

500|$|Davey {{has been}} {{referred}} to as [...] "Ireland's Björk". The comparison caused the Irish Independents Ed Power to comment in one 2009 review: [...] "Alas, such comparisons are probably inevitable <b>when</b> <b>your</b> favourite mode of communication is an ethereal yelp and your songs are populated with a raggle-taggle of yearners, outsiders and freaks". His colleague John Meagher opined, [...] "you won't see Björk heft a guitar half so diligently". Hot Press compared the music on Something Ilk to the works of PJ Harvey and Nina Hynes. The magazine's reviewer also compared her to Joni Mitchell after one 2007 show in Cork. Davey's second album, Tales of Silversleeve, based its sound on the rhythm of the drums. Notable fans of Davey's music include broadcaster Síle Ní Bhraonain. Her records have achieved platinum sales.|$|E
500|$|According to Lo, {{the songs}} on her {{extended}} play Truth Serum are about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship. She stated, [...] "In its entirety, [...] a love story from beginning to end. The song 'Love Ballad' is about the moment you decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed up and {{you just want to}} freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, <b>when</b> <b>your</b> broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". In an interview with Klap Magazine, Lo said, [...] "'Love Ballad' is actually supposed to be a way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him. He's worth the pain. A bit exaggerated but that's what it feels like when you're so into someone".|$|E

If {{he wants to have}} any political future, endorsing Mitt Romney now is the smart thing to do." [...] McCotter's neighbor, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, remarked, [...] "He tried it out, obviously it wasn't working. And he's doing the rational thing and dropping out." [...] Steve Kornacki of Salon summarized the overall campaign as [...] "a cautionary tale about what can go wrong <b>when</b> <b>your</b> average backbench member of Congress becomes a minor cable news celebrity and mistakes it for having a genuine national following." ...|$|E
