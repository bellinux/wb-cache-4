40|$|We have {{investigated}} Th cell {{recognition of the}} HIV core protein p 24 by using CD 4 + T cell clones derived from cynomolgus macaques immunized with hybrid HIV p 24 :Ty virus-like particles (VLP). T cell lines from two immunized animals responded to p 24 :Ty-VLP, control Ty-VLP, purified p 24, and <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> <b>HIV,</b> indicating the presence of T cells specific for p 24 {{as well as the}} Ty carrier protein. The HIV determinants recognized by the T cell lines were identified by using a series of overlapping peptides synthesized according to the sequence of p 24. Both T cell lines recognized peptide 11 (amino acids 235 - 249) and peptide 14 (amino acids 265 - 279). In addition, one T cell line also responded to peptide 9 (amino acids 215 - 229). Definitive identification of two T cell epitopes on p 24 was confirmed at the clonal level: from a total of four T cell clones generated from one of the T cell lines, two respond specifically to peptide 11 and two to peptide 14. The T cell clones were CD 4 ' and MHC class 11 -restricted and secreted IL- 2 in response to stimulation with purified p 24, inactivated HIV or a single synthetic peptide. The specificityof the Th clones for variant peptides demonstrated cross-reactivity with two simian immunodeficiency virus isolates, but only limited responses to HIV- 2 sequences. However, the Th cell epitopes identified on p 24 are highly conserved between 12 HIV- 1 isolates and were recognized by both of the immunized primates. These sequences may therefore be useful for priming a broadly reactive immune response to HIV- 1...|$|E

40|$|Animal {{models of}} HIV- 1 {{have a key}} {{role to play in}} elucidation of the {{cellular}} mechanisms responsible for protective immunity. Vaccination of domestic cats with <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) elicits virus-neutralizing Abs and virus-specific CTL in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs and affords protection from homologous virus challenge. In the present study we confirm the induction of virus-specific CTL following immunization with <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> FIV vaccine and demonstrate that cats are protected for up to 1 yr following vaccination. Long term protection in vaccinated cats correlates with both higher levels of FIV Env-specific CTL in the peripheral blood following vaccination and the presence of FIV Env-specific memory CD 8 + CTL in the lymph nodes, which persist for up to 1 yr following challenge in the absence of detectable virus. The CTL responses observed in vaccinated protected cats differ qualitatively from those in FIV-infected cats. The latter cats either do not generate a memory CTL response or exhibit a Gag-specific memory CTL response.

40|$|Abstract. Stockpiling of pre-pandemic {{influenza}} vaccines guarantees immediate vaccine availability to counteract an emerging pandemic. Generally, {{influenza vaccines}} {{need to be}} stored and handled refrigerated to prevent thermal degradation of the antigenic component. Requirement of a cold-chain, however, complicates stockpiling and the logistics of vaccine distribution. We, therefore, investigated the effect of elevated storage temperatures on the immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic influenza A H 5 N 1 <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> virus vaccine. Either suspended in liquid or kept as a freeze-dried powder, vaccines could be stored for 1 year at ambient temperature (20 °C) with minimal loss of immunogenicity in mice. Elevation of the storage temperature to 40 °C, however, resulted in a significant loss of immunogenic potency within 3 months if vaccines were stored in liquid suspension. In sharp contrast, freeze-dried powder formulations were stable at 40 °C for at least 3 months. The presence of inulin or trehalose sugar excipients during freeze-drying of the vaccine proved to be critical to maintain its immunogenic potency during storage, and to preserve the characteristic Th 1 -type response to <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> virus vaccine. These results indicate that <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> virus vaccines may be stored and handled at room temperature in moderate climate zones {{for over a year}} with minimal decline and, if converted to dry-powder, even in hot climate zones for at least 3 months. The increased stability of dry-powder vaccine at 40 °C may also point to an extended shelf-life when stored at 4 °C.

40|$|Background: Up to 40 % of all mother-to-child {{transmission}} of HIVoccurs {{by means of}} breast-feeding; yet, in developing countries, infant formula {{may not be a}} safe option. The World Health Orga-nization recommends heat-treated breast milk as an infant-feeding alternative. We investigated the ability of a simple method, flash-heat, to <b>inactivate</b> <b>HIV</b> in breast milk from HIV-positive mothers. Methods: Ninety-eight breast milk samples, collected from 84 HIV-positive mothers in a periurban settlement in South Africa, were aliquoted to unheated control and flash-heating. Reverse transcriptase (RT) assays (lower detection limit of 400 HIV copies/mL) were per-formed to differentiate active versus <b>inactivated</b> cell-free <b>HIV</b> in unheated and flash-heated samples. Results: We found detectable HIV in breast milk samples from 31 % (26 of 84) of mothers. After adjusting for covariates, multivariate logistic regression showed a statistically significant negative asso-ciation between detectable virus in breast milk and maternal CD 4 + T-lymphocyte count (P = 0. 045) and volume of breast milk expressed (P = 0. 01) and a positive association with use of multivitamins (P = 0. 03). All flash-heated samples showed undetectable levels of cell-free HIV- 1 as detected by the RT assay (P, 0. 00001). Conclusions: Flash-heat can <b>inactivate</b> <b>HIV</b> in naturally infected breast milk from HIV-positive women.

40|$|To {{identify}} the minimal structures {{that may be}} important {{for the creation of}} a synthetic and/or recombinant vaccine against whooping cough, human T cell clones were obtained against Bordetella antigens. Cloned peripheral blood T lymphocytes from an immune donor were grown in IL- 2 and tested for proliferation in response to inactivated Bordetella species (B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, and B. bronchiseptica) and mutants deficient for the expression of virulence- associated antigens. All the T cell clones obtained were CD 4 + 8 - and recognized specifically the Bordetella antigens when presented by autologous B cells. On the basis of the responsiveness to the <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> bacteria, it was possible to cluster the 12 clones obtained into four groups with the following specificity: (1) filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA); (2) B. pertussis-specific antigens; (3) virulence- associated Bordetella-specific antigens; and (4) nonvirulence- associated Bordetella-specific antigens. Using two new B. pertussis deletion mutants, clone 6 (representative of cluster 1) was found to recognize the COOH terminus of FHA. Furthermore, three out of four clones of cluster 3 were specifically stimulated by the soluble 69 -kD protein from the outer membrane of B. pertussis. Surprisingly, none of the twelve clones obtained by stimulation in vitro with <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> bacteria recognized pertussis toxin (PT), which is believed to be the most important protein to be included in an acellular vaccine.

40|$|Abstract Background Sexual {{acquisition}} of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through mucosal transmission may be prevented by using topically applied agents that block HIV transmission from one individual to another. Therefore, virucidal agents that <b>inactivate</b> <b>HIV</b> virions {{may be used as}} a component in topical microbicides. Results Here, we have identified 2 -methyl- 3 -phenyl- 2 H -[1, 2, 4]thiadiazol- 5 -ylideneamine (WDO- 217) as a low-molecular-weight molecule that <b>inactivates</b> <b>HIV</b> particles. Both HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 virions pretreated with this compound were unable to infect permissive cells. Moreover, WDO- 217 was able to inhibit infections of a wide spectrum of wild-type and drug-resistant HIV- 1, including clinical isolates, HIV- 2 and SIV strains. Whereas the capture of virus by DC-SIGN was unaffected by the compound, it efficiently prevented the transmission of DC-SIGN-captured virus to CD 4 + T-lymphocytes. Interestingly, exposure of virions to WDO- 217 reduced the amount of virion-associated genomic RNA as measured by real-time RT-qPCR. Further mechanism-of-action studies demonstrated that WDO- 217 efficiently ejects zinc from the zinc fingers of the retroviral nucleocapsid protein NCp 7 and inhibits the cTAR destabilization properties of this protein. Importantly, WDO- 217 was able to eject zinc from both zinc fingers, even when NCp 7 was bound to oligonucleotides, while no covalent interaction between NCp 7 and WDO- 217 could be observed. Conclusion This compound is a new lead structure {{that can be used for}} the development of a new series of NCp 7 zinc ejectors as candidate topical microbicide agents. </p...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection {{has been associated}} with perturbations of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), including diminished frequencies in the peripheral blood and reduced production of type I interferons (IFNs) in response to in vitro stimulation. However, recent data suggest a paradoxical increase in production of type 1 interferons in vivo in HIV-infected patients compared to uninfected controls. Using a flow cytometric assay to detect IFN-α-producing cells within unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we observed that short-term interruptions of antiretroviral therapy are sufficient to result in significantly reduced IFN-α production by PDC in vitro in response to CpG A ligands or <b>inactivated</b> <b>HIV</b> particles. The primary cause of diminished IFN-α production was reduced responsiveness of PDC to de novo stimulation, not diminished per cell IFN-α production or migration of cells to lymphoid organs. Real-time PCR analysis of purified PDC from patients prior to and during treatment interruptions revealed that active HIV- 1 replication is associated with upregulation of type I IFN-stimulated gene expression. Treatment of hepatitis C virus-infected patients with IFN-α 2 b and ribavirin for hepatitis C virus infection resulted in a profound suppression of de novo IFN-α production in response to CpG A or <b>inactivated</b> <b>HIV</b> particles, similar to the response observed in HIV-infected patients. Together, these results suggest that diminished production of type I interferons in vitro by PDC from HIV- 1 -infected patients may not represent diminished interferon production in vivo. Rather, diminished function in vitro is likely a consequence of prior activation via type I interferons or HIV virions in vivo...|$|R

These findings led us to perform studies designed to identify the lineage of the cell that synthesizes such a factor in vitro and define the epitopes of HIV- 1 protein that have specificity for the induction of such anti-viral factor. Results of our studies show that this property is a function of CD 4 + but not CD 8 + T cells. Human CD 4 + T cells were thus recovered from the HIV-DC-immunized hu-PBL-SCID mice and were re-stimulated in vitro by co-culture for 2 days with autologous adherent PBMC as antigen presenting cells, APC previously pulsed with <b>inactivated</b> <b>HIV</b> in IL- 2 -containing medium to expand HIV- 1 -reactive CD 4 + T cells.

40|$|Background: Development of {{influenza}} vaccines capable of inducing broad protection against different virus subtypes is necessary given the ever-changing viral genetic landscape.

Objectives: As it has been demonstrated that the route of vaccine administration strongly influences both {{the quantity and quality of}} vaccine-induced immunity, in this study, we determined which route of WIV administration induces optimal heterosubtypic cross-protection. Methods: We compared the magnitude of the immune response and heterosubtypic protection against lethal A/PR/ 8 / 34 (H 1 N 1) infection after subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), and intranasal (IN) vaccination with A/NIBRG- 14 (H 5 N 1) WIV. Results: Subcutaneous and IM administration was superior to IN administration {{of influenza}} WIV in terms of flu-specific CD 8 + T-cell induction and protection of mice against lethal heterosubtypic challenge. Surprisingly, despite the very low flu-specific CD 8 + T-cell responses detected in IN-vaccinated mice, these animals were partially protected, most likely due to cross-reactive IgA antibodies. Conclusion: The results of this study show that the magnitude of WIV-induced flu-specific CD 8 + T-cell activity depends on the applied vaccination route. We conclude that parenteral administration of WIV vaccine, in particular IM injection, is superior to IN vaccine delivery for the induction of heterosubtypic cross-protection and generally appears to elicit stronger immune responses than mucosal vaccination with WIV...|$|R

There was no recognition of either allogeneic skin fibroblasts infected with recombinant vaccinia virus or autologous target cells infected with wild-type vaccinia virus, indicating the specificity and MHC-restricted nature of the response. Vaccinated cats, but not control cats, were protected from challenge with the homologous Petaluma isolate of FIV. Partial epitope mapping of the env-specific cytotoxic response was performed using overlapping 10 -amino acid peptides from the env V 3 domain of FIV. This response appeared to be directed at env peptide 1 (RAISSWKQRN) and env peptide 3 (QRNRWEWRPD), which lie adjacent to a β-turn within the V 3 domain. This study clearly demonstrates that both gag- and env-specific lymphocytotoxicity are induced following vaccination of cats with <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> FIV and thus contribute to the protective immunity observed in these animals...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFive {{neutralisation}} epitopes {{have been}} defined for the O 1 Kaufbeuren strain of {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} (FMDV) by neutralising murine monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). A mutant virus which is resistant to all these Mabs also resists neutralisation by bovine polyclonal sera, and this characteristic was exploited {{in the current study}} to investigate the biological relevance of neutralisation sites in FMDV virulence and vaccine protection. The five site neutralisation-resistant mutant was shown to be as pathogenic as wild-type virus in the guinea pig model of FMD. Guinea pigs were protected in cross-challenge studies from virulent wild-type and mutant viruses using either wild-type or mutant 146 S antigen as <b>inactivated</b> <b>whole</b> virus vaccine. Furthermore, hyperimmune sera raised to either wild-type or mutant antigen offered passive protection against wild-type challenge, in spite of the serum raised against the mutant antigen having minimal neutralising activityin vitro. These results imply that virus neutralisation, at least as defined by thein vitroassay, may not play an essential role in the mechanism of immunity induced by <b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> FMDV vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: With the aim {{of searching}} genetic factors {{associated}} with the response to an immune treatment based on autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with autologous <b>inactivated</b> <b>HIV,</b> we performed exome analysis by screening more than 240, 000 putative functional exonic variants in 18 HIV-positive Brazilian patients that underwent the immune treatment. Methods: Exome analysis has been performed using the ILLUMINA Infinium HumanExome BeadChip. zCall algorithm allowed us to recall rare variants. Quality control and SNP-centred analysis were done with GenABEL R package. An in-house implementation of the Wang method permitted gene-centred analysis. Results: CCR 4 -NOT transcription complex, subunit 1 (CNOT 1) gene (16 q 21), showed the strongest association with the modification of {{the response to the}} therapeutic vaccine (p 0. 00075). CNOT 1 SNP rs 7188697 A/G was significantly associated with DC treatment response. The presence of a G allele indicated poor response to the therapeutic vaccine (p 0. 0031; OR 33. 00; CI 1. 74624. 66), and the SNP behaved in a dominant model (A/A vs. A/GG/G p 0. 0009; OR 107. 66; 95...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCorynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (C. pseudotuberculosis) is a causative {{organism}} of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) in sheep and acute disease in buffaloes known as oedematous skin disease (OSD). Human affected {{with the disease}} show liver abscess and abscess in the internal lymph nodes. The vaccination against CLA up till now occurs by using formalin <b>inactivated</b> <b>whole</b> cells of biovar 1 (sheep strain). Combined vaccine composed of formalin <b>inactivated</b> <b>whole</b> cells of sheep strain and recombinant phospholipase D (rPLD) and another vaccine composed of formalin <b>inactivated</b> <b>whole</b> cells (buffalo origin) and rPLD were prepared in Biotechnology center for services and Researches laboratory at Cairo university and applied for protection against CLA. Both vaccines induced complete protection (100 %) against challenge with virulent biovar 1 or biovar 2. Also vaccination against OSD was performed by two types of vaccines. Vaccine- 1 was composed of formalin <b>inactivated</b> <b>whole</b> cell biovar 1 combined with rPLD and the second vaccine was composed of formalin <b>inactivated</b> <b>whole</b> cells of biovar 2 combined with rPLD. No lesions developed in vaccinated and non vaccinated buffaloes challenged with C. pseudotuberculosis biovar revealing that biovar 1 C. pseudotuberculosis is not infective for buffaloes. Buffaloes vaccinated with the second vaccine and control non vaccinated animals challenged with biovar 2 (buffalo origin) resulted in development of OSD in all animals. This indicates that OSD results due to production of toxin (s) other than PLD. Discovering this toxin (s) is of value in formulation of a future vaccine against OSD...|$|R

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV), causative agent of {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} (AIDS), is a global health concern. To control its transmission, safe sex has been proposed {{as one of the}} strategies. Microbicides- intravaginal/intrarectal topical formulations of anti-HIV agents have also been proposed to prevent HIV transmission. Microbicides would provide protection by directly <b>inactivating</b> <b>HIV</b> or preventing the attachment, entry or replication of HIV in susceptible target cells as well as their dissemination from target cells present in semen or the host cells lining the vaginal/rectal wall to other migratory cells. Microbicides must be safe, effective following vaginal or rectal administration, and should cause minimal or no genital symptoms or inflammations following long-term repeated usage. However, a safe and efficacious anti-HIV microbicide is not yet available despite the fact that more than 60 candidate agents have been identified to have in vitro activity against HIV, several of which have advanced to clinical testing. Nonetheless, proof-of-concept of microbicides has been established {{based on the results of}} recent CAPRISA 004 clinical trials. In this article, the trends and challenges in the development of effective and safe microbicides to combat HIV transmission are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experimental}} broiler {{lines were}} devel-oped by divergent selection for high (HH) and low (LL) antibody response to Escherichia coli. Antibody response of these lines to immunization with a commercial vaccine (<b>whole</b> <b>inactivated</b> virus, WIV) against {{infectious bursal disease}} virus (IBDV) or with proteins VP 2 and VP 3 of that virus, and their resistance to challenge with a virulent IBDV, were tested. The study was performed with 213 male and female chicks from the tenth generation of the HH and LL lines. At 15 d of age, after disappearance of maternal antibodies, chicks from each line were randomly divided into four groups and injected with WIV, VP 2, VP 3, or adjuvant alone as a negative control. Chicks were bled 18 d postinjection, and antibody titers were deter-mined by ELISA. Ten days later, the chicks were chal-(Key words: broiler, selection, immune response, viral protein, infectious bursa disease virus...|$|R
