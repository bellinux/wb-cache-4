5|$|The game's storyline {{focuses on}} {{a young man named}} Wander who enters a {{forbidden}} land. Wander must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen massive beings, known simply as colossi, in order to restore the life of a girl named Mono. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> interact, and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi. Shadow of the Colossus {{has been described as a}} puzzle game, as each colossus' weakness must be identified and exploited before it can be defeated.|$|E

25|$|Often {{times after}} {{internment}} families {{could not be}} reunited. Many mothers were left with children, but no husband. Furthermore, communities were impossible to rebuild. The lack of community lead to an even more intensified gap between the generations. Children had no one <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> speak Japanese outside the home {{and as a result}} they rarely learned the language fluently. The lack of community also led to a lack of Japanese foundation and many children lost touch with their culture. Mothers had also learned to be bolder in their own way and were now taking on wage-earning jobs, which meant that they had less time to teach their children about traditional Japanese culture and traditions. The internment camps had forever changed the way of Japanese-Canadian life.|$|E
25|$|In {{both the}} United States and in Israel several groups {{have sprung up}} {{in the last few years}} that seek to support those who {{identify}} as both Orthodox and homosexual; support Orthodox parents of LGBT children; and promote understanding of homosexuality within Orthodox communities and among Orthodox rabbis. These include an umbrella organization called Eshel, the Gay and Lesbian Yeshiva Day School Alumni Association, the women's group OrthoDykes, the youth group JQYouth, the American-Israeli group headquartered in Jerusalem Bat Kol and the Israeli group Hod ("Majesty"). In 2012, Hod held an advertising campaign against conversion therapies and for self-acceptance of the religious homosexual community in Israel. Online blogs and support groups have enabled many to find other Orthodox LGBT people <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> share the conflict between Orthodox religious and social norms and LGBT self-identification.|$|E
25|$|Dennis Fryzel, {{coach of}} the Buccaneers’ much-criticized special teams, was {{replaced}} by USC offensive line coach Skip Husbands, who became the fifth USC assistant to join McKay in Tampa. Head trainer Dave Kendall was replaced by Northwestern University trainer Tom Oxley. Oxley was immediately given the task of rehabilitating the previous season's seventeen players who finished the year on injured reserve. A surprise trade brought Chicago Bears backup quarterback and Tampa native Gary Huff to the team, while incumbent quarterback Steve Spurrier was placed on waivers. Spurrier and McKay had often feuded during the previous season. McKay stated that cutting Spurrier meant {{that he would have}} a choice of teams <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> sign.

25|$|Multiple {{victories}} in India fill Xerxes with confidence, {{and despite the}} warnings of his counsellor Artabanus that he is pushing his army too hard and extending his reach too far, he continues invading new territory. Fed up fighting, {{a small group of}} Persians revolt, but Xerxes, Demaratus, Mardonius, and Hydarnes brutally suppress the rebellion. Xerxes then turns his attention to Greece, invading and attacking Sparta. Demeratus is soon killed, but at the Battle of Thermopylae, the Spartans are defeated, although Hydarnes is also killed. Hearing that the Spartans brave defence at Thermopylae has inspired the previously passive Greek city states, Xerxes orders his soldiers to continue to attack without allowing them rest. At the Battle of Plataea, the Persians prove victorious, defeating the Greeks. At the conclusion of the battle, Xerxes looks for Artabanus <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> celebrate, but he is unable to find him.|$|E
25|$|Girls {{are most}} likely to enjoy high {{self-esteem}} when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, {{they are more likely to}} derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).|$|E
25|$|Many years ago, in the Enchanted Forest, a young Regina {{wishes that}} her mother Cora {{had more time to}} play. Without her mother {{watching}} her, Regina finds a magic wand and attempts to transform her doll into a real sister <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> play, only to have the spell backfire, knocking her unconscious. Cora and Prince Henry realizes {{that the only way to}} save her is by bringing a magical family member to wake her up. Consequently, Cora visits Oz to bring back Zelena, who just used her magic to restock the logs she dropped. This angers her abusive adoptive father, who doesn't want Zelena to use her “wicked” magic. Cora immediately freezes the woodcutter as he is about to hit her (her adoptive mother wasn't around to protect Zelena this time), then gives Zelena the opportunity to prove that her magic can be used for good, which she accepts. As Zelena is able to wake Regina, the two are unaware of their being sisters at first, but over time become close, and quickly realize that they're related, when Zelena accidentally opens Cora's wand box, leading to Cora admitting that Regina and Zelena are sisters. Despite Regina's pleas to have Zelena in her life, Cora, believing that Zelena's presence will interfere with Regina's future of becoming the next queen, wipes both of their memories and sends Zelena back to Oz.|$|E

25|$|Male E. imperialis {{have been}} {{observed}} to occasionally form aggregations of territories considered to be leks. These aggregations typically occur at sites {{in which they can}} collect aromatic materials; however, females almost never approach these aggregations. It is also important to note that although leks are formed, they are only facultative for this species (the more suitable sites, the greater the number of habitable territories). Since these territories are aggregated, females have a large selection of males <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> potentially mate with in the aggregation. Territorial behavior of male E. imperialis consists of two primary components: displaying on the perch and patrolling its territory. During display, the male ‘stands’ on the perch with its head pointed up, and touching the trunk of the tree with its mandibles closed. Only the fore and hind legs touch the tree trunk, in which the forelegs bend and are held besides the head, whereas the hind-legs are held straight away from the body. During its display, the male would also ‘hop’ on-and-off the tree, about 2cm from the perch, accompanied by a loud buzzing sound. Shortly after displaying, the male then engages in patrol behavior, flying an irregular elliptical path around its territory. This cycle of displaying and patrolling repeats continuously as long as the male remains in its territory and is undisturbed by intruding males. Male E. imperialis are considered to have two types of territories: ‘primary territories’ and ‘secondary territories’. In primary territories, they are almost always defended by males, and is the site for all male-male confrontations. In secondary territories, they are defended for only 1 to 2 hours a day. Secondary territories often serve as a transitional territory for males attempting to move into primary territories by challenging the resident males. Weather also plays a significant role in territorial defense behavior, such that in heavy rain, males would often abandon their territories {{for the rest of the}} day. On dark, overcast days, there is also little to no activity.|$|E

He pursued a permanent position with Osborne, declining an opportunity to go to Jamaica as a correspondent for the Herald, and was hired in November 1906. For the next three years, Howe blended his two jobsreporter and political operativeusing information from each in service of the other. Osborne intended eventually to run for governor himself. However, he was made a nonviable candidate by his unusual propensity to travel in a variety of disguises and his close friendship with a young handyman, with whom Osborne was rumored to have a homosexual relationship. Howe lost interest in Osborne as a patron and began searching for another upcoming name <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> associate; Osborne fired him in 1909.|$|E

500|$|In 1984, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{started off}} as a [...] "funk-punk band, driven by Kiedis's exuberant rapping and Flea's manic slap-bass" [...] (Sanneh, 2002). Guitarist John Frusciante left the band {{in the middle of}} a 1992 tour that {{promoted}} their critically acclaimed album Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It took over a year for the band to find a new guitarist <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> record officially. Dave Navarro, formerly of Jane's Addiction, was invited to join the Chili Peppers after Arik Marshall, who had finished the remaining tour dates for Blood Sugar Sex Magik, was fired. Navarro influenced the band's ensuing album, One Hot Minute, by incorporating various elements of heavy metal and psychedelic rock, which was something that the Chili Peppers had not previously been notable for. Compared to Blood Sugar Sex Magik, One Hot Minute was a commercial disappointment, selling only half of what Blood Sugar Sex Magik had originally sold. Critics dismissed the album, claiming it was weak and unfocused. Shortly after the release of One Hot Minute, Navarro was fired due to internal differences.|$|E
500|$|LaVey {{explains}} that, {{in order}} to control a person, one must first attract his or her attention. He gives three qualities that can be employed for this purpose: sex appeal, sentiment (cuteness or innocence), and wonder. He also advocates the use of odor. In the Book of Belial, he discusses three types of rituals: those for sex, compassion, and destruction. Sex rituals work to entice another person; compassion rituals work to improve health, intelligence, success, and so on; destruction rituals work to destroy another person. LaVey advocates finding others <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> practice Satanic rituals {{in order to}} reaffirm one's faith and avoid antisocial behavior. He particularly advocates group participation for destruction rituals, as compassion and sex rituals are more private in nature. LaVey goes on to list the key components to successful ritual: desire, timing, imagery, direction, and [...] "The Balance Factor" [...] (awareness of one's own limitations). Details for the various Satanic rituals are explained in The Book of Belial, and lists of necessary objects (such as clothing, altars, and the symbol of Baphomet) are given.|$|E
500|$|Greenwald, however, had {{her first}} major run in the company as Molly Holly, where she joined her {{on-screen}} cousins Bob Holly and Crash Holly. At the time, The Holly Cousins {{were involved in a}} feud with T & A (Test, Albert, and manager Trish Stratus). Greenwald says that Stratus was one of her favorite people <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> work. Molly's arrival on the November 6, 2000 edition of Raw started a short feud with Stratus, leading to her first televised victory over Stratus in a Six-Person intergender tag team match at the Survivor Series. In a match between Crash Holly and Dean Malenko, Molly distracted the referee by standing on the ring apron, interfering on Crash's behalf. Malenko then forcefully kissed Molly, annoying her, who later helped out Crash by debuting her Molly-Go-Round finisher on Malenko and enabling Crash to win. In 2001, Molly formed an on-screen relationship with Spike Dudley, in the midst of their storyline rivalry between her cousins and Spike's brothers (The Dudley Boyz). In interviews in subsequent years, Greenwald recalled the [...] "relationship" [...] with Spike Dudley as the [...] "best time of her career." [...] A subsequent fallout between her and Crash even led to an intergender singles match, with Molly pinning Crash.|$|E
