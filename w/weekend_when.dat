5|$|For {{the battle}} {{sequence}} in North Africa, two actual Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks in Desert Air Force paint schemes were used, accompanied by cloned images {{of them or}} by computer-generated planes. In scenes showing squadrons of soldiers, digital extras were not used; instead, photography of real squadrons was cloned. Sony Pictures Imageworks also digitally expanded details on stage locations and at practical locations. The exterior of Hitler's Bavarian residence Berghof was digitally created, since little {{was left of the}} original structure, and the creation was superimposed on a shot of a ski area in Austria. In Berlin itself, city officials helped reduce the need for visual effects by removing power poles and modern lighting over the <b>weekend</b> <b>when</b> filming took place and restoring the equipment by the start of the new week.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{improvements}} in critical reception, The Wolverine outgrossed Origins in total box office, though earned less domestically. The film closed in US theaters on December 5, 2013, grossing $132,556,852 in North America (as opposed to $179,883,157 for the earlier film) and $282,271,394 in other territories (as {{opposed to the}} earlier film's $193,179,707), for a worldwide total of $414,828,246. The film earned $139.6 million on its worldwide opening <b>weekend.</b> <b>When</b> compared {{to the rest of}} the X-Men film franchise, The Wolverine has garnered somewhat mixed results in terms of box office success. While its domestic gross is greater than the production budget, it is still lower than the other five films of the franchise, with its domestic box office total being roughly $45.1 million less than the franchise's average. However, its overseas total currently exceeds the franchise's average by roughly $75.7 million and is significantly more than any of the other X-Men films. With a worldwide total of roughly $414.8 million, The Wolverine was at that time the third highest grossing film.|$|E
5|$|Outside North America, {{the film}} secured a release in 78 countries. It made $20.5 million from 2,407 screens in just 18 markets, placing behind The Force Awakens at the {{international}} box office chart and first among newly released films. The following weekend, it added $32.3 million from 25 markets on 4,849 screens. The film topped the international box office in its third weekend—the same <b>weekend</b> <b>when</b> it topped the U.S. box office—overtaking The Force Awakens with $33.7 million from 48 markets. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it took the No. 1 spot with $7.87 million or £5.2 million ($7.4 million) from 589 theaters and remained {{there for a second}} weekend declining only by 24% with £3.86 million ($5.5 million), as well as for a third weekend. Similarly, in Russia, it passed The Force Awakens to take the top spot with $7.5 million from 1,063 screens. In France, it has the biggest opening day in Paris and the third biggest opening weekend of 2016 (so far) with $8.2 million. It also opened at No. 1 in Mexico ($5.1 million), Spain ($4 million), Holland ($1.3 million), Belgium ($1.1 million), Argentina ($955,000), Sweden ($914,000), South Korea, Denmark, Norway, Israel, Egypt and Portugal among other markets. In Germany ($4.6 million) and Australia ($2.9 million), it debuted at No. 2 both behind The Force Awakens and in Brazil ($2.17 million) behind The Ten Commandments. It had one of the top ten openings of all time for a Fox film, not accounting for inflation in South Korea with $5.7 million and went on to top the box office there for a second weekend with $3.22 million despite cold weather affecting theater attendance resulting in low box office performance. In Russia, despite not opening at No. 1, it topped the box office in its second weekend with $4.4 million—more than The Force Awakens—and went on to top for a third weekend with $3.6 million. In China it had an opening day of around $11 million from more than 11,000 screens, including $250,000 in midnight previews, and $23 million in two days. In its opening weekend, it grossed $31 million, coming in second place behind the animated Zootopia. IMAX comprised $2.3 million on 278 screens. In terms of total earnings, its largest markets outside of the U.S. and Canada are China ($58.6 million), the United Kingdom ($32.8 million), Germany ($28.7 million) and France ($28.2 million).

25|$|Brokeback Mountain was the highest-grossing {{film in the}} U.S. from January 17 through January 19, 2006, perhaps due {{primarily}} to its wins at the Golden Globes on January 16. Indeed, the film {{was one of the}} top five highest-grossing films in the U.S. every day from January 17 until January 28, including over the <b>weekend</b> (<b>when</b> more people go to the films and big-budget films usually crowd out independent films from the top-grossing list) of January 20–22. On January 28, the film fell out of the top five and into sixth place at the box office during that weekend before entering the top five again on January 30 and remaining there until February 10.|$|E

25|$|The revived Corris Railway has {{maintained}} friendly {{links with the}} Talyllyn Railway, which resulted in both of the original Corris locos and rolling stock returning to the railway.

25|$|Ease {{of voting}} {{is a factor}} in rates of turnout. In the United States and most Latin American nations, voters must go through {{separate}} voter registration procedures before they are allowed to vote. This two-step process quite clearly decreases turnout. U.S. states with no, or easier, registration requirements have larger turnouts. Other methods of improving turnout include making voting easier through more available absentee polling and improved access to polls, such as increasing the number of possible voting locations, lowering the average time voters have to spend waiting in line, or requiring companies to give workers some time off on voting day. In some areas, generally those where some polling centres are relatively inaccessible, such as India, elections often take several days. Some countries have considered Internet voting as a possible solution. In other countries, like France, voting is held on the <b>weekend,</b> <b>when</b> most voters are away from work. Therefore, the need for time off from work as a factor in voter turnout is greatly reduced.|$|E
25|$|The tension {{was high}} {{between the two}} Mercedes {{teammates}} going into the <b>weekend</b> <b>when</b> Hamilton {{was found to have}} altered his car settings during the latter stages of the Spanish Grand Prix, using a higher-powered engine setting than the team had previously allowed in order to stay ahead of teammate Rosberg. Rosberg was then discovered to have done the same while chasing down Hamilton {{at the end of the}} Bahrain Grand Prix, though he failed to get past. Despite losing the Drivers' Championship lead to teammate Hamilton in Spain, Rosberg stated he would not be changing his approach and was not heavily focused on the championship but expected the battle to remain tight. Hamilton reckoned his increased comfort with the F1 W05 Hybrid would put Rosberg under pressure in Monaco, saying it was a track where he performed well but the 2013 race was where he was unable to extract the most amount of performance from his car although he hoped to get more out of his Mercedes and wanted to have the Ferrari and Red Bull cars battling him for the victory.|$|E
25|$|At {{the close}} of the 2004 season, it was {{revealed}} that Tony Eury Sr. would be promoted to the team manager position for the DEI corporation, while Tony Eury Jr. became the crew chief for Michael Waltrip for the 2005 season. Peter Rondeau, a Chance 2 employee who also helped Earnhardt win the Busch Series race at Bristol in August, became the crew chief for Earnhardt in 2005. Rondeau served as Earnhardt's crew chief until the Coca Cola 600 <b>weekend,</b> <b>when</b> he was replaced with DEI chief engineer Steve Hmiel, who helped Earnhardt score his lone win of 2005 at Chicagoland in July, when he took the lead from Matt Kenseth on the last cycle of pit stops. Earnhardt was eliminated from any possible competition for the NEXTEL Cup championship after suffering an engine failure at the California Speedway. Earnhardt was reunited with his cousin, Tony Eury Jr., after the fall Richmond weekend, and results improved immediately. Earnhardt finished the season 19th in points.

25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1985–86 season, the Celtics made a daring trade for Bill Walton, an All-Star center with a history of injury. The risk paid off; Walton's {{acquisition}} helped Boston win a league best 67 games. One of Bird's career highlights occurred at the 1986 NBA All-Star <b>Weekend</b> <b>when</b> he walked into the locker room at the inaugural Three-Point Shootout and asked who was going to finish second before winning the shootout. With averages of 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists, and 2 steals per game, Bird became just the third player in NBA history to win three consecutive MVP Awards. In the playoffs, the Celtics lost only one game through the first three rounds en route to a match-up against the Rockets in the Finals. Bird averaged 24 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 9.5 assists per game for the championship round, leading Boston to victory in six games. The '86 Celtics are commonly ranked {{as one of the greatest}} basketball teams of all-time, with the Boston Globes Peter May and Grantland's Bill Simmons listing them at number one.|$|E
