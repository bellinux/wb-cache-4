Cluster formation includes CH and gateway selection which requires a better technique that guarantees network connectivity so that the data of the target coverage could be delivered to the sink properly. Since the sensing antenna for target coverage is also directional, optimizing the active sensing nodes and their sensing sectors, through minimizing the sensing redundancy, is also very difficult.|$|R

Then some typical algorithms are presented and analyzed, classifying them in two categories: spatial and spectral.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the area {{coverage}} of directional sensor networks (DSNs) with random node distribution. The coverage of DSNs {{depends on the}} sensor’s locations, the sensing radiuses, and the working directions, {{as well as the}} angle of view (AoV), which is challenging to analyze. We transform the network area coverage problem into cell coverage problems by exploiting the Voronoi diagram, which only needs to optimize local coverage for each cell in a decentralized way. To address the cell coverage problem, we propose three local coverage optimization algorithms to improve the cell coverage, namely Move Inside Cell Algorithm (MIC), Rotate <b>Working</b> <b>Direction</b> Algorithm (RWD) and Rotation based on boundary (RB), respectively. Extensive simulations are performed to prove the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in terms of the coverage ratio...|$|E

This work describes the results-to-date from TEM characterization of unirradiated and irradiated ODS molybdenum.

'Ribbon'-like lanthanum oxides are aligned along the <b>working</b> <b>direction</b> of the product form and are frequently associated with grain boundaries, serving to inhibit grain boundary and dislocation movement. In addition to the 'ribbons', discrete lanthanum oxide particles have also been detected.

40|$|The {{requirement}} of large, recrystallized, highly elongated grains is of primary {{importance to the}} development of suitable high temperature properties in oxide dispersion strengthened-superalloys. In the present study the recrystallization behavior of MA 6000 E, a recently developed Y 2 O 3 strengthened superalloy produced by mechanical alloying, was examined using transmission and replication microscopy. Gradient and isothermal annealing treatments were applied to extruded and hot rolled products. It was found that conversion from a very fine (0. 2 micron) grain structure to a coarse (approximately 10 mm) grain structure is controlled by the dissolution of the gamma prime phase, while grain shape was controlled primarily by the thermal gradient. The fine uniform oxide dispersion appeared to have only a secondary influence in determining the grain shape as columnar grains could be grown transverse to the <b>working</b> <b>direction</b> by appropriate application of the thermal gradient...|$|E
