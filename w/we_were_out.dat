500|$|In a 2013 interview, Mitsoda {{said that}} it was {{released}} at [...] "the worst possible time - most people didn't even know <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out...</b> fans and the Troika [...] are always going to wonder what the game could have been like with another six months." [...] Activision obtained model Erin Layne to play Jeanette in promotional material for the game. Layne worked with Bloodlines artist Tim Bradstreet for a day to provide the poses chosen by Activision to represent Jeanette in the game's posters, clothing, and other items.|$|E
500|$|Hard as the Americans {{worked to}} {{incorporate}} {{themselves into the}} Grand Fleet, they had yet to shake a belief among the veteran British that they were amateurs merely playing at war. In writing to his American-born wife following the maneuvers, Admiral Beatty noted that, [...] "The American Squadron enjoyed themselves greatly while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out,</b> and did well, and will do better next time. I am sending old Rodman out on an operation of his own, which pleases him and gives them an idea that they are really {{taking part in the}} war. I trust they will come to no harm." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Thinking {{back to when}} we met and {{the many}} times that we spent {{together}} and whenever <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> together, {{there would be a}} caption of some kind, and the caption usually said something like 'an odd couple' or 'an unlikely pair,' but to us it was the most natural and easiest of friendships.... Michael always knew he could count on me to support him or be his date and that we would have fun no matter where we were. We had a bond.... Both of us needed to be adults very early, but when we were together, we were two little kids having fun." ...|$|E

500|$|The Americans {{were pulling}} out of Southeast Asia as quickly as {{negotiations}} with the North Vietnamese would allow them. Ambassador Godley, stunned by the diplomatic developments, ruminated that [...] "We had led him (Souvanna) down the garden path. Let's face it, we were cutting and running... Once <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of Vietnam {{the only way we}} could have protected Laos was with an Army corps. It was totally out of the question and we knew it. We were licked." [...] Souvanna then faced a dilemma, sign a separate agreement with the Pathet Lao on almost any terms, or continue the war with no prospect of success. Hanoi was also desirious to obtain a quick agreement with Vientiane. The sooner the fighting in Laos ceased, the sooner the Hanoi would obtain unimpeded use of the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E
500|$|On Burton's hiring, he and Logan {{reworked}} the screenplay; Logan {{felt they}} agreed over the film's tone due to [...] "share stunted childhoods watching Amicus movies". Turning a three-hour stage musical into a two-hour film required some changes. Some songs were shortened, {{while others were}} completely removed. Burton said [...] "In terms of the show, it was three hours long, but we weren't out to film the Broadway show, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> to make a movie, so we {{tried to keep the}} pace like those old melodramas. Sondheim himself is not a real big fan of movie musicals, so he was really open to honing it down to a more pacey shape." [...] Burton and Logan also reduced the prominence of other secondary elements, such as the romance between Todd's daughter Johanna and Anthony, to allow them to focus on the triangular relationship between Todd, Mrs. Lovett, and Toby.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "dynamic and intelligent" [...] Chapin was {{appointed}} to fill the CEO position at AMC following the departure of Roy Abernethy in 1967, along with William Luneburg as president. Chapin realized he was taking over at a crucial time; The Wall Street Journal described it as [...] "a dying company." [...] At the time, Chapin said, [...] "We're {{going to have to}} show ingenuity." [...] He reflected later that the most difficult period was [...] "... when our president, Bill Luneburg, and I took over. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of money and we had to do something to overcome the immediate problems. We had no time to think about long-range problems. Obviously, we managed to solve immediate considerations..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guitarist and vocalist Daniel Rossen, {{a friend}} of Bear's from jazz-camp, joined the band soon after. Rossen stated, [...] "For a long time, I only played my songs to close friends; and it just {{happened}} that I lived with Chris Taylor during my second year of college, so he heard them. He was my entrance into Grizzly Bear. He joined the band first, then {{after a while he}} suggested I come in with these songs. [...] When I joined, I did about two rehearsals with them, worked out one of my songs to put into the set, then a week later <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> on the road for a two-month tour. It was a real trial-by-fire thing. I was close with Chris and Chris , but I didn’t know Ed [...] at all; it was weird getting to know a stranger by spending all day in the same car." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on Ulver’s evolution, Rygg said, [...] "I don't {{think anyone}} will be surprised. The shock value is gone, I think it went away with Metamorphosis. Since then, the changes haven't been {{fundamental}} at all.” Continuing, “I think the shapeshifting story {{is one that}} has been greatly exaggerated by the media. There have been a couple of twists and turns after the Blake record, that's granted, but nothing too significant. I see Ulver as having a part one and a part two. And that's a division that we already had in our minds before those first three albums were even finished. We already knew we were going somewhere else after Nattens madrigal. Due to logistics, we had to wait almost two years until that one got released, and in the interim we had amassed a huge array of influences. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of our teens and our outlook was becoming more complex." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sigler calls Stephen King a [...] "'master craftsman', {{who writes}} from the 'regular guy' strata {{from which he}} hails. His older stuff had no pretense, no 'higher message,' no 'I’m {{extremely}} important' attitude, just rock-solid storytelling and character development. He also would whack any character at any time, and that’s what hooked you in – when characters got into trouble, you didn’t know if they’d live, unlike 99% of the books {{out there that are}} trying to develop franchise characters." [...] According to Sigler, Jack London's [...] "The Sea Wolf totally changed my views on life". Sigler saw King Kong (1976 version) {{when he was a little}} kid. He said it, [...] "Scared the crap out of me. I hid behind my dad’s shoulder and begged to leave the theatre. As soon as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out,</b> I asked when we could see it again – that was the moment I knew I wanted to tell monster stories. I wanted to have that same impact on other people." ...|$|E

2500|$|The men of {{the convoy}} then began {{launching}} boats to pick up Japanese survivors and kill all of the remaining prisoners. A machine gun mounted on the grounded cargo ship and a second on the Shinyō Maru were also opened up on the Allied personnel. Marine Corps Sergeant Onnie Clem later reported the following; [...] "Up on the bridge there was a machine gun spraying the hatch. A burst of machine-gun fire caught {{all three of us}} and knocked us back down in the hold. We'd all been hit. I got plowed in the skull. Another bullet chipped out my chin. Nevertheless, I was able to work myself back up on deck, and I was eyeing that bridge when I came out that time. The gun was still there, but the gunner was laying out on deck. Somebody had apparently got up there and killed him. At this time I found out that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> in the ocean about two or three miles from shore. All I had was a loincloth." [...] Fifteen or 20 others were recaptured and taken aboard one of the torpedo boats, where they were executed by firing squad as punishment for trying to escape. One of those men was able to free his hands which had been tied behind his back, and he successfully escaped by jumping overboard again. The Japanese dropped 45 depth charges and other explosives on the American submarine over the course of two hours, and the ship sustained some light damage, but nobody was hurt. After that, she surfaced and began patrolling the area again.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Australian journalist Nick Milligan on 25 March 2011, Anderson explained, [...] "I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the 'Bound For Glory' single came off and I was hanging around with the Gunners {{and a lot of}} other LA bad boy rock bands that we supposedly influenced. I realised then that apart from the fact that I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.' It was long enough for us to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal. I rang up each of the original members that were still interested and they all said, 'Yeah, let's get together.' So I said we should negotiate a deal where the band can come over and record in Los Angeles. But, of course, that was the year that our original drummer [...] "Digger" [...] Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform. We didn't reform until '92. In '93, the word got around, because we had reformed with our existing drummer Paul DeMarco. The Gunners heard <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> playing again and said, 'We want you to do our support gigs throughout Australia.' We did those two Guns N' Roses raceways gigs - Eastern Creek in Sydney and the raceway down in Melbourne." ...|$|E

60|$|TIM. Well, I see {{you have}} a mind to go a-fooling too; but take heed in time, and <b>be</b> wise. While <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of danger, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> out; but when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in.|$|R

6000|$|... "Thank God <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of that!" [...] Mr. Hethcote said, as {{the fire}} ceased and the boats headed for a light hung up to direct then.|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't {{you make}} too sure for yourselves," [...] rejoined in despair the dismayed Taper. [...] "It {{does not follow}} that because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out,</b> that you <b>are</b> in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-night, Mr. Cossey. Next {{time that}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> {{shooting}} together I expect I shall be nowhere. It {{was an awful}} fluke of mine killing those four birds." ...|$|R
