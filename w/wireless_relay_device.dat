Magnetic induction (MI) based transmission has been proposed to overcome the very harsh propagation conditions in underground communications in recent years.

30|$|<b>Wireless</b> <b>relay</b> {{transmission}} {{has been}} considered as a supplementary technology for future wireless communication system, and handover {{is a key element}} in <b>wireless</b> <b>relay</b> transmissions to support users’ mobility. Handover failure will result in the forced termination of an ongoing call, and a good handover scheme will provide good system performance. This article focuses on the handover decision problem in <b>wireless</b> <b>relay</b> transmission systems. Initially, the architecture of a single-cell relay system is introduced. The handover decision problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). In the proposed model, a profit function is used to evaluate the quality-of-service of the chosen serving node, and a cost function is used to model processing load and signaling cost. Based on the profit and cost functions, the reward function is formulated. Moreover, the objective is to maximize the expected total reward per connection. The value iteration algorithm is employed to determine the optimal handover policy. Furthermore, the analysis is generalized to multi-cell relay systems. Numerical results show that the proposed MDP-based handover policy is well behaved in <b>wireless</b> <b>relay</b> systems.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} characterizing the optimal rate {{achievable}} with analog network coding (ANC) for a unicast communication over general <b>wireless</b> <b>relay</b> networks is computationally hard. A relay node performing ANC scales and forwards its input signals. The source-destination channel in such communication scenarios is, in general, an intersymbol interference (ISI) channel {{which leads to}} the single-letter characterization of the optimal rate in terms of an optimization problem with nonconvex, non closed-form objective function and non-convex constraints. For a special class of such networks, called layered networks, a few key results and insights are however available. To gain insights into the nature of the optimal solution and to construct low-complexity schemes to characterize the optimal rate for general <b>wireless</b> <b>relay</b> networks, we need (1) network topologies that are regular enough to be amenable for analysis, yet general enough to capture essential characteristics of general <b>wireless</b> <b>relay</b> networks, and (2) schemes to approximate the objective function in closed-form without significantly compromising the performance. Towards these two goals, this work proposes (1) nonlinear chain networks, and (2) two approximation schemes. We show that their combination allows us to tightly characterize the optimal ANC rate with low computational complexity for a much larger class of general <b>wireless</b> <b>relay</b> networks than possible with existing schemes.

The authors generalized the max-flow min-cut theorem to the linear deterministic <b>wireless</b> <b>relay</b> networks and characterized the unicast capacity of such deterministic network as the minimum rank of all the binary adjacency matrices describing source-destination cuts whose number grows exponentially {{with the size of}} the network.
