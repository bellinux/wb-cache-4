5|$|Given {{the role}} of {{mitochondria}} as the cell's powerhouse, {{there may be some}} leakage of the high-energy electrons in the respiratory chain to form reactive oxygen species. This <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> result in significant oxidative stress in the mitochondria with high mutation rates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Hypothesized links between aging and oxidative stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging. A vicious cycle <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> occur, as oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial DNA mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further oxidative stress.|$|E

The mechanism <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for bone health, and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.|$|E
5|$|A carcass was {{a hollow}} {{projectile}} usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball with holes.

Carcasses were used for the first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.|$|E
5|$|A six-page writeup {{about the}} {{building}} appeared in Architect and Engineer in December 1937. The article listed {{the owners and}} the structural engineer, but did not name the architect. In the early 1980s, geologist and architectural historian Gray Brechin discovered that Irvin Goldstine had designed the building; Brechin subsequently interviewed Goldstine regarding his career. An article about the discovery was printed in Metro Magazine, a defunct San Francisco magazine. Until that time, the building <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be designed by the Mallochs.|$|E

5|$|All the {{structures}} in Old Yosemite Village, {{except for the}} chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished during the 1950s and 1960s. Other structures in the park were also moved to the history center. Cedar Cottage, the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, was demolished in 1941 along with others, {{even though they had}} not been flooded. Little regard was given to historic preservation, as the priority <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be the preservation and restoration of natural scenery.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{theories}} are that La Reforma is a dome which was eroded {{to form a}} circular pattern or a set of tectonic blocks. Although the dome <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be formed by the older Comondú volcanics, {{it appears to be}} a product of La Reforma activity.|$|E
5|$|Although the DPP {{passed a}} {{resolution}} to ban all factions within the party in 2006, the dissent between former members of different factions was still present and <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> {{be one of the}} factors that led to DPP's loss in the presidential election. Chai, along with Koo Kwang-ming emphasized the importance of consolidating the party's policy on independence, while Tsai Ing-wen focused on the cooperation of former factions and expansion of the party's support base.|$|E

50|$|The {{first known}} {{appearance}} of the Murinae in the fossil record is about 14 million {{years ago with the}} fossil genus Antemus. Antemus <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> derive directly from Potwarmus, which has a more primitive tooth pattern. Likewise, two genera, Progonomys and Karnimata, <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> derive directly from Antemus. Progonomys <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the ancestor of Mus and relatives, while Karnimata <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> lead to Rattus and relatives. All of these fossils are found in the well-preserved and easily dated Siwalik fossil beds of Pakistan. The transition from Potwarmus to Antemus to Progonomys and Karnimata is considered an excellent example of anagenic evolution.|$|R
