5|$|Hurricane Dean <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to {{forecast}} {{in its early}} stages as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean. Even though most forecast models predicted that Dean would skirt the Leeward Islands, the track prediction models were not consistent and, as a result, uncertainty existed in justifying the posting of watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to fourdays.|$|E
5|$|Kojima {{commented that}} the outside {{environment}} <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to create. He explained that the reason previous games were primarily set indoors is because the current consoles were not powerful enough to portray a true jungle environment. In contrast with urban environments, the jungle {{does not have a}} flat surface. The protagonist in Snake Eater has to cross uneven terrain, including rocks, dirt mounds, and treestumps. As a result, the collision engine used in previous installments could not be used, and a new one had to be built from scratch. Setting up the motion capture technology so players could walk over these mounds was a problem during development.|$|E
5|$|The old Sixth District was {{centered}} in southwestern and south-central Ohio around McEwen's hometown, Hillsboro. After redistricting, McEwen found himself {{running in a}} huge area stretching from Lebanon to Marietta. This new district <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to campaign in. It spilled across six media markets, meaning that McEwen had to buy ads in cities {{where most of the}} viewers couldn't vote in the district. It also lacked any large cities and possessed few unifying elements. His Democratic opponent was psychologist Ted Strickland, whom he had defeated in his initial run in 1980.|$|E

5|$|The {{village of}} Marcellus was first settled in 1794 at the {{intersection}} of two transportation routes: an old Iroquois trail running east–west (later to become the Seneca Turnpike) and the north–south Nine Mile Creek. At the beginning of the 19th century, land travel along the Nine Mile Creek <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> and most travel between Marcellus and the settlements along Onondaga Lake was by water. In 1831 the New York State Legislature authorized the construction of a road to follow Nine Mile Creek from Marcellus towards the town of Salina at Onondaga Lake.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gracie {{was a major}} {{hurricane}} {{that formed}} in September 1959, the strongest during the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season and the most intense to strike the United States since Hurricane Hazel in 1954. The system was first noted as an area of thunderstorms east of the Lesser Antilles which moved {{just north of the}} Greater Antilles, quickly intensifying into a hurricane on September 22. Gracie was a storm that <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to forecast, with its movement unpredictable. After five days of erratic motion, Gracie became a major hurricane which struck South Carolina, and weakened as it moved up the Appalachians, bringing much needed rain to a drought-plagued region. Much of the destruction related with Gracie was centered on Beaufort, South Carolina. Gracie became an extratropical cyclone on September 30 while moving through the Eastern United States.|$|E
5|$|Image Entertainment {{released}} {{the film in}} both the English and Italian versions on DVD on August 1, 2000. Kino {{released the}} film on Blu-ray and DVD on July 16, 2013. Kino's edition of the film was mastered in high definition from the 35mm negative with the Italian language dub and original soundtrack. Arrow Films released Black Sabbath on DVD and Blu-ray in 2013. Arrow's transfer of the Italian version was from an original 35mm internegative print transferred in Italy that had additional grading and restoration done in London. Arrow's version of the American version of Black Sabbath was made from an 35mm interpositive in California. Arrow noted the high definition master they received from Italy <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to restore as the master had issues with the image, sound and color quality and had the stories in the wrong order.|$|E

5|$|Local {{interest}} in restoring the Middle Levels for navigation {{began to develop}} in 1949. The Fenlands Branch of the Inland Waterways Association was formed on 30 October 1949, and following assurances from the Ouse Catchment Board that they were planning to restore the river for navigation up to Bedford, the branch decided to devote their energies to the Middle Levels, which were weedy and heavily silted. Salters Lode lock was rebuilt in 1963, but passage along Well Creek <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult.</b> The East Anglian Waterways Association and the Middle Level Watermans Club began campaigning {{for it to be}} dredged in 1964. The first major working party by volunteers on the system occurred in 1972, when the Well Creek Trust organised a project called 'Fenatic' in October, which involved draining the creek so that it could be cleared of rubbish. It was reopened for traffic in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The Russians {{assaulted}} {{the second}} Polish line and pierced it in numerous places. The position of Russian infantry <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> because it overtook the 14 Polish guns sent forward by General Bem {{to support the}} Polish counter-attack, which meant that it was under artillery fire from the front, the sides and the rear. Eventually a counter-attack by the 4th Line Infantry Regiment under Lt. Col. Kazimierz Majewski repelled the Russians storming the Polish lines. Several smaller Russian units broke through and tried to fortify a group of wooden houses in the suburb of Wola, but were quickly surrounded and killed. At that point, around 13:00, Małachowski wanted to organise yet another counter-attack aimed at Fort 56, but his orders were overridden by Krukowiecki, who feared that the Russians might want to attack further south, near Jerozolimskie Gate, and preferred to keep his reserves intact. The Polish side ceased all offensive actions on the western front, and only the artillery remained active.|$|E
