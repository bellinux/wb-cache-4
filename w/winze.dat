25|$|It {{was in the}} North Shaft that a fire {{occurred}} in 1952, which caused the greatest single loss {{of life in the}} mine's entire history. An electrical fault one weekend may have started the fire. When the men went to work on the Monday morning (7 July 1952), the air compressor was started up, and air from a broken air line fanned the flames, releasing poisonous carbon monoxide gas which began to circulate round the mine. Some of the men began to collapse when they reached the 175Fathom Level. Four men who had descended the 940N <b>Winze</b> were killed, and rescuers were driven out of the mine by the gas. The bodies could not be recovered until 16 July, and the mine did not reopen until 1 September.|$|E
2500|$|Murray's Shaft was deepened {{again to}} the 200Fathom Level about 1940, but that {{development}} was abandoned when {{it was found that}} the winding engine could not lift ore from that depth, and a new engine was unobtainable during the war. Instead a series of winzes were sunk from various places along the 175Fathom Level. The new company had introduced a system of coordinates to specify locations within the mine, centred on Smith's Shaft. Thus the 940N <b>Winze</b> was [...] north of Smith's Shaft (even though that shaft did not connect with the 175Fathom Level.) The 940N <b>Winze</b> was sunk in 1939 to a new 200Fathom Level in the heart of the rich North Ore Shoot. In 1943 the Capital <b>Winze</b> was sunk at 1400N and 214Fathom sublevels were driven north and south from it. Another <b>winze</b> at 530S was started, but suspended when it encountered quantities of water.|$|E
60|$|John Cock returned, {{and they}} both stooped to afford help. In another moment Oliver Trembath, drenched and bleeding, and covered with mud, stood, or rather reeled, before them. It was evident {{that he was only}} half conscious, and {{scarcely}} able to stand. But they had no time to speak--scarcely to think--for the water was already boiling up through the <b>winze</b> like a huge fountain, and filling the level. They seized Oliver by the arms and dragged him hastily towards the nearest <b>winze</b> that led upward. Here they found water pouring down like rain, and heard its thunders above them, but the stream was not sufficient to retard their progress up the <b>winze,</b> which they ascended with comparative ease. Penrose and Cock were surprised at this, but the small quantity of water was soon accounted for {{by the fact that the}} hatch or trap-door of the <b>winze</b> had been closed; and thus, while it prevented the great body of water above from descending, also effectually shut off the only way of escape. They were therefore compelled to descend again to the level, in which the water was now rising rapidly.|$|E
50|$|Common {{features}} in a mine include drifts (horizontal tunnels), shafts (vertical tunnels) and <b>winzes</b> or air vents {{that are much}} smaller and can be at any angle underground. Climbing through these shafts, tunnels, and <b>winzes</b> can be very dangerous due to their unseen entrances and exits. A drift with a portal to the outside is called an adit.|$|R
5000|$|Stoping is {{considered}} [...] "productive work", and is contrasted with [...] "deadwork", the work required merely {{to access the}} mineral deposit, such as sinking shafts and <b>winzes,</b> carving adits, tunnels, and levels, and establishing ventilation and transportation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{water from}} the mine was light, the largest pump being an [...]66 ft plunger pump, which sufficed to keep clear of water the {{workings}} below the tunnel level. Ventilation was afforded by a regular system of <b>winzes</b> from level to level.|$|R
6000|$|The {{air at the}} [...] "end" [...] of {{the level}} in which Maggot and Trevarrow worked was very bad, and, for some time past, men had been engaged in sinking a <b>winze</b> from the level above to connect the two, and send in a supply of fresh air by {{creating}} a new channel of circulation. This <b>winze</b> was almost completed, {{but one of the}} men employed at it had suddenly become unwell that day, and no other had been appointed to the work. As {{it was a matter of}} great importance to have fresh air, now that they had resolved to remain day and night in the mine for some time, Maggot and Trevarrow determined to complete the work, believing that one or two shots would do it. Accordingly, they mounted to the level above, and were lowered one at a time to the bottom of the unfinished <b>winze</b> by a windlass, which was turned by the man whose comrade had become unwell.|$|E
6000|$|In {{another part}} of the mine, below the level where the {{accident}} occurred, James Penrose, whom we have already introduced to the reader, was at work with John Cock. The latter having taken a fancy to try mining for a time instead of smuggling--just by way of a change--had joined the former in working a [...] "pitch" [...] in Botallack mine. These men were peculiarly situated. They were in a level which the water entered, not by flowing along or descending, but, by rising up through a <b>winze.</b> On hearing the noise they ran to this <b>winze,</b> and, looking down, saw the water boiling and roaring far below. They were about to pass on to the shaft when Penrose observed a dark object moving on the ladder. It came slowly up.|$|E
60|$|Penrose at once {{clasped his}} hands, and, closing his eyes, prayed for his comrade with such fervour that his voice rose loud and strong above {{the turmoil of}} the flood. He was still engaged in prayer when the water drove them from the level, and {{compelled}} them to re-ascend the <b>winze.</b> Here John Cock began to pray for himself in agonising tones. By this time Oliver had partially recovered, and suggested that they should ascend the <b>winze</b> to the top. Penrose assured {{him that it was}} useless to do so; but, while he was still speaking, he observed that the water ceased to rise, and began quickly to abate. In fact, all that we have taken so long to describe--from the outburst to the termination of the great rush--took place within half an hour.|$|E
50|$|In mining, a rib pillar {{separates}} one stope {{from the}} other and is aligned transverse of the stope, perpendicular to the strike. It is used in mining to increase the strata stability of the stope and support the raises, <b>winzes</b> or shaft of the mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] said I, [...] "wait in a draughty {{level with}} an extinguishable candle {{close to the}} main shaft, with 30 or 40 miles of levels around, and no end of <b>winzes?</b> No, no, Captain Jan, go on; I'll stick to you now {{through thick and thin}} like your own shadow!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About eighty fathoms," [...] {{said the}} captain; [...] "we shall now go along this level {{and get into}} the pump-shaft, by which we can descend to the bottom. Take care of your feet and head as you go, for you'll be apt to run against the rocks that hang down, and the <b>winzes</b> are dangerous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what would}} happen," [...] asked Oliver, with an {{expression}} of half-simulated anxiety, [...] "if you were to fall down a <b>winze</b> and break your neck, and my candle were to get knocked or blown out, leaving me to find my way out of a labyrinth of levels pierced with holes sixty feet deep?" ...|$|E
6000|$|They hoy't out Will, wi' sair advice; [...] They hecht {{him some}} fine braw ane; [...] It chanc'd the stack he faddom't thrice^13 [...] Was timmer-propt for thrawin: [...] He taks a swirlie auld moss-oak [...] For some black, grousome carlin; [...] An' loot a <b>winze,</b> an' drew a stroke, [...] Till skin in blypes cam haurlin [...] Aff's nieves that night.|$|E
60|$|The noise {{overhead}} now grew {{less and}} less, until it almost ceased. They then ascended to the trap-door {{and tried to}} force it open, but failed. They shouted, however, and were heard, ere long, by those who had escaped and {{had returned to the}} mine to search for their less fortunate companions. The trap-door was opened, strong and willing hands were thrust down the dark <b>winze</b> to the rescue, and in a few seconds the three men were saved.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} {{is divided}} into 19 cadastral communities. These are Diendorf, Doppel (with the localities of Doppel, Neustift and Hofstetten), Eitzendorf, Flinsdorf, Fugging, Greiling, Großrust, Grünz, Hain (with the localities of Kleinhain, Angern and Großhain), Heinigstetten, Kleinrust, Landhausen, Obermerking, Obritzberg, Pfaffing, Schweinern (with the localities of Schweinern and Thallern), Untermerking (with the localities of Untermerking and Mittermerking), <b>Winzing</b> and Zagging.|$|R
50|$|In {{the shaft}} the {{ventilation}} was natural, being {{due to the}} higher temperature underground than above ground. The general tendency of the air-current was down the shaft {{to the bottom of}} the mine, and up through the various <b>winzes</b> (intermediate shafts) to the adit level. The open end of this had been connected to a sloping wooden chimney on the hillside, by which means the draught was increased.|$|R
5000|$|Falling down {{vertical}} openings is {{the most}} common cause of death and injury in abandoned mines. <b>Winzes</b> are vertical or inclined shafts sunk from a tunnel and these can be hidden by darkness, water, loose debris or false floors. False floors may also be present in substantial lengths of tunnel, where the floor level has been worked (understoped). Such floors may be supported by rotten wood, but surfaced with rock and not clearly distinguishable from a solid floor.|$|R
6000|$|Soon {{after passing}} this the captain paused at a deep cutting in the rock, and, looking sadly {{at it for}} a few minutes, said,--"It was here that poor Trevool lost his life. He was a good lad, but careless, and used to go {{rattling}} along the levels with his light in his hat and his thoughts among the stars, instead of carrying the light in his hand and looking to his feet. He fell down that <b>winze</b> and broke his back. When we got him up to grass he was alive, but he never spoke another word, and died the same night." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{were now}} in a region of {{profound}} silence! When we paused for a minute to rest, {{it felt as if}} the silence of the tomb itself had surrounded us--for not the faintest echo reached us from the world above, and the miners at work below us were still far down out of ear-shot. In a few seconds we came to a yawning hole in the path, bridged by a single plank. Captain Jan crossed. [...] "How deep is it?" [...] I asked, preparing to follow. [...] "About 60 feet," [...] said he, [...] "it's a <b>winze,</b> and goes down to the next level!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The next {{who came}} forward was a blind man. He had worked {{long in the}} mine--so long that he could find {{his way through the}} {{labyrinth}} of levels as easily in his blind state as he did formerly with his eyesight. When his eyes were destroyed (in the usual way, by the explosion of a hole), he was only off work during the period of convalescence. Afterwards he returned to his familiar haunts underground; and although he could no longer labour in the old way, he was quite able to work a windlass, and draw up the bucket at a <b>winze.</b> For this he now pocketed two pounds sterling, and walked off as vigorously as if he had possessed both his eyes! ...|$|E
60|$|For {{many days}} after the {{catastrophe}} Oliver Trembath lay in his bed suffering from severe cuts and bruises, {{as well as from}} what must have been, as nearly as possible, concussion of the brain, for he had certainly been washed down one of the <b>winzes,</b> although he himself retained only a confused recollection of the events of that terrible day, and could not tell what had befallen him. At length, however, he became convalescent, and a good deal of his old vigour returned.|$|R
50|$|It was {{primarily}} {{the exploitation of}} the Sunshine vein followed by the Chester vein that determined the present configuration of the underground workings. With {{the discovery of the}} Chester vein on the 2700 level and the ore body's distance from the Jewell shaft of approximately 4000 feet east - southeast, other internal shafts (the No. 4, No. 5 and No. 10 shafts, more properly defined as <b>winzes)</b> were sunk or raised to more efficiently service the operations. The other principal internal shaft is the No. 12 shaft, servicing the Copper vein and the West Syndicate vein in the western end of the mine.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1940s three 8-hour shifts were worked {{each day}} for six days a week. The miners worked on [...] "group piece work." [...] Each group was paid {{fortnightly}} according {{to the amount of}} work done, measured in cubic fathoms in the stopes, or in feet for driving levels or sinking <b>winzes.</b> The cost of explosives used, and of carbide supplied for lamps, was deducted from the payments made. Surface workers in the mill were paid weekly wages. Poor labour relations at the time led to an unofficial strike in 1942; the men on weekly rates eventually received an increase of 2 shillings per day following a similar settlement in the West Cumberland iron mines.|$|R
60|$|At {{the first}} rush {{the water had}} almost filled the level where it occurred, and, {{sweeping}} onward about eight fathoms to a <b>winze,</b> plunged down and partly over it. The greater part, however, {{went down to the}} eighty-five fathom level. East of this a man named Anguin, with his two sons, William and James--youths of about twenty years of age--were at work. They heard the roar of the approaching torrent, and the father and younger son James rushed towards the <b>winze,</b> intending to ascend the ladder. Before they reached it the flood was pouring down with deafening noise. The least harmful part of the cataract was the water, for the current now carried along with it stones, pieces of timber, and rubbish. To encounter all this might have caused the stoutest hearts to quail, but miners can never calculate the probable extent of an inundation. They might, indeed, by remaining in the roof of the level, escape; but, on the other hand, if the flood should be great enough to fill the place, they would certainly be drowned. Father and son, therefore, preferred to make a desperate effort to save their lives. They dashed into the flood and made a grasp at the ladder, but before their hands touched the first round they were beaten down and swept away dead corpses. William, on the other hand, climbed to a cross-piece of timber, where he remained until the water abated, which it did in a very short time, for events of this kind are for the most part awfully sudden and brief as well as fatal. Then, descending, he groped his way in the dark over the very spot where his father and brother lay dead--fearfully mutilated and covered with rubbish--and escaped up the shaft.|$|E
60|$|In a still {{lower level}} two {{brothers}} were at work. Miners usually work in couples--sometimes in larger numbers--and brothers frequently go together. They {{were in a}} <b>winze</b> about thirty fathoms from the engine-shaft. Being overtaken by the flood they were washed down, to the next level, and along it nearly to the shaft. As the torrent tore past this place, bearing splintered timber, stones, and rubbish along with it, an iron wagon was caught up and flung across the level. This formed a barricade, against which the brothers were dashed. The elder of these brothers was afterwards found alive here, and carried to the surface; but he was speechless, and died twenty minutes after being brought up. When the dead body of the younger and weaker brother was recovered, it {{was found to be}} dreadfully shattered, nearly every bone being crushed.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the levels}} {{have been driven}} a {{considerable}} distance from the shaft, the air naturally becomes bad from want of circulation. To remedy this evil, holes, or short shafts, called [...] "winzes," [...] are sunk at intervals from the upper to the lower levels. These winzes are dangerous traps for the unwary or careless, extending frequently {{to a depth of}} ten or fifteen fathoms, and being bridged across by one or two loose planks. Ladders are fixed in many of them to facilitate progress through the mine. When a miner drives the end of his level so far that the air will not circulate, a new <b>winze</b> is usually sunk down to him from the level above. The circulation is thus extended, and the levels progress further and further right and left until they occupy miles of ground. The levels and shafts of Botallack, if put together, would extend to not less than forty miles, and the superficial space of ground, on and beneath which the mine lies, is above 260 acres.|$|E
60|$|Oliver {{had been}} so intent on his feet, and mindful of the <b>winzes,</b> that {{he had failed to}} observe the immense black opening overhead. It {{extended}} so high above him, and so far forward and backward {{in the direction of the}} level, that its boundaries were lost in an immensity of profoundly dark space. The rocky path was also lost to view, both before and behind them, so that the glare of their lights on the metallic walls rendered the spot on which they stood a point of brilliancy in the midst of darkness. Only part of a great beam was visible here and there above them, as if suspended in the gloom to render its profundity more apparent.|$|R
25|$|Underground {{uranium mining}} is in {{principle}} {{no different from}} any other hard rock mining and other ores are often mined in association (e.g., copper, gold, silver). Once the ore body has been identified a shaft is sunk {{in the vicinity of the}} ore veins, and crosscuts are driven horizontally to the veins at various levels, usually every 100 to 150 metres. Similar tunnels, known as drifts, are driven along the ore veins from the crosscut. To extract the ore, the next step is to drive tunnels, known as raises when driven upwards and <b>winzes</b> when driven downwards, through the deposit from level to level. Raises are subsequently used to develop the stopes where the ore is mined from the veins.|$|R
2500|$|Paddys River Mine or Cowley copper mine {{is located}} 700m {{upstream}} on Paddys River. [...] The host rock is a skarn where Shannons Flat Adamellite baked limestone from the Paddy's River Volcanics. [...] The {{bulk of the}} mineral here is magnetite, but other sulfide and minerals of copper, lead zinc and silver attracted miners. [...] Thomas Coyle operated the mine in 1895, producing 2.6 tons of copper and 26.1kg of silver. In 1907 the Cowley Copper Syndicate Ltd started more work cutting two more adits and <b>winzes.</b> However it was abandoned by 1909 as the ore was too low grade. [...] More than a million tons of magnetite remain. [...] Many minerals such as aurichalcite, bronchanite, caledonite, cerussite, hemimorphite, hydrozincite, linarite, native silver, rozenite, and zincsilite have been found at the location.|$|R
6000|$|... "When you do," [...] said Oliver with enthusiasm, [...] "your {{opinion of}} them will be strengthened, for their {{endurance}} underground, and their perseverance in a species of labour which taxes their muscular power as well as their patience to the uttermost, surpasses anything I have either seen or heard of. England does not fully appreciate, because she is not minutely acquainted with, the endurance and courage of her Cornish miners. The rocks through which they have to cut are so hard and unyielding that men who had not been trained from childhood to subdue them would lose heart altogether at the weight of toil and the small return for it. Sometimes, indeed, miners are fortunate, and here, as elsewhere, lucky hits are made, {{but for the most part}} their gains are barely sufficient for their wants; and whether they are lucky or unlucky in that respect, the toil is always hard--so hard that few of them retain health or strength sufficient to go underground beyond the age of forty-five, while hundreds of them find an early grave, owing to disease resulting from their peculiar work, or to accidents. These last are usually occasioned by the bursting out of collections of water which flood the mines, or the fall of masses of timber, or the premature explosion of blast-holes. At other times the men lose hold of the ladders--`fall away' from them, as they express it--or stumble into a <b>winze,</b> which is a small shaft connecting level with level, in which latter case death is almost certain to ensue, many of the winzes being sixty feet deep. In St. Just you will see many poor fellows who have been blinded or maimed in the mines. Nevertheless Cornish miners are a contented, uncomplaining race of men, and Cornwall is justly proud of them." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{man named}} Richard--a {{powerful}} {{man and a}} cool experienced miner, who had faced death in almost every form--was at work {{in one of the}} lowest levels with his son William, a youth of twenty-one, and his nephew, a lad of seventeen, who was the sole support of a widowed mother with six children. They were thirty fathoms from one of the winzes down which the water streamed. On hearing the roar Richard cautioned the younger men to be prompt, but collected. No time was to be lost, but rash haste might prove as fatal as delay. He sent them on in front of him, and they rushed under and past the <b>winze,</b> where they were nearly crushed by the falling water, and where, of course, their candles were extinguished, leaving them in midnight darkness. This last was not so serious a matter to the elder Richard as, at first sight, it might appear. He knew every foot of the ground they had to traverse, with all its turnings, yawning chasms, and plank bridges, and could have led the way blindfold almost as easily as with a light. As they neared the shaft he passed the younger men, and led the way to prevent them falling into it. At this time the water raged round them as high as their waists. The nephew, who was weak, in consequence of a fever from which he had not quite recovered, fell, and, passing the others unobserved, went down the shaft and was lost. The escape of Richard and his son was most wonderful. William was a stout fellow, but the father much more so. They were driven at first into the shaft, but there the fall of water was so great that they could do nothing more than cling to the ladder. By this cataract they were beaten back into the level, but here the water rose around them so quickly and with such force as to oblige them to make another effort to ascend.|$|E
60|$|Every man {{dropped his}} tools, {{and ran to}} the nearest shaft for his life. It was not, indeed, {{probable}} that the flood would fill all the wide-extended ramifications of the vast mine, but no one knew for certain where the catastrophe had occurred, or how near the danger might be to the spot where he laboured. Enough for each that death was dealing terrible destruction somewhere overhead, and that, unless every muscle were strained to the uttermost, the pathway might be filled up, and his retreat cut off. The rush was swiftly but not easily made. Those who have never traversed the levels of a Cornish mine may perhaps fancy, on hearing of levels six feet high, and {{about two and a half}} feet broad, on the average, that the flight might resemble the rush of men through the windings and turnings of the intricate passages in a stupendous old castle. But it was far otherwise. The roofs, walls, and floors of these levels were irregular, not only in direction, but in height and form. There was no levelling or polishing-off anywhere. It was tunnelling of the roughest kind. Angles and projections remained as the chisel, the pick, and the blasting-powder had left them. Here, the foot tripped over a lump, or plunged into a hollow; there, the head narrowly missed a depending mass of rock, or the shoulder grazed a projecting one. Elsewhere, pools of water lay in the path, and at intervals the yawning chasm of a <b>winze</b> appeared, with one or two broken planks to bridge the gulf, of twenty, forty, or sixty feet, that descended to the levels below. Sometimes it was possible to run with the head stooped a little; generally the back had to be bent low--often double; and occasionally progress could only be made on hands and knees,--this, too, with a candle to be guarded from blasts of air or dripping water, and trimmed, lest it should go out and leave the place in total darkness.|$|E
50|$|In 1904 {{the mine}} was {{described}} as having an open-cut on the tin portion, and on the copper section a tramway ran down 7 chains from the mine to the reverberatory furnace. The only building standing besides the furnace was the assay office. Firewood was swung across the creek to the furnace on wire ropes. The copper adit was driven 270 ft, with <b>winzes</b> and drives off it, and a shaft connecting to the surface 60 ft from the portal. The most recent smelting of 150 tons of ore produced 25 tons of matte containing 29% copper and 76oz silver and 6 dwt gold per ton matte. Mining recommenced in 1904, but was abandoned again in 1907, this time reputedly due to falling tin prices, though copper fell dramatically in 1907 as well. However, Kershaw and Dodds intended to erect a crushing works at the site the following year.|$|R
6000|$|Thus encouraged, Captain Dan went on {{to remark}} that there were six men driving in Wheal Hazzard (which {{statement}} caused a [...] "stranger" [...] who chanced {{to be at the}} dinner to observe, in an undertone, that he was not aware they had horses or vehicles of any kind in the mines!), that one cross-cut was also being driven, and three <b>winzes</b> were sinking, and one rise--several of which were opening up tin of first-rate quality, while in the Narrow shaft, Chicornish, Higher Mine, and Wheal Cock, a great deal to the same effect was being done--all of which we leave to the imagination of the reader, merely remarking that however incomprehensible these things may appear to him (or her), they created feelings of profound joy in the assembled guests, especially in the breast of the almost bankrupt one with the bald, red, and blue headpiece.|$|R
50|$|From 1720 the Maaßen Hoisting Shaft (Maaßener Treibschacht) and Maaßen Water Shaft (Maaßener Kunstschacht) of the Lautenthals Glück Pit {{were used}} to hoist ore and surplus water to the surface. At that time, both shafts were {{so-called}} <b>winzes</b> and did not open at the surface. From 1718, the hoisting shaft had a winding engine. From 1842 to 1844 the hoisting shaft was driven to the surface. In the subsequent period, the headframe and other above-ground facilities were added. The reversible water wheel lay 29 metres down the shaft and around 70 metres to the north. It was powered by water from the Oberer Richtschachter Graben. The old water wheel of the blind hosting shaft was another 40 metres deeper in an underground wheel room. In the Maaßen Water Shaft there was a double man engine for enabling miners to journey {{to and from the}} Lautenthals Glück Pit. These and the pumping need for water management were driven by four underground water wheels, which received their water through the Maaßen Watercourse (Maaßener Wasserlauf) which is still visible today.|$|R
