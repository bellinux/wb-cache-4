25|$|Little was {{expected}} of the Rams for 1999. Indeed, ESPN The Magazine's 1999 NFL preview predicted the Rams <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> team in the NFL; worse even than the Cleveland Browns, who had returned as an expansion team that year.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{testimony}} {{indicated that}} Detective Scott inquired of a railroad engineer named Rush, where <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> {{place for a}} train wreck. Rush pointed out the high bridge where, if a rail was pulled, the train would crash three or four hundred feet down an embankment, killing or injuring all on the train. Scott told Rush {{to be on the}} lookout for damaged track that night at that spot. Later that evening Rush stopped his train, walked ahead on the track and discovered that spikes had been pulled.|$|E
500|$|In March 1810, {{he married}} the 19-year old Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, {{and a great}} niece of Marie Antoinette by proxy; thus he had married into a German royal and {{imperial}} family. [...] Louise was less than happy with the arrangement, at least at first, stating [...] "Just to see the man <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> form of torture". [...] Her great-aunt had been executed in France, while Napoleon had fought numerous campaigns against Austria all throughout his military career. [...] However, she seemed to warm up to him over time. [...] After her wedding, she wrote to her father [...] "He loves me very much. I respond to his love sincerely. There is something very fetching and very eager about him that is impossible to resist".|$|E

2500|$|In children, {{paralysis}} due to polio {{occurs in}} one in 1000 cases, while in adults, paralysis occurs in one in 75 cases. By 1950, the peak age incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis in the United States had shifted from infants to children aged 5 to 9 years; {{about one-third of}} the cases were reported in persons over 15 years of age. Accordingly, the rate of paralysis and death due to polio infection also increased during this time. In the United States, the 1952 polio epidemic <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> outbreak in the nation's history, and is credited with heightening parents’ fears of the disease and focusing public awareness on the need for a vaccine. [...] Of the 57,628 cases reported that year 3,145 died and 21,269 were left with mild to disabling paralysis.|$|E
2500|$|That Wolfe disapproves {{of women}} is well established, but Archie claims that there are nuances: “The basic fact about a woman that seemed to irritate him {{was that she was}} a woman; the long record showed not a single exception; but from there on the {{documentation}} was cockeyed. If woman as woman grated on him you would suppose that the most womanly details <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> for him, but time and again I have known him to have a chair placed for a female so that his desk would not obstruct his view of her legs, and the answer can’t be that his interest is professional and he reads character from legs, because the older and dumpier she is the less he cares where she sits. It is a very complex question and some day I’m going to take a whole chapter for it.” (The Silent Speaker, chapter 30.) ...|$|E

"I don't {{know what}} may <b>be</b> for <b>the</b> best," [...] said Margaret, again {{bordering}} upon the hysterical in the tremulousness of her voice, [...] "but that I'm sure <b>would</b> <b>be</b> for <b>the</b> <b>worst.</b> However, I've {{made up my}} mind to nothing as yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you might}} do that, lad," [...] Captain Lister said sadly; [...] "but it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> very <b>worst</b> thing you could do.

2500|$|Significant {{rainfall}} {{was recorded}} along the Palm Beach County coast between November 21 and November 26 during this event, with local amounts {{of up to}} [...] measured at West Palm Beach, Florida. [...] Surface temperatures hovered in the middle 50s°F, or around 13°C, within the main region of impact. However, wind and high seas were the storm's main impact due to the strong pressure gradient between the cyclone's center and a 1040hPa surface high over the Ohio Valley. Winds as high as [...] with swells of up to [...] were reported by ships in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Along the Atlantic coast, winds reached [...] at Vero Beach, [...] at Melbourne, [...] at Titusville, and [...] at Cocoa Beach. Offshore the Atlantic coast, seas also reached [...] Coastal erosion took its toll between St. Augustine and Palm Beach during the three-day storm, which eventually subsided on November 26. About five-sixths of a new pier at St. Augustine was destroyed. Erosion from this cyclone <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> experienced in southern Brevard County until Hurricane Frances in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Max has {{a history}} of cheating, which Inside Soap said would make him the most obvious person, but as he has {{recently}} reunited with his former wife Tanya Jessop (Jo Joyner), it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> thing he could do. However, the magazine said that [...] "Max thrives on passion and deceipt, so getting it on with Kat behind Tanya's back would be consistent." [...] They also said he was busy with his own problems, but had form finding Slater (Kat's maiden name) women irresistible (he had an affair with Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) years earlier). They said Kat's fiery personality would appeal to Max and [...] "he loves illicit liaisons with unsuitable partners". They felt he was bound to mess up his relationship with Tanya, but thought it would more likely be something else that would do that. Soaplife said Max was [...] "least likely even though he has the track record and the matching morals of an alley cat." [...] Actor Wood had previously promised a big storyline for Max, but Soaplife did not think this would be it. Soaplife later ruled out Max, asking [...] "why would he go for hamburger (Kat) when he has steak (Tanya) at home?" [...] All About Soap called Max a [...] "love rat", but doubted that he would cheat on Tanya again, but as it's Max, [...] "all bets are off {{when it comes to the}} bedroom", and said he was the second most likely suspect. In September 2012, Richie said he thought that Max was the most likely suspect, saying [...] "I think it's Max. You can't trust him!" [...] Wood stated that [...] "It would definitely be in keeping with Max for him to be having an affair. He's got a chequered history and women are his Achilles heel. So it would make a lot of sense for it to be him. It would be bad timing, though, because he's planning to get remarried!" ...|$|E

6000|$|Maclise {{was with}} me. It was then half-past seven. We had been walking, and <b>were</b> splashed to <b>the</b> eyes.

50|$|The Bengals' {{final game}} was a {{division}} rivalry rematch against the Ravens. The Bengals trailed throughout {{the game as}} kicker Billy Cundiff hit a 25 and a 47-yard field goal. This was followed by Ray Rice getting a 7-yard TD run. <b>The</b> lead <b>was</b> only narrowed with QB Carson Palmer throwing an 11-yard TD pass to WR Jerome Simpson, but the Bengals couldn't do any more, snapping their two-game winning streak and thus ending the season on a 4-12 record which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> team's <b>worst</b> record under Marvin Lewis.|$|R

"This {{comes of}} meddling with men's amourettes," [...] said Genvil; [...] "Sir Damian would needs brawl with Wenlock about his {{dealings}} with this miller's daughter, and you see they account him a favourer of their enterprise; it will be well if others do not take up the same opinion.--I wish we <b>were</b> rid of <b>the</b> trouble which such suspicions may bring upon us--ay, <b>were</b> it at <b>the</b> price of my best horse--I am like to lose him at any rate with the day's hard service, and I <b>would</b> it <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> it <b>is</b> to cost us." ...|$|R

60|$|A {{simultaneous}} photograph could alone reproduce Mrs. March's tumultuous {{and various}} emotions as she seized the fact conveyed in my words. She poured out {{a volume of}} mingled conjectures, assertions, suspicions, conclusions, {{in which there was}} nothing final but the decision that we must not dream of going there; that it would look like thrusting ourselves in, and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> sort of taste; they would all hate us, and we should feel that we <b>were</b> spies upon <b>the</b> young people; for of course the Bentleys had got Glendenning there to marry him, and in effect did not want any one to witness the disgraceful spectacle.|$|R
60|$|A {{few words}} from those {{standing}} round corroborated a statement which at first appeared fabulous; and then finding that an open encounter with Rupert <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> possible {{method of obtaining}} satisfaction for the injuries he had received, Sir Richard Fulke flung {{himself out of the}} school, muttering deep vows of future vengeance.|$|E

5000|$|On {{one of his}} trips back to the U.S. in December 1967, Vann {{was asked}} by Walt Rostow, an {{advocate}} of more troops and Johnson administration National Security Advisor, whether <b>the</b> U.S. <b>would</b> <b>be</b> over <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of <b>the</b> war in six months: [...] "Oh hell no, Mr. Rostow," [...] replied Vann, [...] "I'm a born optimist.
