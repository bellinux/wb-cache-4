I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
