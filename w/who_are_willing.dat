5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to dental treatment, and few are willing to participate in such a course of action, often because of poverty. Those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to seek dental treatment often resist discussing their drug use. Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the alien {{substance}} Terrigen was released into the ecosystem, Joey Gutierrez developed metal-melting abilities. Unable to control this power, Gutierrez is confronted in the streets by soldiers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to use lethal force to detain him. Gutierrez is saved by S.H.I.E.L.D., and Inhuman agent Daisy Johnson attempts {{to explain to him}} that he is also an Inhuman, with a dormant gene within him that was activated by the Terrigen. Struggling to help Gutierrez accept what has happened to him, Johnson seeks the help of Lincoln Campbell, the Inhuman who helped her transition but has now renounced the ways of the Inhumans, wishing to live a normal life.|$|E

5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance {{is made to}} look like a box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence to the dining room, where they sit at formica countertops in booths {{made to look like}} convertibles from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. The cars have whitewall tires, and speakers are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each convertible seats four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near {{the back of the room}} that are only used when the rest of the restaurant is full and there are guests <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to forego the experience of sitting in the cars. All guests who make reservations are seated in the cars, although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|E

25|$|In {{the current}} century, most {{developed}} countries have increased fertility. From {{the point of}} view of evolutionary biology, wealthier people having fewer children is unexpected, as natural selection would be expected to favor individuals <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> and able to convert plentiful resources into plentiful fertile descendants. This may be the result of a departure from the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Thus, from the perspective of evolutionary psychology, the modern environment is exerting evolutionary pressure for higher fertility.|$|E
25|$|Barbour held strong Republican beliefs, {{similar to}} his neighbors Jefferson and Madison. He vigorously opposed the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 {{and used his}} rhetorical eloquence to support the Virginia Resolutions. Barbour {{believed}} the Acts and their supporters threatened the United States, stating “to make an expected attack from abroad a pretext for attacking the principles of liberty at home has drawn aside the curtain and clearly illuminated for all <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to see.” Barbour refused to support legislation increasing Executive powers, especially unchecked powers.|$|E

25|$|Several factors {{combine to}} put credit unions {{at risk of}} failure. They may {{not be allowed to}} lend enough money to enough people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> and able to repay because of their rules on {{responsible}} lending. When debtors get into trouble, they will often repay liabilities such as payday loans with high interest rates first, leaving the credit unions until last. In some cases courts may, after ruling against debtors, leniently allow them to pay off their debts with very small payments, sometimes free of interest, over a long period.|$|E
25|$|Yield curves {{are usually}} upward sloping asymptotically: {{the longer the}} maturity, the higher the yield, with {{diminishing}} marginal increases (that is, as one moves to the right, the curve flattens out). There are two common explanations for upward sloping yield curves. First, {{it may be that}} the market is anticipating a rise in the risk-free rate. If investors hold off investing now, they may receive a better rate in the future. Therefore, under the arbitrage pricing theory, investors <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to lock their money in now need to be compensated for the anticipated rise in rates—thus the higher interest rate on long-term investments.|$|E
25|$|Although {{religious}} education for children is officially forbidden by law in China, the Communist party allows Hui Muslims to violate this law {{and have their}} children educated in religion and attend Mosques while the law is enforced on Uyghurs. After secondary education is completed, China then allows Hui students <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to embark on religious studies under an Imam. China does not enforce the law against children attending Mosques on non-Uyghurs in areas outside of Xinjiang. Since the 1980s Islamic private schools (Sino-Arabic schools (中阿學校)) have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government among Muslim areas, only specifically excluding Xinjiang from allowing these schools because of separatist sentiment there.|$|E
