5|$|The gangsters {{have bought}} a weapon off the Brotherhood <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> them fight against Inhumans. They open the box {{containing}} the weapon, and unleash a mystical being who turns the gangsters berserk. She secretly infects May as well, as the strike force {{takes out the}} gangsters. Johnson meets with Rodriguez, who stole medication from S.H.I.E.L.D. during their brief check with her <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> Johnson heal—her recent over use of her Inhuman abilities as Quake has been fracturing her bones. Johnson then tracks down the Ghost Rider and confronts it, but it defeats her, explaining that it only murders people that deserve to die. She thinks this should include her, but it refuses to kill her. She later sees the Ghost Rider's human form, Robbie Reyes, looking after his disabled brother Gabe.|$|E
5|$|The storm petrel's large nasal {{olfactory}} bulbs {{facilitate a}} keen sense of smell, and the birds themselves have a distinctive musty aroma <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> researchers to locate breeding colonies. Individual petrels recognise their own body scent and can use it to locate their nest in the dark.|$|E
5|$|RNAi is a {{valuable}} research tool, both in cell culture and in living organisms, because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can selectively and robustly induce suppression of specific genes of interest. RNAi {{may be used for}} large-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as cell division. The pathway is also used as a practical tool in biotechnology, medicine and insecticides.|$|E

5|$|To left {{of center}} in the station model, the {{temperature}} and dew point are plotted. Within the United States on surface weather maps, they are still plotted in degrees Fahrenheit. Otherwise, {{they will be in}} units of degrees Celsius. This knowledge is important to meteorologists because when this data is plotted on a map, isotherms and isodrosotherms (lines of equal dew point) are easily analyzed, either by man or machine, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> determine location of weather fronts.|$|E
5|$|A {{weather map}} {{displays}} various meteorological features across {{a particular area}} at a particular point in time and has various symbols which all have specific meanings. Such maps have been in use since the mid-19th century and are used for research and weather forecasting purposes. Maps using isotherms show temperature gradients, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> locate weather fronts. Isotach maps, analyzing lines of equal wind speed, on a constant pressure surface of 300 or 250hPa show where the jet stream is located. Use of constant pressure charts at the 700 and 500hPa level can indicate tropical cyclone motion. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds at various levels show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure. Cloud codes are translated into symbols and plotted on these maps along with other meteorological data that are included in synoptic reports sent by professionally trained observers.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to diagnose poisoning.|$|E
25|$|It is {{advised to}} {{maintain}} a degree of muscle tension in this asana. Moderate tension in the thighs and hips can help develop positive habits and can increase the musculature in those areas <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> prevent injury. Additionally maintaining a degree of tension requires awareness, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> prevent injury itself. Though in this asana {{it is unlikely to}} injure one's self, this habit can be beneficial throughout yoga practice.|$|E

25|$|Reports have {{suggested}} triclosan, an active ingredient in {{many kinds of}} toothpastes, can combine with chlorine in tap water to form chloroform, which the United States Environmental Protection Agency classifies as a probable human carcinogen.

25|$|In nature, {{males and}} females usually differ in {{reproductive}} fitness optima. Males generally prefer to maximize their number of offspring, and therefore their number of mates; females, on the other hand, tend to care more for their offspring and have fewer mates. Because of this, there are generally more males available to mate at a given time, making females a limited resource. This leads males to evolve aggressive mating behaviors <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> them acquire mates.|$|E
