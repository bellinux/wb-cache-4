50|$|The {{period from}} the 1850s to the 1870s was in general {{an era of}} {{expansion}} for Boondooma and this is reflected in its physical growth at the time. In November 1855, Alexander Robertson Lawson married Emily Mountford Ball and the following year a son named Robert was born. By that time, it seems plans had already been made to replace an earlier house, which was reputedly located on an area archaeologically identified as being later used for a fowl house, with a larger residence to accommodate the Lawson family. Station correspondence from this period reveals building supplies and furniture being ordered in September 1855, including door hinges, locks, handles, window glass, wallpaper, calico for the wooden walls, a drawing room table and chairs, a hand basin, cooking stove, and bath. By late 1856, the Boondooma <b>wages</b> <b>book</b> indicates that 2 carpenters, John Groom and John Moules, were employed at the station. Both carpenters worked at Boondooma until mid-1857, along {{with a team of}} 5 other tradesmen under their supervision, and it is most likely that the main timber house, which is still standing, was constructed during this period.|$|E
5000|$|At {{much the}} same time, it seems the stone {{storeroom}} and an adjoining timber meat house were also being erected. The stone building was constructed from roughly coursed local rock obtained from a nearby quarry, sawn timbers, logs, and antbed, and was built by Wilhelm Brill, a stonemason. Brill was born in Germany in 1811 and arrived in Brisbane on 12 January 1853 on board the Johan Caesar. With his family, Brill first moved to Toowoomba before making his way to Boondooma by August 1855. In the mid-1850s, the Lawsons were actively recruiting German workers owing to the general [...] "scarcity of labour and the satisfaction those already in our service have given us" [...] and the Boondooma <b>wages</b> <b>book</b> shows Brill was employed as a stonemason from 24 May 1856 to 21 July 1857. He remained at the station until 1861 working as a shepherd, thereafter moving to Ipswich and then to Toowoomba where he died in 1886. The main stone structure remains well preserved and Brill's familiarity with metric dimensions makes this building {{one of the earliest}} in Queensland constructed to metric standards.|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The aim {{of the project was}} to study the labour supply, effort, and decisions of the workers employed at the Garesfield Bute pit in County Durham. Main Topics : The Victorian Household Panel Study has been compiled from four sources: the <b>wages</b> <b>book</b> and plans of Garesfield Bute pit at High Spen in County Durham, England; the Ordnance Survey map of 1895; and the 1891 Census Enumerators' Books. It contains detailed information about the households, work places and assignments, output and pay of the hewers, putters and supervisory underground workers in the pit for the period June 1890 to January 1893. For hewers, an important feature of work and society was the system of marrowing, under which they chose their own work mates, and shared earnings with them. The Panel Study permits reconstruction of the history of marrow pairings during the period June 1890 to January 1893. Data on work places and assignments, output and pay form an unbalanced panel of observations of the behaviour of those workers who were present in the pit from time to time. Household information is drawn from the 1891 Census Enumerators' Books, and is there fore a snapshot of household structure at a single point in time. Release 1 a consists of as accurate a transcription of the Garesfield Bute <b>wages</b> <b>book,</b> without any attempt at linkage or other interpretation. Release 1 b includes codes linking workers across pays, and codes linking the <b>wages</b> <b>book</b> to the other three sources.

50|$|The archive {{material}} {{consists of}} business records, <b>wage</b> <b>books,</b> photograph albums, correspondence, letters, diaries, visual reference material, trade cards, and other printed ephemera. The Silver Studio was pioneering {{in that it}} employed {{the services of a}} photographer to record every design. Designs were numbered and cross referenced to photograph albums and day books, the majority of which survive. It is therefore possible to trace the details of the designer of a given design (by which is meant both original designs in the collections, and actual examples of wallpapers or textiles existing in the wider world) and to establish to which manufacturer it was sold, when and for how much. The completeness and coherence of this archive material existing alongside the designs, wallpapers and textiles themselves, makes the Silver Studio collection entirely unique. Rarely do other collections document the whole process of creating and selling a design, as is possible here.|$|R

5000|$|Le Roy Ladurie first {{attracted}} {{attention with}} his doctoral thesis, Les paysans de Languedoc, {{which was published}} as a book in 1966 and translated into English as The Peasants of Languedoc in 1974. In this study of the peasantry of Languedoc over several centuries, Le Roy Ladurie employed a huge range of quantitative information such as tithe records, <b>wage</b> <b>books,</b> tax receipts, rent receipts and profit records, together {{with the use of}} the theories of such thinkers as Ernest Labrousse, Michel Foucault, David Ricardo, Fernand Braudel, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Thomas Malthus, François Simiand, Sigmund Freud, and Max Weber, to contend that the history of Languedoc was [...] "l'histoire immobile." [...] He argued that the history of Langudedoc was marked by waves of growth and decline that in essence changed very little over the passage of time. Le Roy Ladurie acknowledged his debt to Braudel that had argued that it was climate and geography that shaped the course of history, but felt that Braudel had gone too far in using geography and climate as causal agents in history. Instead, Le Roy Ladurie felt that culture and economics were just as important as causal agents as the nature of the land and the weather over it. Influenced by the work of his mentor Fernand Braudel, Le Roy Ladurie set out to write a histoire totale (total history) of Languedoc from the 15th to the 18th centuries that would embrace political, cultural, economic, social history and environmental history all integrated into one.|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the occupational enumeration {{of women in the}} Victorian censuses, and the potential for problems created by the under or mis-enumeration of women's work, {{has been a source of}} much debate and discussion over the last 25 years. The principle aim of this thesis has been to ascertain the extent of the under and mis-enumeration, and to question whether the census is as poorly enumerated as has been suggested. The {{accuracy of}} the argument that the Victorian Domestic Ideology negatively influenced the recording of women's work is also examined. This has been achieved through the examination of the Census Enumerator's Books in rural, provincial and urban communities, comparing the data contained within these with that held in other primary sources. These include such diverse documents as <b>wage</b> <b>books,</b> workhouse and county asylum admission and discharge registers, newspaper articles, court reports, local histories and contemporary surveys. Geographical coherence has been maintained by focusing on women living in East Anglia and London. Through the careful analysis of the documents available, and the innovative use of varying methodologies, it has been possible to compare and contrast the occupational enumeration of married women living in many different locales and working in diverse occupations across 60 years of history. Through this it has been possible to observe the ways in which the census, far from ignoring the work of married women, mirrors closely the working patterns described in other primary sources and histories. The thesis argues that, whilst it cannot be suggested that all work carried out by women will be found in the census, a far greater percentage is recorded than was previously suggested. Furthermore, the census offers an insight into women's working patterns and experiences, adding to our knowledge of women's work and the ebb and flow of working life.

40|$|Michael Turner, John Beckett, and Bethanie Afton have {{assembled}} a data set {{based on a}} large number of English farm records (in the form of account <b>books,</b> <b>wage</b> labor <b>books,</b> and memoranda books). Some of the fruits of this effort appeared previously in Turner, Beckett, and Afton s Agricultural Rent in England, 1690 1914 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997). This new book employs a subset of 979 of these farm records to cast new light on some important aspects of English farm production in the period 1700 to 1914. In addition to the introduction and conclusion, the book comprises five substantive chapters. Chapter 2 discusses the records as a source; chapter 3 considers some aspects of farming practice (notably cropping patterns and fertilizer use); chapter 4 presents new estimates of wheat yields; chapter 5 presents new estimates of barley and oat yields; and chapter 6 presents new evidence on livestock weights. The most important findings of the book are that the overall growth in wheat, barley, and oat yields was much lower than is commonly thought, and that the main period of yield growth occurred between the 1820 s and 1850 s. The authors argue on this basis that the Agricultural Revolution can be fixed firmly in the period 1800 to 1850. The great strength of the book is that the data on which it is based are almost entirely new. For that reason, it is a very welcome contribution to our stock of knowledge, and both the authors and their funding body (the Leverhulme Foundation) are to be congratulated. ...|$|R
