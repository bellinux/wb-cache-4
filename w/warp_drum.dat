5000|$|It is {{important}} that the chainwheel match the chain size (i.e. the link pitch) closely. Even a small difference in link size or consistency can cause undue wear on the chainwheel and/or cause the chain to jump off the windlass when the winch is operating, particularly during payout, a runaway condition sometimes referred to as [...] "water spouting" [...] should it occur at high speed. Nowadays, especially on large tankers and cruise ships, the windlass may be split into independent port and starboard units. In these cases they are frequently coupled with <b>warping</b> <b>drums</b> (as distinct from warping heads). In some of these the <b>warping</b> <b>drums</b> are of the self tensioning or constant tension type.|$|R

50|$|The {{wheels on}} either a {{vertical}} or horizontal windlass provide for either chain or line to be engaged. The wheel for line is termed a warping head, while the chain handling wheel is variously {{referred to as}} the gypsy (in the UK) or wildcat (in North America). For clarity in communication the generic term chainwheel is often used. On small craft a <b>warping</b> <b>drum</b> is sometimes used to handle both chain & rope, although particular care must be taken with sizing and compatibility of line, chain, and windlass, for this feature to work effectively.|$|R

5000|$|... 20-22 denier-organized silk {{is used in}} warp, while twofold , very lightly twisted 30-32 silk is {{used for}} weft. The warp yarn cost Rs. 1600-1800 per kg whereas weft yarn costs Rs. 1300-1600 per kg. A single sari may weigh from 1.45 kg or more {{depending}} upon {{the weight of the}} silk and zari used. The warp is usually made in the peg or <b>drums</b> <b>warping</b> process and is tied in ball form at the back of loom. It is usually made for 2 pieces of sari and is about 11.5 meters in length. While coloured silk is mostly used in figure work, the solid border have extra weft figuring threads. The weft for borders and body being different, three shuttle weaving is adopted, two for border and one for plain body. The border therefore appears as separately woven and then stitched to the body of the sari. Some times a separate pallu warp is twisted on the body. The end piece has fine silk. Warp threads are only of zari forming a golden ground upon which angular, brightly coloured silk designs are woven in the interlocked weft, producing a tapestry effect.|$|R
