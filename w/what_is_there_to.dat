[...] Asked about the Broadway community, Sondheim replied, [...] "There's none whatsoever. The writers write one show every two or three years. [...] Who congregates at Sardi's? [...] <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> congregate about? [...] Shows just sit in theaters and last." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2007, {{following}} Gervais' {{appearance at}} the memorial concert for the Princess of Wales, The Guardian ran a column by Daily Mirror television critic Jim Shelley entitled [...] "Call Me Crazy... But Has Ricky Gervais Lost It?", where he described Gervais as a [...] "tiresome embarrassment". The following week, The Guardian noted that Gervais had responded with [...] "an exhilaratingly foul-mouthed tirade" [...] on his website, concluding with the sentence [...] "yes I am resting on my fucking laurels you cunt!" [...] In this video, Gervais mocked Jim Shelley typing the words [...] "resting on his laurels" [...] as Gervais jokingly lashed out by stating that he was resting on his laurels {{and that he was}} not going to make another show for television, quipping: [...] "What's the point? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> beat?" ...|$|E

[...] He replied, [...] "My family has been living in the west for generations. I took the imperial edict to build the stupa in Tibet for two years. I saw constant wars there, and wish Your Majesty could pacify there. I come for sentient beings." [...] "What do you practice?" [...] He said, [...] "I take my mind as my teacher and know roughly painting, casting, and carving." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1914, {{after being}} invaded by Imperial Germany, Belgium {{suffered}} a food shortage. The tiny nation, {{at the time}} among the most urbanized countries in Europe, only grew enough food to meet 20-25% of its needs. Nonetheless, the German occupiers <b>were</b> requisitioning <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> help feed their army. The civilian population, {{in addition to the}} demoralizing effect of being conquered in a few days by Germany, faced imminent starvation unless a lot of food were brought in, fast.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{theme is}} {{the search for}} self-identity. Near {{the end of the}} book, Aldrick {{questions}} his identity. He thinks to himself, [...] "What was he Aldrick without the dragon?

[...] Without a history or culture to relate to, Aldrick represents a vast number of people of Trinidad who are at a loss in terms of their identities. He is searching for his roots or some clue that will direct him homeward.|$|R
2500|$|Johannes Bronkhorst renders skandha as [...] "aggregates", {{stating that}} the meaning and {{importance}} of the concept is in explaining the non-self concept in Buddhism.

2500|$|Relatively {{early in}} his career, the {{literary}} scholar [...] observed the specific form of critique within Leitner's verse: [...] "By way of his language, Leitner creates the resistance that reality is {{no longer able to}} offer him." [...] In his review entitled [...] "Love and social critique," [...] has verified that observation while exploring Leitner's collection of poems [...] "Schreite fort, Schritt." [...] Leitner, says Lutz Rathenow in an analysis of the poem Angel in Die Welt, often varies the motif of uncertainty: [...] "Anton G. Leitner goes beyond that: and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> do, when angels no longer know what they are and what their mission is? In this slender poem of no more than 27 words, angels are, above all, exhausted. The author is able to place each word with such ambiguity that the poem raises more questions than answers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then-Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Kauzlarich, Regimental Executive Officer at Forward Operating Base Salerno on Khost, Afghanistan, {{under which}} Tillman was serving {{at the time}} of his death, and who led the second {{investigation}} into Tillman's death, made statements about the Tillman family's search for the truth based on Tillman's atheism. In comments to ESPN, Kauzlarich said: [...] "These people have a hard time letting it go. It may be because of their religious beliefs" [...] and [...] "When you die, I mean, there is supposedly a better life, right? Well, if you are an atheist and you don't believe in anything, if you die, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> go to? Nothing. You are worm dirt. So for their son to die for nothing and now he is no more... I do not know how an atheist thinks, I can only imagine that would be pretty tough." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 58 BC, Publius Clodius Pulcher, the tribune of the plebs, {{introduced}} a law (the Leges Clodiae) threatening exile {{to anyone who}} executed a Roman citizen without a trial. Cicero, having executed members of the Catiline Conspiracy four years previously without formal trial, and having had a public falling out with Clodius, was clearly the intended target of the law. Cicero argued that the senatus consultum ultimum indemnified him from punishment, and he attempted to gain {{the support of the}} senators and consuls, especially of Pompey. When help was not forthcoming, he went into exile. He arrived at Thessalonica, on May23, 58BC. Cicero's exile caused him to fall into depression. He wrote to Atticus: [...] "Your pleas have prevented me from committing suicide. But <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> live for? Don't blame me for complaining. My afflictions surpass any you ever heard of earlier". After the intervention of recently elected tribune Titus Annius Milo, the senate voted in favor of recalling Cicero from exile. Clodius cast the single vote against the decree. Cicero returned to Italy on August5, 57BC, landing at Brundisium. He was greeted by a cheering crowd, and, to his delight, his beloved daughter Tullia.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the agent-based model INFSO-SKIN, which provides ex-ante evaluation of possible funding policies in Horizon 2020 for the European Commission’s DG Information Society and Media (DG INFSO). Informed {{by a large}} dataset recording the details of funded projects, the simulation model is set up to reproduce and assess the funding strategies, the funded organisations and projects, and the resulting network structures of the Commission’s Framework 7 (FP 7) programme. To address the evaluative questions of DG INFSO, this model, extrapolated into the future without any policy changes, is taken as an evidence-based benchmark for further experiments. Against this baseline scenario the following example policy changes <b>are</b> tested: (i) <b>What</b> if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> changes <b>to</b> the thematic scope of the programme? (ii) <b>What</b> if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> changes <b>to</b> the instruments of funding? (iii) <b>What</b> if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> changes <b>to</b> the overall amount of programme funding? (iv) <b>What</b> if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> changes <b>to</b> increase Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) participation? The results of these simulation experiments reveal some likely scenarios as policy options for Horizon 2020. The paper thus demonstrates that realistic modelling with a close data-to-model link can directly provide policy advice...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{the book}} has always been popular and {{considered}} a children's classic by many literary critics, a number of prominent individuals have spoken unfavorably of the novel over the years. Children's novelist and literary historian John Rowe Townsend has described the book as [...] "fantasy of an almost literally nauseating kind" [...] and accused it of [...] "astonishing insensitivity" [...] regarding the original portrayal of the Oompa-Loompas as black pygmies, although Dahl did revise this in later editions. Another novelist, Eleanor Cameron, compared the book to the sweets that form its subject matter, commenting that it is [...] "delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare."Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (together with Charlotte's Web [...] ) is probably the book most read aloud by those teachers who have no idea, apparently, what other books they might read to the children. Charlie, again along with Charlotte's Web, is always {{at the top of}} the best sellers among children's books, put there by fond aunts and grandmothers and parents buying it as the perfect gift, knowing no better. And I do think this a most curious coupling: on the one hand, one of the most tasteless books ever written for children; and on the other, one of the best. We are reminded of Ford Madox Ford's observation that only two classes of books are universal in their appeal: the very best and the very worst. [...] is like candy (the chief excitement and lure of Charlie) in that it is delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare. I think it will be admitted of the average TV show that goes on from week to week that there is no time, either from the point of view of production or the time allowed for showing, to work deeply at meaning or characterisation. All interest depends upon the constant, unremitting excitement of the turns of plot. And if character or likelihood of action – that is, inevitability – must be wrenched to fit the necessities of plot, there is no time to be concerned about this either by the director or by the audience. Nor will the tuned-in, turned-on, keyed-up television watcher give the superficial quality of the show so much as a second thought. He has been temporarily amused; <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> complain about? And like all those nursing at the electronic bosom in McLuhan's global village (as he likes to call it), so everybody in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory is enclosed in its intoxicating confines forever: all the workers, including the little Oompa-Loompas brought over from Africa and, by the end of the book, Charlie and his entire family.}} ...|$|E

5000|$|According to him, {{lacrosse}} {{was where}} he learned to protect himself from hard checks: [...] "In those days you could be hit from behind in lacrosse, as well as cross-checked, {{so you had to}} learn how to roll body checks for self-protection." [...] Gretzky adroitly applied this technique as a professional player, avoiding checks with such skill that a rumour circulated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an unwritten rule not to hit him. Defensemen found Gretzky a most elusive target. Fellow Hockey Hall of Famer Denis Potvin compared attempting to hit Gretzky to [...] "wrapping your arms around fog. You saw him but when you reached out to grab him your hands felt nothing, maybe just a chill." [...] The 205-pound (93 kg) Potvin, a three-time winner of the Norris Trophy for best defenceman, added that part of the problem in hitting Gretzky hard was that he was [...] "a tough guy <b>to</b> dislike... <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> hate about Gretzky?
