40|$|Activated carbons (ACs) were {{prepared}} from biomass of Borneo island (wood charcoal, peat, and coconut husk) {{by using an}} electricity-free furnace, of which the energy source was exclusively wood charcoal. This furnace was comprised of two parts, an inner vessel equipped with water inlet for steam activation and an outer shell as a heating part for the inner vessel. The inside temperature of the inner vessel was able to reach over 1000 ℃. Peat and wood charcoal were converted to AC by carbonization followed by steam activation, and the specific BET surface areas of resultant ACs were 889 m 2 /g and 749 m 2 /g, respectively. A mobile <b>apparatus</b> for <b>water</b> <b>purification</b> was newly designed and fabricated with the resultant AC, together with a white quartz sand, which is called keranggas in Kalimantan. The COD_[OH] of both polluted creek water by the University of Palangka Raya and Kahayan River water were remarkably decreased by the purification with the designed apparatus from 20. 0 mgO/L to 0. 93 mgO/L, and 18. 2 mgO/L to 0. 74 mgO/L, respectively. Thus, the newly designed furnace and <b>purification</b> <b>apparatus</b> were shown to be highly effective tools to produce a promising agent for <b>water</b> <b>purification</b> and to produce clarified water without use of electricity, respectively...|$|R

40|$|AbstractConsidering the {{environmental}} protection requirements for retaining wall and slope protection in Civil engineering and construction of water conservancy, {{a new type of}} retaining wall materials and structures with functions of slop reinforcement, slope greening and <b>water</b> <b>purification</b> was studied. In this paper, it designed a kind of Eco-concrete retaining wall's block which has functions of slope vegetation planting and <b>water</b> <b>purification,</b> and studied functions of <b>water</b> <b>purification</b> of this kind of Eco-concrete retaining wall's block through the <b>water</b> quality <b>purification</b> experiment. It shows that, the maximal disposable removal rates of CoDcr, TN and TP are respectively 87 %, 70 % and 90 %, which means that functions of <b>water</b> <b>purification</b> of this kind of Eco-concrete retaining wall's block are very good...|$|R
