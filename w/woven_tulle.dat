I {{was inspired}} by the array of colors and immediately thought of the CWU Pride Week and the beautiful colors seen during the weekâ€™s events. Process: Once I found the fabric and knew what to create, I thought of a student who had presented a project on drag in a class and knew immediately he would be my model and muse for the design. Focusing on the scale and proportion of the garment in relation to the body was essential for a successful final product. Scale is the relationship of sizes {{to each other and to}} the whole regardless of shapes, whereas proportion is the comparative relationship of not only sizes but also distances, amounts and parts. The array of colors used in the garment are very busy, therefore a simple design was used to balance the color intensity. Techniques: This garment was created with the draping method. The garment was draped, trued and transferred to a paper pattern. Three samples were made and several changes were made. Working with the thin fabric and all the panels posed a new challenge to assure that they were all even and balanced.
