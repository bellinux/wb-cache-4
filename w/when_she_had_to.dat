Additionally, she added that would often practise drawing {{in the middle of}} the classes which gave her doubts <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> erase them. She drew her first manga at twenty-one. In 1998, Hoshino moved to Tokyo. She dreamed of bringing her mother to the city and was able to in 2006.

Ultimately, she decided to become a manga author despite her fears of the difficulty it takes.|$|E

Inspired by a picture of a Rio de Janeiro fashion model in an issue of Women's Wear Daily, they had local fashion designer Lapin create a string bikini for the event. Models recruited by talent agent Peter Dasigner presented it by removing fur coats by Alberto Lemon on stage. The presentation was covered by local television stations and the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper, and was sent out via the wire news services of the Associated Press and United Press International.|$|E

However, Stroud interpreted Simone's sudden disappearance, {{and the fact that}} she had left behind her wedding ring, as an indication of a desire for a divorce. As her manager, Stroud was in charge of Simone's income.|$|E
500|$|His {{interest}} in psychology began when his sister Eunice committed suicide, {{because of the}} issue of depression. [...] He received a letter from Eunice's husband in August 1829, which told of her death. [...] Todd had thought he had cured her, multiple times, but she still had episodes, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> attend to a large farm in empty Vermont alone, she was pushed over the edge. This began his theory that mental retardation (insanity at the time) was a disease and had a cause and possibly a cure. This began his revolutionary treatments, and what made the government give so much money for the mental hospital to be built.|$|E

500|$|Gaven {{resided in}} Los Angeles from 1991 to 1993, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> move to New York City {{to act in}} The Who's Tommy. However, her stay in the city was short because of the {{allergic}} reaction and she moved back to Los Angeles. While performing in musicals, Gaven had to be protective of her vocal cords and this affected her personal life. She told Miller in 1997 that [...] "you {{have to give up}} so much of your life", and gave the example that when [...] "somebody coughs behind me [...] I immediately say to my husband, 'We may have to move.'" [...] She also had to avoid shouting. Gaven is currently married to Seth Gaven who owns AV Squad, a film marketing company.|$|E
500|$|Most of the Weeping Angels are not statue props {{but young}} women wearing masks, costumes, and paint that took {{two to three}} hours to apply. Director Adam Smith called them [...] "an {{absolute}} nightmare to film with" [...] because {{it took a long time}} for them to get ready and they had to stand still for long periods of time. In the climactic scene Gillan had to walk with her eyes closed, which she said was difficult and challenging as the ground was uneven and muddy. She stated that [...] "it was the most scary thing" [...] <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> trip over a step and fall, even though she was aware of the crash mat. As she was not able to express herself through her eyes, Gillan had to make herself more animated to convey emotion. The scene in which the Doctor, Amy and River are horizontal in mid-air when the gravity field fails on the Byzantium was achieved by using wires and powerful wind machines. The blue in Amy's bedroom was an idea of Adam Smith to show that it was inspired by the TARDIS from Amy's encounter with the Doctor when she was young.|$|E
500|$|While {{looking for}} comics {{from which to}} {{practice}} reading English, she came across Arcade, an [...] magazine from San Francisco co-published by New Yorker Art Spiegelman. [...] Avant-garde filmmaker friend Ken Jacobs introduced Mouly and Spiegelman, when Spiegelman was visiting, {{but they did not}} immediately develop a mutual interest. [...] Spiegelman moved permanently back to New York later in the year. Occasionally the two ran across each other. [...] After reading Spiegelman's 1973 strip [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet", about his mother's suicide, Mouly felt the urge to contact him. [...] An eight-hour phone call led to a deepening of their relationship. [...] Spiegelman followed her to France <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> return to fulfill obligations in her architecture course. [...] After returning to the United States, when Mouly ran into visa problems in 1977, the couple solved them by getting married—first at City Hall, and then again after Mouly converted to Judaism to please Spiegelman's father. [...] Beginning in 1978 Mouly and Spiegelman made yearly trips to Europe to explore the comics scene, and brought back European comics to show to their circle of friends.|$|E

50|$|The only {{difference}} to Simran after her marriage is her suitable {{appearance in the}} role of a headmistress. She is strict towards her students <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be and lenient whenever that is the need of the hour. Simran is portrayed as an ideal headmistress. Though she comes only in a few scenes, her presence is felt throughout the film. This is a victory for director Rajagopal.|$|R
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought the [...] "premise {{was a little}} thinly {{stretched}} over the hour" [...] and believed {{it would have been}} overshadowed by stronger episodes in season one, but was glad to have another hour of Fringe regardless. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall disliked that the network failed to issue a [...] "disclaimer" [...] about the episode's production date, stating [...] "...maybe the producers assume that all their audiences are brand new to the franchise. Or perhaps, unhappily, it is a sign that Fox has given up on this show, and no longer cares whether its lingering audience is confused." [...] She concluded, [...] "As a standalone episode, this one was of middling interest, and I can see why Fox would have dropped it from the Season One lineup. Fans looking eagerly for more 'mythology' episodes, where the links between the Fringe team, Massive Dynamics, Nina Sharpe, William Bell and, for all I know, the Illuminati are explored, may be disappointed." [...] Jane Boursaw of AOL TV was also critical of Fox for giving no warning about the episode and thought it should actually have been titled 'Walter vs. The Priest.'" [...] She continued, [...] "The whole episode was an interesting intersect between science and faith, not to mention the whole 'being possessed by a dead person because your brain waves crossed during life and death' thing. You can tell it was vintage Fringe -- if indeed it was -- because the storylines are more complex than that these days, what with the alternate universe and Leonard Nimoy and all." [...] Various critics noted guest actress Alice Kremelberg's performance, particularly <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give the impression she was possessed by a male ghost; most reviews were negative, though Boursaw praised it, giving Kremelberg [...] "high fives".|$|E

[...] A few days afterwards warships from JW 55B were involved in the Battle of the North Cape.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{conflict}} {{with one of the}} theater's directors, who was said to have been less than careful about his hygiene, the director questioned Henriette about her bills regarding such things and she replied: [...] "It is easy to say, Mr Count, for someone with no idea how much it costs to keep oneself clean and fresh!" [...] She also writes that when she complained about men and boys trying {{to take a look at}} her <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> change during performances, this director chased them all away, but guarded her from them by observing her himself—though, she adds, he was really quite harmless. She remained neutral during the great theater strikes of 1827 and 1834.|$|E
