40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. Swirl stabilized burners are widely used in industrial combustion processes due to their benefits in terms of wider flame stability limits, improved mixing and high turbulence level [1]. However, swirl flows are prone to hydrodynamic instabilities at critical operating conditions, {{which can lead to}} local velocity and pressure oscillations. These oscillations can modulate the heat release, giving rise to a space-temporal coupling between heat release and pressure, (Rayleigh criterion), leading therefore to thermo-acoustic oscillation. Industrial experience has shown that swirl stabilized <b>wood</b> powder <b>burners</b> can sometimes cause pressure fluctuations that result in high amplitude structural vibrations in the boiler and increased emissions. The qualitative experiments with a 150 kW <b>wood</b> powder <b>burner</b> that was perturbed with a loudspeaker in the secondary air register showed that a strong effect on the flame characteristic occurred when the perturbation frequency was about 17 Hz. Flame visualisations indicated that one or more processing vortices were present during stable combustion and that these vortices became unstable when the excitation frequency and amplitude had a critical value. ej 201...|$|R

The process of constructing their own paintbrush is exciting, and students learn to hollow the endpoint, insert the special hairs from deer or moose pelts and create patterns, symbols or marks by using <b>wood</b> <b>burners</b> and torching the handle. When the brushes are complete and the hair tips are set, we prepare the studio for the meditation.

40|$|There {{is always}} some risk of {{incident}} {{associated with the}} combustion of solid fuels in automatically stoked boilers or stoves. These incidents are of essentially three types: smoke from the burner back into the boiler room (or {{back into the living}} room from pellet stoves), gas explosions in the combustion chamber and back burning in the stoker. There can be a number of reasons for these problems, and in many cases such incidents have not been investigated. The Swedish Building Regulations stipulate that firing equipment shall have adequate safety against fire. They also recommend that stokers/burners should have at least two independent safety systems against back burning. The objective of this project has been to analyse such incidents and to test safety systems for pellet and <b>wood</b> chip <b>burners,</b> in order better to understand how they work. It has also included evaluation of the“fireguard” water sprinkler system. The results from the tests with pellet burners showed that the burners that were tested provided relatively good protection against back burning. However, it was found that it was very important how and where the systems (temperature limiter, water sprinkler etc.) were fitted on the burners in order to ensure correct and effective operation of the safety system. One of the key question was also where to position electronic equipment on the burners in order to ensure that it is not exposed to temperatures higher than those for which it is designed. Over the years, there have been major problems with back burning in older designs of <b>wood</b> chip <b>burners</b> using old technology. The chip burner used in this project was of modern type. The test with simulated back burning showed that the water sprinkler stopped the fire. However, for greater safety the water sprinklers should have included two separate water container. The test with the pellets stove showed that the temperature sensor was of crucial importance for safety against back burning in the stove. Back burn occurred in one of the tests, but only after all the stove’s safety systems had been rendered inoperable. The “Fireguard” water sprinkler system performed well in our tests. However, the position of the temperature sensors, and the integrity of their thermal contact, was of crucial importance for how quickly the sprinklers responded. Another water sprinkler (Syr) showed itself to be very slow to respond when its sensor were in poor thermal contact with the surface of the fuel feed chute. Experience from the tests in this project has shown that it is relatively difficult to simulate back burning in boilers and pellet stoves, despite setting up very favourable conditions for such back burning. Although modern burners and pellet stoves are equipped with all the safety systems that can be expected, several incidents still happen every year. This means that continued analysis of incidents and development of safety systems is essential. The results from this project will be included when SP’s P-marking rules for pellet burners, pellet stoves and chip <b>wood</b> <b>burners</b> are next reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|Thatch {{is not as}} {{flammable}} as {{many people}} believe. It burns slowly, [...] "like a closed book," [...] thatchers say. The vast majority of fires {{are linked to the}} use of <b>wood</b> <b>burners</b> and faulty chimneys with degraded or poorly inserted or maintained flues. Sparks from paper or burned rubbish can ignite dry thatch on the surface around a chimney. Fires can also begin when sparks or flames work their way through a degraded chimney and ignite the surrounding semi-charred thatch. This can be avoided by ensuring that the chimney is in good condition, which may involve stripping thatch immediately surrounding the chimney to the full depth of the stack. This can easily be done without stripping thatch over the entire roof. Insurance premiums on thatched houses are higher than average {{in part because of the}} perception that thatched roofs are a fire hazard, but also because a thatch fire can cause extensive smoke damage and a thatched roof is more expensive to replace than a standard tiled or slate roof. Workmen should never use open flame near thatch, and nothing should be burnt that could fly up the chimney and ignite the surface of the thatch. Spark arrestors usually cause more harm than good, as they are easily blocked and reduce air flow. All thatched roofs should have smoke detectors in the roof space. Spray-on fire retardant or pressure impregnated fire retardants can reduce the spread of flame and radiated heat output.|$|R

This includes pellets for <b>wood</b> <b>burners</b> as well as low moisture content chips for medium sized commercial boilers.

The harnessing of bioenergy from these sources produces residue in the form of ash. As the demand for bioenergy production increases, ash and residue volumes will increase. Major concerns arising from the management of this byproduct include: storage availability, usage, product disposal and the implications of the presence of unburned carbon. This research studies various ash types, identifying specific fractions of technological, environmental and economic viability. Fractions of energy importance, inorganic distribution and catalytic properties of specific ash types are investigated. Ash from three systems were investigated, an industrial boiler, a fixed bed updraft gasifier and a <b>wood</b> pellet <b>burner.</b> Analyses of the boiler ash included particle fractionation, proximate and ultimate analysis, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and bulk density. Samples were separated into various fractions based on particle sizes. The fixed carbon in the as-received boiler ash samples was 30 and 50 % and the higher heating value (HHV) ranged from 5 - 25 MJ/kg of the different fractions. 68 % or more of the energy could be recovered in fractions ≥ 425 μm. High carbon ash was successfully gasified in a fluidized bed reactor at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The pH of the as received samples for the gasifier, boiler and pellet burner were 10. 36, 12. 49 and 13. 46, respectively. Ni with a concentration of 229 mg/kg in the pellet burner ash, exceeded the maximum limit for soil amendments (in British Columbia, Canada) within the particle size fraction ≥ 850 μm but < 2000.
