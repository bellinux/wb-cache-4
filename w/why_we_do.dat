The production and songwriting began with producer Brian Higgins meeting {{each member of the}} group individually, and discussing their life since the release of Chemistry (2005). Higgins took inspiration from these discussions in his songwriting, with bandmate Nicola Roberts explaining that [...] "it's important he's up to date with where we are. Our songs have to reflect us so that's <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] was then written by Girls Aloud with production team Xenomania. Roberts, Cheryl Cole, Sarah Harding and Kimberley Walsh recorded vocals for the song in London, England, while Nadine Coyle recorded her vocals in Los Angeles, California. In July 2007, Girls Aloud {{announced that they}} would release [...] "Sexy! No No No...", as the first single from Tangled Up, in September 2007. The radio premiere of the song was scheduled for the morning of 20 July 2007 on BBC Radio 1, however, it leaked in full online earlier the same day at 02:21 GMT. [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] was released for digital download on 31 August 2007, while it was also made available on two different CD single formats on 3 September 2007. The first disc included a live version of [...] "Something Kinda Ooooh" [...] (2006), recorded at the Bournemouth International Centre. The second CD format featured Tony Lamezma's [...] "Yes Yes Yes" [...] Mix of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] and also a new track as a b-side, entitled [...] "Dog Without a Bone". The b-side was originally written in 2006 in an attempt {{to come up with a}} lead single for the group's first compilation album, , however, [...] "Something Kinda Ooooh" [...] was released instead. [...] "Dog Without a Bone" [...] was Popjustice's song of the day on 20 August 2007.|$|E

[...] In a 2002 speech, DeLay promised to [...] "use every tool at my disposal to ensure that the Republican Conference, and the House of Representatives, continues to preserve and strengthen America's alliance with the State of Israel." ...|$|E

40|$|Two years ago, {{after much}} debate and {{discussion}}, {{the board of}} the Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) decided to combine our annual meeting with {{the annual meeting of the}} American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP). There has been ongoing discussion as to whether this was the best course of action.

2500|$|Greene's area of {{research}} is string theory, a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. [...] String theory attempts to explain the different particle species of the standard model of particle physics as different aspects of a single type of one-dimensional, vibrating string. One peculiarity of string theory is that it postulates the existence of extra dimensions of space: [...] {{instead of the usual}} four dimensions, there must be ten spatial dimensions and one dimension of time to allow for a consistently defined string theory. The theory has several explanations to offer for <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not perceive these extra dimensions, one being that they are [...] "curled up" [...] (compactified, to use the technical term) and are hence too small to be readily noticeable.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{after he}} became {{president}} critics complained that attitudes of and actions by Brotherhood leaders concerning non-Muslims changed. In late April 2013 a fatwa issued {{by a member of}} the MB general guide's office -- 'Abd Al-Rahman Al-Barr (who is often referred to as the movement's mufti) -- forbade Muslims from greeting Christians on their Easter holiday, explaining that Easter and resurrection were contrary to the Muslim faith. [...] "Jesus did not die and was not crucified, but rather Allah gave him protection from the Jews and raised [...] up to Him... which is <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not greet anyone for something we strongly believe is wrong. ..." [...] The Israeli-affiliated media-watchdog group Memri quoted Coptic and opposition leaders attacking the fatwa and noting that in the past MB leaders and even Al-Barr himself had not only allowed but practiced the greeting of Christians on Easter. Columnist A'la Al-'Aribi in the daily Al-Wafd attacked the fatwa as [...] "politics disguised as shari'a..." [...] Al-Barr's previous [...] "view reflected the position of the MB at that time – but now that circumstances have changed , he has changed his position..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, {{the group}} {{announced}} that they would release a new studio album in November of that year. Initial ideas started in March of that year where each member met with British producer Brian Higgins, {{who had worked with}} them together on their previous records. Each singer visited Higgins at his home in England and discussed their experiences and life endeavours after the release of the third Girls Aloud studio album Chemistry (2005); to his advantage, he decided to take inspiration from those discussions and work further on the new record, along with his production team Xenomania. Member Nicola Roberts reaffirmed that it was important for Higgins to be [...] "up to date with where [...] at," [...] and further commented, [...] "Our songs have to reflect us so that's <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Moreover, when asked in an interview with Fascination Records about what fans and critics could expect from the album, member Cheryl said they were heading for a [...] "more mature direction." [...] She also believed that the ideal focus for the record was not to sing [...] "about things that we would have when we were 16. Now we're singing about things that you talk about in your early 20s." ...|$|E

As {{a matter of fact}} it isn't their affair. And as a natural consequence, they don't do so well, and they don't get on--and so the world doesn't pay them. They don't catch on to discursive interests, you see, because they are more serious, they are concentrated on the central reality of life, and a little impatient of its--its outer aspects. At least that, I think, is what makes a clever woman's independent career so much more difficult than a clever man's." ...|$|E
