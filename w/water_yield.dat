25|$|Based on {{the river}} basin water data {{available}} from the year 1934 to 1971 (44 years back data), the tribunal estimated the average <b>water</b> <b>yield</b> in the total river basin as 767 TMC which corresponds to 47% dependability. The live storage capacity available in the river basin is nearly 310 TMC which is 40.5% of the average yield. The water used in the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry is nearly 280 TMC which is the tail end water use in the river basin and its regenerated water either goes to sea or outside the Cauvery basin. The total dissolved salt load generated in the basin is nearly 3.5 million metric tons per year. The estimated salinity or total dissolved salts (TDS) for the water available in Cauvery delta is 441 ppm which {{is close to the}} safe maximum permissible 500 ppm. There is no limit imposed by the tribunal for the ground water use in the river basin. The tribunal has also permitted the basin states to use all the excess water available in above normal water years. Moreover, the river basin population has reached 40 million in the year 2015 and the increasing per capita inorganic salts used/consumed in industrial, agriculture and residential sectors are enhancing the salt export requirements. When adequate salt export from the river basin is not taking place to the sea by forcing Cauvery delta to face water shortage, the water quality (salinity, pH, alkalinity, sodicity, etc.) available for Cauvery delta would deteriorate beyond the permissible limits impeding its sustainable productivity and its aquatic ecosystem conservation. Ultimately salt export criteria is the limitation for the water resources development in a river basin.|$|E
500|$|New Melones Dam has a {{very large}} storage {{capacity}} relative to the watershed that feeds it, as compared to other major reservoirs in California. The potential <b>water</b> <b>yield,</b> and thus the supply contracts, of the Melones Project were calculated based on stream flow data between 1922 and 1978; however, this period may have been somewhat wetter than the long-term average. The Bureau of Reclamation estimated the additional <b>water</b> <b>yield</b> per year as [...] but the actual yield has been closer to [...] As a result, the reservoir is often at a low water level because in most years demand is greater than supply. In the 38 years between 1978 and 2016, New Melones has only reached capacity five times, and only once (in 1983) has it reached {{the level of the}} spillway. Between 1987 and 1992 Reclamation was forced to purchase water from other agencies to fulfill New Melones' water obligations. Even so, the reservoir fell to a record low level of , 3.5% of capacity, on October 1, 1992. Conversely, the great storage capacity also means that New Melones can capture more flood runoff while other major California reservoirs must release it to maintain flood control space.|$|E

500|$|Water {{diverted}} at O'Shaughnessy Dam feeds {{into the}} Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, which provides 85 {{percent of the}} municipal water for 2.4 {{million people in the}} San Francisco Bay Area. The firm <b>water</b> <b>yield</b> is [...] per year, or 237 million gallons (895,000 m3) per day. Because of the unique geology of the Hetch Hetchy watershed, which consists of shallow soils underlain by solid granite bedrock, water that flows into the reservoir is exceptionally clear and of very high quality. This quality is further maintained by stringent protection of the watershed; boating and swimming are prohibited at Hetch Hetchy Reservoir (although fishing is permitted at the reservoir and in the rivers which feed it). As a result, San Francisco tap water is some of the cleanest in the United States, without even the need for filtration, and is said to be of better quality than most bottled water.|$|E

The Forest Service provides access to and recreation opportunities at the seven reservoirs it borders, although it does not own or manage them.

The largest, Warm Lake, is 26 miles (42km) east of Cascade in Valley County; many of the smaller lakes are in the Trinity and West mountains. Annual <b>water</b> <b>yield</b> on the forest is estimated at 4.1 million acre-feet (5.1 Ã— 109 m3). The southern portion of the forest is drained by the Boise River, the central and western portions by the Payette River, northeastern portion by the Salmon River, and far western portions of the Emmett Ranger District by the Weiser River.

500|$|In recent decades, California {{has been}} struck {{with a series}} of severe droughts.

One, the Peripheral Canal, would facilitate water flow from the water-rich north to the dry south, but has never been built due to environmental concerns. The raising of Shasta Dam on the Sacramento or New Melones Dam on the Stanislaus, or the building of Sites Reservoir, has also been proposed.

500|$|New Melones Dam {{has come}} under even greater {{controversy}} than Shasta Dam, {{mainly because of the}} project's conflicts with federal and state limits {{and its impact on the}} watershed of the Stanislaus River. The original Melones Dam, submerged underneath New Melones Lake (hence the name New Melones Dam) is the source of one of these problems. The disused Melones Dam blocks cold water at the bottom of the lake from reaching the river, especially in dry years when the surface of the lake is closer to the crest of the old dam. This results in the river below the dam attaining a much higher temperature than usual, hurting native fish and wildlife. To solve this problem, Reclamation shuts off operations of the dam's hydroelectric power plant when water levels are drastically low, but this results in power shortages. Originally, after the dam was constructed, the State of California put filling the reservoir on hold because of enormous public opposition to what was being inundated: the limestone canyon behind the dam, the deepest of its kind in the United States, contained hundreds of archaeological and historic sites and one of California's best and most popular whitewater rafting runs. Thus the reservoir extended only to Parrot's Ferry Bridge, [...] below its maximum upriver limit, until the El NiÃ±o event of 1982-1983, which filled it to capacity within weeks and even forced Reclamation to open the emergency spillways, prompting the state and federal governments to repeal the limits they had imposed on the reservoir. Furthermore, the project allows a far smaller sustainable <b>water</b> <b>yield</b> than originally expected, and Reclamation calls the dam [...] "a case study of all that can go wrong with a project".|$|E

The goal of this review {{is to provide a}} balanced and impartial assessment of the impacts of forest restoration and forest cover expansion on <b>water</b> <b>yields</b> as informed by the scientific literature. Potential sources of bias on the results of papers published are also examined. English, Spanish and Portuguese peer-review articles in Agricola, CAB Abstracts, ISI Web of Science, JSTOR, Google Scholar, and SciELO. Databases were searched through 2015. Intervention terms included forest restoration, regeneration/regrowth, forest second-growth, forestation/afforestation, and forestry. Target terms included water yield/quantity, streamflow, discharge, channel runoff, and annual flow. Articles were pre-selected based on key words in the title, abstract or text. Eligible articles addressed relevant interventions and targets and included quantitative information. Most studies reported decreases in <b>water</b> <b>yields</b> following the intervention, while other hydrological benefits have been observed.
