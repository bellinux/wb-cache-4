25|$|Many women's clubs {{believed}} that compulsory education {{for young people}} would help solve many child labor issues. In Chicago, the Woman's City Club worked with other clubs {{in order to help}} students stay in school past age 14.

25|$|Meanwhile, Match Game {{kept its}} high {{standing}} in the ratings despite a short-lived move ahead one half-hour from August to December 1975. In November 1977, however, CBS made a fatal mistake regarding the show's time slot. Noting a ratings boon resulted when The Price Is Right and Match Game were paired in afternoons, a major hole in the schedule had developed in the morning slot that The Price Is Right had left behind. In an attempt to resolve the crisis, CBS moved Match Game to 11:00 a.m., immediately following The Price Is Right at 10:00 a.m. However, because much of Match Games audience was composed of students who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>school</b> {{at that time of}} day, ratings began to sag and eventually free fall; many of these students did not return. As a result, Family Feud quickly supplanted Match Game as television's highest-rated game show.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} few decades the general trend of {{pursuing}} a university degree has prompted the founding of new universities {{to meet the needs of}} Thai students. Bangkok became not only a place where immigrants and provincial Thais go for job opportunities, but also for a chance to receive a university degree. Ramkhamhaeng University emerged in 1971 as Thailand's first open university; it now has the highest enrolment in the country. The demand for higher education has led to the founding of many other universities and colleges, both public and private. While many universities have been established in major provinces, the Greater Bangkok region remains home to the greater majority of institutions, and the city's tertiary education scene remains over-populated with non-Bangkokians. The situation is not limited to higher education, either. In the 1960s, 60 to 70 percent of 10- to 19-year-olds who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>school</b> had migrated to Bangkok for secondary education. This was due to both a lack of secondary schools in the provinces and perceived higher standards of education in the capital. Although this discrepancy has since largely abated, tens of thousands of students still compete for places in Bangkok's leading schools. Education has long been a prime factor in the centralization of Bangkok and will play a vital role in the government's efforts to decentralize the country.|$|E

2500|$|Today, {{second round}} {{characters}} are officially regarded as incorrect. However, some have survived in informal contexts; {{this is because}} some people who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>school</b> between 1977 and 1986 received their education in second-round characters. For example, eggs at markets are often advertised as [...] "鸡旦" [...] rather than [...] "鸡蛋," [...] parking venues may be marked [...] "仃车" [...] rather than [...] "停车," [...] and street side restaurants as [...] "歺厅" [...] rather than [...] "餐厅." [...] Another example is handwritten license plates from Hebei and Henan provinces, which often use 丠 and 予 as opposed to 冀 and 豫 to represent those provinces.|$|E

2500|$|Israel enacted an Equal Rights for People with Disabilities Law in 1998. [...] Nevertheless, the US Department of State {{report on}} Israel stated that [...] "de facto {{discrimination}} against persons with disabilities" [...] exists in Israel. In 2014, there were approximately 1.6 million {{people with disabilities}} residing in Israel. Approximately 878,000 were {{between the ages of}} 20 to 64 and 488,000 were over the age of 64. A survey by the Dialog Institute showed that {{a significant portion of the}} Israeli population has difficulty accepting people with disabilities as neighbors, co-workers or classmates. 40% of those surveyed said they would [...] "be bothered" [...] if their children <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>school</b> with a disabled child, and almost a third of respondents said they would [...] "be bothered" [...] living in the same neighborhood as disabled people.|$|E
2500|$|Snape is {{generally}} depicted as being cold, calculating, precise, sarcastic, and bitter. He strongly dislikes Harry and often insults him by insulting his father James. As the series progresses, it is revealed that {{his treatment of}} Harry stems from Snape's bitter rivalry with James when they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>school</b> together. In particular, James and Sirius bullied Snape, which according to Alan Rickman caused the already lonely boy to further [...] "shut himself in". Rowling further described the young Snape as insecure and vulnerable: [...] "Given his time over again [...] would not have become a Death Eater, but like many insecure, vulnerable people he craved membership of something big and powerful, something impressive. [...] was so blinded by his attraction {{to the dark side}} he thought [...] would find him impressive if he became a real Death Eater." ...|$|E
2500|$|Polish {{immigrants}} took low-paying jobs at {{blast furnaces}} in high numbers. As in many jobs Poles took in America, the demand fluctuated, hours were long, and {{the supply of}} expendable labor was high. Industrialist Amasa Stone actively sought out Polish immigrants to work in his steel mill in Ohio, and personally traveled to Poland in the 1870s to advertise laborer opportunities. He advertised jobs in Gdansk, promising jobs for laborers at a salary of $7.25 a week (the average wage at his mill was $11.75 for Americans), and a free ship ride to the United States. Hundreds of Poles took those jobs and the Polish population of Cleveland grew from 2,848 to 8,592 between 1880 and 1890 {{as a result of}} his recruiting. In 1910, 88% of workers labored for an 84-hour weekly shift (7 days, 12 hours per day). Day and night shifts rotated every two weeks, requiring men to perform 18- or 24-hour straight shifts. Movements to end the 7 day week were pushed by management, but many workers did not oppose the practice and saw it as a necessary evil. The United States Steel Corporation slowly eliminated its 7-day work weeks, down from 30% in 1910 to 15% in 1912. Polish American families grew up fatherless in Chicago, and the long hours spent at the blast furnaces only averaged 17.16 cents per hour (...) , below the poverty limit at the time in Chicago. Workers at the blast furnaces had little time for self-improvement, leisure, or many social activities. When the 7-day week was done away with, some workers saw it as a waste of time because their children <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>school</b> and their friends were at work, so they spent time at saloons and drank. Many plants found that a large number of workers quit their jobs when Sunday was taken off their schedules, citing the day off as a reason.|$|E

6000|$|Sleep {{would not}} come. It {{was not because}} I was proud of my travels and excited about having been around the big world to China, and feeling contemptuous of Bartel Sperling, [...] "the traveler," [...] as he called himself, and looked down upon us others {{because he had been}} to Vienna once and was the only Eseldorf boy who had made such a journey and seen the world's wonders. At another time that would have kept me awake, but it did not affect me now. No, my mind was filled with Nikolaus, my {{thoughts}} ran upon him only, and the good days we had seen together at romps and frolics in the woods and the fields and the river in the long summer days, and skating and sliding in the winter when our parents thought we <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>school.</b> And now he was going out of this young life, and the summers and winters would come and go, and we others would rove and play as before, but his place would be vacant; we should see him no more. To-morrow he would not suspect, but would be as he had always been, and it would shock me to hear him laugh, and see him do lightsome and frivolous things, for to me he would be a corpse, with waxen hands and dull eyes, and I should see the shroud around his face; and next day he would not suspect, nor the next, and all the time his handful of days would be wasting swiftly away and that awful thing coming nearer and nearer, his fate closing steadily around him and no one knowing it but Seppi and me. Twelve days--only twelve days. It was awful to think of. I noticed that in my thoughts I was not calling him by his familiar names, Nick and Nicky, but was speaking of him by his full name, and reverently, as one speaks of the dead. Also, as incident after incident of our comradeship came thronging into my mind out of the past, I noticed that they were mainly cases where I had wronged him or hurt him, and they rebuked me and reproached me, and my heart was wrung with remorse, just as it is when we remember our unkindnesses to friends who have passed beyond the veil, and we wish we could have them back again, if only for a moment, so that we could go on our knees to them and say, [...] "Have pity, and forgive." ...|$|E
