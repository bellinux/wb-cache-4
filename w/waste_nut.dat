The specific surface area of the AC and functionalized-AC was obtained by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and found to be 367. 303 and 308. 032 m 2 /g, respectively. Batch experiments showed that higher pH favoured the removal of Hg(II), whereas the phenol removal was slightly affected by the changes in the solution pH. The kinetic data followed pseudo-first order kinetic model, and intra-particle diffusion {{played a significant role in}} the removal of both pollutants. The maximum sorption capacity of Hg(II) and phenol were evaluated using Langmuir adsorption isotherms, and found to be 11. 23 and 5. 37 mg/g, respectively. The removal of Hg(II) was significantly suppressed in the presence of chloride ions due to the formation of a HgCl 2 species. The phenol was specifically adsorbed, forming the donor–acceptor complexes or π–π electron interactions at the surface of the solid. Further, a fixed-bed column study was conducted for both Hg(II) and phenol.

Phenol Formaldehyde (PF) resins are made from Benzene a petroleum product. Petrochemical supplies are finite and the economics of their use by enhancing and extending their use is of considerable interest from both an economic and resource basis. PF resins {{are among the most}} widely used thermosets because of their economics on a cost-per-volume basis. Environmental and cost concerns have lead to the search for alternative chemicals obtained from renewable raw materials to complement and/or replace PF resins. The natural substitute for PF resins used in this study is Cardanol, a natural Phenolic resin distilled from cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL). CNSL itself is derived from <b>waste</b> cashew <b>nut</b> shell. Cardanol can be blended with PF resins to make Cardanol Phenolic Formaldehyde (CPF) resins, extending and complementing the PF resins.

CNS are produced in the cashew nut processing process as waste, but they contain cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) up to about 30 – 35 wt. % of the nut shell weight depending on the method of extraction. CNSL is a mixture of anacardic acid, cardanol, cardol, and methyl cardol, and the structures of these phenols offer opportunities for the development of diverse products. For anacardic acid, the combination of phenolic, carboxylic, and a 15 -carbon alkyl side chain functional group makes it attractive in biological applications or as a synthon for the synthesis of a multitude of bioactive compounds. Anacardic acid, which is about 65 % of a CNSL mixture, can be extracted from the agro waste.

The Syngas produced from the crude glycerol co-gasification can be further employed to generate electricity or to produce chemicals or biofuels (Skoulou and Zabaniotou 2013). On the other hand, microwave plasma gasification is a technology that utilizes plasma flames produced by external electrical sources to gasify substrates. Crude glycerol microwave plasma gasification demonstrated an increment in gasification efficiency and Syngas heating value (Yoon et al. 2013). Another type of gasification is supercritical water gasification. This technology utilizes supercritical water to improve the gasification efficiency. Supercritical water {{has the ability to}} act as an acid/base catalyst, dissolve non-polar organic compounds, and react with other compounds (Tapah et al. 2014). The application of supercritical water gasification in crude glycerol has been evaluated in the presence of KOH and Fe 2 O 3 –Cr 2 O 3 as catalysts (Yang et al. 2013; Tapah et al. 2014). Catalytic supercritical water gasification improved the Syngas quality by reducing biochar impurities and increasing the amount of combustible gases, especially H 2.

Studied parameters were reaction temperature, ratio of each wastes, air factor and residence time. Mixed wastes were first pelletized to cylindrical shape of 2 mm diameter and 3 mm height before feeding into the reaction vessel at the feeding rate of 5 g/min. Air and nitrogen were used as reacting and carrier gases, respectively. Product gases contained mainly of CO, CO 2, H 2, CH 4 were continuously measured by dedicated online TCD/NDIR analyzer. Results indicated that as reaction temperature increased, CO 2 decreased while yields of CO, CH 4 and H 2 increased. Greater conversion to CO 2, CO, H 2 occurred with air factor increased from 0. 0 to 0. 3. Further increase in air factor resulted in lesser CO and H 2 from greater competing combustion reactions.
