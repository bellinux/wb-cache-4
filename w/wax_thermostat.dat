5000|$|Many TMVs use a <b>wax</b> <b>thermostat</b> for regulation. They also {{shut off}} {{rapidly in the}} event of a hot or cold supply failure to prevent {{scalding}} or thermal shock.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{model of}} a {{thermostat}} used in thermostatic mixing valves (TMVs) has been developed. The model contains realistic boundary conditions and material properties including the latent heat corresponding to a mixture of <b>waxes</b> inside the <b>thermostat.</b> The temperature-time characteristics show a relatively slow heating of the thermo-stat regardless of the flow rate. This implies an improvement potential for the thermostat and thus the entire valve...|$|R
50|$|Paraffin wax is an {{excellent}} material for storing heat, with a specific heat capacity of 2.14-2.9 J g−1 K−1 (joules per gram kelvin) and a heat of fusion of 200-220 J g−1. This property is exploited in modified drywall for home building material: {{a certain type of}} wax (with the right melting point) is infused in the drywall during manufacture so that it melts during the day, absorbing heat, and solidifies again at night, releasing the heat. Paraffin wax phase-change cooling coupled with retractable radiators was used to cool the electronics of the Lunar Rover. Wax expands considerably when it melts and this allows its use in <b>wax</b> element <b>thermostats</b> for industrial, domestic and, particularly, automobile purposes.|$|R
50|$|This {{most common}} modern form of {{thermostat}} now uses a wax pellet inside a sealed chamber. Rather than a liquid-vapour transition, these use a solid-liquid transition, which for waxes {{is accompanied by}} a large increase in volume. The wax is solid at low temperatures, and as the engine heats up, the wax melts and expands. The sealed chamber operates a rod which opens a valve when the operating temperature is exceeded. The operating temperature is fixed, but is determined by the specific composition of the <b>wax,</b> so <b>thermostats</b> of this type are available to maintain different temperatures, typically in the range of 70 to 90°C (160 to 200°F). Modern engines run hot, that is, over 80 °C (180 °F), in order to run more efficiently and to reduce the emission of pollutants.|$|R
50|$|Work on cooling {{high-performance}} {{aircraft engines}} in the 1930s {{led to the}} adoption of pressurised cooling systems, which became common on cars post-war. As the boiling point of water increases with increasing pressure, these pressurised systems could run at a higher temperature without boiling. This increased both the working temperature of the engine, thus its efficiency, and also the heat capacity of the coolant by volume, allowing smaller cooling systems that required less pump power. A drawback to the bellows thermostat was that it was also sensitive to pressure changes, thus could sometimes be forced shut again by pressure, leading to overheating. The later wax pellet type has a negligible change in its external volume, thus is insensitive to pressure changes. It is otherwise identical in operation to the earlier type. Many cars of the 1950s, or earlier, that were originally built with bellows thermostats were later serviced with replacement <b>wax</b> capsule <b>thermostats,</b> without requiring any change or adaption.|$|R
40|$|Engine cooling {{and thermal}} {{management}} system is very essential in an automotive industry. It has been existed for decades but only recently been explored for revolution. This study explores current conventional engine cooling, specifically detailing out specifications for <b>wax</b> type conventional <b>thermostat</b> and engine driven water pump. In conventional cooling study, improvement {{has been made}} on thermostat opening temperature. Actual experimental set up has been installed and result recorded. Impact on this change has been studied in term of engine coolant inlet and outlet temperature, radiator, bypass flow rate and also Euro 3 emission compliance. This study also highlights the limitation of current conventional engine cooling and thermal management system, thus requiring revolution to the system. Advanced engine cooling and thermal management system is then explored as a revolution of engine cooling and thermal management system. This further brings us to study on electrification of engine cooling components mainly on electric control valve and electric water pump. The control system is also improved through integration between engine input/output and cooling input /output for optimum combination. 2 case studies have been reviewed which are Chevrolet Tahoe, 5. 77 litre (Chalgren Jr, 2004) and Ford Excursion 6. 0 liter diesel (Chalgren and Allen, 2005). In these two studies, electric water pump, electric valve, dual variable speed fan and also restrictor at bypass to boost heater core coolant flow have been fully examined and effect on engine cooling and thermal management system is observed. A lot of improvement seen from this revolution namely improvement in fuel consumption, reduced warm up time, better emission control, better cabin temperature during cold start, better coolant temperature fluctuation and also reduction in parasitic loss. ...|$|R
