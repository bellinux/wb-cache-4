40|$|Utilization of a {{transparent}} insulation material (TIM) in a solar <b>collector</b> <b>wall</b> {{has been proven}} {{to have a significant}} potential to reduce heating load in passive solar buildings. Transparent insulation transmits a high proportion of incident solar radiation onto a layer of thermal mass which subsequently slowly releases heat, thus reduces the requirement for heating throughout the day.

This thesis presents a numerical simulation model for a building with one transparently insulated wall. The explicit finite difference method is employed to study the thermal performance of an outdoor test room as a function of energy consumption and thermal comfort.

40|$|Plasma-wall {{interactions}} play {{an important}} role in plasma physics. In many theoretical studies an infinite unbounded system is assumed. However in reality, it is often the case that we need to include the physics of the plasma -wall interaction in order to be able to realistically model a plasma system. Such studies are quite complicated due to the non-linear nature of the associated physics. One such example is the source-collector sheath system which describes the plasma between an infinite wall and a Maxwellian source. Such a system comprises of two distinct areas; the first is an electron rich region near the Maxwellian source, the source sheath, and the other is an ion rich area near the <b>wall,</b> the <b>collector</b> sheath. In the first part of this work, we model this system theoretically using truncated Maxwellian distributions for both electrons and ions to describe the collisionless, ionization-free plasma, and we also include flows. Furthermore, we study the problem using simulation results from our Vlasov kinetic code Yggdrasil using a perfectly absorbing wall as a boundary. In the second part of this work, we study the effect of an electron emitting surface in the source-collector sheath system, without plasma flows. Electron emission plays a crucial role for many plasma applications, for example in fusion devices it is an important part of the physics of the interaction of the plasma with the walls of the reactor. A theoretical model is constructed for a range of ion and electron temperatures and for a variety of electron emission characteristics. Furthermore, we use our kinetic code Yggdrasil with an electron emitting boundary to simulate the phenomenon.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology employed in this research is on-site observations of Turkish solar houses built with respect to the details of their application, and depiction of heat gains provided with applied solar measures, and to compare them with an ideal gauge to determine the deficiencies involved in applications. Findings: The investigations discovered that various buildings under consideration share several errors. In order of importance, these items are: faulty applications, erroneous choice of methods and lack of precautions in the summer. Practical implications: The practical implications of the study are that measures must be taken to prevent heat loss during winter nights; outer walls with a resistance to heat transmission of u= 1 W/m 2 K would have been preferred rather than ordinary old-fashioned Trombe walls; in order to prevent overheating the surfaces of the sunspaces, Trombe <b>walls</b> and air <b>collectors</b> contacting the outer environment need to be made movable or pliable to avoid sinking of heated air into the sunspace. Social implications: The social implication of the study is that only continued exploration into solar energy use via exemplary practice may encourage adoption of these systems by society itself.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. In this paper, a numerical study is carried out to characterize the transient local heat transfer coefficient at the fluid-solid wall interface of a solar collector. For that purpose, the considered <b>collector</b> <b>wall</b> geometry is a flat plate with nonnegligible thickness which is subjected to a variable solar heat flux. The transient conjugated conduction-convection heat transfer has been taken into account. The heat transfer coefficient is calculated {{as a function of}} the plate thickness as well as the position along the plate. A good agreement has been found between the calculated temperatures and other experimental results. The heat transfer coefficient evolutions, as a function of time, have been obtained for various positions along the plate. The results showed that at first, high values of the heat coefficient are reached, and then it decreases and tends to constant values. It has been also noticed that at a fixed value of time, the heat transfer decreases when the position is increased from the beginning of the plate towards its end. The parametric study allowed obtaining a correlation of the transient convective heat transfer coefficient {{as a function of the}} steady state coefficient (which depends on the flow velocity and the coordinate of the considered point on the plate), multiplied by a function of time and the plate properties. The results have been used to optimize the heat transfer coefficient measurement technique using the pulse method. The pulse method consists in imposing a heat flux on a wall, and then to calculate, by an inverse method, the heat transfer coefficient from the time evolution of surface temperature (thermo-gram). Measurement of the heat transfer coefficient is based on the introduction into the inverse model of a function that represents the theoretical evolution of this coefficient due to the energy excitation. This function is deduced from the numerical study conducted in this work. dc 201...|$|R
40|$|The flows {{induced by}} natural {{convection}} appear in many engineering problems. Configurations formed by heated plates where these processes occur, were {{the topic of}} intense study in past years. However, new systems with a different constructive disposition and applications in several fields (bioclimatic architecture, electronic cooling, nuclear energy cooling systems) are {{at the moment of}} great interest. Since typical applications of buoyancy-driven airflows in smooth vertical channels are usually in small-scale devices (i. e. in electronic cooling equipment), most investigations were carried out for laminar flows. As a consequence of the great scale of certain passive ventilation systems, as solar chimneys, Trombe <b>walls,</b> or roof <b>collectors,</b> the flow established becomes transitional or even fully turbulent. The regarded geometries frequently involve structures based on converging and sloped channels formed by heated plates, where buoyancy-driven flows take place. Therefore, the study of problems such as the transition to turbulent regime or flows with walled-channel geometries including sloped and converging walls are key to assertively find out the real heating transmission existing in these new systems in a more realistic manner. Nowadays, the need to achieve human comfort by passive heating and ventilation techniques is greater as is the requirement for energy saving. Passive solar systems are the basic elements of bioclimatic design and they do not involve the use of mechanical or electrical devices. The Trombe Wall is the primary example of the technique called indirect gain, whose typical configuration is usually formed by a thick, darkened, masonry wall and a glazed wall. In ventilation applications, other passive systems, called thermosyphons, heat syphons or solar chimneys, can yield natural motions of air due to the induced temperature differences by solar heating. Although several reported works provided useful results for the analysis and design of passive solar devices in buildings, these works cannot determine the necessary details of convection for numerical simulations. Furthermore, as an important lack of design correlations is detected, it is necessary to carry out a systematic study that supplied the heat transfer coefficient and the mass-flow rate as a function of relevant parameters, for several configurations...|$|R
40|$|Generation of a DC {{electron}} beam {{in the future}} Fermilab electron cooler [1] employs an electrostatic acceleration and a beam energy recovery, so that electrons are decelerated from the nominal energy of 4. 3 MeV {{they have in the}} cooling section to few keV in the collector. Stable performance of this scheme requires a current loss {delta}I below 10 {micro}A at the beam current up to the nominal value of I = 0. 5 A. One of sources of the loss is a back flow of secondary electrons from the beam collector. The paper discusses principles and performance of a collector with the low current loss. Electric and magnetic fields in the collectors used in existing electron coolers are axially symmetrical. For practically interesting parameters, such collectors can not provide {delta}I/I< 10 {sup - 4 } because of the reversibility of trajectories in the collectors: a secondary electron with the kinetic energy equal to the energy of the primary one can come out of the collector following the trajectory of the ''parent'' electron. The back flow can be dramatically decreased if the reversibility is broken by a transverse magnetic field in the collector cavity. In our case, the field was formed by a system of permanent magnets. Several versions of the system were tested at a low-energy test bench. The first of them is optimized for operation without a longitudinal magnetic field. The transverse field is formed by two groups of 6 Nd-Fe-B square permanent magnets, mounted {{on both sides of the}} collector and magnetized along the X-axis. Because the directions of magnetization in groups are opposite, the magnetic field in the vicinity of the Z-axis has a quadrupole configuration with the gradient of 10 - 15 G/cm. The field focuses electrons in X direction and defocuses in Y, so that the beam is absorbed on <b>collector</b> <b>walls</b> mainly along a narrow band near the plane X= 0. The transverse field in this region, with the magnitude of 50 - 70 G, effectively confines secondary electrons. The only exception is electrons entering the collector with small Y offsets, which fly through the collector and hit its bottom. Because the transverse field strength near the bottom is low, the produced secondary electrons have a high probability of escaping from the collector. Measurements of the collector efficiency at various beam positions at the collector entrance, made with a low-current, small size beam, show a narrow band of the beam positions with high relative current losses (up to 1 {center_dot} 10 {sup - 3 }) near Y axis. At higher currents, when the beam size is comparable with the entrance opening, the beam cannot be shifted from the high-loss region, and the total efficiency is determined by the beam part overlapped with the band. The best relative current loss in the symmetric configuration is 1. 5 {center_dot} 10 {sup - 5 } at the beam current up to 0. 5 A. To eliminate the effect, the magnets on one side of the collector were shifted along Z with respect to the second group. Arising asymmetry of the magnetic field results in a displacement of the high-loss band from the center and in decreasing of the relative losses down to {delta}I/I= 3 {center_dot} 10 {sup - 6 } at the beam current of up to I= 0. 6 A [2]. When the collector was used in a 1. 2 MeV beam recirculation experiment at the collector voltage of U{sub c}= 4 kV, the maximum beam current of 0. 9 A and {delta}I/I= (5 - 20) {center_dot} 10 {sup - 6 } were demonstrated [3]...|$|R
