5|$|In April 2015, {{the federal}} Ministry of Defence {{launched}} its new Guulwade Plan (Victory Plan), <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> roadmap for long-term {{development of the}} military. It was formulated with technical support from UNSOM. The framework stipulates that international partners are slated to provide capacity-building as well as assistance for joint operations to 10,900 Somali national army troops, with these units drawn from various regions in the country.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{associated with}} the Churches of Christ embrace the methods of modern Biblical criticism but not the associated anti-supernaturalistic views. More generally, the classical grammatico-historical method is prevalent, <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> basis for some openness to alternative approaches to understanding the scriptures.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{electromagnetism}} are most visibly {{employed in the}} electric motor, <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph.|$|E
5|$|The geology of the moor and {{prolonged}} peat extraction {{has provided a}} unique environment <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> habitat {{for a range of}} flora and fauna. Much of the nature reserve managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust is based around abandoned peatworkings which have now become flooded. It is particularly noted for the millions of starlings which congregate at the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{student council}} {{is a group}} of {{students}} <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> liaison between the teachers and students. Meanwhile, the Disciplinary Committee consists of students who are essentially rule enforcers.

5|$|Although {{white dwarf}} {{material}} is initially plasma—a fluid composed of nuclei and electrons—it was theoretically predicted in the 1960s {{that at a}} late stage of cooling, it should crystallize, starting at its center. The crystal structure {{is thought to be}} a body-centered cubic lattice. In 1995 it was suggested that asteroseismological observations of pulsating white dwarfs yielded a potential test of the crystallization theory, and in 2004, observations were made that suggested approximately 90% of the mass of BPM 37093 had crystallized. Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction of between 32% and 82%. As a white dwarf core undergoes crystallization into a solid phase, latent heat is released <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> source of thermal energy that delays its cooling.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the {{telescope}} surface was becoming badly corroded. In 2001–2003, {{the telescope}} was resurfaced, increasing its sensitivity at 5GHz {{by a factor}} of five. A holographic profiling technique was used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.|$|E
5|$|CR106 {{proceeds}} {{east from}} here providing a border between Harriman State Park (to the west) and Bear Mountain State Park (to the east). It then intersects Lake Welch Parkway, a seasonal road <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> route to Lake Welch Beach {{on the northern}} side of the lake. Then, CR106 splits Lake Welch in two different locations on the southern side of the lake. CR106 then begins its trek out of Harriman State Park and into the town of Stony Point.|$|E

5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E
5|$|In rural eastern McLeod County, MN7 jogs to {{the north}} around Silver Lake {{in the city of}} the same name. Northeast of Lester Prairie, the highway crosses into Carver County. This area is also rural farm country as the roadway {{bypasses}} New Germany and Mayer {{to the north}}. Near the latter community, MN7 intersects MN25 <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> connection to both Mayer and the city of Watertown. North of Waconia, the roadway begins to meander southeasterly through an area dotted with several lakes and crosses into {{the western edge of the}} Twin Cities metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} of Batesian-Wallacian mimicry, {{the model is}} a sexually {{receptive}} female, <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> strong attractive effect on males. Some spiders use chemical rather than visual means to ensnare prey. Female bolas spiders of the genus Mastophora lure male moth-flies (Diptera, true flies, but resembling moths) by producing analogues of the moth species' sex pheromones. Each species of spider appears to specialize in a particular species of prey in the family Psychodidae. Juveniles use their front pair of legs to capture prey, such as flies. Older spiders use a different strategy however, swinging a sticky ball known as a bolas suspended by a silk thread at moths. But both old and juvenile are able to lure prey via this olfactory signal; even young spiderlings {{have been shown to}} attract prey species.|$|E

5|$|New {{terrain is}} {{available}} in the game: Wasteland, which impedes the movement of ground vehicles; Ruins, which provide a minor defense bonus for ground units and hiding places in Fog of War; Fire, which is impassable and illuminates the surrounding area during Fog of War; Rough Sea, which impedes the movement of naval units; Mist, <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> defense bonus and hiding places for naval units; and Meteors and Plasma. Plasma forms an impassable wall that no unit can cross, and is generated by Meteors. Once a Meteor is destroyed, any Plasma in contact with it disappears, allowing units to pass. Plasma that is not in contact with a meteor cannot be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{completion}} in 1968, the Oroville Dam has allocated {{the flow of}} the Feather River from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta into the State Water Project's California Aqueduct, <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> major supply of water for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley as well as municipal and industrial water supplies to coastal Southern California, and has prevented large amounts of flood damage to the area — more than $1.3 billion between the years of 1987 and 1999. The dam has confined fish migration up the Feather River and the controlled flow of the river {{as a result of the}} Oroville Dam has affected riparian habitat. Multiple attempts at trying to counter the dam's impacts on fish migration have included the construction of a salmon/steelhead fish incubator on the river, which began shortly after the dam was completed.|$|E
5|$|The First European Conference on Sustainable Cities and Towns {{took place}} in Aalborg in 1994. It adopted the Aalborg Charter, <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> {{framework}} for the delivery of local sustainable development and calls on local authorities to engage in Local Agenda 21 processes. The Fourth European Sustainable Cities and Towns Conference, held in Aalborg in 2004, adopted the more binding Aalborg Commitments on local sustainable development. The commitments have now been signed by 650 local authorities while over 2,500 have signed the earlier Aalborg Charter.|$|E

5|$|The Nord Stage is multitimbral – {{each of the}} Piano, Organ, and Synth {{sections}} {{can sound}} independently. There are two Panels – A and B – each of <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> separate configuration of the three sections within a single Program. Panels can be played independently, {{with one of the}} panels being controlled via an external MIDI keyboard controller, or they can be layered together, allowing for a maximum of 6 part multitimbral. Most of the buttons and knobs on the Stage, such as volume, instrument selection, drawbar levels (for organ) or filter controls (for synthesizer) can also be adjusted by the external keyboard.|$|E
5|$|The drama program {{stresses}} {{technique and}} performance; students must perform in public {{at least twice}} a year. There are three major dramatic productions each season, and high school students are required to compete in the English Speaking Union Shakespeare Contest. Advanced students audition for the Acting Ensemble Company, <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> full season of performances in venues outside the school. The creative writing program focuses on writing as an art in journalism, script writing, poetry, and creative non-fiction. Students participate in writing competitions, internships, and develop portfolios to showcase their work.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth-generation}} iPad (marketed as iPad with Retina display, colloquially {{referred to}} as the iPad 4) is a tablet computer produced and marketed by Apple Inc. Compared to its predecessor, the third-generation iPad, the fourth-generation iPad maintained the Retina Display but featured new and upgraded components such as the Apple A6X chip and the Lightning connector, which was introduced on September 12, 2012. It shipped with iOS 6.0, <b>which</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> platform for audio-visual media, including electronic books, periodicals, films, music, computer games, presentations and web content. Like the iPad 2 and the third-generation iPad, it has been supported by five major iOS releases, in this case iOS 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. iOS 11, which was released on 19 September 2017, does not have support for the fourth-generation iPad because of hardware limitations.|$|E
