5|$|The casing {{was tested}} in a wind tunnel, and {{retained}} after it {{was found to be}} as good as other forms of streamlining. After introduction it was subsequently found that its aerodynamic form failed to disturb the air sufficiently to lift the exhaust from the chimney, thus obstructing the driver's vision <b>with</b> <b>smoke.</b>|$|E
5|$|A-10s were {{initially}} an unwelcome addition {{to many in}} the Air Force. Most pilots switching to the A-10 {{did not want to}} because fighter pilots traditionally favored speed and appearance. In 1987, many A-10s were shifted to the forward air control (FAC) role and redesignated OA-10. In the FAC role, the OA-10 is typically equipped with up to six pods of 2.75inch (70mm) Hydra rockets, usually <b>with</b> <b>smoke</b> or white phosphorus warheads used for target marking. OA-10s are physically unchanged and remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a report}} by George Ivatt in 1945, smoke {{deflectors}} were introduced due to drifting smoke obscuring the crew's forward vision. The first locomotive to be fitted <b>with</b> <b>smoke</b> deflectors from the outset was No. 6253 City of St. Albans in September 1946. All the following four locomotives included this feature. The first unstreamlined locomotive to be retrofitted was No. 6232 Duchess of Montrose in February 1945.|$|E

5|$|From 1996 to 2006, Nissin Foods {{operated}} a Cup Noodles billboard <b>with</b> <b>smoke</b> effects (an effect that {{had also been}} famously used by other Times Square billboards, such as the Camel Cigarettes sign). The Cup Noodles billboard was replaced in 2006 by a General Motors billboard featuring a Chevrolet branded clock; however, {{as a part of}} cutbacks resulting from GM's bankruptcy and re-organization, the Chevrolet Clock was removed in 2009 and eventually replaced by the current Dunkin' Donuts display.|$|E
5|$|Schiavo {{describes}} how the FAA uses a formula ascribing specific monetary value to human lives, and how the agency allows numbers {{to decide whether the}} cost of extra safety is worth the additional expense. For example, if equipping an airline fleet <b>with</b> <b>smoke</b> detectors would cost $100 million, but would only save 10 lives each worth $1 million, then the expense is ruled out. Schiavo is similarly critical of the internal FAA politics and the FAA's administrators.|$|E
5|$|Since the Middle Ages, most {{dwellings}} were log {{houses with}} notched corners, carefully crafted to ensure {{protection against the}} elements. Centrally placed open-hearth fires <b>with</b> <b>smoke</b> vents in the roofs gave way to stone stoves and chimneys in early modern times. Specialized buildings became commonplace, organized around farmyards or gårdstun. The introduction of exterior boarding (weatherboarding) in the 18th century improved housing standards considerably and gave rise to larger houses.|$|E

5|$|The Patrouille Suisse flight {{demonstration}} {{team were}} prominent fliers of the Hawker Hunter for several decades. Squadron aircraft were fitted <b>with</b> <b>smoke</b> generators {{on the engine}} exhausts and, later on, were painted in a distinctive red-and-white livery. The group officially formed on 22 August 1964, and used the Hunter as its display aircraft until it was withdrawn from use in 1994, the team continued to perform flight display using newer aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The game engine—proprietary IW engine 2.0—is a {{modified}} version of id Tech 3, which was used in the first Call of Duty game. With the new game engine, Infinity Ward expanded the scope of combat to deliver a realistic battlefield experience and improved the visuals. The developers were able to cloud visibility <b>with</b> <b>smoke</b> from smoke grenades and create weather effects like dusty sandstorms and whiteout blizzard.|$|E
5|$|The tests {{revealed}} {{a number of}} problems in that the thick wing inherited from the Yak-3 limited the top speed of the aircraft, the engine exhaust damaged the surface of the airfield, the cockpit often filled <b>with</b> <b>smoke</b> from kerosene and oil that had dripped onto the engine, and the aircraft was very short-ranged. Despite these problems, the Yak-15 proved to be very easy to fly, even for pilots accustomed to piston-engined fighters, and caused the VVS to accept the fighter as a conversion trainer.|$|E

5|$|In 1941, Laurana {{was fitted}} <b>with</b> <b>smoke</b> {{apparatus}} {{to assist in}} the defence of Venice. Following the Italian Armistice in early September 1943, Albona and Rovigno were captured by the Germans at the island of Syros in the Aegean Sea on 10 September. They were renamed Netztender 57 and Netztender 56 respectively, and their armament was improved. Laurana was captured at Venice on 11 September, and was commissioned by the Germans under her Italian name on 30 September, after which she served as a minelayer in the Adriatic. She retained her Italian armament. Netztender 57 and Netztender 56 were scuttled by the Germans at Salonika on 31 October 1944, and Laurana was sunk at Trieste by aircraft bombs on 20 February 1945.|$|E
5|$|It was Hamilton's {{teammate}} {{and defending}} race winner Rosberg who topped the time sheets {{at the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting a 1:12.385 lap time. He led Hamilton by almost half a second, with the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen about a second adrift. Slight rain saw most drivers head out early, but the conditions never became wet enough to require intermediate tyres. After starting on the medium compound tyres, many drivers switched to the softer compound for race simulations, only for the session to be red flagged shortly after when Fernando Alonso spun at turn four, only to pull over {{at the side of}} the road <b>with</b> <b>smoke</b> coming from his car some corners later. Valtteri Bottas was sixth fastest, behind Daniel Ricciardo, suffering a spin at turn nine.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefits}} {{gained by}} Maunsell's modifications {{showed in the}} improved performance of the first batch of Maunsell S15s over their Urie-built predecessors. A third batch was ordered in 1931, coinciding with a downturn in the volume of freight due to the economic depression. This meant that {{the last of the}} S15 class was not completed until 1936, although weight-saving modifications were undertaken to this batch. A final modification was also applied to the class at this time, when all locomotives were equipped <b>with</b> <b>smoke</b> deflectors to improve visibility from the footplate when travelling at speed. This modification was a feature that became common to most Maunsell-influenced designs.|$|E

5|$|The group {{discovered}} U-853 bottomed in , {{and dropped}} depth charges and hedgehogs during a 16-hour attack. At first the U-boat attempted to flee, {{and then tried}} to hide by lying still. Both times it was found by sonar. The morning of 6 May 1945 two K-Class blimps from Lakehurst, New Jersey, K-16 and K-58, joined the attack, locating oil slicks and marking suspected locations <b>with</b> <b>smoke</b> and dye markers. K-16 also attacked with 7.2-inch rocket bombs. Numerous depth charge and hedgehog attacks from Atherton and Moberly resulted in planking, life rafts, a chart tabletop, clothing, and an officer's cap floating to the surface. With the loss of all 55 officers and men, U-853 {{was one of the last}} U-boats sunk during World War II. and, with , the last to be sunk in US waters. Atherton and Moberly received credit for the kill.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{breaking}} into and exploring the communist tunnels began on 9 January, {{with the objective}} now switching to the location, clearance and destruction of the tunnel complexes. Whereas standard US Army practice was to seal, blow up or otherwise attempt to render tunnel systems unusable <b>with</b> <b>smoke,</b> tear gas and explosives before quickly moving on, the Australians spent {{the next few days}} laboriously searching and mapping the complexes they found using military engineers. Led by MacGregor, the Australian sappers from 3 Field Troop systematically tackled the tunnels, using telephone line and compasses to plot the subterranean passages. Small-scale contacts between the communists and the Australians continued and MacGregor was later awarded the Military Cross for his leadership.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Mercedes conducted race simulations {{to see how the}} cars would behave with a heavy fuel load. Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session with a lap time of one minute and 35.461 seconds, ahead of teammate Hamilton in second. Alonso was third-fastest, ahead of Bottas and Kimi Räikkönen. Magnussen, Ricciardo, Button and Daniil Kvyat rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Verstappen's run ended early when he pulled {{over to the side of}} the track at the S curves <b>with</b> <b>smoke</b> billowing from his engine because of a broken exhaust valve, and Merhi spun at turn 13 (causing Bottas to swerve to avoid him).|$|E
