5|$|As Romulus was {{an alleged}} usurper, Julius Nepos claimed to hold legally {{the title of}} the emperor when Odoacer took power. However, few of Nepos' contemporaries <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to support his cause after he ran away to Dalmatia.

5|$|The casting {{approach}} for Carnivàle was {{to cast the}} best available actors and to show the characters' realness as opposed to depending on freak illusions too much.

Stephen III also dispatched his envoys to Frederick, who decided not to intervene, but ordered his vassalsthe King of Bohemia, the Duke of Austria, and the Margrave of Styriato {{keep an eye on the}} political situation in Hungary.

5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} their most urgent needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915.

5|$|All {{publications}} and media {{were subjected to}} censorship. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing intellectuals who <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to cooperate.

These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which {{saw to it that}} these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E

The Houston Rockets had looked into relocation to Anaheim the previous season, with Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now Honda Center) as the home venue. However, the NHL team then known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had an agreement that any other tenant at the Pond should share revenues with their then-owner, The Walt Disney Company, although Disney stated they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to negotiate the terms. There are also two existing clubs in Los Angeles, the Lakers and the Clippers, which would make the media market small and limit revenue.|$|E
5|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} on key issues like salary cap and BRI splits.

The players, on the other hand, <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to make concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke off, and the CBA expired at midnight.|$|E
5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to risk battle initially.
