5|$|Landis {{was born}} in Millville, Ohio, in 1866. His name was a {{spelling}} variation on the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in the American Civil War, where his father was wounded in 1864. Landis {{spent much of his}} youth in Indiana; he left school at fifteen and worked in a series of positions in that state. His involvement in politics led to a civil service job. At age 21, Landis applied to become a lawyer—there were then no educational or examination requirements for the Indiana bar. Following a year of unprofitable practice, he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> school. After his graduation, he opened an office in Chicago, but left it when Walter Q. Gresham, the new United States Secretary of State, named him his personal secretary in 1893. After Gresham's death in 1895, Landis refused an offer of an ambassadorship, and returned to Chicago to practice law and marry.|$|E
25|$|Corro {{was born}} between 1786 and 1800 (sources vary considerably). Little {{is known of}} his early or {{personal}} life. He <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> school in Guadalajara before moving to Mexico City and {{made a name for}} himself in the capital as a lawyer. He was extremely religious, politically conservative, and a dedicated follower of Antonio López de Santa Anna.|$|E
25|$|To please his parents, he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> {{school at}} the Free University of Brussels (now divided into the Université Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel) when he was 18 years old. During this period, he {{developed}} a passion for literature, discovering the works of Baudelaire, Flaubert, Leconte de Lisle and other mostly French authors. With his younger brother Georges Khnopff – also a passionate amateur of contemporary music and poetry – he started to frequent Jeune Belgique ("Young Belgium"), {{a group of young}} writers including Max Waller, Georges Rodenbach, Iwan Gilkin and Emile Verhaeren.|$|E

25|$|When Kastner was 22, {{his father}} died reading the Torah in the synagogue on the seventh day of Passover. He had to put off any ideas about emigrating, because his mother now needed him at home. He <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> school, as she wished, then worked {{full-time}} for Új Kelet after graduating, at first working as a sports reporter, though he continued to write about politics. He also became an assistant to Dr. József Fischer, a lawyer, member of Parliament, president of the Jewish Community of Kolozsvár, and leading member of the National Jewish Party. Fischer admired Kastner's writing, and encouraged him to continue working for Új Kelet too.|$|E
25|$|Boxer {{worked as}} a {{stockbroker}} {{for the next three}} years, while her husband <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> school. Later, the couple moved to Greenbrae, Marin County, California, and had two children, Doug and Nicole. She first ran for political office in 1972, when she challenged incumbent Peter Arrigoni, a member of the Marin County Board of Supervisors, but lost a close election. Later during the 1970s, Boxer {{worked as a}} journalist for the Pacific Sun and as an aide to John Burton, then a member of Congress. In 1976, Boxer was elected to the Marin County Board of Supervisors, serving for six years. She was the Board's first woman president.|$|E
500|$|Murray's {{trial on}} charges {{stemming}} from the bus incident and her experience with the Waller case inspired a career in civil rights law. In 1941, she began attending Howard University law school. Murray {{was the only woman}} in her law school class, and she became aware of sexism at the school, which she labeled [...] "Jane Crow"—alluding to Jim Crow, the system of racial discriminatory state laws oppressing African Americans. On Murray's first day of class, one professor, William Robert Ming, remarked {{that he did not know}} why women <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> school. She was infuriated.|$|E

2500|$|Blagojevich {{graduated}} from Chicago's Foreman High School after transferring from Lane Technical High School. He played basketball {{in high school}} and participated in two fights after training as a Golden Gloves boxer. After graduation, he enrolled at the University of Tampa. After two years, he transferred to Northwestern University in suburban Evanston, where he graduated in 1979 with a B.A. in history. He earned his J.D. from the Pepperdine University School of Law in 1983. He later said of the experience: [...] "I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> school at a place called Pepperdine in Malibu, California, overlooking the Pacific Ocean — a lot of surfing and movie stars and all the rest. I barely knew where that law library was." [...] Blagojevich is married to Patricia Mell, the daughter of former Chicago alderman Richard Mell.|$|E
2500|$|Rapping {{attended}} Allderdice High School in Squirrel Hill, {{and graduated}} in 1984. After high school, Rapping attended the University of Chicago where {{he earned a}} Bachelor of Arts degree in economics cum laude. People close to Rapping convinced {{him that he would}} incur tremendous debt if he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> school, so he worked as a research assistant with the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. for two years, {{following in the footsteps of}} his father, Leonard Rapping, a well-known economist. [...] Rapping earned a scholarship to attend the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University where he earned a Master of Public Administration in 1992. [...] Rapping's sister, Alison Rapping has spent her career in the non-profit sector, and is widely considered a leader in that realm. [...] Both siblings attribute their commitment to social justice to the influence of their parents.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Lewis {{was born}} in Ottawa, Ontario, on November 11, 1937, to Sophie Lewis (née Carson) and David Lewis. His parents gave him the Hebrew name [...] "Sholem", a Yiddish {{derivation}} of the Hebrew word shalom, which means peace, because he was born on Armistice Day. From {{the time he was}} born, and through his early childhood, his father was the National Secretary of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), the predecessor party to the NDP. When his family moved to Toronto in 1950, he attended [...] secondary school first at Toronto's Oakwood Collegiate, and then his final three years of high school at Harbord Collegiate Institute. [...] In 1956, he entered the University of Toronto (UofT) where he {{became a member of the}} Hart House debating committee, and on 14 November 1957, debated the senator and future American president, John F. Kennedy, on the question, [...] "Has the United States failed in its responsibilities as a world leader?" [...] The Senator narrowly beat the Hart House team 204-194. Lewis's performance was considered the highlight of the event, while Kennedy's was flat according to many members in the audience like John Brewin. He spent his third year of university at the University of British Columbia (UBC) before spending his final undergraduate year back at UofT where he failed to write his final examinations. [...] He <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> school twice in the early 1960s, dropping out of both UofT and UBC's programs.|$|E

60|$|The {{judge and}} the widow <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> {{to get the}} court to take me {{away from him and}} let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that had just come, and he didn't know the old man; so he said courts mustn't {{interfere}} and separate families if they could help it; said he'd druther not take a child away from its father. So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business.|$|E
6000|$|Now Miss Port {{began to}} be seriously concerned. What {{in the world could}} these women want? They were very much in earnest; that was certain. Could it be {{possible}} that she had said more than she intended to Captain Asher, and that she had given him to understand that she would use any of these women as witnesses if she <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law?</b> However, whatever they meant, she intended to sit them out. So she told her maid to make her some tea and to bring it up with some bread and butter and preserves, and a light. She also ordered her to be careful that the people in the parlor should see her as she went up-stairs. [...] "I guess they'll know I'm in earnest when they see the tea," [...] she said.

But I did do one thing. In the dead of night I went to Ericson's house. I had the same revolver I've got now, and I made him stay in bed while I overhauled things. Nineteen hundred and odd francs was what I carried away with me. He never complained to the police, and he never came back on board. As {{for the rest of the}} gang, they laughed and snapped their fingers at me. There were two Americans in the place, and they warned me to leave the law alone unless I wanted to leave the Miele behind as well.|$|E

He never was late, {{and he was}} usually at the office {{a few minutes before}} his regular time. And yet he saved his time. Every spare moment was devoted to study. He studied book-keeping and type-writing, and he paid for lessons in shorthand by dictating at night to a court reporter who needed practice. He quickly became a clerk, and he made himself invaluable. Father appreciated him and saw that he was bound to rise. It was on father's suggestion that he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> college. He became a lawyer, and hardly was he back in the office when father took him in as junior partner. He is a great man. He refused the United States Senate several times, and father says he could become a justice of the Supreme Court any time a vacancy occurs, if he wants to. Such a life is an inspiration to all of us. It shows us that a man with will may rise superior to his environment." ...|$|E
60|$|With another labourer, one Bernard, Mirabel dug, found {{a packet}} of dirty linen, and, fearing that it might hold the {{infection}} of plague, dipped it in wine, for lack of vinegar. The parcel contained {{more than a thousand}} Portuguese gold coins. Bernard and his mistress were present {{at the opening of the}} parcel, but Mirabel managed to conceal from them the place where he hid it, not a very likely story. He was grateful enough to pay for the desired masses, and he had himself bled four times to relieve his agitation. Mirabel now consulted a merchant in Marseilles, one Auguier, who advised him to keep his old coins a mystery, as to put them into circulation would lead to inquiry and inconvenience. He lent Mirabel some ready money, and, finally, induced Mirabel to entrust the Portuguese hoard to his care. The money was in two bags, one fastened with gold-coloured ribbon, the other with linen thread. Auguier gave a receipt, and now we get a date, Marseilles, September 27, 1726. Later Auguier (it seems) tried to murder Mirabel, and refused to return the deposit. Mirabel <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> with him: Auguier admitted that Mirabel had spoken to him about having found a treasure which he would entrust to Auguier, but denied the rest. In his house was found a ribbon of a golden hue, such as Mirabel used to tie up his bag, and a little basket which has no obvious connection with the matter. The case was allowed to come on, there were sixteen witnesses. A woman named Caillot swore to Mirabel's having told her about the ghost: she saw the treasure excavated, saw the bags, and recognised the ribbon. A man had seen Mirabel on his way to give Auguier his bags, and, indeed, saw him do so, and receive a piece of paper. He also found, next day, a gold coin on the scene of the interview. A third witness, a woman, was shown the treasure by Mirabel.|$|E
6000|$|The drawing-room {{contained}} several {{pictures of}} Mrs. Sherrick {{when she was}} in the theatrical line; Smee's portrait of her, which was never half handsome enough--for my Betsy, Sherrick said indignantly; the print of her in Artaxerxes, with her signature as Elizabeth Folthorpe (not in truth a fine specimen of calligraphy) the testimonial presented to her on the conclusion of the triumphal season of 18--, at Drury Lane, by her ever grateful friend Adolphus Smacker, Lessee, who, of course, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>law</b> with her next year; and other Thespian emblems. But Clive remarked, with not a little amusement, that the drawing-room tables were now covered with a number of those books which he had seen at Madame de Moncontour's, and many French and German ecclesiastical gimcracks, such as are familiar to numberless readers of mine. These were the Lives of St. Botibol of Islington and St. Willibald of Bareacres, with pictures of those confessors. Then there was the Legend of Margery Dawe, Virgin and Martyr, with a sweet double frontispiece, representing (1) the sainted woman selling her feather-bed for the benefit of the poor; and (2) reclining upon straw, the leanest of invalids. There was Old Daddy Longlegs, and how he was brought to say his Prayers; a Tale for Children, by a Lady, with a preface dated St. Chad's Eve, and signed [...] "C. H." [...] The Rev. Charles Honeyman's Sermons, delivered at Lady Whittlesea's Chapel. Poems of Early Days, by Charles Honeyman, A.M. The Life of good Dame Whittlesea, by do, do. Yes, Charles had come out in the literary line; and there in a basket was a strip of Berlin work, of the very same Gothic pattern which Madame de Moncontour was weaving; and which you afterwards saw round the pulpit of Charles's chapel. Rosey was welcomed most kindly by the kind ladies; and as the gentlemen sat over their wine after dinner in the summer evening, Clive beheld Rosey and Julia pacing up and down the lawn, Miss Julia's arm around her little friend's waist: he thought they would make a pretty little picture.|$|E
