Contrary to popular myth, not all contests end in death. If a gladiator was killed the game's sponsor had to pay for his replacement. As a gladiator, you had a near 90% chance of surviving the fight. And if a gladiator was injured, he was given some of the best medical care available in Rome. Roman doctors were renowned for their treatment of flesh wounds. Doctors who worked with gladiators helped to pioneer the treatment of fractures. And they used an opium-based anesthetic for operations. For each victory in the arena, a gladiator is paid the equivalent of a Roman soldier's yearly pay, and he can purchase some personal items. Priscus obtains a small prayer statue and <b>wall-shelf</b> for his own Celtic devotions.|$|E
