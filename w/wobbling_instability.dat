5|$|Between {{these last}} two speeds, if they both exist, is a range of forward speeds at which the {{particular}} bike design is self-stable. In {{the case of the}} bike whose eigenvalues are shown here, the self-stable range is 5.3–8.0m/s (1218mph). The fourth eigenvalue, which is usually stable (very negative), represents the castoring behavior of the front wheel, as it tends to turn towards the direction in which the bike is traveling. Note that this idealized model does not exhibit the wobble or shimmy and rear <b>wobble</b> <b>instabilities</b> described above. They are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with the ground or other degrees of freedom.|$|R
40|$|A <b>wobble</b> <b>instability</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} of a three-wheeled vehicle commonly used in India, and these instabilities are of great interest to industry and academia. In this paper, we studied this instability using a multi-body dynamic model and with experiments conducted on a prototype three-wheeled vehicle on a test track. The multi-body dynamic model of a three-wheeled vehicle is developed using the commercial software ADAMS/Car. In an initial model, all components including main structures such as the frame, the steering column and the rear forks are assumed to be rigid bodies. A linear eigenvalue analysis, which is carried out at different speeds, reveals a mode that has predominantly a steering oscillation, also called a wobble mode, with a frequency of around 5 - 6 Hz. The analysis results shows that the damping of this mode is low but positive up to the maximum speed of the three-wheeled vehicle. However, the experimental study shows that the mode is unstable at speeds below 8. 33 m/s. To predict and study this instability in detail, a more refined model of the three-wheeled vehicle, with flexibilities of three important bodies, was constructed in ADAMS/Car. With flexible bodies, three modes of a steering oscillation were observed. Two of these are well damped and the other is lightly damped with negative damping at lower speeds. Simulation results with flexibility incorporated show a good match with the instability observed in the experimental studies. Further, we investigated the effect of each flexible body and found that the flexibility of the steering column is the major contributor for <b>wobble</b> <b>instability</b> and is similar to the wheel shimmy problem in aircraft...|$|R

40|$|The {{motorcycle}} simulator of the University of Padova can reproduce important motorcycle behaviours such as handlebar counter-steering, capsize, weave and <b>wobble</b> <b>instabilities,</b> {{as illustrated}} in this chapter. The handlebar and footpads are sensorized in a simulator, the rider's control actions are transferred to the real-time multibody model of the motorcycle, and the simulated dynamics are then converted into references for the motion and visual cues. Proper tuning of a simulator is essential to assure the best riding experience within strict technological and physical constraints. Since it is physically impossible to reproduce real-life accelerations in the simulator, the tuning of the washout filter is crucial. A subjective evaluation based on the rider's rating {{is presented in the}} chapter. The utilization of a riding simulator gives the possibility of operating in a flexible environment where both real (hardware-in-the-loop) and emulated devices can be used together...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the high speed, weave and wobble mode, stability of a two-wheeled vehicle {{equipped with a}} passive gyroscopic stabiliser. This stabiliser is a rapidly-spinning disk attached to the chassis of the vehicle with freedom to rotate along an axis perpendicular to the spinning axis. The equations of motion of the combined system are derived symbolically using the multibody dynamics software MBSymba and linearised about the equilibrium condition of constant-speed forward motion in order to investigate stability properties at different vehicle speeds. Using this methodology, a stabiliser is designed that can improve the stability of both the wobble and weave modes of the vehicle. This contrasts with the more conventional use of a damper on the steering column, which can only correct <b>wobble</b> <b>instability</b> and is detrimental to weave mode stability. We conclude with time domain simulations to evaluate {{the effect of the}} stabilizer on cornering...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{classical}} model of Euler top (freely rotating, generally asymmetric rigid body), possibly supplemented with a rotor, corresponds to a generalized Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model describing phenomena of various branches of quantum physics. Classical effects such as free precession of a symmetric top, Feynman's <b>wobbling</b> plate, tennis-racket <b>instability</b> and the Dzhanibekov effect, attitude control of satellites by momentum wheels, or twisting somersault dynamics, have their counterparts in quantum effects that include spin squeezing by one-axis twisting and two-axis countertwisting, transitions between the Josephson and Rabi regimes of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential, and other quantum critical phenomena. The parallels enable us to expand the range of explored quantum phase transitions in the generalized LMG model, {{as well as to}} present a classical analogy of the recently proposed LMG Floquet time crystal.

40|$|Two and {{three-wheeled}} {{vehicles are}} being used in increasing numbers in many emerging countries. The dynamics of such vehicles {{are very different from}} those of cars and other means of transportation. This thesis deals with a study of the dynamics of a motorcycle and an extensively used three-wheeled vehicle, called an “auto-rickshaw” in India. The commercially available multi-body dynamics (MBD) software, ADAMS, is used to model both the vehicles and simulations are performed to obtain insight into their dynamics. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, a study of the two wheeler dynamics is presented. A fairly detailed model of a light motorcycle with all the main sub-systems, such as the frame, front fork, shock absorbers, power train, brakes, front and rear wheel including tire slips and the rider is created in ADAMS-Motorcycle. The simulation results dealing with steering torques and angles for steady turns on a circular path are presented. From the simulation results and analytical models, it is shown that for path radius much greater than motorcycle wheel base, the steering torque and angle can be described by only two functions for each of the two variables. The first function is related to the lateral acceleration and can be determined numerically and the second function, in terms of the inverse of the path radius, is derived as an analytical approximation. Various tire and geometric parameters are varied in the ADAMS simulations and it is clearly shown that steady circular motion of a motorcycle can be reasonably approximated by only two curves–one for steering torque and one for steering angle. In the second part of the thesis, a stability analysis of the three-wheeled “autorickshaw” is presented. The steering instability is one of the major problems of the “auto-rickshaw” and this is studied using a MBD model created in ADAMS-CAR. In an Initial model the frame,steering column and rear-forks (trailing arms) are assumed to be rigid. A linear eigenvalue analysis, at different speeds, reveals a predominantly steering oscillation, called a “wobble” mode, with a frequency in the range of 5 to 6 Hz. The analysis results show that the damping of this mode is small but positive up to the maximum speed(14 m/s) of the three-wheeled vehicle. Experiments performed on the three-wheeled vehicle show that the mode is unstable at speeds below 8. 33 m/s and thus the experimental results do not agree with the model. Next, this <b>wobble</b> <b>instability</b> is studied with an analytical model, similar to the model proposed for wheel shimmy problem in aircrafts. The results of this model show that the wobble is stable at low speeds regardless of the magnitude of torsional stiffness of steering column. This is also not matching with the experimental result. A more refined MBD model with flexibility incorporated in the frame, steering column and the trailing arm is constructed. Simulation results with the refined model show three modes of steering oscillations. Two of these are found to be well damped and the third is found to be lightly damped with negative damping at low speeds, and the results of the model with the flexibility is shown to be matching reasonably well with the experimental results. Detailed simulations with flexibility of each body incorporated, one at a time, show that the flexibility in the steering column is the main contributor of the steering instability and the instability is similar to the wheel shimmy problem in aircrafts. Finally, studies of modal interaction on steering instabilities and parametric studies with payload and trail are presented...|$|R
