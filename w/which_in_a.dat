5|$|In {{the middle}} {{statement}} of the principal theme (between the C minor and A-flat major sections) there is a notational error <b>which,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> literal performance of the score, causes a harmonic clash between the piano and the winds. Mozart probably wrote the piano and wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. Alfred Brendel, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole movement is another notational error: played in cut common time, which calls for two beats per bar rather than four, the movement is, in his view, too fast.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{won their}} third {{consecutive}} game on January 16 with a shootout {{victory over the}} Worcester Sharks. Grubauer stopped four of five shootout attempts by the Sharks, while Mitchell and Potulny scored on the shootout for the win. But that game {{was followed by a}} season-high four-game losing streak, which included a 2–1 overtime loss to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton at the AHL Outdoor Classic on January 20. Before a crowd of 17,311 at Hersheypark Stadium, Hershey kept the Penguins scoreless for two periods before they tied it in the third, then Paul Thompson scored a game-winning breakaway goal 1:19 into overtime. Their fourth straight loss against Binghamton on January 26 briefly took the Bears out of playoff contention in the Eastern Conference. The Bears ranked 22nd in the league for scoring, averaging 2.53 goals per game, and were last in league for shots on goal per game at 25.21. Their record was 0-for-15 when trailing in two periods, and 12 of their games so far had been one-goal decisions. However, the January 26 loss also started a seven-game point streak for the Bears, which included three wins and four overtime losses, three of <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shootout. On January 31, the Bears obtained winger Peter LeBlanc in a trade for Beaudoin to the Chicago Blackhawks, and also received Casey Wellman in a trade for Hamill to the Florida Panthers.|$|E

25|$|Markov {{chains are}} used {{throughout}} information processing. Claude Shannon's famous 1948 paper A Mathematical Theory of Communication, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single step created {{the field of}} information theory, opens by introducing the concept of entropy through Markov modeling of the English language. Such idealized models can capture many of the statistical regularities of systems. Even without describing the full structure of the system perfectly, such signal models can make possible very effective data compression through entropy encoding techniques such as arithmetic coding. They also allow effective state estimation and pattern recognition. Markov chains also {{play an important role}} in reinforcement learning.|$|E

25|$|Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, {{also called}} {{erythrocyte}} pyruvate kinase deficiency, is an inherited metabolic disorder of the enzyme pyruvate kinase. In this condition, {{a lack of}} pyruvate kinase slows down the process of glycolysis. This effect is especially devastating in cells that lack mitochondria, because these cells must use anaerobic glycolysis as their sole source of energy because the TCA cycle is not available. One example is red blood cells, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of pyruvate kinase deficiency rapidly become deficient in ATP and can undergo hemolysis. Therefore, pyruvate kinase deficiency can cause hemolytic anemia.|$|E

Then, with the dramatic decrease of oil prices that happened {{in the second half of}} 2008 plus the confirmed burst of the property bubble, concerns quickly shifted to the risk of deflation instead, as Spain registered in January 2009 its lowest inflation rate in 40 years which was then followed in March 2009 by a negative inflation rate for the first time ever since this statistic was recorded.|$|E
25|$|A local {{government}} {{is a form of}} public administration <b>which,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, {{local government}} generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.|$|E
