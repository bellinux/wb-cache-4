5|$|While {{individual}} dogs may vary, {{in general}} show-bred Labradors are heavier built, slightly shorter-bodied, {{and have a}} thicker coat and tail. Field Labradors are generally longer-legged, lighter, and more lithe in build, making them agile. In the head, show Labradors tend to have broader heads, better defined stops, and more powerful necks, while field Labradors have lighter and slightly narrower heads <b>with</b> <b>longer</b> muzzles.|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos obovatus hybridises with A.detmoldii {{to produce}} A.× pamela. Known only from road verges in the Scott River region, {{it was first}} {{discovered}} in 1979, {{and it is now}} known from more than twenty individual plants. The discovery of it in such large numbers, together with its recognised horticultural potential, prompted Nelson to formally describe and name it in 1986. Morphologically it is intermediate between its parents; that is, taller than A.obovatus, <b>with</b> <b>longer</b> leaves and light red flowers. It is fertile, raising the possibility of the establishment of a hybrid swarm.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines <b>with</b> <b>longer</b> blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 {{feet above the ground}} can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E

It is the third inbound station from O'Hare on the Blue Line and is situated between the Rosemont and Harlem stations. Blue Line trains serve Cumberland 24 hours a day every day; trains operate roughly every 7 to 10 minutes during rush hour and midday operation, <b>with</b> <b>longer</b> headways of up to 30 minutes at night. The station is approximately seven minutes from O'Hare, 31 minutes from Clark/Lake in the Loop, and 52 minutes from Forest Park. 1,304,280 passengers boarded at Cumberland in 2011.|$|E

During 2016 and 2017, as part of Main Roads Western Australia's Traffic Congestion Management Program, {{the intersection}} with Kelvin Road was upgraded to improve traffic flow and safety. New and longer turning lanes were added, This project cost $7.5 million and was funded by the Western Australia state government.|$|E
5|$|Holstein is {{a station}} on the Sognsvann Line (line 6) of the Oslo Metro in Norway. The station is located between Kringsjå and Østhorn stations.

5|$|Hypogeomys australis was {{generally}} similar to H.antimena, the largest living rodent of Madagascar, but even larger, with {{little if any}} overlap in measurements. Grandidier described the extinct species as more robust, with more prominent muscle scars on the long bones and <b>with</b> <b>longer</b> molars with more distinct crests and lobes. The length of the first lower molar is 5.2 to 6.4mm, averaging 5.7mm, in ten H.australis and 3.9 to 5.5mm, averaging 4.8mm, in twenty-four H.antimena. The width of the femur at the proximal (near) end is 18.6 to 21.5mm, averaging 19.9mm, in thirteen H.australis and 16.8 to 18.5mm, averaging 17.5mm, in nine H.antimena. In ten H.australis, total length of the femur is 69.9 to 75.1mm, averaging 72.1mm, compared to 59.7 to 69.9mm, averaging 63.8mm in nine H.antimena.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, W.D. Hamilton {{proposed}} a specific but widely applicable handicap mechanism, parasite-mediated sexual selection. He {{argued that in}} the never-ending co-evolutionary race between hosts and their parasites, sexually selected signals indicate health. This idea was tested in 1994 in barn swallows, a species where males have long tail streamers. Møller found that the males <b>with</b> <b>longer</b> tails, and their offspring, did have fewer bloodsucking mites, whereas fostered young did not. The effect was therefore genetic, confirming Hamilton's theory.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, it was {{announced}} that new targeting and surveillance sensors were under development to provide high-resolution color imagery to crews, replacing older low definition black-and-white imaging systems. Lockheed received the first contract in January 2016, upgrading the Arrowhead turret to provide higher-resolution color imaging <b>with</b> <b>longer</b> ranges and a wider field of view. In 2014, the U.S. Army was adapting its Apaches for increased maritime performance as part of the Pentagon's rebalance to the Pacific. Additional avionics and sensor improvements includes an extended-range radar capable of detecting small ships in littoral environments, software adaptions to handle maritime targets, and adding Link 16 data-links for better communications with friendly assets.|$|E

5|$|In {{paintings}} and engravings of the 18th and 19th centuries, Pugs usually appear <b>with</b> <b>longer</b> legs and noses than today, and sometimes with cropped ears. The modern Pug's appearance probably changed after 1860 {{when a new}} wave of Pugs were imported directly from China. These Pugs had shorter legs and the modern-style Pug nose. The British aristocrat Lady Brassey is credited with making black Pugs fashionable after she brought some back from China in 1886. Ear cropping was made illegal in 1895.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines <b>with</b> <b>longer</b> n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent {{in the production of}} dimethyl terephthalate.|$|E
5|$|Operation of {{the system}} is {{subcontracted}} to Metro Service. Trains run continually, twenty-four hours a day, with the headway varying from two to four minutes, but <b>with</b> <b>longer</b> intervals (up to twenty minutes) during the night only. While a 6 train per hour (tph) service with 8-car trains, moves 48 cars per hour in each direction, Copenhagen Metro with 30 tph with 3 cars only, actually moves 90 cars per hour in each direction. So, in terms of capacity, the Copenhagen Metro is equivalent to a system with 8 cars and 12 tph (or a train every fifth minute).|$|E
