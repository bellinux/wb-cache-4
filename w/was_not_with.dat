5|$|En {{route to}} Albany, the ship {{carrying}} Montgomery up the Hudson River ran aground near Clermont Manor, {{seat of the}} politically powerful Livingston family. While the ship was refloated, the Livingstons played host to the officers who were aboard the vessel. Montgomery was at this time introduced to Robert Livingston's 20-year-old daughter Janet. While it has never transpired exactly what happened between them at this time, Janet noticed that the young Montgomery <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> the regiment (having been given leave to return to England early) when it returned to New York.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{divided the}} debt into {{national}} and state, and further divided {{the national debt}} into foreign and domestic debt. While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Colt {{received}} an extension on his patent {{since he did}} not collect {{on it in the}} early years. In 1852, gun makers James Warner and Massachusetts Arms infringed on the patent. Colt sued the companies and the court ordered that Warner and Massachusetts Arms cease revolver production. Colt then threatened to sue Allen & Thurber over the cylinder design of their double-action pepperbox revolver. However, Colt's lawyers doubted that this suit would have been successful and the case was resolved with a settlement of $15,000. Production of Allen pepperboxes continued until the expiration of Colt's patent in 1857. In 1854 Colt fought for his patent extension with the U.S. Congress, who launched a special committee to investigate charges that Colt had bribed government officials in securing this extension. By August he was exonerated and the story became national news when Scientific American reported that the fault <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> Colt, but with Washington politicians. With a virtual monopoly, Colt sold his pistols in Europe, where demand was high due to tense international relations. By telling each nation that the others were buying Colt's pistols, Colt was able to get large orders from many countries who feared falling behind in the arms race.|$|E

5|$|Judy {{also pointed}} out the {{approach}} of hostile Japanese aircraft long before any of the human crew could hear them. This first occurred prior to the outbreak of war, when the aircraft would fly low over the Gnat with Judy barking at them until they had passed. On an outing to Jiujiang, Jefferey took Judy for a walk outside of the city but she ran ahead, pulling him with her. He realised as he looked back {{that she had been}} pulling him away from a Leopard. In November 1937, the Gnat met with the American river gunboat USS Panay. After the Panay held a party for the two ship's companies, the Gnat crew departed and only realised afterwards that Judy <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> them. They contacted the Panay via signal lamp, but they insisted that they had not seen her. The following morning, the crew heard from a Chinese trader that Judy was on board the Panay after all. In retaliation, a party boarded the American vessel and stole the ship's bell. Afterwards they contacted the Panay and offered them the bell back in return for Judy. She was returned within the hour.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{headed for}} Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. Fearing the Japanese Navy, {{they sought to}} travel via the Lingga Islands hoping that the island group it sat in {{could be used as}} a hiding place. As they {{approached}} on 14 February, Judy indicated the approach of Japanese aircraft and the anti-aircraft gunners took up their positions in readiness. The Grasshopper was hit with a single bomb before the planes departed. Judy was below decks when the planes returned. The Dragonfly was hit by three bombs and sank quickly. The Grasshopper was hit by a further two bombs, and the order was given to abandon ship as a fire spread close to an ammunition compartment. Boats were lowered and the crew and evacuees were ferried just over a hundred yards to shore whilst the Japanese planes strafed the vessels. It was only when they were ashore that they realised Judy <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Violet {{explains}} to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie {{will be coming}} {{to pick up the}} money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.|$|E

25|$|At first, Pope Urban {{threatened}} to excommunicate anyone who helped Odoardo, but Odoardo's allies insisted their conflict <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> the papacy, but rather with the Barberini family (of which the Pope {{happened to be}} a member). When this failed, the Pope attempted to call on old alliances of his own and turned to Spain for assistance. But he received little help as Spanish forces were fully occupied by the Thirty Years' War. As it was, most of the troops fighting {{on the side of the}} papacy were French, most of those fighting for the Dukes were German.|$|E
25|$|On 21 August 1911, the {{painting}} was stolen from the Louvre. The theft was not discovered until the next day, when painter Louis Béroud walked into the museum {{and went to the}} Salon Carré where the Mona Lisa had been on display for five years, only to find four iron pegs on the wall. Béroud contacted the head of the guards, who thought {{the painting}} was being photographed for promotional purposes. A few hours later, Béroud checked back with the Section Chief of the Louvre who confirmed that the Mona Lisa <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> the photographers.

25|$|After his rebaptism, Cowdery {{desired to}} {{relocate}} to the State of Deseret (Utah) in the coming spring or summer, but due to financial and health problems {{he decided that he}} would not be able to make the journey in 1849. Because he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> the Latter-day Saints in Utah, Cowdery was not immediately given a position of responsibility in the church, but in July 1849 Young wrote Cowdery a letter inviting him to travel to Washington, D.C., with Almon W. Babbitt to publicize the State of Deseret's desire for statehood and to draft a formal statehood application. Cowdery's deteriorating health did not allow him to accept this assignment, and within eight months he had died.|$|E
25|$|In 1623, {{the prince}} angered the Ottomans {{by refusing to}} allow an army on its {{way back from the}} Persian front to winter in the Bekaa. This (and {{instigation}} by the powerful Janissary garrison in Damascus) led Mustafa Pasha, Governor of Damascus, to launch an attack against him, resulting in the battle at Majdel Anjar where Fakhr-al-Din's forces although outnumbered managed to capture the Pasha and secure the Lebanese prince and his allies a much needed military victory. The best source (in Arabic) for Fakhr ad-Din's career up to this point is a memoir signed by al-Khalidi as-Safadi, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> the Emir in Europe but had access to someone who was, possibly Fakhr ad-Din himself.|$|E
25|$|While {{working at}} a Centreville Italian restaurant, she met Ronald Roldan, a Bolivian {{immigrant}} then around 30, and began an extramarital affair with him, possibly because he offered to help her with babysitting. By late 2010, the Deckers' marriage had begun to suffer; Bethany moved to a separate apartment in Ashburn, Virginia, at least temporarily. Roldan soon followed. According to her family, she quickly {{found that he was}} abusive, possessive, and controlling. Several times a day, he demanded that she send him a picture of herself from her cellphone to prove that she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> anyone else. Her parents began developing a plan {{to get her out of}} the relationship. By the end of the year, she was pregnant again, likely by Roldan.|$|E

25|$|Norman-Walker was {{supposed}} to take up the new post as the Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Man after he had returned to England. But a problem arose when it became known that his wife would not accompany him. The reaction in the Isle of Man was negative, and the Tynwald insisted that Lady Norman-Walker should accompany her husband to assist the Lieutenant Governor in carrying out his social duties. In fact, it {{was not the first time}} that Norman-Walker had taken up a new post alone. When he arrived at Hong Kong to become Colonial Secretary in 1969, his wife <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> him. The absence of his wife did not attract any criticism at that time in Hong Kong, and she arrived later.|$|E
25|$|Mosby {{finally got}} the Department of Justice post he wanted as Philander Knox ended his term as {{attorney}} general. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> the trust-busting unit, however, but with the Bureau of Insular and Territorial affairs, where Mosby worked (at a low salary of $2,400/year) under his brother-in-law Charles W. Russell from 1904 to 1910. In 1905 President Roosevelt again sent him to Alabama to troubleshoot allegations of irregularities at the Port of Mobile. Next, {{he was sent to}} Oklahoma to investigate charges against U.S. Marshall (and former Rough Rider) Benjamin Colbert. He also secured an indictment of McAlester attorneys George Mansfield, John F. McMurray and Melvin Cornish for misappropriation of Indian Trust funds, but his superior Russell thought the evidence insufficient and ultimately dropped the charges two years later. Meanwhile, Mosby went back to investigate charges of land frauds against Indian minors, and on his return found little to do.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} with mutual fund trading that cast market timing {{in a negative}} light occurred because the prospectuses written by the mutual fund companies strictly forbid short-term trading. Despite this prohibition, special clients were allowed to do it anyway. So, the problem <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> the trading strategy but rather with the unethical and unfair implementation of that strategy, which permitted some investors to engage in it while excluding others. All of the world's greatest investors rely, to some extent, on market timing for their success. Whether they base their buy-sell decisions on fundamental analysis of the markets, technical analysis of individual companies, personal intuition, {{or all of the}} above, the ultimate reason for their success involves making the right trades at the right time. In most cases, those decisions involve extended periods of time and are based on buy-and-hold investment strategies. Value investing is a clear example, as the strategy is based on buying stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic values and selling them when their value is recognized in the marketplace. Most value investors are known for their patience, as undervalued stocks often remain undervalued for significant periods of time.|$|E
