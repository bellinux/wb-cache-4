500|$|The move to Los Angeles {{also meant}} a drastic price {{increase}} for the series. Bruce Harwood, who played Lone Gunman John Fitzgerald Byers noted, [...] "At the time, {{the exchange rate}} between Canadian and U.S. dollars was pretty dramatic. Somebody {{told me that the}} cost per episode doubled, even tripled, once they moved". In addition, the move further reduced the amount of expensive special effects the series was able to produce. Writer Vince Gilligan explained [...] "everything in Los Angeles is more expensive across the board. [...] It became apparent very quickly to me that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> longer going to have things such as nuclear submarines descending through the ice and trains exploding {{in the middle of the}} woods".|$|E
500|$|The ancient, picturesque city of Aachen {{had little}} {{military}} value in itself, {{as it was}} not a major center of war production. Its population of around 165,000 had not been subject to heavy bombing by the Allies. It was, however, an important symbol to both the Nazi regime and the German people; not only was it the first German city threatened by an enemy during World War II, it was also the historic capital of Charlemagne, founder of the [...] "First Reich". As such, it was of immense psychological value. The mindset of the city's defenders was further altered by the different attitude the local population had toward them as they fought on home soil for the first time; one German officer commented, [...] "Suddenly <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> longer the Nazis, we were German soldiers." ...|$|E
500|$|The band took {{a two-week}} hiatus between the European and Japanese {{legs of the}} tour, which began in May 1992. Minutes before the Chili Peppers were {{scheduled}} to perform in Tokyo, Frusciante refused to go on stage, claiming he quit the band. After {{half an hour of}} coaxing, Frusciante agreed to play the show, though he asserted it would be his last. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "It was the most horrible show ever. Every single note, every single word, hurt, knowing that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> longer a band. I kept looking over at John and seeing this dead statue of disdain... And that night, John disappeared from the topsy-turvy world of the Red Hot Chili Peppers." [...] The band hired guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the rest of the tour, which included Lollapolooza and several European festivals. Marshall, however, was fired {{at the end of the}} tour.|$|E

500|$|Like Ice-T's {{gangsta rap}} albums, Body Counts {{material}} focused on various {{social and political}} issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. According to Ernie C, [...] "Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> exception. Like The Beach Boys sing about the beach, we sing {{about the way we}} grew up." [...] Ice-T states that [...] "Body Count was an angry record. It {{was meant to be a}} protest record. I put my anger in it, while lacing it with dark humor." [...] The spoken introduction, [...] "Smoked Pork" [...] features Ice-T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid. The track begins with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their car towards a police car, and then Ice-T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car, much to Mooseman's chagrin, as Mooseman wanted to kill the cop in this round. Ice-T then walks up to the policeman, pretending to be a stranded motorist, asking for help, but the policeman refuses, saying: [...] "Nah, that's not my job! My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out!", then telling him that [...] "my job is eatin' these doughnuts". When the officer recognizes Ice-T, gunshots are heard. The final voice on the track is Ice-T confirming his identity.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the release}} of the first game a former Rockstar {{employee}} admitted that the game almost caused a mutiny in the company, saying that [...] "It may sound surprising, but there was almost a mutiny at the company over that game. It was Rockstar North's pet project - most of us at Rockstar Games wanted no part of it. We'd already weathered plenty of controversy over GTA III and Vice City - <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> strangers to it - but Manhunt felt different. With GTA, we always had the excuse that the gameplay was untethered - you never had to hurt anybody that wasn't a [...] "bad guy" [...] in one of the missions. You could play completely ethically if you wanted, and the game was parody anyway, so lighten up." ...|$|E
2500|$|The crew set {{off from}} Devizes at 0551hrs on Easter Saturday morning for a {{daylight}} run {{to catch the}} evening tide (slower crews started on Good Friday and paddle through the night to finish on Saturday mornings’ tide) with a schedule set for 15hrs 30mins.

[...] At this point they were told by their support crew that the race organisers had decided to abandon the event following a safety incident at Old Windsor weir the previous night. [...] The support crew explained that while they could not keep racing officially, but they were happy to carry on if the crew were, the watches were still running and they felt that we could still get the challenge record. [...] Having prepared solely for this race for 4 months Capps/Baker made the decision to go for it, removing the number from the boat and informed the DW organisation <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> longer in any way their responsibility and got back on the water.|$|E
