40|$|Motivated by {{the former}} {{researchers}} who focus only {{on one of the}} factor <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible investments, this study analyzes factors <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible investments. This study investigates wether cash, equity, expense and income are <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible investments. The reasons why the issue becomes a crucial matter are: First, recent accounting and finance literature say that intangible assets are a firm value creator and increasingly becoming the major drivers of firm value and performance. Second, current financial statements provide very little information about these assets. Even worse, much of the information that is provided is partial, inconsistent, and confusing. Third, intangible assets empirical studies in Indonesia are still very limited. Using sample from manufacture firms listed at the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) over 2003 - 2007, the result indicates that generally cash, equity, expense and income <b>are</b> <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets. These findings have twelve main concerns: First, unexpected cash <b>are</b> <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant. Second, the increasing unexpected cash are negatively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically insignificant. Third, the decreasing unexpected cash are negatively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically insignificant. Fourth, unexpected equity <b>are</b> <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant.

5000|$|Bandura (1982) defined self-efficacy as [...] "a {{belief in}} one's ability to {{effectively}} perform and to exercise influence over events". [...] Individuals who {{are high in}} self-efficacy set more difficult goals, exert more effort to achieve those goals, and seek {{to learn from the}} processes of pursuing those goals. [...] In a meta-analysis by Payne et al., self-efficacy was identified as a proximal outcome of goal orientation. Similarly, VandeWalle, Cron & Slocum found that LGO <b>was</b> <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> self-efficacy, effort, and goal setting level.

These behaviors fall into four categories: transformational leadership behavior, transactional leadership behavior, behaviors {{having to do with the}} path-goal theory of leadership, and behaviors having to do with the leader-member exchange theory. Transformational leadership behaviors, including articulating a vision, providing an appropriate model, fostering the acceptance of group goals, high performance expectations, and intellectual stimulation, have significant positive relationships with Organ's dimensions of OCB. Two types of behaviors representative of transactional leadership style, contingent reward behavior and non-contingent punishment behavior, have significant relationships with Organ's dimensions of OCB. Additionally, both the supportive leadership and leader role clarification aspects of the path-goal theory of leadership are positively related to OCB. Podsakoff et al.

50|$|In {{a review}} of {{research}} on motivation and transfer, Pugh and Bergin (2006) concluded that motivational factors can influence transfer, although the research is limited and not wholly consistent. They found that mastery goals were more consistently linked to transfer success than were performance goals. They also found that interest was related to transfer success when this interest {{was associated with the}} learning content. However, when the interest was related to peripheral things, such as seductive details in text, it inhibited transfer success. In addition, they found evidence that transfer success <b>was</b> <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> self-efficacy. Finally, the reviewers proposed that the transfer process is affected by the presence of an explicit goal of achieving transfer. Pugh and Bergin (2006) predicted that motivational factors influence transfer in three ways. First, they can influence the quality of initial learning in ways that support transfer. Second, they can influence the initiation of transfer attempts, particularly in situations where individuals have an opportunity to apply learning but are not required to. Third, motivational factors can influence individuals’ persistence when engaged in transfer tasks.|$|E
5000|$|Metacognition is {{conceptualized}} as an individual's knowledge and regulation over one's own cognitions. Individuals high in metacognitive awareness are skilled at monitoring their progress towards goals, identifying {{their strengths and}} weaknesses, and adjusting their learning strategies accordingly to achieve favorable outcomes. [...] Although there have been relatively few research studies conducted {{on the role of}} metacognition in leader development outcomes, some studies have found that metacognition {{plays an important role in}} such outcomes. For example, Ford et al. linked LGO and metacognitive activity and found that metacognitive activity was significantly related to knowledge acquisition, post-training performance, and self-efficacy. In a study by Schmidt & Ford, metacognitive activity <b>was</b> <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> LGO as well as cognitive, affective, and skill based learning outcomes. Similarly, Bell and Kozlowski found that LGO was significantly related to metacognitive activity. The National Research Council (2000) points out that it is important to remember that metacognitive skills can be taught and essential that teachers explicitly teach metacognitive skills across the curriculum in a variety of subject areas.|$|E
5000|$|Moderators {{exist in}} the {{relationship}} between organizational ambidexterity and organizational outcomes. Environmental dynamism and competitiveness moderate the relationship between exploitation/ exploration and performance (Levinthal & March, 1993; Lewin, Long & Carroll, 1999). Empirical studies also showed that pursuing exploratory innovation is more effective in dynamic environments, whereas pursuing exploitative innovation is more beneficial to a unit's financial performance in more competitive environments (Jansen, van den Bosch, & Volberda, 2006). Although they were not directly testing an ambidextrous orientation, results indicated a positive performance effect of simultaneously pursuing exploitative and exploratory innovation under high dynamic and competitive environments. The effects of exploitative, explorative and balanced corporate alignment activities on performance were compared under varying environmental conditions (Raisch & Hotz, 2008). The construct of [...] "environmental munificence" [...] was developed to reflect an organization's opportunities and dynamism (Zahra, 1993). They found that, although exploration <b>was</b> <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> performance under high environmental munificence, a balanced orientation failed to significantly affect performance in times of low environmental munificence (Raisch & Hotz, 2008).|$|E
