25|$|Horizontal-axis wind {{turbines}} (HAWT) have the main rotor shaft and electrical generator {{at the top}} of a tower, and must be pointed into the wind. Small turbines are pointed by a simple <b>wind</b> <b>vane,</b> while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a servomotor. Most have a gearbox, which turns the slow rotation of the blades into a quicker rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator.|$|E

The cupola on top of the lantern is made of sheet copper, painted red, and it is topped by ball vent and a <b>wind</b> <b>vane.</b> An access ladder and safety rails, installed in 1990, provide access to the cupola. In the center of the lantern is the VRB-25 apparatus, mounted on steel box.|$|E
500|$|From June 1957 to June 1968, {{the state}} park became a Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Air Defense Network radar site. The {{military}} installation {{was called the}} New Preston Gap-Filler RADAR Annex P-50A /Z-50A. The site was an unmanned gap-filler [...] "providing low altitude coverage" [...] that [...] "consisted of the radar and tower along with the building which contained the radar equipment and a diesel generator." [...] In 1968, a dirt road and cinder block building {{were added to the}} top of the hill as part of an upgrade to the site. In 1981, the park was the subject of a study by Northeast Utilities as a possible wind power site. An anemometer and <b>wind</b> <b>vane</b> were placed atop a [...] tower to record wind data.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{instruments}} used {{to measure}} wind speed and direction are called anemometers and <b>wind</b> <b>vanes,</b> respectively.

500|$|During {{its time}} as a {{meteorological}} station, the observatory collected reports from 312 observation stations in Canada and another 36 in the United States. Each station was equipped with a [...] "Mercurial Barometer, two Thermometers (a maximum and a minimum Thermometer), an Anemometer to measure the velocity of the wind, a <b>Wind</b> <b>Vane</b> and a Rain Gauge". Reports were sent in coded form to the Observatory at 8am and 8pm every day, Eastern Standard Time (then known as [...] "75th meridian time"), and used to produce a chart predicting the weather for the following 36 hours. These predictions were then telegraphed across the country, and charts were distributed to newspapers and the Board of Trade, {{where they could be}} viewed by the public. With the installation of telephones, the Observatory also offered weather reports on demand, which was an important service to fruit vendors, who used the reports to plan shipping.|$|E
2500|$|To gather more weather information, the Germans {{developed}} the Wetter-Funkger√§t Land (WFL) automatic weather station. It {{was designed by}} Dr. Ernst Ploetze and Edwin Stoebe. Twenty-six were manufactured by Siemens. The WFL had an array of measuring instruments, a telemetry system and a 150 watt, Lorenz 150 FK-type transmitter. It consisted of ten cylindrical canisters, each [...] by c.47cm diameter ( [...] circumference) and weighing around [...] One canister contained the instruments and was attached to a [...] antenna mast. A second, shorter mast carried an anemometer and <b>wind</b> <b>vane.</b> The other canisters contained the nickel-cadmium batteries that powered the system. [...] The WFL would send weather readings every three hours during a two-minute transmission on 3940 kHz. [...] The system could work {{for up to six}} months, depending on the number of battery canisters.|$|E
2500|$|Galehead Hut (...) lies nearly [...] {{above sea}} level on rugged Garfield Ridge. Construction on the {{original}} structure there began in 1931, using wood from the surrounding trees. It was completed in 1932, along with Zealand Falls Hut, its closest northern neighbor. A small space under the front porch was used to store perishable foods. In 1938, Galehead gained a temporary 360degree view when the Great New England Hurricane blew over all the surrounding trees. It was replaced in June 2000 with a new Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant hut, complete with a wheelchair ramp {{even though it is}} [...] of rough trail from the nearest trailhead. Given its altitude and remoteness, {{the vast majority of the}} new structure's materials had to be carried in; thus mainly lightweight materials were utilized. New features include composting toilets (already in use at Mizpah Spring Hut, Carter Notch Hut, and Lonesome Lake Hut), both solar panels and a <b>wind</b> <b>vane</b> for producing power, and a foundation fastened to the granite bedrock with grouted rebar, giving the hut the ability to withstand winds up to [...] The hut is [...] from the summit of South Twin Mountain and [...] from the summit of Galehead Mountain. It is tied with Mizpah Springs Hut as fourth highest and sleeps the second fewest guests. Greenleaf is the closest hut to the south.|$|E
50|$|To {{estimate}} the energy {{production of a}} wind farm, developers must first measure the wind on site. Meteorological towers equipped with anemometers, <b>wind</b> <b>vanes,</b> and sometimes temperature, pressure, and relative humidity sensors are installed. Data from these towers must be recorded {{for at least one}} year to calculate an annually representative wind speed frequency distribution.|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} sensors tested {{consisted of a}} perforated sphere static, a twin venturi pitot arrangement, designed to permit the derivation of dynamic pressure in both forward and backward flight, and a Mk. 8 T pitot-static head. It was found that only the Mk. 8 T pitot-static head gave satisfactory results over the range of sideslip angles likely to be met in flight. This pitot-static head was then calibrated over a range of incidence and sideslip angles and error contours ware plotted to facilitate the correction of the indicated static and dynamic pressures recorded in flight. The <b>wind</b> <b>vanes</b> measuring sideslip and incidence were also calibrated over the same range and error contours plotted for the correction of their indications. Finally the dynamic response of the <b>wind</b> <b>vanes</b> was investigated to determine their natural frequency and damping and hence their amplitude ratio and phase lag when recording aircraft oscillations...|$|R

She was seated. She turned her head at the sound of his footsteps and started at the sight of him. Every touch of colour vanished from her face. She rose instantly, made a step toward him as if to address him, and hesitated. He stopped and stood still, expectant. Then he perceived that a nervous tumult silenced her, perceived too, that she must have sought speech with him to be waiting for him in this place.|$|E
60|$|He {{had already}} learnt from Lincoln {{that these were}} the leaders of {{existing}} London society; almost every person there that night was either a powerful official or the immediate connexion of a powerful official.

He lived in a vast hotel near that part of London called Seventh Way, and had very large and comfortable apartments on the seventeenth floor. Households and family life had long since disappeared with the progressive refinement of manners; and indeed the steady rise in rents and land values, the disappearance of domestic servants, the elaboration of cookery, had rendered the separate domicile of Victorian times impossible, even had any one desired such a savage seclusion. When his toilet was completed he went towards {{one of the two}} doors of his apartment--there were doors at opposite ends, each marked with a huge arrow pointing one one way and one the other--touched a stud to open it, and emerged on a wide passage, the centre of which bore chairs and was moving at a steady pace to the left. On some of these chairs were seated gaily-dressed men and women. He nodded to an acquaintance--it was not in those days etiquette to talk before breakfast--and seated himself on one of these chairs, and in a few seconds he had been carried to the doors of a lift, by which he descended to the great and splendid hall in which his breakfast would be automatically served.|$|E
