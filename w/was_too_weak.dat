5|$|Relations between Argentina and Uruguay worsened, {{and both}} nations {{came close to}} declaring war on each other, {{although}} neither could afford a direct military conflict. Argentina had only recently emerged from a long civil war, and was still struggling to suppress a Federalist rebellion in its western province of La Rioja. Uruguay <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> militarily {{to engage in a}} fight unaided.|$|E
5|$|By now, the {{division}} <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> {{to attempt to}} reach Frost at the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest were badly mauled or scattered. Urquhart made the difficult decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing, Urquhart hoped to hold out until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms.|$|E

5|$|Harlan argued to Goebbels that Söderbaum, {{having just}} given birth, <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> {{to take on}} the role. Goebbels countered that a special room could be set up as a nursery and that a wet-nurse could be hired to care for the infant. He further offered to halt {{shooting}} if Söderbaum became ill. Harlan later reported that Söderbaum was so upset by the entire affair that she considered fleeing back to her native Sweden to avoid having to play the part of Dorothea. In the end, however, she decided to stay and performed the role.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{traveled}} to Blue Lick Springs for his health {{soon after the}} election, but <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to return to Frankfort for the inauguration. A Bourbon County {{justice of the peace}} administered the oath of office on September 5, 1816 at the springs. Madison's only official act of office was the appointment of Colonel Charles S. Todd as secretary of state. He died on October 14, 1816, just weeks into his term, the first governor of the state to die in office. He is buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Ney now had two problems: he {{expected}} support columns from Soult's division on both flanks to arrive momentarily {{and he did}} not know that the Austrians had arrived in force, directly in front of his center. Although Roget's brigade was strong enough to prevent the Austrians from flanking the position, Gazan's brigade <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to resist the superior Austrian force, which was growing visibly stronger as Hotze's troops continued to arrive at the forward line and throw themselves into the fray.|$|E

Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral. Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed the body to the island cemetery, Isola di San Michele, where he was buried near Diaghilev and Stravinsky. Dorothy died in England the following year. Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{ratification}} {{and implementation of}} the United States Constitution, the thirteen sovereign states followed the Articles of Confederation, created by the Second Continental Congress and ratified in 1781. However, the national government that operated under the Articles of Confederation <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to adequately regulate the various conflicts that arose between the states. The Philadelphia Convention set out to correct weaknesses of the Articles that had been apparent even before the American Revolutionary War had been successfully concluded.|$|E
5|$|The strenuous {{campaign}} took {{a decisive}} toll on Helm's already weakened body. He <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> {{to travel to}} Frankfort for his inauguration, so {{the oath of office}} was administered at his home on September 3, 1867. Helm's secretary of state read the governor's inaugural address at the Hardin County Courthouse. In it Helm repeated his intent to remove political disabilities from ex-Confederates. He also charged that Congress was meddling in the affairs of the states. Though he promised protections for blacks, he opposed the idea of black suffrage.|$|E

5|$|Although Chaplin {{still had}} plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s {{he was very}} frail. He {{experienced}} several further strokes, which {{made it difficult for}} him to communicate, and he had to use a wheelchair. His final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography, My Life in Pictures (1974) and scoring A Woman of Paris for re-release in 1976. He also appeared in a documentary about his life, The Gentleman Tramp (1975), directed by Richard Patterson. In the 1975 New Year Honours, Chaplin was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, though he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to kneel and received the honour in his wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|Although he openly opposed secession {{during the}} American Civil War, federal {{military}} forces labeled Helm a Confederate sympathizer. In September 1862, {{he was arrested}} for this alleged sympathy, but Governor James F. Robinson recognized him as he was being transported to a prison in Louisville and had him released. After the war Helm identified with the Democratic Party, and in 1865 Hardin County voters returned him to the state senate. In 1867 he was the state's Democratic candidate for governor. Despite his failing health, Helm made a vigorous canvass of the state and won the general election. He <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so state officials administered the oath of office at his home on September 3, 1867. He died five days later.|$|E
5|$|At that point, {{the party}} reunites with Zola, who {{supplies}} a Mechat {{for them to}} pursue Nene. As the party goes after Nene in the Mechat, Nene initiates an ancient machine that splits the world into two hemispheres, with thousands of isolated cubes floating between the halves. The party follows Nene to the Primitive Cube {{at the core of}} the transformation. The party journeys through the cube eventually defeating General Szabo and ultimately engaging Nene. As the party weakens Nene, it is revealed that Zola was working for Nene all along, and she was the voice that told the others to swallow the spheres. When Zola <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to defend herself, Nene had given her a shadow and sent her to Jibral as a spy. Zola betrays and kills Nene choosing her friends over him.|$|E

5|$|Colt did not refrain long from manufacturing, {{and turned}} to selling {{underwater}} electrical detonators and waterproof cable of his own invention. Soon after {{the failure of the}} Patent Arms Manufacturing Company, he teamed up with Samuel Morse to lobby the US government for funds. Colt's waterproof cable, made from tar-coated copper, proved valuable when Morse ran telegraph lines under lakes, rivers, bays, and in his attempts to lay a telegraph line under the Atlantic Ocean. Morse used the battery from one of Colt's mines to transmit a telegraph message from Manhattan to Governors Island when his own battery <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to send the signal.|$|E
5|$|Further east, the strongpoint {{defenses}} were effective. On the Dog Red / Easy Green boundary, {{the defenses}} around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy {{toll on the}} remaining 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined the remnants of F/116 behind the shingle, and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle. A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to have any effect and was forced back down. To their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green / Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in {{an assault on the}} bluffs.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, a French {{squadron}} under Rear-Admiral Charles Linois used Batavia on Java {{as a base}} {{to attack}} the China Fleet, although the attempt ended in failure at the Battle of Pulo Aura. Java presented a clear threat to British maritime interests in the South China Sea, but the British squadron based in the Indian Ocean <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> in 1805 to consider operations so far from its main base at Madras while Linois remained active. By the start of 1806, Linois had sailed into the Atlantic and an expeditionary force had seized the Dutch base at the Cape of Good Hope, securing the western Indian Ocean and providing reinforcements that allowed Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew to begin operations against the Dutch forces in the East Indies.|$|E

30|$|In underwater, {{since the}} channel between the signal source and the sonar is often in severe fading, the {{received}} signal by one sonar may <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to <b>be</b> detected accurately. However, with cooperative spectrum sensing, the same signal can {{be received by}} multiple sonars from different paths. If the received signal by one sonar <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak,</b> the detection performance cannot be decreased through sharing the sensing information with the other sonars. Thus, the sensing diversity gain can be achieved to improve the final detection performance through cooperative spectrum sensing.|$|R
5|$|In 1887, {{eighteen}} {{years after the}} rift formed in the American women's rights movement, Stone proposed a merger of the two groups. Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted on, then passed to the other group for evaluation. By 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Stone <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> with heart problems and respiratory illness to attend its first convention but was elected chair of the executive committee. Stanton {{was president of the}} new organization, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to move any farther. Norris {{was well}} aware of the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he {{would have to go to}} him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Out of 32 {{pieces of}} {{artillery}} held in reserve by Dembiński, only four were moved forward to Fort 58. Around 6:30, nine more guns joined the artillery duel around Wola, but their support <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> and came too late. At that time two large assault columns were formed by Russian II Infantry Corps. The first, under General Nikolai Sulima, advanced on Fort 54 with Lutkovski's Brigade (2,500 men) {{in the first}} line. The second, commanded by General Friedrich Caspar von Geismar, headed for Fort 55. As soon as von Geismar realised that the redoubt was empty, he ordered 1,500 men under Col. Pavel Liprandi to join the attack on Fort 54 instead. Despite serious losses, three battalions of Lutkovski's Brigade reached the stockade surrounding the earthworks and started clearing obstacles.|$|E
