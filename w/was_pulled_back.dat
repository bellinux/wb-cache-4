5|$|In {{the months}} {{immediately}} following the 1930 renumbering, NY14 was routed on Pennsylvania Avenue and South Main Street through southern Elmira. By 1935, NY14 was rerouted to follow Pennsylvania Avenue into downtown. As a result, all of NY17D north of the junction of Pennsylvania and Maple avenues became concurrent with NY14. The overlap was eliminated in the early 1940s when NY17D <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to the intersection of Pennsylvania and Maple avenues and renumbered as NY427.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Warner Bros. set the Australian {{release date}} as 6 September 2007, {{nearly two months}} after the {{majority}} of other release dates. However, after complaints from the Australian community, including a petition garnering 2,000 signatures the date <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to 11 July 2007. The release dates of the film in the UK and US were also moved back, both from 13 July, to 12 and 11 July, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The routing of NY268 {{remained}} unchanged until , when NY268 was supplanted by a reextended NY263. The extension was short-lived, however, as NY263 <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to its junction with NY78 by 1977. Ownership {{and maintenance of}} NY268's former routing north of Greiner Road was transferred {{from the state of}} New York to Erie County at some point prior to 1980. The remainder was given to Erie County on April1, 1980, as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The Tonawanda Creek Road portion of old NY268 was redesignated as CR559 while the Salt Road portion was redesignated as CR560.|$|E

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 3 January, Berryman met with Allen, Jerram and Frowen at Allen's headquarters at Post 40 to discuss plans for the next day. It was agreed that Allen would advance on Bardia and cut the fortress in two, supported by Frowen's guns, every available tank, MacArthur-Onslow's Bren gun carriers and the 2/8th Infantry Battalion, which Mackay had recently allocated from reserve. Allen gave orders accordingly. During {{the afternoon}} the 6th Cavalry Regiment <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to become the brigade reserve and the 2/5th Infantry Battalion relieved the 2/2nd to free it to advance the next day. That evening, Berryman {{came to the conclusion}} that unless the Italian defence collapsed soon, the 16th and 17th Infantry Brigades would become incapable of further effort and Brigadier Horace Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade would be required. Mackay was more sanguine about the situation, and reminded Berryman that his orders had been to capture Bardia with only two brigades. While they were discussing the matter, O'Connor and Harding arrived at 6th Division headquarters, and O'Connor readily agreed to the change of plan.|$|E

25|$|This triumph allowed Liechtenstein and Stutterheim {{to deploy}} their cavalry brigades {{on the west}} side of the stream. But because the 2nd Column had not kept contact with the 1st Column and Advance Guard, the allied generals halted the troops.

The Austrian cavalry <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back,</b> abandoning Telnice, and a few battalions were deployed nearby to cover Buxhoeveden's retreat.

25|$|In 1939, {{the brigade}} was a 1st Line Territorial Army Brigade {{stationed}} in the United Kingdom. It was assigned to Eastern Command defending the south-eastern portion of the country. Equipment shortages prevented it from receiving any significant numbers of modern tanks; obsolete Vickers Medium Mark II and Mk II Light Tanks comprising most of the armour on hand until after the Battle of Dunkirk. Shortly after that battle, the brigade HQ <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to Salisbury Plain, although each tank battalion was detailed as a mobile reserve for the infantry divisions holding the coastline. Each regiment could only form a single mobile squadron, the remaining two serving as infantry.|$|E
25|$|The Armenian–Azerbaijani War, {{which started}} after the Russian Revolution, {{was a series}} of brutal and hard-to-classify {{conflicts}} in 1918, then from 1920–22 that occurred during the brief independence of Armenia and Azerbaijan and afterwards. Most of the conflicts did not have a principal pattern with a standard armed structure. The Ottoman Empire and British Empire were involved in different capacities: the Ottoman Empire left the region after the Armistice of Mudros but British influence continued until Dunsterforce <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> in the 1920s. The conflicts involved civilians in the disputed districts of Kazakh-Shamshadin, Zanghezur, Nakhchivan and Karabakh. The use of guerrilla and semi-guerrilla operations was the main reason for the high civilian casualties, which occurred during the nation-building activities of the newly established states.|$|E

25|$|In March 1941, as {{the threat}} of {{invasion}} passed, the battalion was transferred to Egypt and then, after just three weeks, onto Greece, which was already engaged against the Italians in Albania, and where a German attack was expected. Arriving in Athens in early April on board the Hellas, the 22nd Battalion deployed forward to Katerini initially, but just after the German invasion of Greece it <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> to the Olympus Pass, where the 5th Brigade established blocking positions. The subsequent fighting was short and the battalion saw little action as the Allied force was quickly pushed back and evacuated by sea {{around the end of}} April.

25|$|Australia and {{the rest}} of Task Force 44 were removed from patrol duties on 10 January 1943; no Japanese {{aircraft}} or ships were sighted during the three months on station. Task Force 44 <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> and split into smaller groups: two rapid response forces, and a third (made up of Australia and three American destroyers) sent to Moreton Bay for exercises. In early February, Australias group sailed to Sydney, where the cruiser was fitted with a new radar, then proceeded on 17 February to meet the convoy returning the 9th Division from the Middle East. The convoy arrived in Fremantle on 18 February, then sailed for the Great Australian Bight, where Australia and her escorts met them. The ships reached Sydney on 27 February without incident, and Australia and her destroyers returned to northern waters.|$|E

Here, the 745th had a rare encounter with concentrated German armor supported with troops and showed their own combat experience in helping the 1st Infantry Division hold the northern shoulder of the Bulge and prevent the Germans from exploiting the road network behind them. Both the division and the tank battalion stayed in the line until the first week of February 1945 and restored the front to near its original position. The battalion finally received a much needed three-day rest on 10 February, before preparing for the final assault into Germany.|$|E
