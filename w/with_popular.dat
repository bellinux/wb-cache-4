Amis followed these books with the 1966 novel, The Anti-Death League, which had a plot filled <b>with</b> <b>popular</b> fiction elements and helped Amis prepare for Colonel Sun.|$|E

She later wrote about him for her undergraduate senior thesis and made him the subject of her PhD dissertation at Yale University.

She structured the resulting book as a psychological thriller.|$|E

5|$|As in {{previous}} generations, Nintendo provided {{strong support for}} its new console <b>with</b> <b>popular</b> first-party franchises like Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Pokémon, among others. To appeal to casual and non-gamers, Nintendo developed a group of core Wii games, consisting of Wii Sports, Wii Play, Wii Fit, and Wii Music, where players {{make use of the}} motion-sensing abilities of the console and its peripherals to simulate real world activities. With the exception of Wii Music, the games and their sequels have all been highly successful.|$|E
5|$|As {{it connects}} to I-580, I-205 is a frequently-congested major {{commuter}} {{route to the}} Bay Area. Signs on eastbound I-580 instruct travelers to take I-205, SR120, and SR99 to reach Modesto instead of using the direct, but non-freeway, route SR132. I-205 also serves to connect the Bay Area <b>with</b> <b>popular</b> weekend destinations such as Yosemite, Reno, and Lake Tahoe. The Altamont Commuter Express provides commuters with an alternate route over Altamont Pass to San Jose and San Francisco, the latter through a transfer to BART.|$|E
5|$|British Open Championship Golf was {{the third}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was directed by Rex Bradford, designer of the early golf title Mean 18. The team sought to create an accurate simulation of tournament golf play, which they felt was missing in the genre. To achieve this goal, they focused on recreating the atmosphere of a tournament, and included reactive crowds and announcers. The game was placed in competition <b>with</b> <b>popular</b> golf series such as Links and PGA Tour.|$|E

5|$|Grindcore is {{an extreme}} genre of music that {{originated}} {{in the early to}} mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, <b>with</b> <b>popular</b> contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.|$|E
5|$|Highmore and Ellys, both gentlemen and not actors, {{insisted on}} {{actively}} participating in every day-to-day decisions regarding scheduling, choice of plays, expenses, actors' behaviour. Their management style clashed with Theophilus, when he recovered and returned in February. They denied his play The Harlot's Progress instead putting a play by Ellys. The fighting between the managers coincided with poor attendance {{from both the}} epidemic in London and other theatres attracting audiences <b>with</b> <b>popular</b> operatic performances. Theophilus's play The Mock-Officer failed, which caused Highmore and Ellys to turn further against him. However, his 31 March 1733 The Harlot's Progress, based on William Hogarth's painting of the same name, proved to be very successful and embarrassed the two other managers.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Edward Bernays {{helped the}} Lucky Strike {{cigarette}} brand increase its sales among the female demographic. Research showed {{that women were}} reluctant to carry a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes, because the brand's green color scheme clashed <b>with</b> <b>popular</b> fashion choices. Bernays persuaded fashion designers, charity events, interior designers and others to popularize the color green. He also positioned cigarettes as Torches of Freedom that represent rebellion against the norms of a male-dominated society.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Hitler's reprimand, Goebbels {{launched a campaign}} to promote the antisemitic views of the Nazis to the German populace. He ordered each film studio to make an antisemitic film. Hitler preferred films such as Der ewige Jude which presented the Nazi antisemitic agenda openly and directly; however Goebbels disliked the crudeness of such straight-forward approaches, preferring the much more subtle approach of couching antisemitic messages in an engaging story <b>with</b> <b>popular</b> appeal.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1965 that {{recruitment}} of fighters increased along <b>with</b> <b>popular</b> support, and the strike teams were able to increase in size. The increase in popular support was {{in part due to}} FRELIMO agencies' offer of help to exiled Mozambicans, who had fled the conflict by travelling to nearby Tanzania. Like similar conflicts against the French and United States forces in Vietnam, the insurgents also used landmines to a great extent to injure the Portuguese forces, thus straining the armed forces' infrastructure and demoralising soldiers.|$|E
5|$|On March 1, 1845, President Tyler {{signed the}} {{annexation}} bill, and on March 3 (his last day in office), he forwarded the House version to Texas, offering immediate annexation (which preempted Polk).

The bill was signed by Polk on December 29, 1845, accepting Texas as the 28th state of the Union. Texas formally relinquished its sovereignty to the United States on February 19, 1846.|$|E

5|$|Republican leaders {{struggled}} {{to come to}} terms <b>with</b> <b>popular</b> sentiment; some wanted passionate armed struggle; others a more reasoned approach. Some leaders, such as the leftist Tan Malaka, spread the idea that this was a revolutionary struggle to be led and won by the Indonesian pemuda. Sukarno and Hatta, in contrast, were more interested in planning out a government and institutions to achieve independence through diplomacy. Pro-revolution demonstrations took place in large cities, including one led by Tan Malaka in Jakarta with over 200,000 people, which Sukarno and Hatta, fearing violence, successfully quelled.|$|E

5|$|Taraki's Government {{initiated}} a land reform on 1 January 1979 which attempted {{to limit the}} amount of land a family could own. Those whose landholdings exceeded the limit saw their property requisitioned by the government without compensation. The Afghan leadership believed the reform would meet <b>with</b> <b>popular</b> approval among the rural population while weakening the power of the bourgeoisie. The reform was declared complete in mid-1979 and the government proclaimed that 665,000 hectares (approximately 1,632,500 acres) had been redistributed. The government also declared that only 40,000 families, or 4 percent of the population, had been negatively affected by the land reform.|$|E
5|$|The Macedonian kings, who wielded {{absolute}} power and commanded state {{resources such as}} gold and silver, facilitated mining operations to mint currency, finance their armies and, by the reign of PhilipII, a Macedonian navy. Unlike the other diadochi successor states, the imperial cult fostered by Alexander was never adopted in Macedonia, yet Macedonian rulers nevertheless assumed roles as high priests of the kingdom and leading patrons of domestic and international cults of the Hellenistic religion. The authority of Macedonian kings was theoretically limited by {{the institution of the}} army, while a few municipalities within the Macedonian commonwealth enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and even had democratic governments <b>with</b> <b>popular</b> assemblies.|$|E
5|$|The Ripper murders mark an {{important}} watershed {{in the treatment}} of crime by journalists. Jack the Ripper was not the first serial killer, but his case was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy. Tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication of inexpensive newspapers with wider circulation. These mushroomed in the later Victorian era to include mass-circulation newspapers as cheap as a halfpenny, along <b>with</b> <b>popular</b> magazines such as The Illustrated Police News which made the Ripper the beneficiary of previously unparalleled publicity.|$|E
