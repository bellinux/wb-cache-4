25|$|MEG {{has access}} to {{virtually}} no sources of brain activity below a few centimetres under the cortex. EEG, on the other hand, can receive signals from greater depth, albeit {{with a high degree}} of noise. Combining the two makes it easier to determine <b>what</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EEG signal comes from the surface (since MEG is very accurate in examining signals from the surface of the brain), and what comes from deeper in the brain, thus allowing for analysis of deeper brain signals than either EEG or MEG on its own.|$|E

25|$|The postulation of pawa {{as being}} an early loan from Malay is {{extremely}} hypothetical — and suggested {{not only by the}} form of the word, but also the loss of the final -l. Two early English loans underwent a similar change, which in essence is a back formation from <b>what</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> language appeared to be a plural. Most nouns (a) form the plural with an -l suffix, and (b) in the nominative-accusative singular elide the stem final vowel, as in tukuyapa- 'same-sex sibling', plural tukuyapal, nominative-accusative tukuyap, and under this model 'custard-apple' became katitap, plural katitapal, and the word 'mammy-apple' (pawpaw/papaya) became mamiyap, plural mamiyapal.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, {{the poverty}} {{thresholds}} {{used by the}} US government were originally developed during the Johnson administration's War on Poverty initiative in 1963–1964.

Orshansky multiplied the cost of the food basket by a factor of three, under the assumption that the average family spent one third of its income on food.|$|E

25|$|The Head of House is {{responsible}} for doing the shopping list and deciding who does <b>what</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shopping task.

Once a housemate has been Head of House they could not stand a second time, but could compete to stay in heaven. After the divide was removed, only eligible housemates competed to become Head of House, except for Week 12 when all housemates were eligible.

25|$|Although Chu Ci is an {{anthology}} of poems by many poets, Qu Yuan was its central figure, both as author of the seminally important Li sao section and in the persona of protagonist. There are various other authors which are also thought to have written various sections of the Chu Ci, {{as well as some}} sections which may derive from some traditional source. Various scholarly sources propose solutions for who wrote <b>what,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chu Ci, with more doubt or questions about some sections than others. Besides the actual authorship of the diverse material of the Chu Ci, another scholarly concern is in regard to the history of who and when these pieces were collected and anthologized into one work, and also what other editorial work was done. Besides the authorship of the actual content, much commentary has been written in regard to the Chu Ci, some of which is traditionally incorporated into the printed editions.|$|E
25|$|Apostolic exarch {{is usually}} a consecrated bishop of a titular see to whom the Pope, as Bishop of the Roman See of the Apostle Peter, has {{entrusted}} the pastoral care of the faithful of an autonomous Eastern Catholic particular Church sui iuris in an area, not raised {{to the rank of}} eparchy (diocese), that is situated outside the home territory of an Eastern Catholic Church. The office of apostolic exarch thus corresponds to <b>what</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Latin Church is called an Apostolic vicar. Apostolic exarchates are generally exempt (immediately subject to the Holy See), with limited oversight by the Patriarch, Major Archbishop or Metropolitan in chief of the particular Eastern Church. It there is no metropolitan in a particular Eastern Catholic church, apostolic exarchates in their territories are directly subjected to Rome. For example, Byzantine Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia belongs to the Byzantine Catholic Church of Croatia and Serbia, but since there is no metropolitan in that church, Apostolic Exarch of Serbia is directly subjected to the Holy See.|$|E

25|$|In 'Nick', Nick {{struggles to}} find {{money to pay}} for Russian gangsters to smuggle Matty back into England, all the while {{struggling}} with his feelings for Franky. After emotionally pouring his heart out to her during an argument in a nightclub toilet, he subsequently blows the deal. But, to his happiness, Franky finally reciprocates his feelings, and they form a relationship. In 'Alo', Alo is finally forced to grow up when, in his effort to put his failed relationship with Mini behind him, he has sex with a girl named Poppy Champion (Holly Earl) who he did not initially know to be underage. Poppy reports him to the police when he breaks up with her. Although charges are eventually dropped, he and Mini are forced further apart than ever before. 'Liv' focuses on Liv's isolation. Since meeting Alex, she has been 'dealing' with Grace's death by going out, partying, drinking, and staying at Alex's house instead of her own home. Alex leaves Bristol one weekend, and Liv finds that—aside from her sister Maude—she has truly drifted from her friends, and Mini in particular. Moreover, she begins to have intense pains and feels a large lump on her side, which she worries might be ovarian cancer. Ultimately however, the lump {{turns out to be a}} grief-induced hallucination; responding to this, Liv takes a step towards dealing with Grace's death by placing flowers next to her tombstone alongside Rich, Doug, and Maude. While Mini's mum tries to convince her to give her child for adoption once it is born, and Franky is conflicted after Matty returns to Bristol, in 'Franky & Mini', both girls decide to leave everything behind and abscond. Soon, however, Mini wishes to return home, despite Franky's insistence. Alo learns of Mini's pregnancy and to her surprise—in the end—vows to take care of her no matter <b>what.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> finale, Franky attempts to track down her mother, but instead finds her biological sister who declares their mother has died. At Alex's house party to celebrate leaving Bristol behind, she tells both Matty and Nick she loves them but cannot be with them. In the conclusion, Mini goes into labour, while Franky's sister takes her to see her mother—who is not dead after all. Nick and Matty bond once again, and the latter turns himself in to the police. In the final scene, playing in parallel, Alex leaves Bristol for Thailand; Alo and Liv are beside Mini as she gives birth; Franky lays eyes on her mother; and Rich, outside the room where Mini is giving birth, looks at the camera and says 'bye'.|$|E
500|$|The Wrongs of Woman is <b>what</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{late eighteenth}} century was called a Jacobin novel, [...] a {{philosophical}} novel that advocated {{the ideals of the}} French Revolution. Wollstonecraft's novel argues along with others, such as Mary Hays's Memoirs of Emma Courtney (1796), that women are the victims of constant and systematic injustice. Wollstonecraft uses the philosophical dialogues in her novel to demonstrate women's powerlessness.|$|E
500|$|With Louis Armstrong and Muggsy Spanier, Beiderbecke {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} jazz soloists of the 1920s.

[...] "In a Mist" [...] (1927), one of a handful of his piano compositions and one of only two he recorded, mixed classical (Impressionist) influences with jazz syncopation.|$|E

The September 11 attacks occurred a few months later, and the U.S. focused its foreign policy on the War on Terror against countries suspected of harboring terrorist organizations. As a result, the U.S. gave no further financial aid to Argentina. This policy was confirmed after an interview of Bush with the Brazilian president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who confirmed Brazil would not be affected by the Argentine crisis.|$|E

500|$|During {{recording}} {{sessions for}} their upcoming album, vocalist Gregg Allman was {{also working on}} his solo album, Laid Back, and the sessions occasionally overlapped. Chuck Leavell was asked to play piano for Allman's solo album, and gradually found himself contributing to the Allman Brothers as well. Allman and Betts took turns caring for Oakley, taking him outdoors to places like the zoo {{to keep him from}} drinking as much. [...] "Time and time again, I have sat and wondered, 'God, <b>what</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hell could I have done, what could have anybody have done, to help him?'" [...] said Allman. Upon Leavell's entry into the group, Oakley {{went out of his way}} to make the new member comfortable. On November 11, 1972, overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night, Oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus, just three blocks from where Duane had been killed in a bike accident. He declined hospital treatment and went home, but gradually grew delirious. He was taken to the hospital shortly thereafter and died of cerebral swelling caused by a fractured skull. Oakley was buried directly beside Duane at Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia.|$|E
500|$|Of the Baltic tribes {{may have}} written Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy when {{they spoke of}} the Veneti, Venedi or Venedai people. Pliny in Natural History locates them {{in the mouth of}} the Vistula region, while Ptolemy in Geographia just east of the lower Vistula along the Bay of Gdańsk. The Western Baltic Veneti's {{territory}} may have reached east all the way to Sambia. Tacitus in Germania, describing (possibly the same) inhabitants of the south-eastern Baltic shores, mentioned the Aesti people, involved in collecting amber not for their own use but for long distance trade in a raw state. Jordanes in Getica speaks of the [...] "Aesti, who dwell on the farthest shore of the German Ocean" [...] (beyond the Germanic-named Vidivarii people, who occupied the mouth of the Vistula area). This [...] "Ocean" [...] he defines as where the floods of the Vistula empty, the Baltic Sea.

500|$|An early {{mention of}} Flixton {{appears in the}} Testa de Nevil, which {{includes}} the entry: [...] "Albert Gredle, sen., gave to Henry, son of Siward, one carucate of land in Flixton by 10s. yearly. [...] The heirs hold that land." [...] The manor of Flixton was, for a time, controlled by the Grelleys, Barons of Manchester. [...] Robert of Lathom, who inherited the manor, granted the parish of Flixton to the newly created Burscough Priory, located near Ormskirk, in 1190. [...] The Grelleys {{may not have been}} Flixton manor's only masters, as in 1250–1251 part of the area came into the possession of David de Hulton. [...] The Hultons united <b>what</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th century was a fragmented manor. [...] In 1330 they sub-let one half of it to the Valentine family and the other to two branches of the Radcliffe family. [...] The Valentines are included in the Exchequer Lay Subsidy Rolls of 1332, which show five tax payers in Flixton: Richard le Valentine, Henry de l'Wode, William de l'Berne, Richard son of Robert and John de Booth. [...] The name Valentine also appears in Flixton's parish registers, which begin in 1570. [...] Written on vellum and mostly in Latin, the first records 11baptisms, 2marriages and 7burials. [...] Christian names include Hamlet, Randle and Ralph. [...] The registers show that surnames such as Gilbody, Valentine, Millatt and Low remained prevalent in the area well into the 19th century.|$|E
