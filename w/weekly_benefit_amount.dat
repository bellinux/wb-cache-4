Much of the empirical evidence of this effect has involved {{a positive relationship between}} benefit liberality and the number of weeks that recipients collect benefits. But several analysts have argued that weeks of compensated unemployment may be a misleading measure of unemployment duration because many beneficiaries are unemployed for some time before they file for benefits. In particular, if higher benefit levels induce unemployed workers to file for benefits more promptly, then benefit level will be positively associated with compensated unemployment duration even if it has no effect on total unemployment duration...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters and analyzes individuals' and firms' response to tax and government spending policies. The first chapter focuses on the economic incidence of a large value added tax (VAT) cut in the restaurant industry in France. In particular it estimates {{the share of the}} tax cut falling on workers, firm owners and consumers by analyzing the VAT cut applied to French sit-down restaurants [...] a drop from 19. 6 percent to 5. 5 percent [...] in July 2009. Theoretically, we develop a standard partial equilibrium model of consumption tax incidence that includes consumption substitutability between the taxed good and an untaxed good, and markets for production inputs, which we allow to vary with the tax. Empirically, we use firm-level data and a difference-in-differences strategy to show that the reform increased restaurant profits and the cost of employees, and aggregate price data to estimate the decrease in prices produced by the reform. We compare sit-down restaurants to (a) non-restaurant market services and (b) non-restaurant small firms, and find that prices decreased by around 2 percent, the cost per employee increased by 3. 9 percent and the return to capital increased by around 10 percent. Using these reduced-form estimates we conduct a welfare analysis and find that (1) the effect on consumers was limited, (2) employees shared around 20 percent of the benefit eighteen months after the reform, and 29 percent thirty months after the reform, and (3) the reform mostly benefited capital owners, who received around 50 percent of the tax cut, both in the short-run and in the long-run. The second chapter derives a more general result on the price effect of VAT changes. It shows that prices respond asymmetrically to increases and decreases in VAT. We combine monthly commodity price data with information on value added tax (VAT) rates across several European countries for the period 1996 - 2015 and show that prices respond more to VAT increases than to VAT decreases. We explain this asymmetric pass-through to prices with a simple fairness argument developed in the behavioral economics literature. Our finding cautions against using incidence estimates derived in previous studies without accounting for the direction of the tax change and questions the effectiveness of reductions in VAT to achieve redistribution or stimulate economic growth. The third chapter of the dissertation focuses on a major government spending program in the United States: unemployment insurance (UI). Specifically, I use data on geographic mobility from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and state-year variation in unemployment insurance (UI) laws to evaluate the link between unemployment benefit generosity and mobility decisions of unemployed workers in the United States in the period 2001 - 2012. My empirical strategy uses a proportional hazard model to study whether the probability of moving during the unemployment spell depends on UI benefit generosity. I find that (1) higher UI <b>weekly</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>amounts</b> increase unemployed workers' geographic mobility, (2) the effect is stronger for more liquidity constrained unemployed workers (3) UI <b>weekly</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>amounts</b> are a stronger determinant of unemployed workers' geographic mobility than UI duration. Theoretically, I develop a spatial equilibrium model with risk-averse and liquidity constrained unemployed workers, and explain the empirical findings with the presence of high monetary moving costs...|$|R

50|$|The plan {{provides}} up to {{one year}} of tax-free benefits equal to 55% of the recipient's average gross (pre-tax) income in a recent base period quarter. The minimum benefit is $50 a week and as of January 1, 2017, the upper limit is $1,173 per week. Excluding the current and immediately previous quarter, the base period is the four quarters immediately prior to that. The <b>weekly</b> <b>benefit</b> is 55% of the recipient's average weekly pay during the highest earning quarter in the base period.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} workers' compensation on the time until an injured worker returns to work. Two large increases in the maximum <b>weekly</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>amount</b> in Kentucky am Michigan are examined. The increases raised the benefit amount for high earnings individuals by over sixty percent, while low earnings individuals, who did not earn enough {{to be eligible for}} the old maximum, did not experience a change in their incentives. A comparison of the behavior of pecp 1 e injured the year before the benefit increases to those injured the year after provides an estimate of the effect of higher benefits on injury duration. This use of a "natural experiment" allows us to separate the effect of the level of the benefits from the effect of previous earnings, which is a common difficulty in the analysis of social insurance programs. The analysis uses individual records from a large number of insurance companies. Time out of work increases dramatically for those groups eligible for the higher benefits, while those whose benefits do not change do not experience a change in duration. The estimates suggest large moral hazard effects of higher benefits, with the estimated elasticity of spell duration with respect to benefits of approximately. 3 to. 4. ...|$|E

30|$|UI is a federal-state {{partnership}} providing short-term {{cash benefits}} {{to individuals who}} lose their jobs {{through no fault of}} their own, i.e. either involuntarily or voluntarily with a good cause (e.g. due to illness). Unemployed workers are eligible for UI benefits if they fulfill all monetary and non-monetary requirements. Monetary entitlement requires sufficiently high wage earnings during the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters before the worker files a claim. Non-monetary eligibility criteria concern both the reason for job separation and ongoing claims. <b>Weekly</b> UI <b>benefit</b> formulas specify a minimum and a maximum <b>benefit</b> <b>amount</b> as well as a percentage within these boundaries. The duration of benefits is either set at a fixed level for all UI recipients (nine states), or depends on the total <b>amount</b> of <b>benefits</b> unemployed workers can receive during their eligibility period.
