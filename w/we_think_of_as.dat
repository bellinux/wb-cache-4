We have to use a special type of steel that won't go rusty near to the salt-laden, maritime air of Cardiff Bay. This stainless steel will be made near to Pontypool. For the Wales Millennium Centre I thought it was important that the materials should have a [...] "natural" [...] texture, and that they should be instantly recognisable to anyone seeing them, even from a distance. For this reason I felt it was important that the steel of the shell should have the rough grain and the riveted pattern that <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> more typical of old industrial structures, such as those that used to be commonplace around the landscape of the industrial south. —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E

2500|$|Remark: Some intuition for {{the mean}} ergodic theorem can be {{developed}} by considering the case where complex numbers of unit length are regarded as unitary transformations on the complex plane (by left multiplication). If we pick a single complex number of unit length (which <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> U), it is intuitive that its powers will fill up the circle. Since the circle is symmetric around 0, {{it makes sense that}} the averages of the powers of U will converge to 0. Also, 0 is the only fixed point of U, and so the projection onto the space of fixed points must be the zero operator (which agrees with the [...] limit just described).|$|E
2500|$|The Cuban-born {{art critic}} Ricardo Pau-Llosa {{was an early}} champion, writing: [...] "Ojeda's works, from the onset of his arrival in {{professional}} art circles two years ago, possess an assured, subterranean, yet overpowering spirit of importance. His work is unsettling because, in some mysterious way, beneath the shell of what seems [...] "safe" [...] themes and subject matter, lies an instinctive and intuitive sense of art's most necessary function: the placing of craft {{at the service of}} altering our sense of the real. This Ojeda does without recourse to the cantankerous and gimmicky cult of pseudo-novelty which has characterized North American, and especially New York, art over the last few years. Ojeda does not seek to explode reality, to denote it with the flashy burden of art that is more junk than irreverence. Ojeda undermines, rather than ambushes, the boundaries of what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> real." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2015, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that Android {{will serve as}} Google's future main laptop operating system, with the plan to fold Chrome OS into it by 2017. [...] Google's Sundar Pichai, who led the development of Android, explained that [...] "mobile as a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> desktop today." [...] and back in 2009, Google co-founder Sergey Brin himself said that Chrome OS and Android would [...] "likely converge over time." [...] Lockheimer, who replaced Pichai as head of Android and Chrome OS, responded to this claim with an official Google blog post stating that [...] "While we've been working on ways to bring together {{the best of both}} operating systems, there's no plan to phase out Chrome OS [...] guaranteed auto-updates for five years". That is unlike Android where support is shorter with [...] "EOL dates [...] at least 3 years [...] for Android tablets for education".|$|E

2500|$|The series also {{introduces}} a new character named Singularity, a pocket universe that gains self-consciousness during [...] "Secret Wars".

[...] Wilson also stated that Singularity can act as [...] "a whole world within herself and she can also move between different worlds and dimensions like taking a walk, so she has access to {{all corners of the}} Marvel U in a way that other characters do not." [...] " [...] {{one of the first people}} we have encounter Singularity," [...] Bennett revealed. [...] "So Nico is put in charge of acclimating this character and showing her their civilization and world while trying to save it. Nico is sort of like the grounding human force and the anchor that begins to show Singularity the capacity of human beings, both for good and for evil, so Nico becomes even more invested when she starts to see her homeland through the eyes of this stranger." ...|$|E

6000|$|Examples are {{scarcely}} needed of {{this total}} levity {{on the subject}} of cosmic philosophy. Examples are scarcely needed to show that, whatever else <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> affecting practical affairs, we do not think it matters whether a man is a pessimist or an optimist, a Cartesian or a Hegelian, a materialist or a spiritualist. Let me, however, take a random instance. At any innocent tea-table we may easily hear a man say, [...] "Life is not worth living." [...] We regard it as we regard the statement that it is a fine day; nobody thinks that it can possibly have any serious effect on the man or on the world. And yet if that utterance were really believed, the world would stand on its head. Murderers would be given medals for saving men from life; firemen would be denounced for keeping men from death; poisons would be used as medicines; doctors would be called in when people were well; the Royal Humane Society would be rooted out like a horde of assassins. Yet we never speculate as to whether the conversational pessimist will strengthen or disorganize society; for we are convinced that theories do not matter.|$|E
60|$|There are two {{different}} questions involved when we ask whether matter exists, {{and it is important}} to keep them clear. We commonly mean by 'matter' something which is opposed to 'mind', something which <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> occupying space and as radically incapable of any sort of thought or consciousness. It is chiefly in this sense that Berkeley denies matter; that is to say, he does not deny that the sense-data which we commonly take as signs of the existence of the table are really signs of the existence of something independent of us, but he does deny that this something is non-mental, that it is neither mind nor ideas entertained by some mind. He admits that there must be something which continues to exist when we go out of the room or shut our eyes, and that what we call seeing the table does really give us reason for believing in something which persists even when we are not seeing it. But he thinks that this something cannot be radically different in nature from what we see, and cannot be independent of seeing altogether, though it must be independent of our seeing. He is thus led to regard the 'real' table as an idea in the mind of God. Such an idea has the required permanence and independence of ourselves, without being--as matter would otherwise be--something quite unknowable, in the sense that we can only infer it, and can never be directly and immediately aware of it.|$|E
