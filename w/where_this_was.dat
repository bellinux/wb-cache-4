5|$|The {{following}} list {{contains a}} chronology {{of when the}} various sections of mainline railway lines were electrified. The list excludes industrial and short branch lines, as well as systems installed at ports and yards. The list contains the date when the electrification was taken into regular use on each section. It also notes if a section was opened as an electric railway, and if the line was prepared as an electric line, but <b>where</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not taken into use immediately. The list contains the line and section to be electrified, and its length. The length indicates {{the length of the}} mainline section at the time of electrification. Due to changes of routes and shortening of lines, the current length of sections may be shorter. The sixth column shows the electrification system, including voltage and frequency in case of AC and no frequency in case of DC.|$|E

25|$|On 1 August a ban {{was put on}} all {{cattle in}} the {{prefecture}} Iwate, after 6 cows from two villages were found with heavy levels of caesium. Iwate was the third prefecture <b>where</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> decided. Shipments of cattle and meat would only be allowed after examination, and when the level of caesium was below the regulatory standard. In Iwate some 36,000 cattle were produced in a year.

25|$|The Talmud elaborates on {{the biblical}} {{requirement}} of the husband to provide his wife with clothing, by insisting that each year, he must provide each wife with 50 zuzim's-worth of clothing, including garments appropriate to each season of the year. The Talmudic rabbis insist that this annual clothing gift should include one hat, one belt, and three pairs of shoes (one pair {{for each of the}} three main annual festivals: Passover, Shabu'ot, and Sukkoth). The husband was also expected by the classical rabbis to provide his wife with jewellery and perfumes if he lived in an area <b>where</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> customary. These obligations were waived if the wife wished to provide for herself.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of domestic routes was a contentious political issue. SAS held {{a privilege to}} commence any route they wished, but lacked regional airliners to serve the smaller airports. Norway and Sweden had seen extensive construction of regional and smaller primary airports earlier than in Denmark. In Norway the independent operator Braathens SAFE was allowed to operate {{a majority of the}} domestic services and in Sweden Linjeflyg had been established to fly the larger portion of domestic hauls. This had been met by skepticism in Denmark, <b>where</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> seen as a breach of the agreements establishing the SAS consortium. It also made some Danish politicians call {{for the establishment of a}} Danish domestic carrier.|$|E

25|$|A {{double-track}} tunnel with restricted clearances {{is sometimes}} singled {{to form a}} single track tunnel with more generous clearances, such as the Connaught Tunnel in Canada or the Tickhole Tunnel in New South Wales, Australia. In {{the case of the}} Tickhole Tunnel a new single-track tunnel was built and the two tracks in the original tunnel were replaced by one track in the centreline of the tunnel. Another case <b>where</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> necessary was the Hastings Line in the United Kingdom, where the tunnels were eventually singled to permit the passage of standard British-gauge rolling stock. Before the singling, narrow-bodied stock, specially constructed for the line, had to be used.|$|E
25|$|Tactics {{became even}} more brutal when the Zionists were ready to {{complete}} their occupation of the Galilee in October. By that time the Arab villagers, having seen what had happened elsewhere, had become adamant about staying put {{in their homes and}} on their lands. To frighten them away, the occupying forces started a strategy of planned massacres, which were carried out in Eilabun, Faradiyya, Safsaf, Sa'sa', and other villages. In places <b>where</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not to their advantage for one reason or another, the army would resort to forceful expulsion. I was to wittnes some of these tactics in Rameh a month or so later.|$|E
25|$|Britain's Great Western Railway {{introduced}} the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system in 1906. This {{system is the}} forerunner of today's Automatic Warning System (AWS) and consists of an electrical system that sounded a bell in the cab as the train approached a signal at clear. Power was fed through a metal ramp to a pickup {{on the underside of}} the locomotive to power the bell. An absence of the electrical voltage on the ramp caused a warning horn to sound in the locomotive's cab. The driver then had a set time to acknowledge the warning and start braking his train accordingly. If the driver did not acknowledge the warning, the brakes would be applied automatically. <b>Where</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> implemented, it did away with the need for fog signalling, since the driver could tell the state of the distant signal regardless of his ability to see it.|$|E

25|$|The British were {{concerned}} their production would be inadequate and licensed {{production of the}} Hispano to the US. However, the US production never became satisfactory and the British eventually gave up on the U.S. versions. British production was eventually increased to the point <b>where</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> no longer an issue. The ultimate version of the British wartime Hispanos was the Hispano Mk. V, which had a shorter barrel, and lacked the cocking cylinder thus requiring manual cocking before flight. It was lighter and had {{a higher rate of}} fire (desirable in aircraft armament), although at the expense of some muzzle velocity. The shorter barrel meant that the weapon could be housed within the wing of a fighter plane, reducing drag and making them less vulnerable to freezing and mechanical stress. One of the main British fighters to use the Mk. V was the Hawker Tempest Mk. V Series II, which mounted two cannon in each wing. Ammunition types available included Semi-Armour Piercing, Incendiary (SAPI) and High Explosive, Incendiary (HEI). Around 42,500 Hispano cannon of various Marks were manufactured by Birmingham Small Arms (BSA).|$|E
25|$|Nasser had {{let it be}} known, in 1954â€“55, that he was {{considering}} buying weapons from the Soviet Union {{as a way of}} pressuring the Americans into selling him the arms he desired. Nasser's hope was that {{faced with the prospect of}} Egypt buying Soviet weapons, and thus coming under Soviet influence the Eisenhower administration would be forced to sell Egypt the weapons he wanted. Khrushchev who very much wanted to win the Soviet Union influence in the Middle East, was more than ready to arm Egypt if the Americans proved unwilling. During secret talks with the Soviets in 1955, Nasser's demands for weapons were more than amply satisfied as the Soviet Union had not signed the Tripartite Declaration. The news in September 1955 of the Egyptian purchase of a huge quantity of Soviet arms via Czechoslovakia was greeted with shock and rage in the West, <b>where</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> seen as a major increase in Soviet influence in the Near East. In Britain, the increase of Soviet influence in the Near East was seen as an ominous development that threatened to put an end to British influence in the oil-rich region.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{played in}} the first dozen Masters, through 1948, {{but only in the}} first as a competitor. By then, his health at age 46 had {{declined}} to the stage <b>where</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> no longer possible. With his health difficulties, being past his prime, and not competing elsewhere to stay in tournament form, he never truly contended at the Masters, although his scores were usually respectable. These were almost all ceremonial performances, since his main duty was as host of the event. His extraordinary popularity, efforts with the course design, and tournament organization boosted the profile of the Masters significantly. The tournament, jointly run by Jones and Clifford Roberts, made many important innovations which became the norm elsewhere, such as gallery ropes to control the flow of the large crowds, many scoreboards around the course, the use of red / green numbers on those scoreboards to denote under / over par scores, an international field of top players, high-caliber television coverage, and week-long admission passes for patrons, which became extremely hard to obtain. The tournament also sought and welcomed feedback from players, fans, and writers, leading to continual improvement over the years. The Masters gradually evolved to being {{one of the most respected}} tournaments in the world, one of the four major championships.|$|E

[...] The laws are primarily concerned with religious affairs; only the last four of its twenty-eight chapters do not deal with ecclesiastical affairs. [...] The first clause of the code gives the Church freedom from taxation. [...] Subsequent clauses specify penalties for irregular marriages, heathen worship, work on the sabbath, and breaking fasts, among other things; and also define how members of each class of societyâ€”such as the king, bishops, priests, ceorls, and esnesâ€”can clear themselves by giving an oath. In addition to the focus of the laws themselves, the introduction makes clear the importance of the Church in the legislative process. Bertwald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was present at the assembly which devised the decrees, and so was Gefmund, the Bishop of Rochester; and [...] "every order of the Church of that nation spoke in unanimity with the loyal people".|$|E

The Saxon rule was consolidated under King Ine, who established a fort at Taunton, demolished by his wife in 722. It is sometimes said that he built palaces at Somerton and South Petherton but this does not seem to be the case. He fought against Geraint in 710. In 705 the diocese of Sherborne was formed, taking in Wessex west of Selwood. Saxon kings granted land in Somerset by charter from the 7th century onward. The way and extent to which the Britons survived under the Saxons is a debatable matter. However, King Ine's laws make provision for Britons. Somerset originally formed part of Wessex and latter became a separate [...] "shire". Somersetshire seems to have been formed within Wessex during the 8th century though it is not recorded as a name until later. Mints were set up at times in various places in Somerset in the Saxon period, e.g., Watchet.|$|E
