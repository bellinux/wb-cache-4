25|$|Research {{suggests}} that specific leisure interventions enhance feelings of SWB. This {{is both a}} top-down and bottom-up effect, in that leisure satisfaction causally affects SWB, and SWB causally affects leisure satisfaction. This bi-directional effect is stronger in retired individuals than in working individuals. Furthermore, it appears that satisfaction with our leisure at least partially explains the relationship between our engagement in leisure and our SWB. Broadly speaking, researchers classify leisure into active (e.g. volunteering, socializing, sports and fitness) and passive leisure (e.g. watching television {{and listening to the}} radio). Among older adults, passive leisure activities and personal leisure activities (e.g. sleeping, eating, and bathing) correlate <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of SWB and feelings of relaxation than active leisure activities. Thus, although significant evidence has demonstrated that active leisure is associated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of SWB, or happiness, {{this may not be the}} case with older populations.|$|E

It is often argued that in countries <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of social capital (as measured, for example, by trust, civic norms and membership of community groups) levels of cooperation and altruistic behaviour will be higher. This paper explores whether such altruistic behaviour extends to giving foreign aid. Cross-country data are used to assess whether countries <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of social capital give more foreign aid, as a proportion of GDP, than countries where social capital is lower...|$|R

25|$|Much of the {{research}} regarding happiness and leisure relies on subjective well-being (SWB) as an appropriate measure of happiness. Research has demonstrated {{a wide variety of}} contributing and resulting factors in the relationship between leisure and happiness. These include psychological mechanisms, and the types and characteristics of leisure activities that result in the greatest levels of subjective happiness. Specifically, leisure may trigger five core psychological mechanisms including detachment-recovery from work, autonomy in leisure, mastery of leisure activities, meaning-making in leisure activities, and social affiliation in leisure (DRAMMA). Leisure activities that are physical, relational, and performed outdoors are correlated with greater feelings of satisfaction with free time. Research across 33 different countries shows that individuals who feel they strengthen social relationships and work on personal development during leisure time are happier than others. Furthermore, shopping, reading books, attending cultural events, getting together with relatives, listening to music and attending sporting events is associated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of happiness. Spending time on the internet or watching TV is not associated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of happiness as compared to these other activities.|$|E

Those from families with both parents present, from high socioeconomic backgrounds, who performed better at school, were more religious, who had higher parental expectations, and felt like their parents care, showed lower levels of sexual activity across all age groups in the study (age 13-18). In contrast, those <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of body pride, showed higher levels of sexual activity.|$|E

25|$|Nature {{connectedness}} {{is related}} to subjective well-being and other indicators of positive functioning such as solving a problem in one's life. Subjective well-being is defined as feeling pleasant emotions or having pleasant experiences. To assess well-being, participants complete measures of how often they feel positive emotions (an affective measure), how often they feel negative emotions (an affective measure), and how satisfied they are with their lives (a cognitive measure). Individuals <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of well-being typically indicate that they are satisfied with their lives, feel more positive emotions, and less negative emotions.|$|E

25|$|Differences in {{education}} levels are also highly correlated to PC and Internet access: those <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of education {{are more likely}} to have ICTs at home and/or at work. Education is closely correlated to income, which obviously facilitates the purchase of ICTs and inclusion in the work environment. However, when income levels are taken into account, those with higher educational attainment will have higher rates of access. 91 percent of Chinese Internet users have a high school or above degree. A ZEF study on telephone access in rural China shows that heads of farm households with a primary level of education were more likely to subscribe to telephones than those without any level of education.|$|E

No significant contemporaneous results were found for adults who should have benefited less from the intervention owing to their substantially lower (prior) infection rates. The program nearly eradicated hookworm and would flourish afterward with new funding as the Rockefeller Foundation International Health Division.|$|E
