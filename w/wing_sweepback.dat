5000|$|Like the Pike, {{it was a}} large twin-engined biplane of the then-standard {{wood and}} canvas construction. It had three-bay <b>wings</b> without <b>sweepback,</b> {{dihedral}} or stagger, partly to facilitate wing folding.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a convenient method for calculating the pitching-moment characteristics of tapered <b>wings</b> with <b>sweepback</b> and twist. The method {{is based on}} the fact that the pitching-moment characteristics of a wing may be specified by giving the value of the pitching moment at zero lift and the location of the axis about which the axis is constant. Data for calculating these characteristics are presented by curves which apply to wings having a linear distribution of twist along the span and which cover a large range of aspect ratios. The curves are given for wings having straight taper and distorted elliptical plan forms. The characteristics of wings of other shapes may be determined by interpolation...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} of static and dynamic longitudinal stability both {{at high speeds}} and at low speeds are discussed and data are presented which indicate progress made in the solution of these problems. It is shown that the incorporation of large amounts of sweepback on both the wing and the horizontal tail can significantly increase the Mach number at which critical trim changes and stability changes occur and can greatly reduce the trim changes and stability changes encountered at supercritical speeds. Data are also presented which demonstrate the possibility of obtaining satisfactory longitudinal stability in the landing configuration for <b>wings</b> with <b>sweepback</b> {{of the order of}} 45 deg utilizing various stall control devices. Optimum arrangements for such devices, however, should be determined experimentally...|$|R

50|$|Flying wings lack {{anywhere}} to attach an efficient vertical stabilizer or fin. Any fin must attach directly {{on to the}} rear part of the wing, giving a small moment arm from the aerodynamic center, which in turn means that the fin is inefficient and to be effective the fin area must be large. Such a large fin has weight and drag penalties, and can negate {{the advantages of the}} flying wing. The problem can be minimized by increasing the <b>wing</b> <b>sweepback</b> and placing twin fins outboard near the tips, as for example in a low-aspect-ratio delta wing, but many flying wings have gentler sweepback and consequently have, at best, marginal stability.|$|E
50|$|The Tiger Moth {{might be}} {{confused}} {{at first glance}} with the Belgian-designed Stampe SV.4 aerobatic aircraft which had a very similar design layout; both aircraft made use of a similar main landing gear configuration, a slightly <b>sweepback</b> <b>wing,</b> and an alike engine/cowling design. Several Tiger Moths were converted during the 1950s to a Coupe standard, which involved the installation of a sliding canopy over both crew positions, not unlike the Canadian-built Fleet Finch biplane trainers which had worked beside the Tiger Moth in RCAF service as trainers in Canada during the type's wartime years.|$|R
50|$|Weber's {{subsequent}} {{work with}} Küchemann was {{in improving the}} theory of subsonic aerodynamics. Initial methods treated wing thickness and lift in isolation. In the 1950s, she developed a simultaneous treatment of all the features of a <b>wing</b> (thickness, twist, <b>sweepback,</b> camber) to predict the air pressure distribution over it. The Vickers aircraft team then solved the inverse problem - that of determining the wing shape that best suited a required pressure distribution. The resultant wing shape, the most advanced for a civilian craft, was used on the VC10 airliner.|$|R

50|$|As {{construction}} had proceeded, it {{had been}} decided to change the armament to a single 0.303 Vickers K machine gun in the nose turret and an arrangement of four 0.303 Browning machine guns in the tail. Furthermore, there was {{a change in the}} tail turret to a powered version, Gouge also had to devise a solution for the resulting movement aft of the aircraft's centre of gravity. Following early flight trials with the first prototype, the aircraft was modified with a <b>wing</b> <b>sweepback</b> of 4° 15' via the addition of a spacer into the front spar attachments. This had the effect of repositioning the centre of lift enough to compensate for the changed centre of gravity.|$|E

40|$|In this note, the {{equations}} of the flexural-torsional flutter of a swept wing are established, assuming the wing to be semi-rigid and fixed at the root. The general effect of <b>sweepback,</b> <b>wing</b> stiffness and {{position of the}} inertia axis are determined. The critical speeds for flutter and for wing divergence are determined (i) for incompressible flow (ii) for compressible flow, assuming a modified Glauert correction. The critical flutter speed is in general higher for a sweptback wing having the same wing stiffness as the upswept wing; foe a swept forward wing, divergence will occur before flutter...|$|R
40|$|The {{positions}} of boundary-layer transition were ascertained experimentally for a swept-back wing and a <b>wing</b> without <b>sweepback</b> which were alike {{in all other}} respects and were compared for the same angle of attack (R(sub e) = 5. 6 x 10 (exp 5)). The swept-back wing in a definite range of angle of attack resulted in a backward shift of the transition point on the suction side of the wing. The favorable effect of sweepback on {{the position of the}} transition point is confirmed, consequently. In addition to decreasing the drag at high Mach numbers, the swept-back wing is acknowledged to have additional advantages. These are: (1) Decrease of the pressure drag. The reduction factor is approximately equal to the cosine of the angle of sweepback. (2) Backward shift of the transition point. There are no known experiments which establish experimentally the advantage anticipated. It appeared justifiable, therefore, to carry out some fundamental experiments which might furnish some idea of the magnitude of the advantage expected. Such an experiment is reported in what follows; the advantage of the sweepback appears clearly...|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and computational {{analysis of the}} influence of shocks in transonic flutter phenomena is presented, by studying the interactions between the shocks and the elastic deformations of the wing during flutter. Shocks and the associated mixed subsonic-super-sonic flow at the wing surface are shown to {{have a profound effect on}} the energy exchange between the wing and the airstream and hence on flutter stability. The counterintuitive flut-ter behavior of certain flexible swept wings with changes in dynamic pressure or density altitude can be explained in terms {{of the influence of}} the location and dynamics of the shocks on the stability of the <b>wing.</b> Classical <b>sweepback</b> theory based on linear aerodynamics fails in this case, and it predicts flutter boundary shifts in the opposite direction to what is observed in the present transonic flutter calculations.

It featured a Thomson-CSF Agave radar which, amongst other functions, was essential to launch the Exocet missile. One of the major technical advances of the Super Étendard was its onboard UAT-40 central computer; this managed most mission-critical systems, integrating navigational data and functions, radar information and display, and weapons targeting and controls.|$|R
40|$|Summary. ' Wind-tunnel {{tests to}} {{determine}} the flutter characteristics of a model wing, carrying a localised mass, are described. The investigation covers the effects of <b>wing</b> <b>sweepback,</b> and of the magnitude and position of the localised mass. Consideration is also given {{to the effects of}} pitching radius of gyration and aerodynamic shape. The mass values. used vary from 0 " 13 to 1 - 17 times the wing mass. The test results indicate that the parameters that have the greatest effect on critical flutter speed are mass value, spanwise and chordwise position of the localised mass, and <b>wing</b> <b>sweepback.</b> Radius of gyration and aerodynamic shape of the localised mass are found to be secondary in their effects. It was found that the flutter speed of a wing could be c 6 nsiderably increased or decreased by attaching a localisec~ mass; under certain conditions the flutter speed could be more than doubled. A number of different forms of flutter were obtained in the tests, and the values of the parameters at the transition • from one form of flutter to another provide the main guide to the flutter characteristics of a wing carrying a localised mass. 1. Introduction. [...] Experimental investigations of the flutter characteristics of model wings. carrying localised masses t have been undertaken both in this country and elsewhere in the past.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a need for a high-speed, {{high-lift}} civilian transport. Although unconventional, a flying wing could fly at speeds in excess of Mach 2 and still retain the capacity of a 747. The design of the flying wing is inherently unstable since it lacks a fuselage and a horizontal tail. The project goal was to design, construct, fly, and test a remote-piloted scale model flying wing. The project was completed as part of the NASA/USRA Advanced Aeronautics Design Program. These unique restrictions required us to implement several fundamental design changes from last year's Elang configuration including <b>wing</b> <b>sweepback</b> and wingtip endplates. Unique features such as a single ducted fan engine, composite structural materials, and an electrostatic stability system were incorporated. The result is the Banshee ' 94.

40|$|Summary. The Short SB 5 is a {{low-speed}} research aircraft {{capable of}} operation with <b>wing</b> <b>sweepback</b> angles of 50 °, 60 °, or 69 °, various wing leading-edge configurations, {{and a high}} or low tailplane. Extensive flight measurements {{have been made in}} the 60 ° sweepback, low-tail configuration and these included tests with inboard nose flaps undeflected, with nose flaps deflected 4 ° and 20. 2 °, and with full-span leadingedge droop. Other variations included the incorporation of a small leading-edge notch at 70 per cent semispan, and 20 ° deflection of the trailing-edge flaps. This Report is restricted to consideration of the forces and moments acting on the aircraft and those produced by the control surfaces; fluid motion investigations are to be reported separately.

40|$|The {{supersonic}} biplane is {{well known}} for the airfoil which has zero wave drag at the supersonic speed. However a Mach cone is generated at the wing tip and disturbs the shock wave interaction of the rectangular supersonic biplane with finite span length. The drag increases near the wing tip due to this disturbance. By devising its planar shape, the effect of the wing-tip can be reduced. This paper investigates on the phenomenon of the three-dimensional shock wave interaction for the three-dimensional supersonic biplane with four different kinds of planar shapes using Computational Fluid Dynamics. The drag becomes small when the wing has a small taper ratio, but excessive taper can also lead to more drag than the rectangular wing. When the <b>wing</b> has small <b>sweepback</b> angle and adequate taper ratio, its wing section has better shock wave interaction than that of the two-dimensional supersonic biplane...|$|R
