In 1959, <b>Wonder</b> <b>Where</b> had an {{outstanding}} season, including winning the Canadian Oaks. The horse was voted Canadian Horse of the Year for the year and later, the filly was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. The <b>Wonder</b> <b>Where</b> Stakes was established in honour of the horse in 1965, becoming one of the Canadian Triple Tiara races for fillies in Canada in 1995. After the outstanding year in 1959, Maloney wanted to continue racing <b>Wonder</b> <b>Where</b> and Smythe did not, concerned over some tendon trouble. The horse broke down in a race in Fort Erie, and the partnership dissolved after that.|$|E

25|$|Leavitt {{continued}} {{to publish the}} eponymous almanac after he moved to Meredith. He had already founded a newspaper in 1811, while still living in Gilmanton, which he called The New Hampshire Register, and which he continued publishing for several years (181117). The Register became well-known thanks to Leavitt's habit of printing brief synopses of historical events. On the side, between farming, teaching school, and publishing his newspaper, Leavitt wrote and published at least eight textbooks on mathematics, grammar, astronomy, geography and music, including an edition of Nicolas Pike's widely distributed A New and Complete System of Arithmetic in 1826, {{as well as the}} staple textbooks of teachers across the nation The Scholar's Review and Teacher's Daily Assistant. The scores of textbooks produced by Leavitt, a dizzying array of titles down the years, including Complete Directions for Parsing the English Language; Or, The Rules of Grammar Made Easy: Being a New Grammatical Essay, Designed as a Supplement to Lindley Murray's Grammar, for the Use of Students as Soon as They Begin to Parse, make one <b>wonder</b> <b>where</b> Leavitt found the time.|$|E

500|$|Legendary {{accounts}} {{surround the}} life of Alexander the Great, many deriving from his own lifetime, probably encouraged by Alexander himself. His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in Cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis. Writing shortly after Alexander's death, another participant, Onesicritus, invented a tryst between Alexander and Thalestris, queen of the mythical Amazons. When Onesicritus read this passage to his patron, Alexander's general and later King Lysimachus reportedly quipped, [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>where</b> I was at the time." ...|$|E

500|$|The main titles were {{designed}} by Nick Livesey, {{a graduate of the}} Royal College of Art who worked for one of Scott's production companies in London. The sequence, shot in Florence by Livesey himself was intended as the film's second promotional trailer. The studio thought it not [...] "quite right", but it remained on Scott's mind and would eventually end up as the main title sequence. Livesey would gather footage of pigeons in an empty square in Florence early one morning which, in the final cut, would morph into the face of Hannibal Lecter. Scott believed it a good idea, as it fundamentally asked the question: 'Where is Hannibal Lecter?' Scott explains: [...] "And of course this story tells it, with pigeons in the cobblestones of somewhere, where you <b>wonder</b> <b>where</b> that is...and there he is his face appears." [...] The titles are said to have been influenced by the film Seven.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{during the}} 1950s and 1960s {{generally}} regarded the Elegy as powerful, and emphasised its place {{as one of}} the great English poems. In 1955, R. W. Ketton-Cremer argued, [...] "At the close of his greatest poem Gray was led to describe, simply and movingly, what sort of man he believed himself to be, how he had fared in his passage through the world, and what he hoped for from eternity." [...] Regarding the status of the poem, Graham Hough in 1953 explained, [...] "no one has ever doubted, but many have been hard put to it to explain in what its greatness consists. It is easy to point out that its thought is commonplace, that its diction and imagery are correct, noble but unoriginal, and to <b>wonder</b> <b>where</b> the immediately recognizable greatness has slipped in." [...] Following in 1963, Martin Day argued that the poem was [...] "perhaps the most frequently quoted short poem in English." [...] Frank Brady, in 1965, declared, [...] "Few English poems have been so universally admired as Gray's Elegy, and few interpreted in such widely divergent ways." [...] Patricia Spacks, in 1967, focused on the psychological questions in the poem and claimed that [...] "For these implicit questions the final epitaph provides no adequate answer; perhaps this is one reason why it seems not entirely a satisfactory conclusion to the poem." [...] She continued by praising the poem: [...] "Gray's power as a poet derives largely from his ability to convey the inevitability and inexorability of conflict, conflict by its nature unresolvable." [...] In 1968, Herbert Starr pointed out that the poem was [...] "frequently referred to, with some truth, as the best known poem in the English language." ...|$|E
500|$|While still {{rooted in}} pop punk, Blink-182 finds the band {{expanding}} their sonic template with darker, restless songs. The compositions {{on the record}} {{have been described as}} musically diverse and [...] "borderline experimental," [...] with sullen moodiness and off-kilter hooks the basis for many tracks. The record pulls from a variety of styles, including electronic rock, jangle pop, and [...] "reflective" [...] alternative rock. Experimentation was constantly present: the band tried different mic techniques and toyed with harmonium organs, Polynesian Gamelan bells, [...] and turntables. The band infused these experimentalist elements into their usual pop punk sound, inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side-projects (Box Car Racer and Transplants.) In a full article about the album in the November 20, 2003 edition of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Ben Wener described the music of the album as [...] "expansive, downcast, and sometimes spectral." [...] The New York Times considered that the album may have been influenced by the growing popularity of emo pop, while AllMusic regarded it a delve into post-punk. [...] "Much of the punk has been dissolved, the buzzsaw guitars faded into the corners, allowing room for staggering dynamics, cathartic guitar bursts and a weightier, more experimental and ambitious sound", wrote Tom Bryant of Kerrang!. The goal for Blink-182 was continuity: each song develops lyrically like chapters in a book, and songs segue into one another to present a cohesive feel instead of a regular collection of tracks. [...] In addition to the side-projects, the music of the album was inspired by the September 11 attacks and the onset of the Iraq War. The mood was unsettling for DeLonge, whose brother is a Navy officer: [...] "It was so weird because we'd all be glued to the TV, watching these bombs explode over another country. So I'd see all this and <b>wonder</b> <b>where</b> he was at, and then we'd have to go into the next room and sing or finish writing lyrics. I think it affected our moods throughout the day." [...] In addition, it was just inspired by socializing: [...] "We would just hang out for hours talking. It was really cool", said DeLonge.|$|E

2500|$|Musicologist David Carr {{explains}} how many individuals {{have sought to}} develop secular or [...] "religiously untethered" [...] senses of spirituality through the spiritual power of music. Forms of artistic expression, such as painting and music, are said to evoke a sense of awe and <b>wonder,</b> <b>where</b> the individual is temporarily transported to another dimension far-removed from the trivialities of everyday existence. Musician and theologian June Boyce-Tillman emphasizes how music [...] "takes us out of 'everyday' consciousness with its concerns for food, clothing and practical issues" [...] and moves us into a self-transcending experience. For many SBNRs, music has become {{the basis of their}} spirituality as opposed to a partner to it.|$|E

2500|$|Discussing the {{influence}} aesthetic for Shadows of the Sun and {{the influence}} of chamber music, Rygg commented, “There's no specific aesthetic other than a sense of the beautiful itself, I suppose. There's a connection to classical composition, that's pretty obvious. Some Wagner transpositions. Some Schumann warped beyond recognition etc. in there. [...] "Funebre" [...] is largely based on one single bar off Wagner and we have that little Chopin signature thrown in there as well. So yeah, even though we use fewer notes, the classical stamp is all over the record. Beach Boys? It's probably the vocal thing, that I am fond of clean-sung, layered, well-produced vocals and harmonies. That's another rarity these days.

2500|$|Many people <b>wonder</b> <b>where</b> the Xs came from, and {{how were}} they ever used on beer. [...] In truth, the three Xs are {{actually}} a quality rating system. [...] The system was initially used in Europe during the 16th Century. [...] As European royalty traveled their lands and visited neighboring counties, a royal courier was sent ahead of the official party. [...] The courier’s job was to sample beer at inns along the way. [...] If the beer was only average, the courier would mark the inn’s sign or door with a single X. [...] If the inn’s beer was deemed good, the sign or door would receive two Xs. [...] A mark on an inn of three Xs meant that the beer inside was excellent, and a must-stop for the royal court as they passed through.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{measures}} {{have been taken to}} try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President Ronald Reagan introduced the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987. This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, [...] "During her education, she [...] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act.

2500|$|In a March 2016 {{interview}} with ABC Managing Director Mark Scott, Media Watch host Paul Barry examined {{the question of}} perceptions of left wing bias at the ABC. Scott noted that while perhaps the ABC was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices, he did not accept the criticism of bias because [...] "a lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and they <b>wonder</b> <b>where</b> are the strong right wing commentators on the ABC. We don't {{do that kind of}} journalism. We don't ask questions about our journalists' voting pattern and where their ideology are. We look at the journalism that they put to air and we have strong editorial standards..." [...] Following the interview, conservative ABC critic Andrew Bolt wrote [...] "How can the man heading our biggest media organisation be so blind to the ABC's unlawful and dangerous Leftist bias?" [...] while former Media Watch host Jonathan Holmes wrote for The Age that this interview indicated that ABC management had failed to recognise a clear problem of left wing bias among some capital city radio presenters.|$|E
2500|$|Alcohol was {{strictly}} forbidden during rehearsals and recording, so the cast fortified themselves with milk. The milk {{in turn was}} fortified with brandy. In later episodes the catchphrase [...] "round the back for the old brandy!" [...] or [...] "the old Marlon Brando" [...] was used to announce the exit {{of one or more}} characters, or a break for music.

2500|$|Following {{the series}} in England, Baig was {{included}} in the Indian squad for the home series against Australia later that year. In the second Test at Kanpur, he scored 19 and 36 runs in both the innings. The match marked India's first Test victory against Australia. In the first innings of the next match at Bombay, he scored 50 and was involved in a crucial 133-run partnership with Nari Contractor. Baig followed that with another half-century in the second innings when he made 58. His half-centuries were helped India secure a draw. During a break in India's second innings, when Baig walked to the pavilion along with Ramnath Kenny, he was kissed on his cheek by a young woman spectator, becoming the first Indian cricketer to be kissed on the field. Vijay Merchant who was commentating then remarked [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>where</b> all these enterprising young ladies were when I was scoring my hundreds and two hundreds." [...] A painting called [...] "The Kissing of Abbas Ali Baig", depicting the incident was featured in Salman Rushdie’s novel The Moor's Last Sigh (1995).
