Anger toward the governor grew {{to the point}} that on August 15, Mecham's appearance at Sun Devil Stadium before an exhibition NFL game resulted in cries of [...] "Recall! Recall!" [...] combined with catcalls. By mid-September, <b>signatures</b> in excess <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minimum required had been collected at roadside locations despite the 115 °F (46 °C) afternoon heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arizona summer. <b>Signature</b> collection continued for the full 120-day period allowed for by state law. On November 2, the recall committee turned in 32,401 petitions containing 388,988 <b>signatures</b> (more than <b>the</b> 343,913 votes Mecham had received during his election). After <b>the</b> Secretary <b>of</b> State's office received the petitions, Mecham refused to <b>waive</b> verification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>signatures,</b> forcing <b>the</b> petitions to be sent to the counties for verification. On January 26, 1988, Secretary of State Rose Mofford reported to Mecham that 301,032 signatures had been verified—a quantity sufficient to force a recall election. A recall election was scheduled for May 17, 1988, and former Republican Congressman John Rhodes agreed to run against Mecham.|$|R

The Mishnah taught that rice, millet, poppy seed, sesame, and legumes are exempt from challah (for though they are sometimes made into dough, they are not capable of leavening), as are less than five-fourths of a kav, or about 3½ pounds (the minimum subject to challah) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five kinds <b>of</b> grain subject to challah. Sponge-biscuits, honey cakes, dumplings, pancakes, and dough made from a mixture of consecrated and unconsecrated grain are also exempt from challah.|$|R

40|$|Biometric based {{personal}} {{identification is}} {{a reliable and}} widely accepted method for authentication. Human 3 D signature is distinct from other biometric authentication methods due to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> third dimensional hidden information. In this paper, a new model for on-line 3 D signature verification using multiple parameters is proposed. The parameters considered from human signature namely, velocity, acceleration, pressure, direction, pen ups/downs, total time taken, length and depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> are unique for each person. The proposed model highlights the third dimensional distinctive parameter, depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> for its hidden information. Curve fitting is performed on the points obtained from different non-linearly spaced layers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> pad. <b>The</b> best fitted curves from all the layers and other signature parameters are used in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> verification <b>of</b> 3 D <b>signature.</b> <b>The</b> digital multi-parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3 D <b>signature</b> are further encrypted with cryptographic algorithms to protect from cryptanalysis.

40|$|In these notes, we wish {{to provide}} an {{introduction}} to <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> method, focusing on its basic theoretical properties and recent numerical applications. The notes are split into two parts. The first part focuses on the definition and fundamental properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> a path, or <b>the</b> path <b>signature.</b> We have aimed for a minimalistic approach, assuming only familiarity with classical real analysis and integration theory, and supplementing theory with straightforward examples. We have chosen to focus in detail on <b>the</b> principle properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> which we believe are fundamental to understanding its role in applications. We also present an informal discussion on some of its deeper properties and briefly mention <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> in rough paths theory, which we hope {{could serve as a}} light introduction to rough paths for the interested reader. <b>The</b> second part <b>of</b> these notes discusses practical applications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> path <b>signature</b> to <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> machine learning. <b>The</b> <b>signature</b> approach represents a non-parametric way for extraction of characteristic features from data. The data are converted into a multi-dimensional path by means of various embedding algorithms and then processed for computation of individual terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> which summarise certain information contained in <b>the</b> data. <b>The</b> <b>signature</b> thus transforms raw data into a set of features which are used in machine learning tasks.
