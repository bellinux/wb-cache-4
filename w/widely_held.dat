5|$|An air well {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a dew pond. A dew pond is an artificial pond intended for watering livestock. The name dew pond (sometimes cloud pond or mist pond) derives from the <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> belief that the pond was filled by moisture from the air. In fact, dew ponds are primarily filled by rainwater.|$|E
5|$|From 10 July 1925 {{to the end}} of his life, Meher Baba {{maintained}} silence, communicating {{by means}} of an alphabet board or by unique hand gestures. With his mandali (circle of disciples), he spent long periods in seclusion, during which time he often fasted. He also traveled <b>widely,</b> <b>held</b> public gatherings and engaged in works of charity with lepers, the poor and the mentally ill.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Direct Doxastic Voluntarism — {{the notion}} that we have direct (un-mediated) {{voluntary}} control over our beliefs — has <b>widely</b> been <b>held</b> to be false. There are, however, two ways to interpret the impossibility of our having doxastic control: as either a conceptual/logical/metaphysical impossibility or as a psychological impossibility...|$|R
5|$|Goldschmidt {{declined}} {{to run for}} re-election in 1990, despite the <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> perception {{that he could have}} been easily re-elected; at the time, he cited marital difficulties. Bernie Giusto, who was Goldschmidt's driver at the start of his term and later became Multnomah County Sheriff, was widely rumored to be romantically involved with Goldschmidt's wife Margie (and would later date her openly after they divorced).|$|E
5|$|Like many ancient {{medicinal}} plants (Pliny the Elder describes {{it in his}} Naturalis Historia), great mullein was linked to witches, although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> to ward off curses and evil spirits. The seeds contain several compounds (saponins, glycosides, coumarin, rotenone) that are toxic to fish, and {{have been widely used}} as piscicide for fishing.|$|E
5|$|Stossel's {{news reports}} and {{writings}} attempt to debunk popular beliefs. His Myths and Lies series of 20/20 specials challenges {{a range of}} <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> beliefs. He also hosted The Power of Belief (October 6, 1998), an ABC News Special that focused on assertions of the paranormal and people's desire to believe. Another report outlined the belief that opposition to DDT is misplaced and that the ban on DDT {{has resulted in the}} deaths of millions of children, mostly in poor nations.|$|E

5|$|The {{actions of}} both commanders have been {{extensively}} analyzed in this action. While Montcalm performed well during the battle, some tactical options escaped his notice, {{and some of}} his actions in preparing the defenses at Carillon are open to question. In contrast, almost everything Abercrombie did has been questioned. It is <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> among historians that he was an incompetent commander.|$|E
5|$|The modern post-industrial era in {{advertising}} {{was one of}} reaffirming <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> social values, such as heterosexuality and the middle-class, while neglecting alternative values or lifestyles. The advertising industry was conservative and did not deviate from images that were socially acceptable. Some countries, such as Japan, continue to present the family stereotypically, especially in their television advertisements. In the past decade, however, many advertising agencies have begun to more accurately capture reality and the diversity of lifestyles and family types of consumers.|$|E

He also disputed a <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> belief that Moon drove a Lincoln Continental into the hotel's swimming pool, as claimed by the drummer in a 1972 Rolling Stone interview.|$|E
40|$|Cheating is an {{important}} area for educational research, {{not only because it}} reduces the [...] consequential validity of assessment results, but also because it is anathema to <b>widely</b> [...] <b>held</b> public principles of equity and truthfulness (see Cizek, 1999 for a comprehensive [...] review of the topic). Moreover, modern education is centred on numerous situations that [...] really depend upon a student's honesty.

5|$|Although Carabane {{was once}} a {{regional}} capital, the village has since become so politically isolated {{from the rest of}} the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The indigenous population was originally animist, but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies.|$|E
5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five loops has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the B flat major chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E
5|$|In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle {{suggested}} that nature abhors a vacuum, a principle that {{became known as}} the horror vacui. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space. Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the West it was <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> for many centuries that space could not be empty. As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled.|$|E

Writing for music website AllMusic, Mark Deming {{described}} Vincebus Eruptum as [...] "a glorious celebration of rock & roll primitivism run through enough Marshall amps to deafen an army", praising the band's [...] "sound and fury" [...] {{as one of}} the founding movements of heavy metal. Pitchfork reviewer Alexander Linhardt gave the album nine out of a maximum ten points, noting that the album was less structured than its successor, Outsideinside. It has also been described by Billboard as [...] "the epitome of psychedelic rock".|$|R

5|$|In Original Stories, Wollstonecraft {{employed}} the then-burgeoning genre of children's literature {{to promote the}} education of women and an emerging middle-class ideology. She argued that women {{would be able to}} become rational adults if they were educated properly as children, which was not a <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> belief in the 18th century, and contended that the nascent middle-class ethos was superior to the court culture represented by fairy tales and to the values of chance and luck found in chapbook stories for the poor. Wollstonecraft, in developing her own pedagogy, also responded to the works of the two most important educational theorists of the 18th century: John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E
5|$|On March 15, Washington defused the Newburgh {{situation}} by {{giving a speech}} to the officers. Congress ordered the Army officially disbanded in April 1783. In the same month, Congress passed a new measure for a twenty-five-year impost—which Hamilton voted against—that again required the consent of all the states; it also approved a commutation of the officers' pensions to five years of full pay. Rhode Island again opposed these provisions, and Hamilton's robust assertions of national prerogatives in his previous letter were <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> to be excessive.|$|E
5|$|Since the 18th century, {{people have}} become {{increasingly}} concerned about the welfare of farm animals. Possible measures of welfare include longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom from disease, and freedom from immunosuppression. Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly {{in line with the}} most <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> position in the western world, a form of utilitarianism: that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and that the benefits to humans outweigh the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that animals have rights, should not be regarded as property, and should never be used by humans.|$|E

5|$|The {{indigenous}} population was originally animist, {{but while the}} fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% {{of the population of}} Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from Dakar, many of whom were Muslim.|$|E
5|$|The sitter is unknown, {{although}} some art historians have speculated on her identity. On {{the grounds of}} similarity of facial features, writer Wilhelm Stein suggested in the early 20th century {{that she might be}} Marie de Valengin, the illegitimate daughter of Philip the Good of Burgundy. However, this is a contentious assertion and not <b>widely</b> <b>held.</b> Because her hands are shown as resting on the painting's lower frame, art historians generally accept that this was an independent portrait, rather than a devotional work. It is possible that it was intended as a pendant to a picture of the woman's husband, however no other portrait has been suggested as a likely companion.|$|E
5|$|Following the McIntosh-Prescott Report, which {{indicated}} the long-term faults {{with the class}} that still required solving, successful {{efforts were made to}} bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was implemented to provide up-to-date information on the submarines to the media, to improve the public perception of the class by providing factual information on the status of the project and responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, <b>widely</b> <b>held</b> within the RAN, that the Collins-class boats would be like any other vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, and with all the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal in ensuring that the boats were at an operational standard.|$|E

5000|$|Children’s motor {{development}} generally {{follows the}} pattern of sitting (around 6 months), crawling (around 9 months) and walking (around 10 - 16 months), with high normal variability in the ages at which various milestones are reached. [...] The early gait of young new-walking children is distinguished from that of an older child or adult by many features: shortened stride, feet <b>held</b> <b>widely</b> apart, arms <b>held</b> up (‘high guard’ assisting balance), apparent sway (coronal plane), and rapid steps (high cadence). More mature gait includes body rotations (transverse plane), longer stride, and lowered arm swing, all of which increase both speed and energy efficiency. Mature gait patterns generally develop around 3 years of age, but again there is a range of normal variation (2 to 6 years).Walking or bipedal gait is usually assessed clinically {{unless there is a}} neuromuscular condition, such as cerebral palsy. Laboratory based gait analysis can be very useful for planning treatment regimes, especially surgical management, but also the effects of ankle-foot-orthoses (AFO’s) and footwear.|$|R
