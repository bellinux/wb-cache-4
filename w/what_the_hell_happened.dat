500|$|For {{the filming}} of the chestburster scene, the cast members knew that the {{creature}} would be bursting out of Hurt, and had seen the chestburster puppet, but {{they had not been}} told that fake blood would also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and squibs. The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest a stream of blood shot directly at Veronica Cartwright, shocking her enough that she fell over and went into hysterics. According to Tom Skerritt: [...] "What you saw on camera was the real response. She had no idea <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>happened.</b> All of a sudden this thing just came up." [...] The creature then runs off-camera, an effect accomplished by cutting a slit in the table for the puppeteer's stick to go through and passing an air hose through the puppet's tail to make it whip about.|$|E
500|$|Charles Onyett from IGN applauded Gravity Bone, {{saying that}} it is [...] "a game that appears to toy with the notions of heroism and villainy, and the ways the player {{identifies}} with, and is directed toward, both roles." [...] He praised all aspects of the game, commenting, [...] "the cohesiveness of its striking visual presentation, soundtrack and effects, and almost entirely incomprehensible story combine to create an atmosphere of peculiar strength." [...] Onyett concluded his preview of the game by stating, [...] "it's a pleasure to experience, and never ceases to delight and surprise over its short run." [...] Anthony Burch from Destructoid gave a positive review, stating that it [...] "is so stylistically unified, so consistently cool and weird and imaginative, that it's damn near impossible not to fall in love withâ€”even as the game ends and you're wondering <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>happened,</b> and why." [...] He also applauded several technical and design aspects of the game, expressing appreciation for the game's [...] "stylistic choices", as well as the [...] "nigh unbelievable" [...] bloom effects featured in the game. Burch concluded that Gravity Bone is [...] "a great ride", and that the [...] "atmosphere and style alone will barrel you through to the journey's end, which comes all too soon." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of [...] (2009), the Hub is {{destroyed}} and Torchwood relocate to London as fugitives. Torchwood itself is later destroyed {{by the end of}} the serial. Fans were left asking the fate of, among other things, the Rift. The [...] of Torchwood relocates primarily to the United States. When asked in an interview with SFX magazine, Davies stated [...] "I like to think that when [...] Steven Moffat so thoughtfully closed all those cracks in the universe, the Rift in Cardiff closed up at the same time. I used to wonder <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>happened</b> to that Rift and now it's all solved. When I watched those cracks seal up I was like, 'Oh, thank you.'" [...] This refers to the events of the 2010 Doctor Who episode [...] "The Big Bang", which was written by Steven Moffat. However, Torchwood media in 2011 since provided a direct explanation for the Rift. In the radio drama [...] "The House of the Dead", Jack visits a haunted location where the Rift allows ghosts, including the deceased Ianto Jones, to enter into the living world. To close the Rift forever and seal an ancient evil on the other side of it, Jack creates a device designed to seal the Rift. The device will also provide Jack an end to his cycle of resurrections. However, Ianto's spirit tricks Jack into leaving, and detonates the device himself, closing the Rift [...] "forever" [...] and with it the barrier between the living and the dead.|$|E

You don't think to poke fun at bad special effects, sets or performances. You're just waiting to see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> will <b>happen</b> next." ...|$|R
5000|$|Roeg's {{films are}} known for having scenes and images from the plot {{presented}} in a disarranged fashion, out of chronological and causal order, requiring the viewer {{to do the work}} of mentally rearranging them to comprehend the storyline.

[...] This is also the strategy of Richard Lester's 1968 film Petulia, which was Roeg's last film as a cinematographer only.|$|R
5000|$|MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, [...] "I'm {{not going}} to say that Grimm has jumped the shark with this latest {{expansion}} of WTF world-building, but I'm definitely laughing and I can't stop and I'm not taking this show seriously anymore. I can't. Serious Grimm had a good run, but the transformation into quirky comic book theatrics and silliness is complete. And that's okay. There's a place for rubber masks, iffy CGI, and loads and loads of cheese. Batcrap craziness has always been Grimms bread and butter, even when the series decided to try on the 'grown-up' pants and dabble in deep and meaningful symbolism and real-world parallels. Grimm still seems to think of itself as some kind of fantastical mirror to the real world and I guess in a way it still is. Sometimes I don't know <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> is <b>happening</b> in real life, just like I haven't been able to make heads or tails or fangs or claws of what's going on in Grimms Portland this season." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{match was}} played in hot, dry and blustery {{conditions}} {{in front of}} 116,956 spectators, the fourth-largest crowd in VFL/AFL history. Richmond rover Kevin Bartlett, a renowned finals performer, was prominent early, gathering kicks at will. The first key incident in the match occurred at the 4-minute mark of the quarter. Carlton captain-coach John Nicholls, who had masterminded Richmond's demise in the previous year's Grand Final, was coming out to mark a long kick from Alex Jesaulenko when he was sensationally felled with a high shirtfront by Richmond defender Laurie Fowler, who was running back with the flight of the ball. Fans and players were stunned {{at the sight of}} one of football's most imposing figures laying groggy on the ground and unable to rise. Teammate David McKay reflected thus on the incident: To see someone who was a colossus knocked out like that really stung. He was such an enormous presence on the ground as a leader that we thought, [...] "Shit, what's going to happen now?" ... You could talk to any player from that day and they'd tell you we were stunned. I'm not saying that was the reason Richmond won on the day, but we were starting to think twice about <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> was <b>happening</b> out there. The impact of that incident still resonates decades later, and has been replayed on television many times since. As Fowler recalled of that incident a few years later:I was keyed up at the time and all I remember is that I had my eyes on the ball. If Nick had run through me the whole thing would have been forgotten. Nicholls lay motionless for at least three minutes, whilst being attended to by trainers. He was awarded a 15-yard penalty, and scored a goal from the free kick, but suffered double vision and had no impact {{for the remainder of the}} match.|$|R
