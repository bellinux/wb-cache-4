5|$|A {{new article}} about the Turk did not turn up until 1899, when The American Chess Magazine {{published}} {{an account of the}} Turk's match with Napoleon Bonaparte. The story <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> <b>a</b> review of previous accounts, and a substantive published account would not appear until 1947, when Chess Review published articles by Kenneth Harkness and Jack Straley Battell that amounted to a comprehensive history and description of the Turk, complete with new diagrams that synthesized information from previous publications. Another article written in 1960 for American Heritage by Ernest Wittenberg provided new diagrams describing how the director sat inside the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Gautier was not {{satisfied}} with this story. It <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> <b>a</b> succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, {{a man who had}} written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in Giselle. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the ZX Spectrum+ {{started in}} June 1984, {{and it was}} {{released}} in October the same year. This 48KB Spectrum (development code-name TB) introduced a new QL-style case with an injection-moulded keyboard and a reset button that <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> <b>a</b> switch that shorted across the CPU reset capacitor. Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48KB model. It was possible {{to change the system}} boards between the original case and the Spectrum+ case. It retailed for £179.95. A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was available. Early on, the machine outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more usual 5–6% for the older model.|$|E

5|$|The {{most popular}} of these among the wealthy {{patrons of the}} day was the four-volume Vitruvius Britannicus by Colen Campbell. Campbell was both an {{architect}} and a publisher. The book <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> <b>a</b> book of design containing architectural prints of British buildings, which had been inspired by the great architects from Vitruvius to Palladio; at first mainly those of Inigo Jones, but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by Campbell and other 18th-century architects. These four books greatly contributed to Palladian architecture becoming established in 18th-century Britain. Their three authors became the most fashionable and sought after architects of the era. Due to his book Vitruvius Britannicus, Colen Campbell was chosen as the architect for banker Henry Hoare I's Stourhead house (illustration above), a masterpiece that became the inspiration for dozens of similar houses across England.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> <b>a</b> típica, or wind orchestra, which was {{sometimes}} augmented to 100 players for special occasions such as fiestas.|$|E
25|$|While the {{previous}} Warring States era {{was one of}} constant warfare, it was also considered {{the golden age of}} free thought. Qin Shi Huang eliminated the Hundred Schools of Thought which incorporated Confucianism and other philosophies. After the unification of China, with all other schools of thought banned, legalism became the endorsed ideology of the Qin dynasty, which <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> <b>a</b> system that required the people to follow the laws or be punished accordingly.|$|E
25|$|In America she <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> <b>a</b> novelty act, and she rejoined Diaghilev in 1916, {{dancing with}} the Ballets Russes, and her former partner Vaslav Nijinsky, in New York and later in London. She {{first came to the}} {{attention}} of Londoners in The Good-humoured Ladies in 1918, and followed this with a raucous performance with Léonide Massine in the Can-Can of La Boutique fantasque. When her marriage to Barrocchi broke down in 1919, the dancer abruptly disappeared for a time, as she had done before in America.|$|E

25|$|In October 1960, a new model, The Frisky Prince {{was shown}} at the Earls Court Motor Show. This <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> <b>a</b> re-bodied Family Three with front hung doors. Around the same time, a deal was done with a company called Middlesbrough Motorcraft and kits to build your own Frisky became {{available}} from them. Anthony Brindle, who had become joint managing director of Frisky Cars {{took part in a}} publicity run attempting to visit five European capitals, Paris, Luxembourg, Brussels, Amsterdam and London not spending more than £5 on fuel.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{no changes}} {{were made to the}} text, it <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> <b>a</b> remake of the 5th with very minor updates. All in all, the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions are {{virtually}} the same as each other. Rather than revising the main text of the encyclopedia with each edition, Constable chose to add all updates to the supplement. It's probable that the 6th edition only exists because of the need to remove the long s, which had gone out of style, from the font, which required the whole encyclopedia to be re-typeset.|$|E
25|$|His form in England {{assured him}} of a Test place {{in the next few}} games. After scoring a pair against Australia in the Kanpur Test, Sharma scored his first Test hundred in the very next match. He could have scored another in the next Test at Calcutta, but with 3.4 overs still left {{before the end of the}} Test, he appealed against light. Through the 1979–80 season, Sharma played a series of steady but unexceptional innings where he often played a {{supportive}} role to a senior batsman. He <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> <b>a</b> defensive batsman but could hit very hard when needed.|$|E

25|$|The lack {{of trained}} {{military}} {{was one of}} the most pressing difficulties of the revolutionary government in Buenos Aires. Besides the Patricios Regiment and other corps formed during the British invasions, the only troops with some experience were the Blandengues, lancers militia recruited to patrol the borders of the territories still controlled by indigenous people (mapuche and ranquel). Until 1812, with the arrival of veterans from the Napoleonic Wars, that would join as officers, the army <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> <b>a</b> militia. Most of the commanders were civilians or junior officers, put in charge more for their political leanings, status in society or charisma than for their military capacity.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{the nobility}} grew from wealthier or more {{powerful}} {{members of the}} peasantry, those who were capable of assigning work or wealth to provide the requisite cavalrymen. In Finland, there never existed outright serfdom. Hence, nobility <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> <b>a</b> class of well-off citizens, not owners of other human beings. In the Middle Ages {{and much of the}} modern age, nobles and other wealthy men were landowners, as well as lords of villeins and servants. Members of the nobility utilized their economic power and sometimes also other powers to have smaller farmowners sell their lands to manor lords, so landowning centralized gradually more {{in the hands of the}} noble class.|$|E
25|$|His last commercially {{available}} project, Papa Woody, {{was released in}} 1996 under the name Ether Bunny, although it <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> <b>a</b> solo effort. Serving as his personal tribute to the cartoon and jazz music, Vahnke claims to have been more satisfied with his work on Papa Woody than on any Vampire Rodents album. A collaboration with Athan Maroulis called Alchemia, later renamed Obsidian, was planned for release in 1997 but never came into fruition. The overall project {{was described as a}} SBC and LTG approach to The Blue Nile with string orchestra. Also, a completely instrumental Vampire Rodent album was completed the same year, but like the Alcemia/Obsidian project was shelved indefinitely.|$|E
