50|$|Hidalgo was {{the most}} common of these:Originally all the nobles in the <b>Western</b> <b>Peninsular</b> Christian Realms were hidalgos and, as cristianos viejos, held nearly {{exclusive}} right to privileged status (although there were some Jews and Muslims recognized as hidalgos, who shared their privilege to bear arms as knights in the mesnada real). The first of the kings of Pamplona and Asturias were originally elected and lifted up on a shield to assume Princeps inter Pares status, by these otherwise untitled nobles. For approximately three hundred years the hidalgos retained this privilege, only a few of them eventually being granted the non-heritable title of Comes#Medieval usages. Unlike Spain's later titled nobles, the early hidalgo did not necessarily possess or receive any fief or land grant. Many were as poor as commoners, although they were tax-exempt and could join the civil service or the army.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, Malaysia {{produced}} almost 63,000 tons of tin, {{accounting for}} 31% of world's output. Tin deposit spreads across <b>western</b> <b>Peninsular</b> Malaysia, particularly the Kinta Valley in Perak. In 1883, Malaysia {{was the largest}} tin producer in the world. In 1885, 12.8 km of railway was constructed connecting Taiping to Port Weld in Perak. The first trunk road in Peninsular Malaysia was constructed passing through major mining towns in Perak, Selangor and Negeri Sembilan {{in which it was}} mostly used to transport tin from mines to ports. In the 1920s, dredging machines were introduced to boost the production of tin. Starting from the 1980s, tin mining in Malaysia experienced sharp decline due to competition from Brazil and the falling of tin price. In 1989, the Malaysian Tin Products Manufacturers' Association was established to promote and protect the downstream business of tin industry in the country.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} what deformed the inherited Bentong-Raub suture zone in <b>western</b> <b>Peninsular</b> Malaysia, a detailed field {{study in the}} area around Kuala Lumpur was conducted focussing on the various structural, metamorphic and kinematic features of the Bentong-Raub Zone and the surrounding Western- and Central Belts. The in-depth knowledge on large-scale structures and the tectonic origin of the study area was used to develop a tectonic model for the evolution of western Malaysia. Four deformation phases were recognized in the field, of which the most prominent one, D 1, is a progressive deformation phase comprising two foliations, two folding geometries and coeval shear, and can be related to NE-SW shortening. Presumably, this deformation corresponds to accretionary wedge formation during northward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean beneath Indochina. Burial of sediments in this accretionary wedge led to the growth of biotite, muscovite, chlorite, garnet, quartz and feldspar under greenschist facies metamorphic conditions. Sedimentation and subsequent deformation and burial-related sub-greenschist facies metamorphism of a Triassic forearc basin recorded a second deformation event D 2. Intrusion of the Triassic S-type Main Range Granites caused contact metamorphism in the surrounding metasediments and was followed by steep normal faulting (D 3) and a later, regional strike-slip shearing event (D 4). The combined effect of D 3 and D 4 is thought to have {{played a major role in}} the exhumation of <b>western</b> <b>Peninsular</b> Malaysia during Paleogene times. It is also suggested that this shear is related to Eocene formation of offshore sedimentary basins due to Indian-Eurasian collision and subsequent clockwise rotation of south-east Asia...|$|E
