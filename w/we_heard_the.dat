25|$|During {{the night}} of the 30th we had not a moment of repose, as every moment <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> loud crush of houses {{collapsing}} under of stones, mud, and ashes piled upon them, and feared that the turn of the convento and the church of Casasay would come in next. Shortly before daybreak of December 1 there was a tremendous crash as if the house were coming down on our heads: the roof of the apse of the church had caved in! Not long afterward, the roof of their kitchen gave away with a thud. Both were tile roofs.|$|E
500|$|More than 750 {{slaves were}} rescued in the Combahee River Raid. Newspapers heralded Tubman's [...] "patriotism, sagacity, energy, [...] ability", {{and she was}} praised for her {{recruiting}} efforts – most of the newly liberated men went on to join the Union army. Tubman later worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She described the battle by saying: [...] "And then we saw the lightning, {{and that was the}} guns; and then <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> thunder, and that was the big guns; and then <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> rain falling, and that was the drops of blood falling; and when we came to get the crops, it was dead men that we reaped." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Science Journal G. Wayne Clough, the 12th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution assuaged [...] the animosities between critics and proponents of the exhibition: [...] “So I don't think there's anything negative here. I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time {{in a situation like this}} to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, what are you going to do about it? And, you remember, the United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.” ...|$|E

500|$|Even some staunch traditionalists {{from both}} the urban and rural folk music {{communities}} had an affinity for the Kingstons' polished commercial versions of older songs. In her memoir And A Voice To Sing With, singer and activist Joan Baez recalled that [...] "Traveling across the country {{with my mother and}} sisters, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> commercial songs of the budding folk boom for the first time, the Kingston Trio's 'Tom Dooley' and 'Scotch and Soda.' Before I turned into a snob and learned to look down upon all commercial folk music as bastardized and unholy, I loved the Kingston Trio. When I became one of the leading practitioners of 'pure folk,' I still loved them..." [...] Arthel [...] "Doc" [...] Watson of North Carolina, {{one of the most respected}} and influential musicians performing traditional music, remarked, [...] "I’ll tell you who pointed all our noses in the right direction, even the traditional performers. They got us interested in trying to put the good stuff out there—the Kingston Trio. They got me interested in it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 14, 2007, Stephen Harper shuffled MacKay from Foreign Affairs to Defence, {{replacing}} Gordon O'Connor. On November 6, 2007, {{while attending}} {{a meeting at}} Forward Operating Base Wilson, 20 kilometres west of Kandahar City, Mackay was unharmed as two rockets struck the base at about 11 a.m. local time. Mackay described the incident: [...] "There was an explosion. It was a loud bang", said MacKay. [...] "When it happened, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> explosion, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> whistle overhead, {{we were told to}} get down and we did." [...] The incident happened {{on the same day that}} a suicide bomber detonated an explosive in Baghlan in the northeastern part of the country killing at least 35 including several politicians. While Taliban insurgents were suspected of being behind the bombing, it was not believed to be related to the attack in Kandahar.|$|E
2500|$|In 1832, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon {{wrote an}} account {{in which they}} both claimed to have seen the resurrected Jesus Christ. They wrote, [...] "And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the {{testimony}} last of all, which we give of him, that he lives; for we saw him, even on the right hand of God, and <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> voice bearing record {{that he is the}} Only Begotten of the Father." ...|$|E

2500|$|Buchanan {{explained}} the song's concept and lyrical interpretation during a track by track {{analysis of the}} album on the group's official website, saying: [...] "This song is about reacting to the press when they slag you off, about how they judge you. When <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> song we loved it. To be honest, any publicity is good publicity whether it's positive or negative, and it's taken us {{a while to get}} that. When the press write something negative and something that's untrue, it's hard to look at that in a positive way. We could really relate to the song." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Queen {{said she}} was [...] "utterly shocked" [...] and her [...] "thoughts were with all those affected". Her son and heir to the New Zealand throne, The Prince of Wales, also said to New Zealand's governor-general and prime minister: [...] "My wife and I were horrified when <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news early this morning... The scale of the {{destruction}} all but defies belief when we can appreciate only too well how difficult {{it must have been}} struggling {{to come to terms with}} last year's horror ... Our deepest sympathy and constant thoughts are with you and all New Zealanders." ...|$|E
2500|$|King Hussein {{declared}} {{martial law}} on 16 September and initiated the military actions later {{known as the}} Black September conflict. Hostage David Raab described the Jordanian military actions: [...] "We {{were in the middle}} of the shelling since Ashrafiyeh was among the Jordanian Army's primary targets. Electricity was cut off, and again we had little food or water. Friday afternoon, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> metal tracks of a tank clanking on the pavement. We were quickly herded into one room, and the guerrillas threw open the doors to make the building appear abandoned so it wouldn't attract fire. Suddenly, the shelling stopped." ...|$|E

2500|$|After calling at Madras on 13 February, she {{departed}} for Suez; her captain, Captain Kirton, had {{been instructed to}} land at Trincomalee with about £5,000 of Government treasure. Mrs. Inglis had kept a diary of the events during the siege of Lucknow to which she added her account of the wreck:We made good progress all that day (Tuesday). It was eight o'clock, a beautiful night, and we were running along at a great pace. Finding it very hot in the saloon after tea, [...] had come on deck, and {{were sitting on the}} bulwarks behind the wheel. Suddenly we were startled by a loud grating sound something like the letting down of an anchor, and just then saw a large rock close to us. I said, 'We must have touched that.' Several men rushed to the wheel, and then again <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> same sound, only louder, and a quivering of the whole ship. She then remained stationary, only heaving backwards and forwards.|$|E
2500|$|On July 12, at 11 a.m., the 15th NJVI dropped anchor at [...] "the Sixth Street Wharf in Washington City" [...] (Modern day Washington Navy Yard) {{where they}} were [...] "welcomed by crowds of {{citizens}} and officials, who received us as deliverers from a great peril. The arrival brought joy to Washington." [...] From there they, {{along with the other}} regiments of the 1st and 2nd Divisions, marched up 6th Street, turned onto 7th Street and on to the [...] "7th Street Road". They marched with colors flying past cheering citizens who hung flags and waved handkerchiefs until they reached Columbian College Hospital (modern day George Washington University Hospital). [...] "Soon <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> booming of canon before us, and quickly, at the word, fell into ranks, and with accelerated pace hurried toward the scene of action." [...] They were ordered to proceed to Fort Massachusetts (Fort Stevens) to meet General Early's invaders.|$|E
2500|$|Prime Minister Justin Trudeau {{discussed}} the situation during {{a telephone call}} to State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and the Canadian government pledged [...] for relief support of Rohingya refugees. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the violence against the Rohingya [...] "looks a lot like ethnic cleansing". According to the parliamentary secretary of the Canadian foreign ministry, [...] "The violence is still ongoing so obviously there's a failure on part of the military, {{on the part of}} the government. I don't think <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> end of this yet about what our role is going to be. As I said, we are still assessing the situation and we're looking for ways for Canada to be constructive. We are in discussion as well with our embassy over there, with our officials on the ground". The Canadian government has faced internal pressure to act, and pro-Rohingya protests in Toronto included Buddhist members of the Toronto city council.|$|E

2500|$|Wanting {{to return}} to their sound from that {{particular}} era, after narrowing down the selection from twelve finished songs to ten that they wanted to record, the band sought to work with James [...] "Jimbo" [...] Barton, who had mixed and engineered the band's hit albums Operation: Mindcrime and Empire, and whom they had last worked with in the mid-90s, when he produced their album Promised Land. Deciding to work with Barton was [...] "a no-brainer", according to La Torre, and Rockenfield has said that Barton was really the only choice. Barton had stayed in contact with Wilton, who would often fill him in on {{what was going on in}} the band. Queensrÿche invited him to see them perform at the House of Blues in West Hollywood on November 24, 2012, where he reportedly said that the band [...] "had something really special here and he wanted to be a part of it." [...] In the studio in Seattle, he told the band: [...] "Look guys, let's just start where we left off, back in 1995". Rockenfield looks back on the collaboration, saying: [...] "Working with Jimbo [...] and the addition of Todd has revitalized the band in ways we never knew until <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> final results" [...] and: [...] "We had the best time, and he was such a great, perfect match to make this record." ...|$|E
