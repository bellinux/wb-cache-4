25|$|The {{idea of the}} {{documentary}} was first thought of by Kemp around January 2005, after the series on Gangs <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> {{with the idea of}} embedding himself with a unit. Kemp had initially wanted to do a series about troops in Iraq following the 2003 invasion and posed the idea to James Murdoch, head of Sky TV. Due to the prevailing sensitive political situation, the MOD were reluctant.|$|E
25|$|On 14 August 2009, Schmeichel {{signed for}} League Two side Notts County {{in a deal}} that is {{believed}} to have broken the club's previous transfer record. The transfer reunited Schmeichel with his former Manchester City manager, Sven-Göran Eriksson, who had recently been appointed director of football for Notts. He was the highest paid player at the club, earning ₤1 million annually. He made his debut on 22 August and kept a clean sheet in the side's 3–0 win against Dagenham & Redbridge. In September 2009, Schmeichel almost scored with an audacious overhead kick against Morecambe <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> from a corner late on in the game.|$|E
25|$|Aerts {{continued}} his win-streak when he knocked out Andrew Thomson in fifty-six seconds at K-1 King of the Ring 2000 in Bologna, Italy on May 12, 2000. This run {{came to an}} end, however, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> against Cyril Abidi, a promising young French fighter, at K-1 Spirits 2000 on July 7, 2000. Abidi managed to drag Aerts into a brawl and caused a huge upset by KOing him in round one. Aerts was then {{given the chance to}} prove this loss was simply a fluke when he rematched Abidi in the quarter-finals of the K-1 World Grand Prix 2000 in Yokohama, a qualifying tournament for the 2000 World Grand Prix. He was unable to do so, however, and Abidi stopped him en route to the final.|$|E

25|$|Sun Quan was {{not only}} unhappy with Zhang Wen for praising the Shu government, but also jealous of his growing popularity. He feared that Zhang Wen would win over {{the hearts of the}} people and {{eventually}} take over his throne, so he thought of ways to depose Zhang Wen. His opportunity arrived when Zhang Wen was implicated in an incident involving Ji Yan, an official whom Zhang Wen recommended to serve in the Wu government. Ji Yan incurred much resentment from his colleagues <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with radical ideas to reform the bureaucracy – a move that would affect over 90 percent of all Wu officials. In 224, Ji Yan and his colleague Xu Biao (徐彪) were arrested and removed from office based on allegations of unprofessional conduct. They committed suicide later. Zhang Wen was implicated in this incident because he not only recommended Ji Yan, but was also a close friend of both Ji Yan and Xu Biao. Like them, he was removed from office, arrested and imprisoned.|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, J. August Richards, one of {{the stars}} of the earlier Joss Whedon series Angel, was cast in the pilot in an {{unspecified}} role, later revealed to be Mike Peterson, the first live-action portrayal of Deathlok and a recurring character throughout the season. Nicholas Brendon, another Whedon collaborator, was also reportedly considered for Richards' role. In December, two recurring characters were set to be added to the series with the episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] They were described as [...] "an African-American agent who specializes in combat/weapons, and a high-level S.H.I.E.L.D. agent/munitions expert who has past ties to both Coulson and Ward." [...] In January 2014, Bill Paxton was cast as Agent John Garrett, [...] "a rough-and-tumble former cohort of Agent Coulson with a little bit of attitude and cigar-smoking swagger", for at least four episodes of the season. Jed Whedon said that [...] "We actually discussed Bill Paxton in the room, when we were talking about the character ... Then <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> as an actual possibility, we couldn't believe it." [...] The next month, B.J. Britt was cast as Agent Triplett, an associate of Garrett. Other recurring guests in the season include Saffron Burrows as Victoria Hand, David Conrad as Ian Quinn, and Ruth Negga as Raina.|$|E
500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan" [...] {{took place}} in the Upper Boat Studios on 23 March 2012, alongside that for the episode [...] "Asylum of the Daleks". The final episode Gillan and Darvill shot as Amy and Rory was actually the previous episode, [...] "The Power of Three". Nevertheless, Gillan and Smith got very emotional filming the final graveyard scene. Amy and Rory's scene on the rooftop was filmed in a car park in Cardiff, Wales, with a greenscreen standing in for the New York skyline. To create the effect of the two plunging down, Gillan and Darvill were suspended upside-down by wires and raised and lowered. Much of the episode was filmed in Central Park in New York City in April 2012. The filming was attended by thousands of American fans, which surprised the cast and crew. Other scenes were shot at night in the city, {{as well as by the}} East River in front of the Brooklyn Bridge and in the Tudor City apartment complex. Moffat was in New York City <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with the story, and thought it was appropriate for the Weeping Angels. He described the city as [...] "a different backdrop" [...] to shoot a Doctor Who story in, and made use of its architecture. Fellow executive producer Caroline Skinner felt that the location [...] "has such scale and romance" [...] which [...] " [...] the episode a real atmosphere and a very different tone for Doctor Who". The week spent filming in the city was done by a [...] "small unit by American standards" [...] according to producer Marcus Wilson. They did not take any props of Angels or the TARDIS, which were instead added in post-production. Filming for the episode also occurred at a cemetery in Llanelli. During post-production, the New York skyline was inserted into the cemetery scenes. Gillan insisted on reading Amy's afterword to Smith when his reaction was filmed. They were not expecting it to be in front of a crowd in Central Park, and Smith said he had to [...] "treat this like a play". Because the content was so secret, Gillan had to read very quietly and Smith could not hold the real page because a spectator might take a picture of it. Gillan found that she only had one page of the script, and had to improvise the rest.|$|E

[...] For many years Sardi’s was the location where Tony Award nominations were announced. Vincent Sardi Sr. received a special Tony Award in 1947, the first year of the awards, for [...] "providing a transient home and comfort station for theatre folk at Sardi's for 20 years." [...] In 2004, Vincent Sardi Jr. received a Tony Honor for Excellence in the Theatre.

2500|$|On 29 April 1920, Moon {{was at the}} {{controls}} of a flying boat on an instructional cruise when it crashed into the sea. Moon and three other crew members were killed, while two were rescued, slightly injured. At the inquest a survivor, Observer-Officer L. H. Pakenham Walsh, D.F.C. gave evidence saying that [...] "the flying boat started off all right, and it had made several practice landings on the water". Squadron-Leader Moon took control to do a glide. At about [...] "the machine received a bump on the tail which threw the machine {{out of control and}} developed into a spin". Although Squadron-Leader Moon tried to regain control, they were too close to the water to complete the recovery. The aircraft collapsed upon hitting the water.

2500|$|DeLillo {{returned}} with what {{would turn out}} to be his final novel of the decade with Falling Man in May 2007. The novel concerned the impact on one family of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, [...] "an intimate story which is encompassed by a global event." [...] According to a 2007 interview in Die Zeit, DeLillo claims that originally he [...] "didn't ever want to write a novel about 9/11" [...] and [...] "had an idea for a different book" [...] which he had [...] "been working on for half a year" [...] in 2004 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with an idea for the novel, beginning work on the novel following the re-election of George W. Bush that November. Although highly anticipated and eagerly awaited by critics, who felt that DeLillo was one of the contemporary writers best equipped to tackle the events of 9/11 in novelistic form, the novel met with a mixed critical reception and garnered no major literary awards or nominations. DeLillo, however, remained unconcerned by this relative lack of critical acclaim, remarking in 2010, [...] "In the 1970s, when I started writing novels, I was a figure in the margins, and that’s where I belonged. If I’m headed back that way, that’s fine with me, because that’s always where I felt I belonged. Things changed for me in the 1980s and 1990s, but I’ve always preferred to be somewhere in the corner of a room, observing." ...|$|E
