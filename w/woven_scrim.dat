50|$|For the {{aircraft}} production number 292 (B-737) and after (this aircraft was production line number 152), an additional outer layer of skin or doubler sheet at the lap joint of the fuselage was added. In {{the construction of}} this aircraft this doubler sheet was not used {{in addition to other}} details of the bonding of the parts. In the case of production line 292 and after, this doubler sheet gave an additional thickness of 0.91 mm at the lap joint. In airplane line number 291 and before, cold bonding had been utilized, with fasteners used to maintain surface contact in the joint, allowing bonding adhesive to transfer load within the joint. This cold bonded joint used an epoxy-impregnated <b>woven</b> <b>scrim</b> cloth to join the edges of 0.9 mm thick skin panels. These epoxy cloths were reactive at room temperature, so they were stored at dry ice temperatures until used in manufacture. The bond cured at room temperature after assembly. The cold bonding process reduced the overall weight and manufacturing cost. Fuselage hoop loads (circumferential loads within the skins due to pressurization of the cabin) were intended to be transferred through the bonded joint, rather than through the rivets, allowing the use of lighter, thinner fuselage skin panels with no degradation in fatigue life.|$|E
50|$|Nonwoven {{materials}} are either felted or membrane. Nonwoven {{materials are}} attached to a <b>woven</b> backing (<b>scrim).</b> Felted filters contain randomly placed fibers supported by a <b>woven</b> backing material (<b>scrim).</b> In a membrane filter, a thin, porous membrane is bound to the scrim. High energy cleaning techniques such as pulse jet require felted fabrics.|$|R
50|$|Thermoplastic is heat-welded seams form a permanent, {{watertight}} {{bond that}} {{is stronger than}} the membrane itself. PVC resin is modified with plasticizers and UV stabilizers, and reinforced with fiberglass non-woven mats or polyester <b>woven</b> <b>scrims,</b> {{for use as a}} flexible roofing membrane. PVC is, however, subject to plasticizer migration. (a process by which the plasticizers migrate out of the sheet causing it to become brittle.) Thus, a thicker membrane has a larger reservoir of plasticizer to maintain flexibility over its lifespan. PVC is often blended with other polymers to add to the performance capabilities of the original PVC formulation, such as KEE - Keytone Ethylene Ester. Such blends are referred to as either a CPA - Copolymer Alloy or a TPA - Tripolymer Alloy.|$|R
5000|$|The word sarking {{is further}} used {{as part of}} the term scrim and sarking, a method of {{interior}} construction widely used in Australia and New Zealand in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In this method, wooden panels were nailed over the beams and joists of the house frame, and a heavy, loosely <b>woven</b> cloth, called <b>scrim,</b> was then stapled or tacked over the top of this. This construction method allowed wallpaper to be applied directly to unplastered walls.|$|R
