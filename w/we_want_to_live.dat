2500|$|Professor Thio Li-ann has {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} in Singapore free speech is not a primary right, but is qualified by public order considerations couched in terms of [...] "racial and religious harmony". It seems that the legal framework prefers to serve foundational commitments such as the harmonious co-existence of different ethnic and religious communities, because [...] "community or racial harmony form the bedrock upon which peace and progress in Singapore are founded". In his 2009 National Day Rally speech Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong characterized racial and religious divides as [...] "the most visceral and dangerous fault line" [...] in Singapore society, and earlier he had said that [...] "we must respect one another's religions, we must not deliberately insult or desecrate what others hold sacred because if <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> peacefully together, then we must live and let live, there must be tolerance, there must be mutual respect".|$|E

2500|$|Monty, {{who left}} the series in 1986, {{returned}} in 1991 with the hope she would again raise the ratings of the show. She brought Geary back to General Hospital that same year as Luke's look-alike cousin, Bill Eckert. The actor had refused {{to return to the}} show as Luke without Laura. The unpopularity of the Bill Eckert character led to ABC's firing Monty, killing off Bill, and bringing Luke and Laura back, played by Geary and Francis. Upon their return, the actors took more control of the writing for their characters. Geary, along with a writer friend, Irene Suver, developed the story for Luke and Laura's return. Geary's contract allowed him to rewrite his dialogue at his discretion. Francis and Geary were also known for fighting over story direction with executive producer Wendy Riche and the show's writers. The departure of head writer Richard Culliton days after a tense meeting with Geary caused rumors to circulate that the actor threatened to quit if Culliton were not fired. [...] "The meeting did not go well, but I made no ultimatums and there was certainly no violence," [...] Geary said. [...] "I really don't know if I {{had anything to do with}} his departure, but I wouldn't shed any tears if I did." [...] Francis supported Geary in what they considered to be standing up for the [...] "integrity" [...] of their characters and protecting the [...] "Spencer franchise." [...] "Sometimes people think we're difficult because of that, but we're only difficult because <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> up to the high standards we've set," [...] Francis said.

25|$|Unger's {{critique}} of economics {{begins with the}} identification of a key moment in economic history, when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity. In Unger’s analysis, classical economics focused on the causal relations among social activities, which were connected with the production and distribution of wealth. Classical economists asked questions about the true basis of value, activities that contributed to national wealth, systems of rights, or about the forms of government under which people grow rich. In the late-nineteenth century, in response to attacks from socialist ideas and debates about how society works, and {{as a means to}} escape the conundrums of value theory and to answer how values could become prices, marginalist economics arose. This movement in economics disengaged economics from prescriptive and normative commitments to withdraw the study of economies from debates about how society worked and what kind of society <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in. For Unger, this moment in the history of economics robbed it of any analytical or practical value.|$|R

At war's end, a new kind of suburb came into being[...] [...] [...] Thanks to the GI bill, two new names were added to American folksay: Levittown and Park Forest.

"If one {{of those}} ten {{thousand}} members of the Sokol Society had thrown back his brown cloak and shown red when all the others still kept them selves cloaked--if he was a normal sensitive man--he might have felt something of a fool. He might have felt premature and presumptuous. Red he was and the others he knew were red also, but why show it? That is the peculiar distress of people like ourselves, who have some sense of history and some sense of a larger life within us than our merely personal life. We don't {{want to go on}} with the old story merely. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> somehow in that larger life and to live for its greater ends and lose something unbearable of ourselves, and in wanting to do that we are only wanting to do what nearly everybody perhaps is ripe to do and will presently want to do.

Talboys built himself a house. You know Talboys. When I first met him, before he started building, he was a cheerful soul with a kindly word for everyone. The builder assures him that in another twenty years, when the colour has had time to tone down, his house will be a picture. At present it makes him bilious, the mere sight of it. Year by year, they tell him, as the dampness wears itself away, he will suffer less and less from rheumatism, ague, and lumbago. He has a hedge round the garden; it is eighteen inches high. To keep the boys out he has put up barbed- wire fencing. But wire fencing affords no real privacy. When the Talboys are taking coffee on the lawn, there is generally a crowd from the village watching them. There are trees in the garden; you know they are trees--there is a label tied to each one telling you what sort of tree it is. For the moment there is a similarity about them. Thirty years hence, Talboys estimates, they will afford him shade and comfort; but by that time he hopes to be dead.
