As such, it presents a challenge to students to learn the immunological language, understand underlying molecular mechanisms and gain insight into the interactions of all elements. To help the students learn the basic concepts and master immunological terms, the course was initially presented using traditional lectures and follow-up workshops. In the first week of a three week rotation, four hours of lectures covered the basic concepts for two major topics.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine how discourses are mobilised and {{deployed}} by actors in a domain during a critical incident. In particular {{we examine the}} changes and the continuities {{in the way that}} the major parties in the Melbourne port dispute of 1997 - 98 related to each other. We focus on the discourses used to structure the ways that these organisations related. We adopt perspectives from critical domain theory and discourse theory, and derive our main concept and unit of analysis, what we call the discursive domain. The main process that occurs in a discursive domain is actors' 'mapping' discourses onto concepts, and concepts onto objects, in order to make certain courses of action rational and sensible. We propose that different mapping processes occur in differently organised domains. <b>We</b> <b>employ</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> method. Data was gathered from an analysis of media reports about the port of Melbourne during 1997 - 98. These texts are used to examine the kinds (number and diversity) of discourses used by each of two main networks of organisations in the domain during that period. The main finding is an unexpected association between the 'organised' domain and the 'complex' mapping performed by actors. Our contribution is to build on previous understandings of the role of discourses in domains by examining the complexity of 'mapping' by domain actors during critical incidents such as a major industrial dispute. We conclude by drawing implications of the discursive domain approach for domain theory and discourse theory...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Whenever {{people think}} of FDI flows, the {{traditional}} assumption is that the investment flows from MNCs in the developed economies to either other developed economies and/or to the developing world. Now, a new trend has emerged owing {{to the process of}} globalisation. That is, FDI from the emerging and developing economies such as China, India, South Africa and Brazil is flowing to both developed and developing economies. There is more flexibility of movement of capital and knowledge which does not conform to hitherto held assumptions that FDI flows in a particular pattern to particular locations, that is, largely from the developed economies to the developing economies. This new trend needs to be captured both empirically and conceptually. One work we have been doing is exploring the new phenomenon of R&D related FDI flow into the emerging economies such as India, China and Brazil (Baskaran and Muchie, 2008). It is interesting that knowledge that is assumed often to be retained in the home parent company (usually in a developed country) is now open to movement to the {{to other parts of the}} world where there is a very strong pool of concentration of talent and skills such as India and China. Similarly, companies from the developing world now appear to be looking for strategic presence in other countries - both developed and developing economies. We explore the factors driving this outward flow of FDI from developing economies and the shape and nature of this flow. Further more, the research will examine the implications of this trend [...] whether the FDI itself is changing because of this new trend and in what way this is taking place in reality. For this, <b>we</b> <b>employ</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> of companies with external involvement from selected economies [...] China, India and South Africa...|$|R

In connection to biologically inspired models (Thomas-Rössler models), where strong fluctuations represent qualitative structural changes, we observe the appearance of stochastic resonance-like phenomena i. e. transitions that lead to orderly behavior when the noise increases.

Second, barriers to eco-innovation also derive from external and internal pressures.

40|$|Policy {{brokers and}} policy {{entrepreneurs}} {{are assumed to}} have a decisive impact on policy outcomes. Their access to social and political resources is contingent on their influence on other agents. In social network analysis (SNA), entrepreneurs are often closely associated with brokers, because both are agents presumed to benefit from bridging structural holes; for example, gaining advantage through occupying a strategic position in relational space. Our aim here is twofold. First, to conceptually and operationally differentiate policy brokers from policy entrepreneurs premised on assumptions in the policy-process literature; and second, via SNA, to use the output of core algorithms in a cross-sectional analysis of political brokerage and political entrepreneurship. We attempt to simplify the use of graph algebra in answering questions relevant to policy analysis by placing each algorithm within its theoretical context.

In so doing, <b>we</b> <b>employ</b> a <b>case</b> <b>study</b> analysis of a social entrepreneur who started, and still operates, a refugee support centre in a major Australian city. This research is timely in light of the current state of academic development of social entrepreneurship (SE) which remains an emerging and under-researched field of academic inquiry (Austin, 2006). In a literature review covering the period between 1990 and 2004, Mair, Robinson and Hockerts (2006) were able to uncover only a handful of academic articles on SE in peer-reviewed journals. Johnson (2000) found similar results, with most references contained in journalistic and professional sources, including internet websites. As such the field remains under-theorised, extremely broad, and bedevilled by a plethora of varying definitions. Our review of the SE literature reveals that it is concentrated in four distinct topic areas: (i) the meaning and conceptualisation of SE (Mort, Weerawardena, and Carnegie, 2003; Thompson, Alvy, and Lees, 2000; Waddock and Post, 1991; Roper and Cheney, 2005; Dees, 1998), (ii) the difference between SE and business entrepreneurship (Austin, Stevenson, and Wei-Skillern, 2006), (iii) the characteristics, motivations, and personal values of social entrepreneurs (Plater-Zyberk, 2005; Hemingway, 2005), and (iv) the activities of social entrepreneurs (Thompson, 2002; Alvord, Brown, and Letts, 2004).

We {{report on a}} detailed set of over 1200 hand actions made by four typically developing boys and four boys with autism. Participants were assessed for unimanual hand actions to both objects and the self (self-directed behaviors). Individual and group analyses suggest that typically developing children have a right hand dominance for hand actions to objects and a left hand dominance for hand actions for self-directed behaviors, revealing a possible dissociation for functional specialization of {{the left and right}} hemispheres respectively. Children with autism demonstrated mixed-handedness for both target conditions, consistent with the hypothesis that there is reduced cerebral specialization in these children. The findings are consistent with the view that observed lateralized motor action can serve as an indirect behavioral marker for evidence of cerebral lateralization...|$|R
