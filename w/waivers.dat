40|$|New Federal Rule of Evidence 502 (“FRE 502 ”) {{will end}} the threedecade push to nationalize a {{corporate}} litigation protection known as the “selective <b>waiver</b> doctrine. ” First adopted by the Eighth Circuit in 1978, the selective <b>waiver</b> doctrine holds that, when a corporation discloses privileged materials to a government agency during an investigation, the corporation retains its privileges against third-party litigants—i. e., the corporation may selectively waive its attorney-client privilege (and in other circuits its attorney work product protection). This {{flies in the face}} of traditional <b>waiver</b> rules, under which a <b>waiver</b> of privilege to one’s adversary generally is a <b>waiver</b> to all adversaries on that subject matter. Based on years of frustration with discovery costs, fear of corporate fraud, and heavy burdens placed on administrative agencies, many legal scholars praised selective <b>waiver</b> as a cure for those ills. Recently, when the Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules met to discuss additions to the FRE, many called for the inclusion of a selective <b>waiver</b> provision. After much debate, the Advisory Committee determined that the selective <b>waiver</b> proposal for FRE 502 was too controversial. In its enacted form, FRE 502 does not contain a selective <b>waiver</b> provision...|$|R

40|$|State Medicaid {{home and}} {{community-based}} <b>waiver</b> programs {{for persons with}} AIDS (PWAs) were implemented {{with the expectation that}} PWAs would use home and community-based services in lieu of more expensive hospital-based care. If so, then Medicaid spending per PWA should decline and this in turn should generate program cost savings. While some published research indicates that <b>waiver</b> participants incur lower expenditures than non-participants, this evidence is based on data which pre-dates the development of highly effective but expensive antiretroviral combination therapies. In this study, we analyzed Florida Medicaid claims data for PWAs from December 1995 through December 1997 to determine how participation in the home and community-based <b>waiver</b> affects the use of inpatient services, the receipt of antiretroviral combination therapies, monthly expenditures and survival of PWAs. Importantly, antiretroviral combination therapies were available to Medicaid recipients with AIDS throughout this time period. Four important findings are obtained. 1) the <b>waiver</b> program offers a different form of care to PWAs; <b>waiver</b> participants are more likely to receive combination therapies, but are less likely to use hospital-based care relative to non-participants. 2) The <b>waiver</b> is not randomly selected by PWAs; white men and sicker patients {{are much more likely to}} join the <b>waiver</b> program than other eligible PWAs. 3) After controlling for the non-random selection of the <b>waiver</b> and other patient characteristics, monthly expenditures for <b>waiver</b> participants are 49 % lower than non-participants. 4) <b>Waiver</b> participation does not significantly affect survival. ...|$|R
