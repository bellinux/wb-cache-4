5|$|Emigrants {{departed}} from an English port (generally Liverpool) and travelled by ship to New York or Boston, then by railroad to Iowa City, Iowa, the western terminus {{of the rail}} line, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> outfitted with handcarts and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} was designed, as was its predecessor at Watten, to receive, process and launch V-2 rockets {{at a high}} rate. Trains carrying V-2s would enter {{the heart of the}} complex through the Ida rail tunnel, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unloaded. A large number of V-2s could be stored in the side tunnels; LOX would also be produced on-site ready for use. When the time came, the rockets would be moved into the octagonal preparation chamber <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> lifted to a vertical position for fuelling and arming. From there they would be transported on motorised launch carriages, still in a vertical position, through the Gustav and Gretchen passageways. The launch pads were located {{at the end of the}} track on the floor of the quarry, from where the missiles would be fired.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson {{reportedly}} compiled fake playbooks and {{had them}} distributed <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> discovered by Maryland personnel. Wilkinson later {{admitted that he had}} indeed used the ruse on occasion, without specifically stating it was employed before the 1954 Orange Bowl.|$|E

50|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, {{before it}} was engulfed by Lake Borgne, {{the ruins of the}} fort were a popular {{gathering}} place for teenagers seeking a spot <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> supervised.|$|R
5|$|Deeper (average: 3m) {{and much}} wider (av. 10m) {{perimeter}} ditches (fossae). These would have flat floors {{rather than the}} traditional V-shape. Such ditches would {{make it difficult to}} bring siege equipment (ladders, rams, and other engines) to the walls. It would also concentrate attackers in an enclosed area <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> exposed to missile fire from the walls.|$|E
5|$|Following the French {{surrender}} on 22 June, the French fleet {{was to be}} disarmed under German and Italian supervision, {{under the}} terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralize the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, to move them to French possessions like Martinique <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> outside the reach of the Axis powers, to move them to the USA <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interned, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum. After 10 hours of discussions and the French rejection of any part of the ultimatum, the British ships opened fire.|$|E
5|$|The 722 Sunshields were {{carefully}} pre-positioned in the Martello tank-holding area near El Imayid railway station. Each was numbered. The crew of each tank {{was brought to}} Martello, told their number, shown <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> parked and taught how to put up and take down the Sunshield, which {{they would have to}} do at night.|$|E

5|$|After each flight {{the engines}} would {{be removed from}} the orbiter and {{transferred}} to the Space Shuttle Main Engine Processing Facility (SSMEPF), <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> inspected and refurbished in preparation for reuse on a subsequent flight. A total of 46 reusable RS-25 engines, each costing around US$40 million, were flown during the Space Shuttle program, with each new or overhauled engine entering the flight inventory requiring flight qualification on one of the test stands at Stennis Space Center prior to flight.|$|E
5|$|Following the Armistice {{that ended}} the fighting, Königsberg took Rear Admiral Hugo Meurer to Scapa Flow to {{negotiate}} with Admiral David Beatty, {{the commander of the}} Grand Fleet, for the place of internment of the German fleet. The accepted arrangement was for the High Seas Fleet to meet the combined Allied fleet in the North Sea and proceed to the Firth of Forth before transferring to Scapa Flow, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interned. Most of the High Seas Fleet's ships, including Karlsruhe, Emden, and Nürnberg, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter. Königsberg instead remained in Germany.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March the Embassy {{predicted}} {{there would}} be 3,600 evacuees, far exceeding the original estimate of approximately 400. This necessitated {{the development of a}} new evacuation plan whereby Marines would secure Pochentong Airport, while helicopters would ferry evacuees from central Phnom Penh to Pochentong from <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> flown on C-130 planes to Thailand. However, this plan was quickly overtaken by events as the supply C-130s coming into Pochentong were used for evacuees on the return journey, quickly reducing the number of evacuees that would need to be moved in a final evacuation.|$|E
50|$|Frustrated {{at how the}} Barisan's {{proposal}} {{had been}} misrepresented, Lim called for his supporters to cast blank or spoilt votes during the referendum. However, the PAP was quick in amending the referendum rules at the last minute: it ensured that blank votes <b>would</b> <b>be</b> treated as 'undecided' and the ultimate decision for <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> count <b>would</b> <b>be</b> made by the Legislative Assembly, which they controlled.|$|R
50|$|The ecclesiastical {{administration}} of Baras was given {{back by the}} Jesuits to the Franciscan in 1679. Two years later In 1682, the town was transferred to its present site <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> menaced by marauding tribes of the mountaineers.|$|R
60|$|Had she hidden away? There was {{no place}} to hide in. But Grimes looked about, and Tom also, for he was as puzzled as Grimes himself at her disappearing so suddenly; but look <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would,</b> she <b>was</b> not there.|$|R
5|$|During the 1920s, many navies were {{pursuing}} the flotilla leader concept, building large destroyers {{similar to the}} World War I Royal Navy V and W-class destroyers. In the interwar French Navy, these ships were known as contre-torpilleurs, and were intended to operate with smaller destroyers, or as half-flotillas of three ships. The idea was that such a half-flotilla could defeat an Italian light cruiser of the Condottieri class. The Navy of the KSCS decided to build three such flotilla leaders, ships that would {{have the ability to}} reach high speeds and with a long endurance. The long endurance requirement reflected Yugoslav plans to deploy the ships into the central Mediterranean, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to operate alongside French and British warships.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Jack Thorpe filed {{a federal}} {{lawsuit against the}} borough of Jim Thorpe, seeking to have his father's remains {{returned}} to his homeland and re-interred near other family members in Oklahoma. Citing the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Jack was arguing to bring his father's remains to the reservation in Oklahoma, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> buried near those of his father, sisters and brother, {{a mile from the}} place he was born. He claimed that the agreement between his stepmother and Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, borough officials was made against the wishes of other family members who want him buried in Native American land. Jack Thorpe died at 73 on February 22, 2011.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1942, 10 Norwegian ships at Gothenburg made {{an attempt}} to escape into Allied-controlled waters, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> met and {{protected}} {{by a group of}} British warships. However, Sweden would not allow the Norwegian ships to use their neutral waters for this, and Swedish ships steered the escapees towards waiting German warships. Of the 10, two made it through to the British, six were sunk by the Germans or scuttled by their crew, of which Skytteren was one, two turned back to Gothenburg. Skytteren was scuttled in the waters off Måseskär, Sweden. Her crew were taken as prisoners of war. The wreck of Skytteren remains in those waters, with her bow facing to the west.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Charles Grant advised {{them not}} to attempt to land at Calcutta, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> {{probably}} <b>be</b> at once arrested and sent home again, but to land at the Danish colony of Serampore, and there wait for an opportunity of joining Carey at Mudnabutty.|$|R
500|$|The rebellion's leaders—with the {{exception}} of Paul Revere and Joseph Warren—had all left Boston by April 8. [...] They had received word of Dartmouth's secret instructions to General Gage from sources in London well before they reached Gage himself.

5|$|On February 11, Buckner relayed {{orders to}} Pillow from Floyd to release Floyd's and Buckner's troops to operate {{south of the}} river, near Cumberland City, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to attack the Union supply lines while keeping a clear path back to Nashville. However, this would leave the Confederate forces at Fort Donelson heavily outnumbered. Pillow left early {{on the morning of}} February 12 to argue these orders with General Floyd himself leaving Buckner in charge of the fort. After hearing sounds of {{artillery}} fire, Pillow returned to Fort Donelson to resume command. After the events of the day, Buckner remained at Fort Donelson to command the Confederate right. With the arrival of Grant's army, General Johnston ordered Floyd to take any troops remaining in Clarksville to aid in the defense of Fort Donelson.|$|E
5|$|One {{common goal}} of early Daoism was to extend life by {{achieving}} immortality. The Celestial Masters believed {{that in order}} to achieve immortality, one was not supposed to extend life in the current world, but rather 'feign death' in this world, and be reborn on the other side. In order to feign death, an adept had to have perfectly harmonized internal spirits. When someone with refined internal spirits died in this world, their spirit would venture to the Palace of Grand Darkness where their form would be refined and then reborn in a perfected state on the other side. There are no surviving texts that describe what kind of place the 'other side' was. Those that failed to harmonize their internal spirits prior to death would be reborn in the underground earth-prisons, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> subject to eternal torment and toil.|$|E
5|$|The 3d PRS {{had been}} formed on 10 June 1941. After {{conducting}} flights over the Americas, it was deployed to the China-Burma-India Theater. The unit flew mapping missions {{over the region}} from 10 December 1943 until it was disbanded and re-formed in the United States during April 1944 to be equipped with the new F-13 photo reconnaissance variant of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bomber. Due to delays {{to the development of}} the F-13, the 3d PRS was unable to commence training on the type until 24 August, and began to receive its first operational F-13s on 4 October. 3d PRS F-13s began to depart for Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 19 October, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> supported by the unit's ground echelon which had arrived on 18 September.|$|E

5|$|The Americans {{continued}} to receive armaments from Ticonderoga, with guns arriving on September 21 {{and also on}} October 5. However, the artillery were positioned {{too far away to}} do much damage to the fort. With the arrival of the new guns, Montgomery planned to move the emphasis of the bombardment from {{the east side of the}} fort to the north side, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> closer. However, his officers unanimously rejected this plan, fearing that many men would desert due to the increased danger. Montgomery ordered that a new battery be built where the Royal Savage could be threatened. On October 14, the battery was completed and then used to sink the British ship.|$|E
5|$|The Phra Thinang Siwalai Maha Prasat (พระที่นั่งศิวาลัยมหาปราสาท) {{is located}} on the southern-eastern end of the Siwalai Garden. The Siwalai Maha Prasat is a Thai-style edifice with a Mondop style spire of seven tiers. Built during the reign of King Rama V in 1878 to house the metal statues of his four predecessors, which were cast in 1869. The hall was {{to be used as a}} royal pantheon, where the lives of {{previous}} monarchs were to be commemorated and worshiped. Later King Rama VI had the statues removed and rehoused at the Prasat Phra Thep Bidorn in the Temple of the Emerald Buddha compound, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more assessable to the public. On 6 April 1918 the first ceremony of worship was inaugurated, this ceremony continues to be performed annually. Since the removal of the statues, the Siwalai Maha Prasat has been left vacant.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 {{was also}} sold {{for a while}} in {{duty-free}} shops at UK airports. However, this fell foul of government export restrictions aimed at preventing the Soviet bloc countries from obtaining Western high technology goods. It was not uncommon for visitors from the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries to pick up gadgets in Western countries with the aim of transferring their technology to their own states' industries. In 1983 the government ordered that the ZX81s were to be withdrawn from sale at airports. There was no such restriction on sales to communist China and in November 1983 Sinclair Research announced that it had signed an agreement to export ZX81 kits to a factory in Guangzhou, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> assembled for the Chinese market.|$|E
