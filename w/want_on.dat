25|$|Pay What You Want – In 2013 comedian Bob Slayer {{introduced}} a new model to the Fringe, at his Heroes of Fringe venues, where punters could 'Buy a ticket in advance to guarantee a seat or Pay What You <b>Want</b> <b>on</b> exit'. The model {{is a mixture of}} Paid and Free and enables performers to find a paying audience without risking large marketing spend. Phil Kay, Tom Binns and Miss Behave were amongst the first established acts to embrace this model along with Adrienne Truscott who won the Edinburgh Comedy Awards Panel Prize with a PWYW. Adam Hess was nominated for best newcomer in 2015. Other promoters such as Just the Tonic, Pleasance and C-Venues have since introduced the model to their venues. In 2016, Gilded Balloon adopted PWYW for the Counting House venue, which was previously a Free Festival venue.|$|E
25|$|In the 1st ever Test {{series that}} took place from March to April 1877 Harry Jupp was England's opening batsman. England lost the toss and were made to field. Harry Jupp {{following}} England Captain James Lillywhite onto the Melbourne pitch, was the 2nd Test Player to appear in Test Cricket. He was 96 days older than his Captain at 35 years 116 days old. As {{the rest of the}} England team came onto the pitch he was passed, in age, by Tom Emmett (England No: 8) and James Southerton (England No: 11). In the 1st Test Harry toiled in the field for {{a day and a half}} and then became England's first ever test batsman as he faced a first ball from Australian opening bowler John Hodges. Harry <b>want</b> <b>on</b> to make only the 2nd test 50 (Charles Bannerman of Australia had made 165 in the 1st Innings) and finished on 63. He ended the 2nd day on 54 not out. Jupp's 63 in an Innings became the 2nd best Innings score of the match. At the end of the match he scored 67 runs the 2nd highest total by a test batsman at that time.|$|E
25|$|In 1695, Every {{set sail}} for the {{volcanic}} island of Perim {{to wait for}} the Indian fleet that would be passing soon. (The fleet made annual pilgrimages to Mecca, so the knowledge of the approximate time the pilgrims would be returning home may have been readily available.) The fleet was easily the richest prize in Asia—perhaps in the entire world—and any pirates who managed to capture {{it would have been the}} perpetrators of the world's most profitable pirate raid. In August 1695, the Fancy reached the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, where he joined forces with five other pirate captains: Tew on the sloop-of-war Amity, with a crew of about sixty men; Joseph Faro on the Portsmouth Adventure, with sixty men; Richard <b>Want</b> <b>on</b> the Dolphin, also with sixty men; William Mayes on the Pearl, with thirty or forty men; and Thomas Wake on the Susanna, with seventy men. All of these captains were carrying privateering commissions that implicated almost the entire Eastern Seaboard of North America. Every was elected admiral of the new six-ship pirate flotilla despite the fact that Captain Tew had arguably more experience, and now found himself in command of over 440 men while they lay in wait for the Indian fleet. A convoy of twenty-five Mughal ships, including the enormous 1,600-ton Ganj-i-sawai of eighty cannons, and its escort, the 600-ton Fateh Muhammed, were spotted passing the straits en route to Surat. Although the convoy had managed to elude the pirate fleet during the night, the pirates gave chase.|$|E

500|$|Around {{the same}} time, the EZPpay system was {{expanded}} for overseas {{use during the}} aftermath of the 1992-1995 War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where U.S. personnel were deployed on peace-keeping missions. [...] Named [...] "EagleCash", the overseas system functions similarly to the EZpay system, but with the added ability of soldiers to attach personal bank accounts to the card, allowing them to load, and reload, without having to access their financial institutions back home. [...] As 386th Air Expeditionary Wing financial manager, Catherine Miles explained in a 2007 article, [...] "It's like a gift card. [...] You can put as little or as much money as you <b>want</b> <b>on</b> it and it comes from your checking account." [...] Unlike regular debit cards, the Eagle Cash is managed on-base, using batch processing which ensures that the cards remained useful even when connections to banks and credit unions State-side are severed. [...] The system was given widespread acceptance in 1999, just before the War in Iraq; it has since been expanded to many military bases such as Camp Anaconda on the front lines.|$|E

500|$|He was billeted with Alexander, who {{was working}} in Hut 8, the {{counterpart}} to Hut 6 working on German Naval Enigma. Their close friendship let them easily resolve the competing needs of their sections for the limited available bombe time. By October 1941, he was deputy head of Hut 6 under Welchman. At this time, Bletchley Park was experiencing a shortage of clerical staff which was delaying the work on Enigma, and the management of GCCS appeared unable to obtain the resources needed. This affected both Hut 6 and Hut 8, which was run by mathematician Alan Turing with Hugh Alexander as his deputy. Together, Welchman, Milner-Barry, Turing and Alexander bypassed {{the chain of command}} and wrote a memorandum directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, outlining their difficulties. It fell to Milner-Barry to deliver the message to 10 Downing Street in person, on 21 October 1941. The next day, Churchill responded, [...] "Action this day: Make sure they have all they <b>want</b> <b>on</b> extreme priority and report to me that this has been done." [...] Within a month their needs were being met.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after, Byrom joined Northern Premier League First Division side Clitheroe on a {{short-term}} contract. He finished the 2006–07 season top scorer with 11 league goals despite only joining {{the club in}} January 2007, including a hat-trick against Kidsgrove Athletic. However, Byrom's Clitheroe contract expired and Conference North side Southport took him on non-contract terms {{for the start of}} the 2007–08 season, where he scored two goals in two games. Despite being offered a contract by Southport manager Peter Davenport, Byrom opted to re-join Clitheroe in August 2007. On signing a two-year deal with Clitheroe, Byrom said [...] "I thought about giving up football when I left Accrington, but I really enjoyed my time at Clitheroe, they've given me a new lease of life and a licence to do what I <b>want</b> <b>on</b> the park". Clitheroe chairman, Carl Garner, said [...] "this is a big day for Clitheroe. This is one of the biggest signings the club has made. He's a special player and a special talent". In the first half of the 2007–08 season, Byrom scored six goals in all competitions for Clitheroe, which caught the attention of Conference National team Northwich Victoria. He played his last game for the Northern Premier League club in a 3–3 draw with local rivals Rossendale United, a game in which he captained the side for the first time.|$|E
