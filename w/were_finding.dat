5|$|Although {{the early}} workers in Alberta did not {{recognize}} it at the time, they <b>were</b> <b>finding</b> the remains of juvenile Lambeosaurus as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested duckbills were interpreted as adults of a distinct lineage of hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae. The first such animal to be named was Trachodon altidens, a left upper jaw (GSC 1092) from the Dinosaur Park Formation described by Lawrence Lambe in 1902. In the same volume, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested T. altidens could belong to a new genus, which he labelled Didanodon without further discussion. In 2006, Lund and Gates stated that Didanodon altidens was a nomen nudum, without further discussion.|$|E
5|$|By 1920 variety theatre {{had become}} popular in Britain, and Robey had {{completed}} the successful transition from music hall to variety star. Pantomime, which relied on its stars to make up much of the script through ad lib, was also beginning {{to fall out of}} favour, and his contemporaries <b>were</b> <b>finding</b> it too difficult to create fresh material for every performance; for Robey, however, the festive entertainment continued to be a lucrative source of employment.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a French-language publication, the gazette {{was seen}} as {{independent}} of France. Its production was tolerated and even encouraged by the authorities, who often used Gazette de Leyde and other similar publications for their own ends, when wishing to publicize information {{that could not be}} released via the official channels. The paper also gave voice to institutions like the Parliament of France that <b>were</b> <b>finding</b> it difficult to publish in the official French newspaper, the Gazette de France.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} {{to the needs of}} smaller libraries who <b>were</b> <b>finding</b> the expanded classification schedules difficult to use, in 1894, the first abridged edition of the Dewey Decimal system was produced. The abridged edition generally parallels the full edition, and has been developed for most full editions since that date. By popular request, in 1930, the Library of Congress began to print Dewey Classification numbers on nearly all of its cards, thus making the system immediately available to all libraries making use of the Library of Congress card sets.|$|E
5|$|With the Americans {{moving closer}} towards Kiska and Attu, the Japanese <b>were</b> <b>finding</b> it {{increasingly}} difficult to resupply their bases there. In March 1943, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid established a naval blockade around the islands, refusing to let Japanese ships through. On March 26, Admiral Hosogaya attempted to break the blockade with eight battle ships as well as three transports, resulting in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, the last battle fought only between surface ships in the Pacific War. Following the American victory in this battle, the Japanese were forced to resupply their occupied possessions in the Aleutian chain by submarine.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1941, just as ASO units <b>were</b> <b>finding</b> their feet, a {{large number}} of {{personnel}} and aircraft were sent to Malta (and the Desert Air Force) to interdict Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps supplies from Italy to North Africa. Adding to the problem was a shortage of materials and testing facilities. Restocking squadrons and re-equipping them was slow. Not until 1942 did the ASO squadrons get the recognition needed, {{in the wake of the}} German Operation Cerberus. Maintenance was also poor. Each service was to maintain an operational ready rate of 70 to 75 percent. In Coastal Command it was 40, and not much higher in others at that point. Greater emphasis was made and serviceability increased.|$|E

5|$|In the Podrinje region, {{encompassing}} the Drina basin, a Partisan {{district committee}} had been formed on 29 June, {{to oversee the}} local uprising and form Partisan detachments. After collecting weapons and ammunition, the detachment's first action was to attack the gendarmerie station in Bogatić on 7 August, disarming the gendarmes and capturing more weapons. Due to {{the scope of the}} local uprising, on 9 August the detachment was renamed the Podrinje Partisan Detachment. They disarmed the re-equipped gendarme platoon at Bogatić on 10 August, and then carried out the destruction of town archives, telephone lines and bridges in the district. By 14 August, the detachment's ranks had swelled to about 360 fighters in six companies, the occupation forces and local collaborators <b>were</b> <b>finding</b> it difficult to use the road from the district centre Šabac to Loznica due to Partisan ambushes, and the railway line between the two towns was out of action.|$|E
5|$|The Fort Vancouver Centennial Corporation {{hoped to}} sell {{commemorative}} half dollars at the planned celebration, and persuaded Representative Albert Johnson of Washington state to introduce {{legislation in the}} House of Representatives. In May 1924, he and Senator Wesley Jones, also of Washington state, introduced legislation in their houses of Congress for a half dollar commemorating the centennial of Fort Vancouver. The bills were not given any hearings. Indiana Representative Albert Vestal, {{the chairman of the}} House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, met with Johnson and persuaded him to introduce a bill for a medal instead. Vestal reasoned that the Treasury Department was opposing more commemorative coin issues, as these <b>were</b> <b>finding</b> their way into circulation and confusing the public. On February 3, 1925, Jones introduced a bill for a medal, and on the 12th, Johnson did the same.|$|E

The Mackenzie's position as Earl of Seaforth {{came to an}} end in 1716, and it seems to have been arranged that while the Clan Ross held the county seat the Munros would represent the Tain Burghs. To secure the burghs, control of three out of the five was necessary. Ross ascendancy was secure in Tain, and from 1716 to 1745 the Munros controlled Dingwall.|$|E

25|$|Henry James, Stein, Pound, and Eliot {{demonstrate}} {{the growth of}} an international perspective in American literature. American writers had long looked to European models for inspiration, but whereas the literary breakthroughs of the mid-19th century came from finding distinctly American styles and themes, writers from this period <b>were</b> <b>finding</b> ways of contributing to a flourishing international literary scene, not as imitators but as equals. Something similar was happening back in the States, as Jewish writers (such as Abraham Cahan) used the English language to reach an international Jewish audience.|$|E
