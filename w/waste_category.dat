5000|$|Predisease is a {{subclinical}} or prodromal {{vanguard of}} a disease state. Prediabetes and prehypertension are common examples. The nosology or epistemology of predisease is contentious, though, because there is seldom a bright line differentiating a legitimate concern for subclinical/prodromal/premonitory status (on one hand) and conflict of interest-driven disease mongering or medicalization (on the other hand). Identifying legitimate predisease can result in useful preventive measures, such as motivating the person to get a healthy amount of physical exercise, but labeling a healthy person with an unfounded notion of predisease can result in overtreatment, such as taking drugs that only help people with severe disease or paying for drug prescription instances whose benefit-cost ratio is minuscule (placing it in the <b>waste</b> <b>category</b> of CMS' [...] "waste, fraud, and abuse" [...] classification).|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of {{interest}} in Industrial Internet of Things lately. Its applications and their benefits have generally been widely researched, but the internal applications that product management use have not been sufficiently studied. In this thesis I study how product management can use and benefit from Industrial Internet of Things. I explore the different needs of product management, as well as different Industrial Internet applications and their benefits, to find how the needs could be fulfilled with the applications. I also use lean wastes and value to measure their benefits. All of product management’s objectives require information to aid in decision making. Some of the most important available information include customer information and product usage information. Industrial Internet can be used to build monitoring level applications that produce that information. Some of the most important applications include usage based customer segmentation, product faults analysis and sales support applications. These applications have been used as case studies in this work. Lean <b>waste</b> <b>categories</b> are good way of quantifying and evaluating the benefits of Industrial Internet applications. When the traditional manufacturing type <b>waste</b> <b>categories</b> are combined with information management <b>waste</b> <b>categories,</b> the different efficiency gains are easy to categorize. By estimating the value of the wastes and additional value created by the applications, as well as the costs of building the application, it is possible to evaluate their profitability. In both literature and empirical part, it was found that some of the information needs of product management can be fulfilled more efficiently than before, leading to the application being beneficial. They also tend to use the same technology stack as Industrial Internet applications in general, making them interesting...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{consists of}} an investigation on the incidence of residential construction waste in Texas. Construction waste has proved to {{have a negative effect}} on the economic health of construction companies and on the environment. To evaluate the current methods two waste diagnostic questionnaires were developed to identify the most frequent <b>waste</b> <b>categories</b> present in the job site affecting the final cost of the residential projects, the types of waste and their possible causes. The questionnaires were sent to one hundred and twenty construction companies. Three criteria were used to select companies for the study. First, only private companies were chosen. Second, only companies doing predominantly residential construction works were chosen. Third, only companies who are operating in Texas were chosen. The results showed that wood, drywall and concrete are the most frequent <b>waste</b> <b>categories</b> affecting the final cost in residential projects and waste of materials, over allocation of materials, rework, clarifications, unnecessary handling of materials, inefficient movement of workers, waste of space on site, and delays are the most dominant types of waste occurring in these categories...|$|R

40|$|Construction {{managers}} {{have for a}} long time focused their attention on conversion processes, with little attention given to flow activities, leading to uncertain flow processes, expansion of non value-adding activities, and reduction of output value. This paper investigates the incidence of non value-adding activities in construction projects in Indonesia and Australia, focusing on non-residential building and infrastructure projects. Data was collected via questionnaires and personal interviews targeting 99 respondents from Indonesia and 50 respondents from Australia. A quantitative approach was adopted for this research utilising the results of a questionnaire survey involving 53 variables that relate to non value-adding activities. The variables were then separated into two classifications: <b>waste</b> <b>categories</b> that contribute to a reduction in the value of construction productivity and waste cause variables that could be defined as factors producing waste. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the different perceptions amongst the respondents and to determine the key variables of non value-adding activities.

The ultimate goal of this effort was to develop {{an estimate of the}} life cycle costs for the aforementioned waste types. The Cost Estimation Model is a tool {{that can be used to}} calculate the costs of waste management at LANL for the aforementioned waste types, under several different scenarios.

30|$|For many of {{the results}} the sectors with the largest direct and total waste {{multipliers}} are sector Phosphate Rock (# 72) and sector Natural Rubber (# 28). This is because both these sectors have very large multipliers—in many cases three {{times larger than the}} other largest sectors in that <b>waste</b> <b>category.</b> The reason for Phosphate Rock and Natural Rubber having large multipliers is that they are the two smallest waste generating sectors of the Australian economy for 2008, and so produce a very small amount of waste. They are also small economic sectors and so relative to their economic activity they produce a very large amount of waste. This illustrates that just because a sector has a high multiplier it does not equate to the importance of that sector in terms of economic influence or that it currently produces a high tonnage of waste.|$|E

Limited quantities of oxygen can even lead to improved AD reactor performance under certain operating conditions.
