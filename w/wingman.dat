5|$|Gollob was {{credited}} with 150 aerial victories claimed in 340 combat missions, 144 of which were on the Eastern Front. He never lost a <b>wingman</b> in combat, nor was he shot down.|$|E
5|$|Here Voss began {{a lifelong}} {{friendship}} with another young {{pilot in the}} squadron, Manfred von Richthofen, who would soon gain fame as the Red Baron. They would later exchange family visits while on leave, and Richthofen would host the Voss family at his squadron's airfield. The friendship grew from Voss flying as Richthofen's <b>wingman</b> in combat, and disregarded the disparity in their family backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|On February 10, 1952, Davis flew his 59th {{and last}} combat {{mission of the}} war in an F-86E Sabre (tail number 51-2752). That day, he led a flight of four F-86s on a patrol near the Yalu River, near the Manchurian border. Davis' group {{was part of a larger}} UN force of 18 F-86s {{operating}} in the area. As Davis' patrol reached the border, one of his F-86 pilots reported he was out of oxygen causing Davis to order him to return to base with his <b>wingman.</b> As Davis continued patrolling with one <b>wingman,</b> Second Lieutenant William W. Littlefield, and cruising at an altitude of , they spotted a flight of 12 MiG-15s of the Chinese 4th Fighter Division heading in the direction of a group of US F-84 Thunderjets conducting a low-level bombing mission on North Korean communication lines.|$|E
50|$|The {{option of}} <b>wingmen</b> {{is much more}} present in this game than others in the series. A small golden plane icon flies down the screen at certain times which {{releases}} a <b>wingmen</b> icon. <b>Wingmen</b> add some extra firepower, but are vulnerable to enemy fire.|$|R

50|$|Aeroplane Acrobatics Challenge: The {{remaining}} {{players were}} asked to divide themselves into four mavericks and five <b>wingmen.</b> The four mavericks were to each take a turn in an aeroplane and describe how the plane would fly, and relay this information to the five <b>wingmen</b> down on the ground. The five <b>wingmen</b> on the ground were split into two groups and, based on the instructions they were given by the mavericks, would try to identify which of the aerobatic manoeuvres was being performed. The first two correct guesses would each win $2,000 into the kitty, and any further correct guesses would each win $3,000 for the kitty. The <b>wingmen</b> made only two correct guesses, therefore winning $4,000 for the kitty.|$|R
5|$|The Brillanten (Diamonds) were {{presented}} by Hitler at the Wolfsschanze, near Kętrzyn (German: Rastenburg) on 19October1943. Nowotny immediately {{went on a}} short vacation to Vienna before returning to his front-line unit. On 29October1943, Nowotny presented the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross to Oberfeldwebel Otto Kittel. In the days following, Nowotny flew as <b>wingman</b> to Karl Schnörrer, helping him accumulate further victories. On 11November, Anton Döbele was killed when he rammed an Il-2 Sturmovik. The next day, 12November1943, Schnörrer was severely injured after bailing out at low altitude. Schnörrer was replaced as Nowotny's <b>wingman</b> by Unteroffizier Ernst Richter. With Richter, Nowotny claimed his final two aerial victories on the Eastern Front on 15November1943. In total, Nowotny had claimed 255confirmed kills plus a further 50unconfirmed, before he was taken off combat duty.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Jerome Hudner Jr. (born August 31, 1924) is {{a retired}} officer of the United States Navy and a former naval aviator. He rose {{to the rank of}} captain, and {{received}} the Medal of Honor for his actions in trying {{to save the life of}} his <b>wingman,</b> Ensign Jesse L. Brown, during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|A {{flurry of}} action followed. On 1 July 1941 he {{expended}} 89 rounds and damaged a Bf 109E. Bader's section was attacked and Johnson out-turned his assailant. Firing, he saw glycol streaming behind it. On 14 July, the Tangmere Wing flew on Circus 48 to St Omer. Losing {{sight of the}} squadron, Johnson and his <b>wingman</b> proceeded inland at 3,000 feet after spotting three aircraft. Turning in behind them, he identified them as Bf 109Fs. Johnson dived so as {{to come up and}} underneath into the enemy's blind spot. Closing to 15 yards, he gave the trailing Bf 109 a two-second burst. The tail was blown off and his windshield was covered in oil from the Messerschmitt. Johnson saw the other Bf 109s spinning down out of control. Having also lost his <b>wingman,</b> Johnson disengaged. Climbing and crossing the coast at Etaples, Johnson bounced a Bf 109E. Giving chase in a dive to 2,000 feet and firing at 150 yards, he observed something flying off the Bf 109's starboard wing. Johnson could not see any more owing to the oil-covered windscreen and did not make a claim. His second victory was probably Unteroffizier (Corporal) R. Klienike, III./Jagdgeschwader 26 (Third Group, Fighter Wing 26) who was posted missing.|$|E
25|$|Gabreski {{was also}} criticized {{for having a}} poor {{attitude}} towards <b>wingmen.</b> One historian, citing five interviews with pilots and an unpublished manuscript by a sixth, observed that Gabreski flew the fastest aircraft available and failed to notice when his slower <b>wingmen</b> could not keep up. These pilots, reportedly afraid to fly with him, commented {{that he was more}} interested in personal achievement than in his <b>wingmen.</b> He was also criticized for a lack of discipline among his off-duty pilots and for allegedly encouraging exaggerated kill claims.|$|R

5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Korean War, Leyte was ordered to the Korean Peninsula, {{arriving}} in October 1950. Brown, an ensign, flew 20 combat missions before his F4U Corsair aircraft came under fire and crashed on a remote mountaintop on 4 December 1950 while supporting ground troops at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Brown died of his wounds despite the efforts of <b>wingman</b> Thomas J. Hudner, Jr., who intentionally crashed his own aircraft in a rescue attempt, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Bolt got {{his first}} {{victories}} of the deployment on 23 September {{when he was with}} a flight of 15 VMF-214 aircraft escorting B-24 Liberators back from a raid on Kahili. The bombers had been followed by 20 to 30 Zeros, and a dogfight quickly ensued. During the course of the engagement over Bougainville, Bolt scored two victories. His <b>wingman,</b> Ed Harper, also claimed a victory. For the next several weeks, the squadron operated out of Munda in the Solomon Islands.|$|E
5|$|Following a minor injury, Wurmheller {{was again}} posted to the fighter pilot school in Werneuchen as an instructor. Upon {{his return to}} front line duty in May 1942, he was posted to 1. Staffel and claimed 10 {{victories}} during May 1942 and a further 12 victories the following month. Among these claims were four Spitfires shot down on 31 May and five on 5 June 1942. Most of these missions were flown with Rudolf Pflanz as his <b>wingman.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following that, Graf {{was sent}} back to Germany on four weeks leave, during which he made a number of public appearances. While he was on leave, his long-time <b>wingman</b> and friend, Steinbatz, was killed on 15 June when his plane crashed after being hit by {{anti-aircraft}} fire. Steinbatz had been awarded the Oakleaves to his Knight's Cross on 2 June, and was posthumously awarded the Swords to his Knight's Cross for his 99 victories – the first non-commissioned officer in the Wehrmacht to be so honored.|$|E
5|$|He was {{assigned}} to the 1. Staffel of this Gruppe. Staffelkapitän was Oberleutnant Adolf Buhl. One of the Schwarmführer was Oberfeldwebel Helmut Goedert, to whom Marseille {{was assigned}} as <b>wingman.</b> Marseille already flew his very first combat mission on the next day, Wednesday 13 August 1940 and claimed his first aerial victory on 24 August 1940. In over little more than two years he would amass another 157 aerial victories. His 158 aerial victories were claimed in 382 combat missions.|$|E
5|$|In the {{unfolding}} plot, the player learns that Tachikawa and Elaine were killed (by the sabotage of their gun-ships) to procure microchips implanted in their brains. These chips can record a pilot's knowledge and combat skills; Nanosoft desired them {{to power the}} artificial intelligence in their weapons. The G-Police commander Horton is assassinated by Slater's traitorous <b>wingman</b> Ricardo, also to this end. The game ends with {{the destruction of a}} large spacecraft by Slater; the closing sequence reveals that Nanosoft had planned to use this to exert military dominance over other corporations.|$|E
50|$|During the Rann-Thanagar War miniseries the <b>Wingmen</b> {{were divided}} in several legions. There were legions attacking Rann, legions {{defending}} Thanagar and legions loyal to Onimar Synn. After {{the destruction of}} Thanagar and its following terraforming by green lanterns Kilowog and Ion, the reinstatement of the <b>Wingmen</b> Force was led by Carter Hall -- who was made its first official cop and later commissioner.|$|R

5|$|On 21 July, Johnson {{shared in}} the {{destruction}} of another Bf 109 with Pilot Officer Hepple. Johnson's <b>wingman</b> disappeared during the battle. Sergeant Mabbet was mortally wounded but made a wheels-up landing near St Omer. Impressed with his skilful flying while badly wounded, the Germans buried him with full honours. On 23 July, Johnson damaged another Bf 109. During this battle Adolf Galland, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG 26 was wounded; his life was saved by a recently installed armour plate behind his head.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} by historian Norman Fortier suggests that Mayer {{was shot down}} by Lieutenant Walter Gresham of the 358th Fighter Squadron of the 355th Fighter Wing. The claim is based on gun camera footage and recollections of Mayer's <b>wingman,</b> who was forced to bail out during the action. Mayer was buried at the cemetery of Beaumont-le-Roger, France, and in 1955 re-interred at the German War Cemetery in St. Desiré de Lisieux.|$|E
5|$|After {{pinpointing}} Hambleton's location, the Air Force bombarded {{the area}} around him {{for the next three}} days. On April 4, a flight of ten Douglas A-1 Skyraiders, half the total available in all of South Vietnam, attempted {{to pave the way for}} a SAR team, and it was badly shot up. Eight of the ten aircraft were damaged, two severely. The damage significantly affected the availability of the Skyraiders.At dusk, Major Jimmy D. Kempton flying F-4D 66-0265 with the 390th TFS (Danang Gunfighters) and a <b>wingman</b> entered from the coast under a descending 500 foot ceiling and dropped BLU 52 SAR ordnance on four sides of Hambleton's location, the last of SAR ordnance on April 4.|$|E
50|$|As wing leader, {{the player}} assigns pilots to primary and {{secondary}} missions. Secondary missions consist of gathering equipment, conquering/protecting territory, or rescuing pilots. Additionally, pilots can be assigned to flight school to receive new recruits. <b>Wingmen</b> have their own skill sets indicating how good they are at flying, shooting, and following orders. The player gives orders to <b>wingmen</b> to attack, disable a target, or escape from battle.|$|R

5|$|He {{claimed his}} {{first of two}} aerial {{victories}} in the Battle of France on 20May 1940. Ostermann had been entrusted with leading a Rotte, an element of two aircraft, with Unteroffizier (non-commissioned officer) Fritz Marcks as his <b>wingman.</b> The Schwarm (flight) led by Oberleutnant (Senior Lieutenant or First Lieutenant) Günther Scholz engaged eight French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406's fighters near Amiens with Ostermann, Marcks and Scholz claiming one each. His second aerial victory was achieved over a Curtiss Hawk-75 on 26May 1940. In a head on firing pass two 20mm shells tore off {{large parts of the}} aircraft's tail fin, which then collided with Osterrmann's starboard wing. The French pilot was observed to bail out with Ostermann managing to make a safe landing.|$|E
5|$|In June 1941, JG51 was {{transferred}} East {{to take part}} in Operation Barbarossa with 1 staffel. On the morning of the 22 June, Bär and his <b>wingman</b> Oberfeldwebel Heinrich Höfemeier were escorting a damaged Heinkel He 111 over German lines when they made contact with 18 Tupolev SB bombers from the 39 SBAP (Skorostnoy Bombardirovohchnyy Aviatsionny Polk—high speed bomber aviation regiment) and 10 SAD (Smeshannaya Aviatsionnaya Diviziya—composite aviation regiment). The German pilots attacked; Höfemeier claimed four, Bär two—though the former was wounded in the arm. The Germans noted the vulnerability of the Soviet aircraft which lacked self-sealing fuel tanks and had a propensity to burst into flames. More JG51 Bf 109s appeared and claimed six more. None of the 39 SBAP or 10 SAD aircraft returned home. Bär had achieved his 19th and 20th victory.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Britain, Mayer often {{flew over}} the English Channel as the <b>wingman</b> of Helmut Wick. He claimed three further {{victories}} in this campaign, all over Royal Air Force (RAF) Supermarine Spitfires, but was himself shot down or forced to land at the French Coast. Once he had to swim in the Channel for an hour before he was rescued. At the end of 1940 Mayer had four victories to his credit and JG2 was withdrawn from combat to replenish the heavy losses it had sustained. Following a short tour as fighter pilot instructor at the Jagdfliegerschule (fighter pilot school) in Werneuchen, Mayer {{was sent back to}} the Channel Front.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Wingmen</b> force wear non-winged helmets, {{protective}} military-style armour, metallic wings, carry energy blasters {{weapons and}} communication relay.
