5000|$|An {{argument}} {{often overlooked}} by those criticizing the payday and title loan industry {{is that these}} loans provide immediate financial aid {{in the face of}} emergencies and hardship. When a disaster strikes, those who are unbanked and have no means of obtaining loans through traditional credit institutions—primarily due to low credit scores—have nowhere else to turn. Small-dollar-credit products such as title loans prove to be invariably useful to these individuals and their families, granting short-term financial relief, provided the loan is paid off quickly, before interest payments compound excessively. Furthermore, once a borrower has reestablished his/her credit history, he/she may choose to take out a more traditional loan to pay off the title loan. While critics may point to this as a way in which individuals find themselves continuing to borrow, it has been shown in a recent study that even larger loan sizes <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> a higher risk of the borrower becoming trapped in a cycle of debt. Additionally, it was discovered that access to title lending decreased the chance an individual would experience bankruptcy, rather than increasing it as is commonly held. Additionally, the study found that larger loan sizes <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> a higher risk of the borrower becoming trapped in a cycle of debt.|$|E

Certain evidence explained that measurements of implicit self-esteem are delicate to put in context, which is further argued in later research of implicit self-esteem.|$|E

Through an online survey of open-ended questions, Perez, Espinoza, Ramos, Coronado, and Cortes [...] reported that in elementary school, 38% of undocumented students were civically engaged. In middle school, rates increased to 41%. In high school, 73% participated in civic engagement with 34% reporting spending more than 40 hours per year doing volunteer work. Also, 7% participated in social services, 3% were engaged in activism, 29% tutored other students, and 55% operated administrative work. In general, 86% of all respondents also participated in extracurricular activities during high school. In addition to college, 55% participated {{in some form of}} civic engagement.

One of her first investments made in this capacity strengthened the ties between Reddit and its de facto image host Imgur. She stated that a goal for the following year was making it easier for people to become Redditors. Pao became the interim Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in November 2014 after Yishan Wong resigned. Following efforts by Wong to scale back salary negotiation, Pao decided to give two final offers (one with more cash, one with more equity) to all prospective employees. As motivation for the change, she cited findings that women {{were more likely to be}} penalized for attempting to negotiate pay. After seeing that Reddit's previous offers <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> gender, Pao stated that the new policy was still the fairest, as well as a stepping stone to having publicly posted salaries. One of the largest changes to the website made under Pao was the banning of revenge porn in March 2015. Other social networks, that removed such images in the following months, have been widely referred to as following Reddit's model. In June and July 2015, Pao was the subject of criticism and harassment by Reddit users after five Reddit communities (subreddits) were banned for harassment and Reddit's director of talent was fired. A Change.org petition requesting her removal reached 200,000 signatures and on July 10, it was announced that Pao had resigned from Reddit [...] "by mutual agreement".|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} the normal aging effects on trabecular meshwork (TM) parameters using Fourier domain anterior segment {{optical coherence tomography}} (ASOCT) images. Patients and Methods. One eye from 45 participants with open angles was imaged. Two independent readers measured TM area, TM length, and area and length of the TM interface shadow from 3 age groups (18 – 40, 41 – 60, and 61 – 80). Measurements were compared using stepwise regression analysis. Results. The average TM parameters were 0. 0487 (± 0. 0092) [*]mm 2 for TM area, 0. 5502 (± 0. 1033) [*]mm for TM length, 0. 1623 (± 0. 341) [*]mm 2 for TM interface shadow area, and 0. 7755 (± 0. 1574) [*]mm for TM interface shadow length. Interobserver reproducibility coefficients ranged from 0. 45 (TM length) to 0. 82 (TM area). TM area and length <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> age.
