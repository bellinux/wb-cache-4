50|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>lathes</b> are {{machines}} used {{to manufacture}} and resurface {{the wheels of}} railway cars. When wheels become worn or compromised from excessive use, this tool {{can be used to}} re-cut and recondition the wheel of the train car. There are a number of different <b>wheel</b> <b>lathes</b> available including underfloor variations for resurfacing wheels that are still attached to the rail car, portable types that are easily transported for emergency wheel repairs, and CNC versions which utilize computer-based operating systems to complete the wheel repair.|$|R
50|$|The depot {{was officially}} opened by Patrick McLoughlin (MP) in October 2015. The {{completed}} main facilities building (MFB) was 256 by 40 m with five roads, each with full underfloor inspection facilities, {{and a light}} (2.5 t) crane. One road had two bogie drops, and a road was fitted with 25 kV AC electrification for static tests though the main building was unelectrified (third rail). <b>Wheel</b> <b>lathes</b> and carriage washes were outside the MFB.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, seven European {{countries}} pledged {{additional aid}} to the TAZARA and provided $150 million from 1987 to 1993. [...] The donors sought to reduce dependence of landlocked Zambia, Zimbabwe and Zaire on transport routes through Apartheid South Africa and war-torn Angola and Mozambique. [...] Sweden supplied 25 tank wagons and 350 HSO goods wagons, though the TAZARA was deemed to need 1,000 new wagons. Austria and Switzerland provided mechanized track maintenance equipment. [...] Switzerland and Sweden provided railburn repair equipment and training. Finland financed a rescue crane, rerailing equipment and accident prevention training. The European Economic Community (EEC) financed <b>wheel</b> <b>lathes</b> to maintain wagons and locomotives. Norway paid for human resource development.|$|R

50|$|As of July 7, 2005, {{the fleet}} {{consisted}} of ninety Class 420 train sets and sixty Class 423 sets. The Class 423 trains ply the S1 and S3 lines, while the 420s are in use along the other lines. Maintenance of the trains and power units {{takes place in}} the S-Bahn service yard at the original eastern terminus of line S1 in Plochingen. This yard is equipped with the latest <b>wheel</b> <b>lathes</b> and washing and graffiti-cleaning equipment. About 550 employees working in three shifts keep the S-Bahn in service. On May 5, 2009, Bombardier and Alstom announced they received an order for 83 Class 430 train sets (including an option for another 83 sets) to replace the Class 420 from 2012 on.|$|R
50|$|Beyond the {{platforms}} {{stand the}} locomotive shed, machine shop, paint and carpenters' shops in two rubble stone buildings {{built in the}} 1890s. Beyond them is the modern carriage shed which was erected in 1999, {{on the site of}} a coal yard, replacing the 1893 original which was demolished {{to make way for the}} Bus depot and headquarters block adjacent. The locomotive shed is capable of holding up to 12 locomotives in addition to which the single road workshop can store up to five locomotives at any one time. This facility features overhead lifting gear which is capable of lifting locomotive boilers from the frames to carry out maintenance; there is also a static beam engine and <b>wheel</b> <b>lathes</b> located in this shed, which also houses the blacksmith and plant room to the rear, the former being converted from a stores area in 2001.|$|R

50|$|In {{the mid to}} {{late 1990s}} the State Rail Authority {{auctioned}} most of the removable plant at the depot, the pit <b>wheel</b> <b>lathe</b> and crane from the <b>wheel</b> <b>lathe</b> shed, along with the drop table in No.2 Shed, both sanding sheds and the four 18000 imp gal diesel fuel tanks were also auctioned off. The machinery in the workshop/store building was also disposed of and the entire building was then used as a store for the neighbouring railcar maintenance centre, this building being the only one at the depot remaining in active railway use.|$|E
40|$|Economic Tyre Turning (ETT) is {{the process}} of turning wheels to a profile that has the same tread shape but a thinner flange than the design case, {{allowing}} less material to be removed from the wheel diameter. ETT can allow maintainers to extend wheel life, particularly when the wheel is approaching its minimum diameter. Modern <b>wheel</b> <b>lathes</b> are typically capable of turning such profiles but GB railway group standards do not currently permit their use. This paper investigates the effect of using ETT wheel profiles on the wheel-rail interface, in terms of wear and rolling contact fatigue (RCF) damage. It demonstrates how a Wheel Profile Damage Model (WPDM) can be used to accurately predict both the magnitude of wheel wear and the worn shape of the wheel for mileages exceeding 100, 000 miles since turning. The paper presents results for one suburban and one inter-city train fleet. It discusses the validation of the wear prediction using data from the real fleets and the calibration methodology used to adjust the Archard wear model within the WPDM to improve the accuracy of the simulation results for specific routes. Having established that wear patterns can be predicted with a good degree of accuracy, the paper then examines how the predicted wear performance changes when wheel profiles with thin flanges (four different flange thicknesses at 1 mm intervals from 28 mm to 25 mm) are used. The analysis is extended to predict the effect of using ETT on rail RCF for typical routes and operating conditions using a series of vehicle dynamic simulations. The analysis considers new 56 E 1 and 60 E 2 rails together with a selection of worn wheel and rail profiles...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{dynamical}} simulation of the lateral motion of railway vehicles, the increase of the mileage expressed by the distance covered between two tyre-profile renewal turnings of the <b>wheel</b> sets on <b>lathe</b> is examined {{as a function of}} the axle box-guidance stiffnesses in longitudinal and lateral directions with the given railway line and the stochastic lateral track unevennesses taken into consideration. With the help of applying a numerical opti-mization procedure, the numerical value of the stiffnesses of the axlebox guidance ensuring the maximum mileage are determined. 1...|$|R
50|$|Woodturning is {{the craft}} of using the wood lathe with {{hand-held}} tools to cut a shape that is symmetrical around the axis of rotation. Like the potter's <b>wheel,</b> the wood <b>lathe</b> is a simple mechanism which can generate a variety of forms. The operator {{is known as a}} turner, and the skills needed to use the tools were traditionally known as turnery. In pre-industrial England, these skills were sufficiently difficult to be known as 'the misterie' of the turners guild. The skills to use the tools by hand, without a fixed point of contact with the wood, distinguish woodturning and the wood lathe from the machinists lathe, or metal-working lathe.|$|R
50|$|Tires are {{reasonably}} thick, about 3 in, giving {{plenty of room}} for wear. Worn tires or tires with flats are re-profiled on a <b>wheel</b> <b>lathe</b> if there is sufficient thickness of material remaining.|$|E
50|$|The Class 507 and Class 508 {{electric}} {{multiple units}} are based at Kirkdale depot, regularly stabled {{in the back}} sidings near Bank Hall railway station. In 2006, a new small shunter was allocated to the depot to take sets into the new <b>wheel</b> <b>lathe.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2006, a new <b>wheel</b> <b>lathe</b> was {{installed}} at the depot in an area formerly used for storage of departmental equipment. The new lathe has ended the need to tow train sets to the lathe at Allerton TMD near Hunts Cross railway station with a Class 08 shunter.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 1568, a {{separate}} fly <b>wheel</b> powered a <b>lathe</b> via a drive belt. A master {{would cut the}} wood while an apprentice turned the crank on a huge wheel, often several feet in diameter. This was a continuous revolution lathe, which led to adaptation to external power sources such as water, steam, and electricity. This lathe evolved into the 'queen of machine tools' which {{made it possible to}} turn parts for other machinery. The Holtzapffels developed ornamental turning lathes from the continuous revolution lathe combined with metal-working innovations like the automatic slide rest. These lathes worked from geared patterns to cut designs in hardwoods such as ebony. They were favored as a hobby by European princes, meriting a mention by Tolstoy in War and Peace (1869).|$|R
40|$|Wheel sets of rail vehicles, {{especially}} of high-speed trains, {{are subject to}} high dynamic loads. In order to detect possible defects {{at an early stage}} the wheel sets have to be inspected periodically applying non-destructive testing techniques. Both wheels and axles have to be checked for material defects. In close cooperation with industrial partners we have developed methods and equipment for the in-service inspection of wheels and axles in maintenance workshops. Stationary systems are used to inspect disassembled wheel sets which have to undergo a refurbishment process. The inspection is run after re-profiling the <b>wheels</b> on a <b>lathe</b> and before final assembly of the wheel set. Mobile testing equipment is applied to inspect wheel sets which need no refurbishment. In this case the inspection can be carried out on the train which saves the costly dismantling of wheel sets and is also beneficial in terms of train availability. A fast and early detection of crack-like defects in the near surface zone of the tread of railway wheels can even be performed while the train is passing over stationary ultrasonic probes at speeds of up to 15 km/h. This system based on the Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer technique EMAT can inspect all the wheels of a train within a few minutes and allows a fast check of the condition of the tread. The presentation introduces ultrasonic testing systems for wheels and axles of high-speed train sets as well as combined ultrasonic and eddy-current testing stations for wheel sets of passenger trains and freight cars featuring block brakes. Special requirements for new installations of the wheel and axle testing systems requests development of state-of-the-art miniaturized front-end ultrasonic and eddy-current test instrumentation. Innovations in that regard offer new dimensions for the concept and design of such wheel and axle testing systems, including features that provide a minimum of effort in maintenance of the inspection systems. Due to the small size of the electronic modules those can be placed in close proximity to the transducer assembly. High-speed networking techniques ensure the transfer of all the digital ultrasonic and eddy-current data acquired from the front-end modules to the workstation being responsible for data acquisition and analysis. The paper will give an overview of those systems, describe their function as well as their operability in real customer service and will conclude with some thoughts on lessons learned and possible ways ahead...|$|R
50|$|Members of {{the class}} have visited the <b>wheel</b> <b>lathe</b> at Delec Locomotive Depot in Sydney and one was on display at Sydney Central for the 100th Anniversary of Clyde Engineering in 1998.

50|$|It {{closed on}} 8 February 1997 with {{operations}} {{transferred to the}} new Southbank depot, although trams continued to visit the depot to use the <b>wheel</b> <b>lathe</b> for a few months. The 2.8 hectare site was sold in November 1997 to developer Renak Holdings for $19 million. It was demolished in June 1998 and redeveloped as office accommodation.|$|E
50|$|If {{the flat}} spot is very small, the rail vehicle {{will be able}} to {{continue}} being used. The fault is removed later in the wheelset turning process, using a <b>wheel</b> <b>lathe.</b> However, because of the heat suffered while being dragged along the rail and the impacts suffered afterward, these wheels are more likely to break due to changes in the alloy structure.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, the {{allocation}} of the depot included Classes 20, 26, 27, 37 and 47, and DMU Classes 101 and 104. Meanwhile, Class 08 shunters were also stabled. At that time, the depot had a <b>wheel</b> <b>lathe</b> and two snowploughs. The depot's logo is commonly noted as having been a Scottie dog, however it was more closely reflective of a West Highland White Terrier.|$|E
50|$|The main {{contractor}} for the conversion was VolkerFitzpatrick. The conversion work was practically complete by late 2015. The remodelled six road 400 m main building included : new inspection pits; a complete trainlift jack set for two five car trains on road 3, a bogie drop on road 4; an overhead crane on road 5; and a <b>wheel</b> <b>lathe</b> on road 6. Three {{of the six}} roads had overhead electrification.|$|E
