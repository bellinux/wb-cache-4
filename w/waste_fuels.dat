50|$|An {{interesting}} footnote on the {{wet process}} history is that some manufacturers have in fact made very old wet process facilities profitable {{through the use of}} <b>waste</b> <b>fuels.</b> Plants that burn <b>waste</b> <b>fuels</b> enjoy a negative fuel cost (they are paid by industries needing to dispose of materials that have energy content and can be safely disposed of in the cement kiln thanks to its high temperatures and longer retention times). As a result, the inefficiency of the wet process is an advantage—to the manufacturer. By locating waste burning operations at older wet process locations, higher fuel consumption actually equates to higher profits for the manufacturer, although it produces correspondingly greater emission of CO2. Manufacturers who think such emissions should be reduced are abandoning the use of wet process.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, the U. S. cement {{industry}} has reaped the rewards of extremely high consumption. Record outputs have been seen reaching over 96 % of capacity. While this window of opportunity presents itself, many cement producers are actively seeking ways to maximize production. One cement producer that operates several wet process cement rotary kilns and burns supplemental <b>waste</b> <b>fuels</b> had a unique challenge: to maximize its output {{in order to meet}} the high demand for cement and increase the utilization of <b>waste</b> <b>fuels.</b> In order to meet both objectives and stay well within the boiler and industrial furnace (BIF) regulations, they looked for ways to improve the kiln operation. The company knew that the baghouse had a significant impact on its overall plant operations. Using standard fiberglass fabric filter media, the plant was experiencing continuous reactive maintenance, short overall filter media life and occasional opacity issues. It was proposed that changing to a filter media with lower filter resistance would allow more flexible operation in the kiln. The project began with a trial comparing the traditional fiberglass filter media to the proposed filter media, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane/fiberglass fabric. During a one-year trial, a comprehensive evaluation would determine if there would be an acceptable return on the investment in higher priced filter bags. Five years after the trial began and four years (to date) after complete implementation in two kiln baghouses, the findings include: fewer incidents of high opacity, longer bag life, more consistent differential pressure, and less preventive maintenance. This improved baghouse operation enabled the company to meet their objectives of high production and increased use of alternative <b>waste</b> <b>fuels.</b> Based on the results to date, the company recently replaced the filter bags in the remaining kiln baghouse with ePTFE membrane bags...|$|E

40|$|Biomass-based <b>waste</b> <b>fuels</b> {{are used}} in many {{industrial}} applications since combustion of biomass gives no net emissions of carbon dioxide. Some <b>waste</b> <b>fuels,</b> e. g. RDF (refuse derived fuels), contain not only biomass, but also some fossil material, hence can be classified as partially CO 2 neutral fuels.

In the present study, the biomass fraction of artificially made RDF was determined by means of the SDM (se- lective dissolution method) in total carbon basis and also by the 14 C method in total carbon, weight and calorific value bases. Then the relative accuracywas compared using findings from a previous study. SDM shows very high accuracy in weight and calorific value basis. The 14 C method gives comparable results in most cases, but shows considerable deviations for some samples. The SDM results in total carbon basis show less accuracy compared to the other bases. When performing the SDM analysis in total carbon basis, one should correct for ash forming matter in order to increase the accuracy of the biomass fraction determination...|$|E

40|$|The {{energetic}} {{recovery of}} biomass and biomass waste {{has a long}} history in Austria. The available infrastructure consists of 17 fluidized bed combustors (FBC) with a total thermal capacity of 700 MW and three fluidized bed gasifiers with a total thermal capacity of 33 MW. Eight FBC plants have circulating beds while the other three have bubbling beds. In Austria, FBCs for biomass are employed in the heat and electricity producing industry, in the pulp and paper industry, and in the sewage sludge treatment. Additionally, the heat and electricity industry employs the three fluidized bed gasifiers. The applied fuel can be related to the respected industries: the heat and power industry usually utilizes biomass in form of wood chips, whereas the pulp and paper industry utilizes biomass waste like bark, waste wood and fibrous rejects. In this work the properties of biomass and biomass <b>waste</b> <b>fuels</b> of Austrian FBCs as well as the fuel impact on pre-processing and flue gas treatment are evaluated. In this context an overview of the utilized fuels is created and fuel properties like calorific value, content of impurities, availability, etc. are compared.

The main focus of this work is the comparison of fuels based on biomass and biomass waste and the investigation of their benefits and limitations.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} impact of various biomass fuels and combustion conditions on the NOx emissions during biomass co-firing. Fossil fuels dominated the energy scenario since the industrial revolution. However, in the last decades, increasing concerns about their availability and environmental risks related with their extensive utilization, together with rising oil prices are favouring the development of renewable energies. Increasing the share of renewable energy sources in the power generation sector is strongly promoted in the EU, and the European Commission has set as goal to double its current global share by 2010. Co-firing biomass and <b>waste</b> <b>fuels</b> with fossil fuels appears as a promising route to introduce renewable fuels in the power sector and reduce CO 2 emissions. Biomass co-firing has been implemented at several coal-fired units, generally limited to about 5 % of the thermal input. This practice offers several advantages. Besides CO 2 emission reduction, it enables flexibility in fuel supply as power operators are not dependent on a constant supply of a particular fuel. Economically, co-firing is encouraged in many countries as fiscal incentives are available for power operators going "green" and emission trading spreads. In order to increase the fired biomass share, an important requirement {{that has to be}} met by power operators concerns NOx emissions, as future EU targets tighten. It is therefore crucial to characterize the combustion of biomass and <b>waste</b> <b>fuels</b> with pulverized coal, in order to minimize NOx formation. Experimental and modelling tools have been used to investigate the NOx formation from fuel-bound nitrogen of biomass fuels and coal/biomass mixtures.
