5|$|A {{classic example}} of a random <b>walk</b> <b>is</b> known as the simple random walk, which is a {{stochastic}} process in discrete time with the integers as the state space, {{and is based on}} a Bernoulli process, where each iid Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, the simple random walk takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, say, , or decreases by negative one with probability , so index set of this random <b>walk</b> <b>is</b> the natural numbers, while its state space is the integers. If the , this random <b>walk</b> <b>is</b> called a symmetric random walk.|$|E

5|$|The high walk of crocodilians, {{with the}} belly {{and most of}} the tail being held off the ground, is unique among living reptiles. It {{somewhat}} resembles the walk of a mammal, with the same sequence of limb movements: left fore, right hind, right fore, left hind. The low <b>walk</b> <b>is</b> similar to the high walk, but without the body being raised, and {{is quite different from the}} sprawling walk of salamanders and lizards. The animal can change from one walk to the other instantaneously, but the high <b>walk</b> <b>is</b> the usual means of locomotion on land. The animal may push its body up and use this form immediately, or may take one or two strides of low walk before raising the body higher. Unlike most other land vertebrates, when crocodilians increase their pace of travel they increase the speed at which the lower half of each limb (rather than the whole leg) swings forward; by this means, stride length increases while stride duration decreases.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the pool, steps lead down to {{a smaller}} {{rectangular}} pool at right-angles to the first. The steps and the retaining wall at {{the end of the}} terrace are listed at GradeII. The retaining walls of the pool are also listed at GradeII. This area contains two statues by Jonathan Kenworthy. From this pool a path, known as the Broad Walk, stretches to the north and the south. At each end of the Broad <b>Walk</b> <b>is</b> a building designed by Waterhouse for the 3rdMarquess. At the north end is the Parrot House, dating from 1881â€“83, which is built in yellow terracotta. It is the form of a round colonnaded Ionic temple with a shallow domed roof. Above the colonnade and the inner drum are concentric balustrades. A flight of eleven steps leads up to the south entrance. The Parrot House is listed at GradeII. At the south end of the Broad <b>Walk</b> <b>is</b> a loggia, dating from about 1880. This is built in buff and red sandstone. At its front are three arches between Ionic columns. The loggia was built to enclose a Roman altar which was found in 1821 at a spring near Boughton and brought to Eaton in 1822. The loggia is listed at GradeII. To the east and west of the loggia are reconstructed Roman columns, each of which is listed at GradeII.|$|E
5|$|South of the loggia is the Dutch Tea Garden, {{which was}} laid out by C.E.Mallows in about 1905. The garden {{contains}} the Tea House which was designed by John Douglas. This has a cruciform plan and is a half-timbered building on a sandstone plinth. The roof is of red tiles, and sweeps upwards to a small spire surmounted by a weathercock. It is listed at GradeII. In {{the centre of the}} garden is a statue of Mercury and in front of the Tea House are two stone Talbots. To the north of the Tea House, on the path leading to the Broad <b>Walk,</b> <b>is</b> a pair of wrought iron gates made in 1913 for the 2ndDuke.

5|$|The orchard {{contains}} {{fruit trees}} such as quinces, medlars, crab {{apples and pears}} are underplanted with spring-flowering meadow plants such as snakeshead fritillaries, camassias, narcissus, cowslips and lady's smock. The orchard is crossed by wide mown paths meeting at a central sundial. Originally four weeping elms were situated at {{the four corners of}} the garden, but they succumbed to Dutch elm disease in the early seventies and were replaced in 1973 by four weeping ash trees which make inviting 'houses'. The orchard can be viewed from the raised walk on its east side, another idea copied from Avebury Manor. A main path known as the Long <b>walk</b> <b>is</b> based on the Long Walk at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire, although it is on a smaller scale. It is a plain grassed walkway connecting the Raised Walk with the Pond Garden.|$|E
