25|$|When using RFLP, the {{theoretical}} {{risk of a}} coincidental match is 1 in 100 billion (100,000,000,000), although the practical risk is actually 1 in 1000 because monozygotic twins are 0.2% of the human population. Moreover, the rate of laboratory error is almost certainly higher than this, and often actual laboratory procedures {{do not reflect the}} theory under which the coincidence probabilities <b>were</b> <b>computed.</b> <b>For</b> example, the coincidence probabilities may be calculated based on the probabilities that markers in two samples have bands in precisely the same location, but a laboratory worker may conclude that similar—but not precisely identical—band patterns result from identical genetic samples with some imperfection in the agarose gel. However, in this case, the laboratory worker increases the coincidence risk by expanding the criteria for declaring a match. Recent studies have quoted relatively high error rates, which may be cause for concern. In the early days of genetic fingerprinting, the necessary population data to accurately compute a match probability was sometimes unavailable. Between 1992 and 1996, arbitrary low ceilings were controversially put on match probabilities used in RFLP analysis rather than the higher theoretically computed ones.

2500|$|The fall of Rangoon cut off {{the routine}} import of Burmese rice into India and Ceylon. [...] In India, {{according}} to the Famine Commission's, Final Report, [...] "the areas most affected were parts of the provinces of Bombay and Madras and the States of Cochin and Travancore." [...] The imports from Burma normally met India's supply deficit in rice, which totaled 1,750,000 tons. In Bengal, the net import for which actual receipts and despatch documents existed, was on average 50,000 tons annually for 1932–1937, [...] and 159,000 tons annually for 1938–42, the highest levels being recorded for the years 1934 and 1939 at 364,000 tons and 382,000 tons respectively. [...] But, according to the Final Report, there was also unrecorded import into Bengal [...] "by country boat from Assam and from Arakan in Burma" [...] the extent of which was not known accurately. [...] The Commission proposed that this import was {{of the order of}} 50,000 tons annually for 1932–1937 and 100,000 tons annually for 1938–1942. [...] Aggregate consumption was also computed, not by a direct approach using census-based population statistics whose margin of error was too high, but by indirect estimation from a combination of the available values of annual supply, net import, carry-over stock at the year's beginning, and the same at the year's end. [...] However, as carry-over stock in any individual year could not be accurately estimated, averages <b>were</b> <b>computed</b> <b>for</b> a longer periods under the expectation that the carry-over stock at {{the beginning and the end}} of the periods were negligible compared to the total consumption during the periods. [...] The commission also made adjustments in annual supply, which had errors stemming from the assessment of cultivated acreage under the permanent settlement in Bengal. In this way, average consumption for the 15-year period 1928 to 1942 was computed to be 8.14 million tons annually for unadjusted acreage, and 9.18 million tons for the adjusted. Annual consumption was then estimated by assuming that it veered off the unadjusted average by increments, or decrements, of 0.10 million tons every year, and off the adjusted average by those of 0.12 million tons. [...] Using these data in the Famine Inquiry Commission report, the percentage of net imports—either recorded only, or both recorded and unrecorded, computed relative to a 15-year- or 5-year time period, and to consumption- or supply averages, which were either unadjusted or adjusted—were found by scholars to be 1.1% and 1.4% in one instance, and [...] "less than 4%" [...] in another. Using different data, P. C. Mahalanobis estimated the net imports to be on average 1% of aggregate supply for the period 1934–39, estimating their highest value for a single year at 5% for 1934, and noting that [...] "the physical quantities of net imports was never large." [...] While acknowledging that the influx of Burma rice was a factor in stabilizing prices, as it prevented hoarding or cornering the market, he concluded that there was [...] "chronic but a growing shortage of rice in Bengal," [...] which had not affected prices or imports because a large number of people, lacking the money to buy enough food, often made do with less than what was enough.|$|E

5000|$|The 6.0 system {{went through}} various {{versions}} {{in terms of}} how scores were tabulated and compared with each other. Until 1980, for example, each judges' weighted scores from each phase of the competition were added together before computing ordinals, instead of using factored placements. Because compulsory figures were scored using a wider range of marks than the short program or free skating, this system allowed skaters to take a large lead in that segment of the competition, which made them effectively unreachable in later segments. The system of factored placements, in which ordinals <b>were</b> <b>computed</b> <b>for</b> each competition segment separately and factors applied to the relative placements rather than the raw marks, was proposed as early as 1971 by former Hungarian champion and World Referee Pál Jaross, and finally adopted for the 1980-1981 season. In 1998, the method by which placements within a segment were computed was changed from [...] "best of majority" [...] -- ranking skaters by the highest ordinal for which they received a majority vote of the judges—to a system of [...] "one-by-one" [...] comparisons between the ordinals of all the skaters.|$|E
