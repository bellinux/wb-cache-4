500|$|Both Hollywood trade {{publications}} were positive: David Hunter of The Hollywood Reporter predicted {{it to be}} a sleeper hit {{and called}} it [...] "outstanding," [...] while Lael Loewenstein of Variety called it [...] "a visually appealing, well-crafted film [...] an unalloyed success." [...] Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly commented, [...] "I have long thought that I was born without the gene that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to be emotionally drawn in by drawings. That is, until I saw The Iron Giant." [...] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed that the storytelling was far superior to other animated films, and cited the characters as plausible and noted the richness of moral themes. Jeff Millar of the Houston Chronicle agreed with the basic techniques as well, and concluded the voice cast excelled with a great script by Tim McCanlies. Amid the positive reviews, a mildly negative review came from The Washington Post Stephen Hunter, who opined, [...] "The movie — as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is — has the annoyance of incredible smugness." ...|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{currently}} {{resides in}} San Miguel de Allende, {{a city in}} central Mexico, but for years she lived and wrote in San Antonio, Texas, in her briefly controversial [...] "Mexican-pink" [...] home with [...] "many creatures little and large." [...] In 1990 when Pilar E. Rodríguez Aranda asked Cisneros in an interview for the Americas Review why she has never married or started a family, Cisneros replied, [...] "I've never seen a marriage that is as happy as my living alone. My writing is my child and I don't want anything to come between us." [...] She has elaborated elsewhere that she enjoys living alone because it gives her time to think and write. In {{the introduction to the}} third edition of Gloria E. Anzaldúa's Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, Cisneros wrote: [...] "It's why I moved from Illinois to Texas. So that the relatives and family <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> the liberty to disappear into myself. To reinvent myself if I had to. As Latinas, we have to... Because writing is like putting your head underwater." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....There's {{always the}} hope that in some way, someday – and there are {{precedents}} within scripture – your hope would be that God would draw you back to him. All {{those who have the}} knowledge of Christ would seek to walk with him again. People would say, 'Billy Wright, that's impossible,' but nothing's impossible if you have faith in God. I would hope that he <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to come back. I'm not walking with God.... Without getting into doctrine, without getting too deep, it is possible to have walked with God and to fall away and still belong to God".|$|E
6000|$|... "If your lordship <b>would</b> only <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> {{to recall}} to your memory the {{circumstances}} of the case,--how you, yourself, allocated--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. I {{was going}} to have added, if your irascible temper <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> <b>me,</b> that the notorious smuggler, Jim Cuttance--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose they}} {{overcharged}} you because a city man wanted the animals. But {{of course you}} <b>would</b> not <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to be robbed." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2011, an Adelaide woman {{contacted}} biological anthropologist Maciej Henneberg {{about an}} identification card of an H. C. Reynolds {{that she had}} found in her father's possessions. The card, a document issued in the United States to foreign seamen during World War I, was given to Henneberg in October 2011 for comparison of the ID photograph {{to that of the}} Somerton man. While Henneberg found anatomical similarities in features such as the nose, lips and eyes, he believed they were not as reliable as the close similarity of the ear. The ear shapes shared by both men were a [...] "very good" [...] match, although Henneberg also found what he called a [...] "unique identifier;" [...] a mole on the cheek that was the same shape and in the same position in both photographs."Together with the similarity of the ear characteristics, this mole, in a forensic case, <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to make a rare statement positively identifying the Somerton man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jim Crace {{moved to}} Birmingham in 1965 {{to study at}} what is now Birmingham City University, where his contemporaries {{included}} the novelist and journalist Gordon Burn, whose later writing blurred the lines between fact and fiction to examine the trauma, spectacle and dysfunction of contemporary celebrity, and new gothic psychological novelist Patrick McGrath. Crace wrote short stories from the early 1970s and published his first novel Continent in 1986. Still living in Moseley {{in the south of}} the city, his reputation unusually combines both a broad popular readership and substantial acclaim among critics and academics. His work sits outside the social realist mainstream of English novelists, having more in common with European and South American authors such as Italo Calvino, Vladimir Nabokov, Franz Kafka, W. G. Sebald, Jorge Luis Borges or Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Although his novels have settings as diverse as the bronze age, the Judaean Desert in the time of Christ, an 1830s Cornish fishing village and an invented eighth continent, Crace claims that the subject of all of his books is present-day Birmingham, seen through [...] "some idea or inspiration that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to take the subject and dislocate it to another place and time to see if it cracks, if it bends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu {{opposed the}} Oslo accords from their inception. In 1993, he {{dedicated}} a chapter, entitled [...] "Trojan Horse", {{of his book}} A Place Among the Nations to argue against the Oslo Peace Process. He asserted that Amin al-Husseini {{had been one of}} the masterminds of the Holocaust, and that Yasser Arafat was heir to the former's 'alleged exterminationist Nazism.' During his term as prime minister in the late 1990s, Netanyahu consistently reneged on commitments made by previous Israeli governments as part of the Oslo peace process, leading American peace envoy Dennis Ross to note that [...] "neither President Clinton nor Secretary [...] Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace." [...] In a 2001 video, Netanyahu, reportedly unaware he was being recorded, said: [...] "They asked me before the election if I'd honor ," [...] "I said I would, but... I'm going to interpret the accords in such a way that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders. How did we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones are security zones; as far as I'm concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, miss!" [...] said Mr. Guppy, rising {{when he saw}} me rise. [...] "But <b>would</b> you <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> the favour of a minute's private conversation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! if Dickory were here," [...] gasped Dame Charter, [...] "he {{would turn}} the boat himself; he <b>would</b> never <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to be taken among those awful wretches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} be afraid for me, Jeanne," [...] he urged. [...] "The Scarlet Pimpernel cares for all his followers; he <b>would</b> never <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to run {{unnecessary}} risks." ...|$|R
60|$|What could I say to all this? Really nothing; and I {{hoped he}} <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to be silent. The storm recommenced.|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, and she <b>would!</b> <b>Allow</b> <b>me</b> {{to congratulate}} you, Mrs. Sydney," [...] added Tom, {{advancing}} with his wedding-reception bow and a wicked look at Fanny.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{you seen}} {{anything}} of your brother?" [...] I asked, putting {{the question in}} as careless a tone as my devouring anxiety <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to assume.|$|E
6000|$|... "If Miss Houghton <b>would</b> just <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to run {{round and}} bring {{something}} in. Yes? May I? That {{would be so}} much more cheerful. What is your choice, gentlemen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am. They {{would have}} been over now and passed if you <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> to obey my reason, and {{to tell him the}} whole story of your former love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I thought," [...] he answered, [...] "that you <b>would</b> never <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to {{make love}} to you, I should feel like {{following}} this cigar." [...] He threw it into the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Really, my love,' said Mrs Skewton in her mildest manner; for her daughter's {{face was}} threatening; 'if you <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> {{to offer a}} word, I should recommend--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “If you <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me,</b> my lord,” {{returned}} Archie, “what I {{have to say}} is {{very serious}} to me; and be pleased to be humorous after I am gone!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Bultiwell," [...] he protested, [...] "you {{are very}} hard on me. I wish you <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> {{a few words of}} explanation. Will you--will you lunch with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you <b>would</b> only <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> {{to explain}} myself, sir, you would view my conduct {{in a totally}} {{different}} light. I am ready to marry to-morrow, if the lady will have me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{is the day}} of Saint Mariä Kleophä, my name-day. She <b>would</b> not <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to {{be eaten}} by wolves on her day. Such a thing could not be thought of. You, yes, but not me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{the worst}} of it," [...] said the bishop. [...] "It {{would have been so}} much better for himself if he <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> to provide quietly for the {{services}} till the trial be over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> {{to pay for}} {{our board}} and lodging, of course?" [...] I {{answered}} interrogatively. [...] "Otherwise I mustn't trespass so far as that on your kind indulgence." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. In a few moments. Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me,</b> I {{would like}} {{to say a few words}} to her, and we will join you later on.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me,</b> my lord," [...] {{returned}} Archie, [...] "what I {{have to say}} is {{very serious}} to me; and be pleased to be humorous after I am gone!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{leave for}} the public to decide how far the {{treatment}} I have related deserved acknowledgements … my judgement told me I could not with sincerity return thanks my feelings <b>would</b> not <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to give vent to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I fear, Comrade Jackson,' he said, 'that the old noblesse oblige {{traditions of}} the Psmiths <b>would</b> not <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to do that. No. We will stroll gently, after a light lunch, to Trafalgar Square, and hail a taxi.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I suppose so," [...] {{answered}} King Rinkitink, with a laugh. [...] "But {{what else}} could I do? My subjects <b>would</b> not <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to go anywhere at all, if they knew it. So I just ran away." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently, I {{heard a noise}} again, {{and woke}} up quietly, without starting, but just {{opened my eyes and}} peered about as well as the dim light of the little oil-lamp <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] she said, {{with obvious}} hesitation, [...] "if you <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> {{to give you}} the things, sir, and then you give them to Ingua, as if they came from yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Smith. [...] "That is--no. I found {{a broken}} {{statuette}} {{hidden in the}} sand outside the tomb. It is of the queen, but I thought perhaps you <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to keep this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Never mind, ma,’ said Miss Emma Porter, in {{colloquy}} {{with her}} respected relative, {{and trying to}} look unconcerned; ‘if they had invited me, you know that neither you nor pa <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> {{to take part in}} such an exhibition.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{you have}} come to a case in point. You often dined with Mr. Effingham before he went abroad, and yet you <b>would</b> never <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to ask Mr. Effingham to dine with us. That is what I call meanness." ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{there was}} much {{suppressed}} excitement, and some one thrust a pair of field-glasses into my hand, but either they were wrongly set or the state of my nerves <b>would</b> not <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to see through them. So Quick took them and reported.|$|R
