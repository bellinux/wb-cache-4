25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the behavior of the theory at large and small momenta, a key quantity is the propagator. For a Yang–Mills theory <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> both the gluon and the ghost propagators. At large momenta (ultraviolet limit), the question was completely settled with the discovery of the asymptotic freedom. In this case it is seen that the theory becomes free (trivial ultraviolet fixed point for renormalization group) and both the gluon and ghost propagators are those of a free massless particle. The asymptotic states of the theory are represented by massless gluons that carry the interaction. The coupling runs to zero as we will see in the next section.|$|E
25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E

2500|$|It goes on {{to comment}} that on a general level the {{reasoning}} used by the atheists for denying the existence of God is based {{in the fact that}} [...] "we ascribe to God affections that are human, or we attribute so much strength and wisdom to our minds" [...] that we presume to understand that which God can and ought to do.

2500|$|..... Machiavelli {{sheds light}} on Churchill. The Italian notes that virtues and vices are often {{symbiotic}} rather than antithetical. Thus people say, 'Hannibal was a great general – too bad he was cruel', when the likelihood is that Hannibal was great {{in part because he}} was cruel. So here <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the probability that Churchill was great in 1940 in part because he was too pugnacious, stubborn, deluded, and conservative (in the deepest sense) to be able to adjust to the New Order in Europe – traits he had shown in the matter of India." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bernhard Ringrose Wise (10 February 1858 – 19 September 1916) was an Australian politician.

Even then it does not tell the whole truth. It is claimed that the play is historical: but history is easy to misuse." [...] In New York, Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise told the press after seeing The Birth of a Nation that the film was [...] "an indescribable foul and loathsome libel on a race of human beings". In Boston, the civil rights activist William Monroe Trotter organized demonstrations against the film, which he predicted was going to worsen race relations, while Booker T. Washington wrote a newspaper column asking readers to boycott the film. In Washington D.C, the Reverend Francis James Grimké published a pamphlet entitled [...] "Fighting a Vicious Film" [...] that challenged the historical accuracy of The Birth of a Nation on a scene-by-scene basis.|$|E
