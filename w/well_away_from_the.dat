5|$|For {{the next}} decade, Galileo stayed <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> controversy. He revived his project {{of writing a}} book on the subject, {{encouraged}} by the election of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the condemnation of Galileo in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission.|$|E
5|$|On {{the voyage}} across the Atlantic, Bryant interviewed ambulance-service troops {{and others on}} board the Espagne and wrote news stories about them and about the threat of torpedo attacks. In France, she {{gathered}} most of her material <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Western Front, and sent her news stories to Reed, who edited them and forwarded them to Wheeler.|$|E
5|$|Sources differ {{about the}} cities hosting {{some of the}} early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders are {{generally}} housed <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> students, and partly because after the competition the students did not always stay based in one city {{for the rest of the}} IMO. The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.|$|E
50|$|This species visits flowers; it also {{commonly}} {{rests on}} leaves. It often emits a buzzing sound when resting. It is a notable wanderer {{and can be}} found <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> water. <b>The</b> larvae feed on detritus.|$|R
25|$|A {{pending lawsuit}} kept <b>Wells</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> studio for several months, {{as she and}} Gordy {{brokered}} the contract details, with Wells fighting to gain {{a larger share of}} the royalties she'd had earned during her tenure with Motown. Finally, Wells invoked a clause that allowed her to leave the label, advising the court that her original contract was invalid, as she had signed while she was still a minor. Wells won her lawsuit and was awarded a settlement, leaving Motown officially in early 1965, whereupon she accepted a lucrative ($200,000) contract with 20th Century Fox Records.|$|R
60|$|They met, a {{few moments}} later, in the garden. Mr. Collins threw the jack with great {{precision}} and they played an end during which his superiority was apparent. They strolled together across <b>the</b> lawn, <b>well</b> <b>away</b> now <b>from</b> <b>the</b> house. For the first time Granet dropped his careless tone.|$|R
5|$|Burnell built {{extensively}} at Acton Burnell Castle, {{and large}} parts of his house have survived. It was substantially different in plan from the older hall-style houses, which had the private quarters {{at the back of}} a large hall. At Acton Burnell the bishop's quarters were <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> building's main public spaces, and included a latrine. The house was not quite a castle, but it was designed to have some defensive capability. The overall form of the structure was of a fortified hall-house, much like the Norman-era hall-keeps. He also built the chapel and great hall in the Bishop's Palace in Wells.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge, Iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central Pacific; it reached hurricane status on September 9 while 470miles (760km) south-southeast of Hilo. The subtropical ridge, which typically keeps hurricanes <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian Islands, weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed Iniki {{to turn to the}} northwest. With very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures, Iniki steadily intensified, and attained major hurricane status on September 10 while south-southwest of the island chain.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{evolution in}} dreadnought protection {{came with the}} development of the anti-torpedo bulge and torpedo belt, both attempts to protect against underwater damage by mines and torpedoes. The purpose of underwater protection was to absorb the force of a detonating mine or torpedo <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> final watertight hull. This meant an inner bulkhead {{along the side of the}} hull, which was generally lightly armoured to capture splinters, separated from the outer hull by one or more compartments. The compartments in between were either left empty, or filled with coal, water or fuel oil.|$|E

In July 2007 it was confirmed by Ofcom that Belmont would be remaining a wideband transmitter after digital switchover, though the first {{four of the six}} multiplexes would still be available within the original A group, as this graph makes clear.|$|R
5000|$|The Concert Band became <b>well</b> known <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> campus through annual spring {{tours and}} weekly radio {{broadcasts}} that were well established by 1927. Band concerts in the University Auditorium were popular and well attended by students, faculty and townspeople. The Concert Band always played a formal concert for the June graduation festivities {{in addition to}} playing for the Commencement ceremonies.|$|R
5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southeast of England. Any airfield that {{was in danger of}} being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still have to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E
5|$|Other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy {{receptacles}} {{and smaller}} fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue; animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the seeds, or swallow {{them so they}} pass through the gut to be deposited in the animal's droppings <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> parent tree. The germination of some seeds is improved when they are processed in this way. Nuts may be gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately consumed. Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing softens with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring. Pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears may help to disperse the seed by raiding squirrel caches.|$|E
5|$|The Bronze Age in Scotland {{lasted from}} {{approximately}} 2200 BC to 800 BC and northern Scotland {{has produced a}} relative dearth of remains from this period {{in comparison to the}} Neolithic and later Iron Age. This may in part be due to deteriorating weather conditions in the second millennium BC. In Orkney, fewer large stone structures were built during this period, burials were now being made in small cists <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> great megalithic sites and a new Beaker culture began to dominate. Nonetheless the great ceremonial circles continued in use as bronze metalworking was slowly introduced to Scotland from Europe over a lengthy period. There is agreement amongst historians that from about 1000 BC it is legitimate to talk of a Celtic culture in Scotland, although the nature of the Orcadian Celtic civilisation and their relationships to their neighbours remains largely unknown.|$|E

5|$|Three other British ships {{failed to}} respond to the signal from Howe, {{including}} HMS Alfred which engaged the French line at extreme range without noticeable effect, and Captain Charles Cotton in HMS Majestic who likewise did little until the action was decided, at which point he took the surrender of several already shattered French ships. Finally HMS Thunderer under Albemarle Bertie took no part in the initial action at all, standing <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British line and failing to engage the enemy despite the signal for close engagement hanging limply from her mainmast. The French rear ships were no less idle, with Entreprenant and Pelletier firing at any British ships in range but refusing to close or participate in the melees on either side. The French rear ship Scipion did not attempt to join the action either, but could not avoid becoming embroiled in the group around Royal George and Républicain and suffered severe damage.|$|E
5|$|The French {{position}} {{was such that}} they were able to lay down withering fire on the British forces as they advanced, and the abatis (a word that shares derivation with abattoir, or slaughterhouse) rapidly became a killing field. By about 2 pm, it was clear that the first wave of attack had failed. Montcalm was active on the battlefield, having removed his coat, and was moving among his men, giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met. Abercrombie, who was reported by early historians like Francis Parkman and Thomas Mante to be at the sawmill (and thus <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> action), was reported by his aide, James Abercrombie, to be near the rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle, and to have approached the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle. It is uncertain why, after the first wave of attack failed, Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks. Writing in his own defense, he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk's assessment that the works could be easily taken; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} the naval base was soon {{apparent}} when the First World War broke out in August 1914. Only {{a few minutes after}} the declaration of war went into effect at midnight on 3/4 August, a German liner was captured by a torpedo boat from Gibraltar, followed by three more enemy ships the following day. Although Gibraltar was <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main battlefields of the war – Spain remained neutral and the Mediterranean was not contested {{as it was in the}} Second World War– it played an important role in the Allied fight against the German U-boat campaign. The naval base was heavily used by Allied warships for resupplying and repairs. The Bay of Gibraltar was also used as a forming-up point for Allied convoys, while German U-boats stalked the Strait looking for targets. On two occasions, Gibraltar's guns unsuccessfully fired on two U-boats travelling through the Strait. Anti-submarine warfare was in its infancy and it proved impossible to prevent U-boats operating through the Strait. Only two days before the end of the war, on 9 November 1918, SM UB-50 torpedoed and sank the British battleship HMS Britannia off Cape Trafalgar to the west of Gibraltar.|$|E
50|$|Nesting is {{critical}} to the survival of this species so its behaviour in this area is well studied. Nesting tends to be done along the coast and the foraging for food is performed <b>well</b> inland <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nests. In fact, the closest that an individual heron will get to another apart from breeding is during roosting in their nests. Habitat degradation has resulted in closer roosting and has become integrated with other heron species such as Cattle Egrets and Squacco Herons.|$|R
5|$|Unfavorable {{environmental}} conditions caused {{weakening of the}} hurricane by September4 as it resumed a west-northwest course <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Hawaii. Conditions later became favorable and Uleki acquired winds of 105mph (165mph) on September7, constituting its secondary peak. The hurricane crossed the International Dateline on September8 and was reclassified as typhoon. Remaining <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> land, <b>the</b> cyclone steadily weakened to a tropical storm by September12. Gradually turning north and later east, the degrading cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone four days later and ultimately dissipated on September17 near the International Dateline.|$|R

5|$|While {{traversing}} {{the southern}} Yucatán Peninsula, the system nearly degenerated into a remnant low {{during the afternoon}} of June18; however, as it neared water, sufficient convection redeveloped to maintain {{the system as a}} tropical depression. The circulation contracted over land and emerged into the warm waters of the Bay of Campeche that day. The system became increasingly organized as it turned westward in response to a mid-level ridge over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. A Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission into the depression during the afternoon of June19 revealed gale-force winds, prompting the NHC to upgrade and name the system Tropical Storm Barry. Based on a reconnaissance flight and Dvorak estimates, it was estimated that Barry attained peak winds of 75km/h (45mph) late on June19. At 1115UTC on June20, Barry made landfall at Laguna La Mancha, just north of Veracruz, Mexico. Hours after moving inland, Barry weakened to a tropical depression as it interacted with the high terrain of Mexico. The center of circulation became increasingly ill defined, with the majority of convection located <b>well</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> center. Late on June20, Barry dissipated over the Mexican state of Puebla.|$|E
