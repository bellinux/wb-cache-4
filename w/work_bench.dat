2500|$|Played by Donavon Stinson, Ted was the Work Bench's pompous, {{imperious}} manager (and recovering gambling addict) {{who gave}} his employees, especially Sam, Andi, Ben, and Sock, a hard time. In episode 20 ("Dirty Sexy Mongol") Ted {{was fired from}} his job as manager at the <b>Work</b> <b>Bench</b> after sexually harassing a secret shopper sent from corporate. Corporate appointed Andi as the new store manager. She took pity on Ted and rehired him as a trainee for the <b>Work</b> <b>Bench</b> with Sock as his trainer.

2500|$|The lowest-performing {{salesperson}} at the <b>Work</b> <b>Bench,</b> Bert [...] "Sock" [...] Wysocki (played by Tyler Labine) {{spends most}} of his time sleeping in the stock shelves, planning his topless home supply store, and other time-wasting activities. He won the dog of the month award (the opposite of employee of the month) nine months in a row. He also regularly steals supplies from the <b>Work</b> <b>Bench,</b> both to aid Sam in capturing souls and for fun (like making a mechanical bull from paint mixers and lumber). Fortunately, he is braver and more athletic than his slacker personality suggests, and often provides the muscle of Sam's group. Sock assists Sam with collecting souls.|$|E
2500|$|While firm at times, the Devil {{has never}} {{expressed}} outright anger, {{in spite of}} Sam's frequent complaints, incompetence, and meddling; however, when Sam cheated {{him out of a}} deal with another human, the Devil caused all of the surrounding racks in the <b>Work</b> <b>Bench</b> to collapse on Sam out of [...] "disappointment." ...|$|E
50|$|Players {{can also}} carry {{items such as}} beds and <b>work</b> <b>benches</b> with them to other areas, and these items can be {{obtained}} by collecting resources instead of buying them with money like in ordinary Sims titles, or by finding lost shipments of items that occasionally wash up on the beach.|$|R

With help from Sam's neighbor (and demon) Tony, {{as well as from the}} escaped soul at the time, Sam convinces Andi of his [...] "job". Andi reacts poorly, but eventually accepts Sam's fate and becomes his third assistant in hunting souls, though her assistance seems more focused on research rather than actual confrontation. In season 2, Andi was promoted to manager of the <b>Work</b> <b>Bench</b> when Ted was fired because of harassing a [...] "secret shopper". She was later demoted in [...] "My Brother's Reaper", for allowing the <b>Work</b> <b>Bench</b> to be used for a bachelor party.|$|E

This permanent exhibition also refers to the topic [...] "Washing and Washing Machine" [...] with reference to Miele, a local manufacturer of household appliances.|$|R
50|$|Slotted angle (also {{sometimes}} referred to as slotted angle iron) is a system of reusable metal strips used to construct shelving, frames, <b>work</b> <b>benches,</b> equipment stands and other structures. The name derives, first, from the use of elongated slots punched into the metal at uniform intervals to enable assembly of structures fixed with nuts and bolts, and second, from the longitudinal folding of the metal strips to form a right angle.|$|R
2500|$|Gotwald {{undertook}} {{his early}} studies at an [...] "academy" [...] {{near his home}} of which, as an adult, he admitted to remembering little. At the age of ten, {{he went to work}} as a clerk and errand boy in various stores to help support his family. He also worked as a carpenter and a carriage maker. However, Luther later wrote, [...] "my desires for further education prevented me from so concentrating my mind at these trades as to make a success of them. I remember keeping books in the drawer of my <b>work</b> <b>bench</b> and at every spare moment, I would take occasion to read from them. In fact, my employer said that my mind was so set on the books that I managed to spoil more lumber than I was worth and I was discharged."

Subsequently, other demons follow 'The Way of Steve' {{in an attempt to}} emulate his path to Heaven. Steve appears to a human being to convince him to abandon the path to Hell.

In addition to being married to Ben, Sara is also involved with a married Cirque du Soleil performer named Esteban. When Sara reveals she's pregnant with Esteban's child, Ben has the bargaining chip he needs, and Sara eventually lets him date Cassidy. After an immigration officer discovers their ruse, Sara convinces Ben to give her $2,000 to help bribe the officer; in actuality, she takes the money and goes on the lam.|$|E

Plus specialized industries may need additional properties such as fire retardant matting for welding, static dissipative matting for electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection, anti-microbial for food industry applications.|$|R
50|$|In October 1913 {{a mobile}} {{workshop}} {{was built to}} repair aircraft in the field. A 'large bus body' was equipped with an electric generator which powered a lathe, bandsaw, drills, shaping machine, grindstone and lights.

30|$|We {{assume that}} each {{component}} {{arriving in the}} group is assigned to exactly one technician, i.e., that once a part is assigned to a technician then {{he is the only}} person within the group that will ever work on it. In practice {{this is not the case}} and technicians within a group may rotate between <b>work</b> <b>benches</b> so that several different technicians end up working on the same part. Note that we still allow for the possibility that a part, or subparts of it, be sent to other groups for other technicians to work on.|$|R
60|$|There {{were two}} windows in Phonny's shop. One {{was over the}} <b>work</b> <b>bench</b> and was an {{ordinary}} window, formed with sashes. The other was merely a large square hole {{with a sort of}} lid or shutter opening upward and outward, like the small door of the hen-house. Phonny used to call this his shutter window. It was the place where he was accustomed to throw out his shavings.|$|E

There Vane made friends with the wheelwright, who regarded him dubiously at first, and obtained a piece of larch board from him. The grizzled North countryman watched him closely as he set a plane, which is a delicate operation, and then raised no objection when Vane made use of his <b>work</b> <b>bench.</b> After that, Vane, who had sawn up the board, borrowed a few tools and copper nails, and he and Mabel {{went back to the}} canoe.

One of the {{children}} took the book, and others leaned over to one side, and put their papers upon the seat, and prepared to write there. Some began to write very soon. Others looked around mysteriously, considering {{which one of the}} company would make the best president. Henry stood up by the great <b>work</b> <b>bench,</b> and made that his writing-desk; keeping a sharp look-out all the time lest Rollo should see what he should write. And thus the children prepared their votes for president.|$|E

30|$|In âAssignment and {{scheduling}} problemâ subsection we designed an algorithm to assign the components to the technicians {{within a single}} group, and we implemented it in Excel for a small example. Several limitations {{need to be addressed}} before the algorithm could be used by an aircraft components maintenance shop, such as our assumptions that a technician can only work on one part at once and that technicians do not rotate between <b>work</b> <b>benches.</b> We indicated how the algorithm could be extended {{to take into account the}} interactions between all the groups. This needs further development, however, and its implementation would be a major programming task. The assignment algorithm should be tested by comparing the assignments produced by our algorithm with those produced manually by team leaders.|$|R
