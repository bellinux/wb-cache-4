5|$|The wreck timbers {{were found}} under a {{sediment}} that preserved {{the remains of}} the <b>wooden</b> <b>vessel,</b> without which the wreck would have been lost due to marine worms. Wrecks of this age are rare finds and this particular one was in such a good condition that much of the hull was preserved. This has given us an insight into how ships of this period were constructed—something which has not been seen before as no Arabian ship of this type had previously been found, nor any with their cargo intact.|$|E
5|$|The two vessels were {{pounding}} {{each other}} at such close range, they also managed to collide with one another at five different times. By 11:00am Monitors supply of shot in the turret had been used up. With one of the hatches to the gun ports damaged and jammed shut she hauled off to shallow waters to resupply the turret and effect repairs to the damaged hatch, {{which could not be}} repaired. During the lull in the battle Worden climbed through the gun port out onto the deck {{to get a better view}} of the overall situation. Virginia, seeing Monitor turn away turned her attention to the Minnesota and fired shots that set the <b>wooden</b> <b>vessel</b> ablaze, also destroying the nearby tugboat Dragon. When the turret was resupplied with ammunition Worden returned to battle with only one gun in operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} vessels of the Principe di Carignano class were {{initially}} ordered as steam frigates by the Regia Marina Sarda (Royal Sardinian Navy) {{shortly before the}} unification of Italy. While {{they were on the}} stocks, the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) of the newly-formed Kingdom of Italy decided to convert the ships into ironclads. A third ship, , was too far advanced in her construction to allow for conversion, and so she was completed as a <b>wooden</b> <b>vessel.</b> These ships had been designed by Inps. Eng. Felice Mattei. A fourth ship, Conte Verde, was built to a modified design created by Inps. Eng. Giuseppe De Luca. These ships came as part of a major naval expansion program that was designed to prepare a fleet of ironclads capable of defeating the Austrian Navy. Italy considered the Austrian Empire to be its main rival, since it controlled predominantly Italian areas, including Venice.|$|E

25|$|Sea {{transport}} {{is extremely}} important for economic integration and for domestic and foreign trade. It is well developed, {{with each of the}} major islands having at least one significant port city. Because Indonesia encompasses a sprawling archipelago, maritime shipping provides essential links between parts of the country. Boats in common use include large container ships, a variety of ferries, passenger ships, sailing ships, and smaller motorised vessels.

25|$|Drums {{are highly}} {{influential}} in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums {{and how to}} play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped <b>wooden</b> <b>vessel,</b> with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui type of water drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.|$|E
500|$|By the 1850s, {{competition}} was keen as steamships grew {{in size and}} efficiency to serve the fast-growing nation. The Old Bay Line, in particular, served as {{a link between the}} antebellum South and northern markets, hauling large quantities of cotton north and manufactured goods south, along with a thriving passenger business between Baltimore and Norfolk. Railroads also began acquiring steamship lines in the 1850s, and the Seaboard & Roanoke Railroad, a predecessor of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad (RF), acquired a controlling interest in the Baltimore Steam Packet Company in 1851. As competitors entered the field, each line vied to outdo its competitors in the luxurious appointments of their ships' staterooms and dining service. The company acquired newer and larger ships in the 1850s, such as the North Carolina in 1852 and the Louisiana in 1854, the latter at [...] in length being the largest <b>wooden</b> <b>vessel</b> the company would own.

500|$|In 1999 a {{combined}} research team from RIMAP and the Australian National Maritime Museum examined some known wrecks in the harbour and in 2000, RIMAP and the ANMM examined {{a site that}} appears {{to be one of the}} blockade vessels, partly covered by a separate wreck of a 20th-century barge. The older remains were those of a <b>wooden</b> <b>vessel</b> of approximately the same size, and possibly a similar design and materials as Lord Sandwich ex Endeavour. Confirmation that Cook's former ship had indeed been in Newport Harbor sparked considerable media and public interest in confirming her location. [...] However, further mapping showed eight other 18th-century wrecks in Newport Harbor, some with features and conditions also consistent with Endeavour. In 2006 RIMAP announced that the wrecks were unlikely to be raised. In 2016 RIMAP concluded that there was a probability of 80 to 100% that the wreck of Endeavour was still in Newport Harbor, probably one of a cluster of five wrecks on the seafloor, and planned to investigate the ships and their artifacts further. They were seeking funds to build facilities for handling and storing recovered objects.|$|E
