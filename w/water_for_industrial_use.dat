40|$|Abstract. The {{microfiltration}} (MF) and nanofiltration (NF) integrated membrane technologies {{were used}} in the advanced treatment of dyeing wastewater. The ZrO 2 MF membrane was used to remove colloidal species from the wastewater before NF. The effects of permeate flux, CODCr rejection, the removal effects of ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus by polyamide NF membrane were investigated. The results indicated that the turbidity removal efficiency was 76. 7 %~ 95. 0 %. CODCr rejection was range from 33. 3 % to 54. 9 % by MF. After the process of NF, CODCr rejection was between 66. 65 % and 91. 18 %. The removal effects of both color and turbidity were 100 %. The value of pH was 6 ~ 7. The CODCr was smaller than 60 mg·L- 1. The value of ammonia nitrogen was smaller than 7 mg·L- 1. The value of total phosphorus was smaller than 0. 5 mg·L- 1.

50|$|The area {{encompassing}} {{present day}} Omro was Winnebago Indian Territory {{when it was}} first visited by French explorers in 1639. Omro's location gave it two advantages from the beginning, which were a position on one of the few natural transportation and communications routes of the time and an abundant amount of <b>water</b> <b>for</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>use.</b> The first modern settlers visited in 1847. There are at least three differing accounts of how the town was named. One widely held version is that it was named for Charles Amereau, a French trader and blacksmith who started a fur trading post there. By 1880, Omro was a stop on the railroad line and was home to the county fairgrounds, several mills, a glass factory, carriage factories, several machine works, and had a population greater than 2,000. Eventually most of the manufacturers either relocated to nearby Oshkosh, or faded away. Since Omro began a revitalization process in 1986, it has seen growth. Several projects pay respects to Omro's past, including a historical walking tour, the Scott park pavilion project, and the designation of a historic downtown district.|$|E
5000|$|The Kosal {{region of}} India {{had been a}} prosperous land with {{abundant}} natural resources and a self-sufficient economy. Flooding {{was not a very}} well known occurrence in the region; however, there were many occasions of droughts. The Hirakud Dam, as well as others, was built by the government primarily to decrease the damage by flooding in Coastal Odisha and to facilitate irrigation in the Kosal region. As most of the dams were built in Western Odisha, many villages were displaced. Moreover, the displaced people, mainly farmers, were not given compensation for damages. The displaced people migrated to other places such as in Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, Bargarh, Sonepur, Angul, and the Boudh district. After losing their land and not being compensated, said displaced people bought land and lived on small income generated from their small land holdings. Irrigation and rain saved these people from facing severe sustained drought. [...] Forest coverage of the catchment area of Hirakud Dam which lies mostly in Chhattisgarh, has declined drastically which is evident from browsing catchment area of the Hirakud on Google Earth. Most of the perennial water sources and streams come from the Bauxite holding Mountains due to the water affinity of the mineral. As bauxite and iron ores are being extracted, the water-holding capacity of these have declined causing siltation and flash floods during rain and drought during summer. [...] Adding to it unsustainable industrialization and use of water resources by Industry the irrigation in this region has suffered. High level of Pollution due to many small and large industries and indiscriminate deforestation has decreased precipitation and has increased diseases leading either to decrease in yield or loss of crop. [...] The state government assured farmers in the Kosal region that irrigation in the Hirakud command area would not be adversely affected by industrialization. However, the government has taken all steps to facilitate use of <b>water</b> <b>for</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>use</b> which was actually meant for farmers. Though the industries have huge financial resources to source their own water supply or to increase the water holding capacity of Hirakud, the government has not taken the necessary steps to improve water supplies to the villages and farms.|$|E

Previous studies used water demand functions and total cost functions to estimate firms'willingness to pay for water use. They find that the marginal productivity of water varies among sectors in China, with an industry average of 2. 5 yuan per cubic meter of water. The average price elasticity of industrial water demand is about - 1. 0, suggesting a great potential for the Chinese government to use pricing policies to encourage water conservation in the industrial sector.
