5|$|By 2000, Madonna {{was dating}} {{director}} Guy Ritchie, and was pregnant <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> Wanting to distract {{herself from the}} media frenzy surrounding this news, Madonna concentrated {{on the development of}} her eighth studio album, Music. Buoyed up by the commercial success of 1998's Ray of Light album, she was keen on getting back to the studio to record new material. She was then introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Madonna instantly liked his pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and his utilization of acid bass in his songs.|$|E
5|$|Created by comedian Bill Cosby, Clair {{is based}} on Cosby's own wife, Camille. Cosby {{originally}} intended for the character to be a plumber, but the producers and Camille ultimately convinced him to rewrite her into a lawyer to reflect a family that closer resembled their own. At one point, Clair had also been envisioned as a Dominican housewife who speaks Spanish when frustrated, inspired by Ricky Ricardo from the sitcom I Love Lucy, but this idea was also abandoned. Rashad, originally credited as Phylicia Ayers-Allen, won the role by exhibiting a subtlety in her audition that other candidates lacked. After marrying husband Ahmad Rashad and adopting his surname, Rashad became pregnant <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> during the show's third season, thus requiring her to conceal her pregnancy during episode tapings.|$|E
40|$|Family {{literacy}} includes activities among {{two generations}} {{in a family}} and intergenerational activities, which take place between children and adults. This activities include parents reading <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> The subject of research in my diploma thesis is motivation of parents for reading <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> {{in the first grade}} of primary school, with emphasis on complex texts. With latter we think of: longer comprehensive fairytales, vast texts, complex content literature, poetry, comic books, literature with real-life themes and technical literature. In the empirical part of this diploma thesis I have conducted a survey among parents and the results showed me what motivates parents to read <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> Results have shown that lack of time is the most common reason that prevents parents to read more <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> but they are aware that reading together <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in domestic environment is very important for <b>children</b> and <b>their</b> development. Research has indicated that longer comprehensive fairytales, which are meant for older children, are most common literature they read <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in the first grade of primary school. Their overall commitment, motivation to read complex texts <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> is mediocre and the motivation to read these kind of texts derives from the impact that those kind of texts have on child's reading development and consequently better academic success. The lack of time is the reason that parents don't read complex texts more to <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> Schools encouragement on this matter is felt by parents, who think reading complex texts <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> is beneficial...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{selected}} {{aspects of a}} recent study of non-resident fathers' leisure <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> The settings and context for non-resident fathers' contact <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> are described and the methodology comprising interviews with eighteen non-resident fathers is briefly explained. The fathers who participated were a diverse group. Leisure is a vital aspect of most non-resident fathers' engagement <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> Nevertheless, for non-resident fathers to be fully-integrated in their children's lives they need to participate in a range of everyday activities that allow them to function as parents rather than as regular visitors. Policy and legislation must better recognise the qualitative aspects of parent's engagement <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children...</b>|$|R

5|$|John and Josephine deeply {{wish to have}} a {{child and}} when she is born with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony, they name her Snow White. However, Josephine, Snow White's mother, dies in childbirth, leaving John alone <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> In the winter, John struggles to find food for his daughter, Snow White, when he sheds a tear over a frozen lake and frees a {{creature}} known as the Green-Eyed One. As thanks for freeing him, Green-Eyed One offers John three wishes. For John's wishes, he asks for nourishment for his daughter, a kingdom to raise his family, and a queen for a new wife, as the creature cannot raise the dead.|$|E
5|$|After Cain's disappearance, Mary becomes {{head of the}} Hargreaves. Augusta {{possesses}} Alexis, {{and seeks}} out Mary in the mausoleum Cain had built before leaving to confront Alexis. Augusta reveals that she manipulated Alexis into abusing his sons and trying to resurrect her for her amusement. Before she can kill Mary, Augusta triggers Cain's trap in the mausoleum and dies. Years later, Mary is married to Oscar and pregnant <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child,</b> although she still waits for his return. Crehador, a medium close to Cain, sets up a tea party for Mary, fulfilling Cain's promise; he then reminisces on how he found Cain being held by Riff's corpse within the ruined tower. The bunkoban-exclusive epilogue expands the ending slightly. It shows an elderly Mary, who lies on her deathbed attended by a woman nearby and hears the laughter of Jizabel's ghost as he plays with his pet sheep. Sensing a presence nearby, she dies, and taking the form of her ten-year-old self, her soul joins Cain hand-in-hand at a tea party with their friends and loved ones—although they exist as spirits, a boy nearby can hear them.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{problems}} with joint attention are associated with developmental processes. Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. Autism spectrum disorders). A core deficit noted in autism is eye gaze. Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object. This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention. Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents. Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts. Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention. Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital. Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> rate that infant lower on scales of social competence. Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age. In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.|$|E

40|$|The {{study had}} two goals: First, a 20 -item “ Refugee Parent-Child Relational Communication Scale ” was {{developed}} for parents from refugee backgrounds. Former refugee parents from Ethiopia, Congo and Burma (N= 221) completed this and other questionnaires measuring demographics, acculturation and acculturative stress. Exploratory factor analysis indicated three factors: “Engagement”, “Hope and Aspirations” and “Dissonance”. The sub-scales were internally consistent. Second, this newly-developed scale was used to explore whether the parents’ communication and relations <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> were associated <b>with</b> demographics, acculturation and acculturative stress. Results of multiple regressions indicated that mothers and parents with higher acculturation were more engaged <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> and also encouraged <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to aspire for higher goals in life. Though parents with higher acculturative stress were also developing aspirations and hopes in their children; they reported strained relations <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> Parents from the Congo scored higher on dissonance, indicating some problematic communication <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children...</b>|$|R
