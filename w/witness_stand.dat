5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised on the <b>witness</b> <b>stand</b> with transcripts of these, which {{he had not been}} given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E
5|$|October 9, 1944, {{was another}} {{in a string of}} days {{consisting}} of accused men testifying on the <b>witness</b> <b>stand.</b> This day, however, Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), sat in on the proceedings. Marshall had flown to the Bay Area on a special wartime travel priority arranged by Navy Secretary Forrestal. The NAACP had given the mutiny trial top importance due to the U.S. Navy's policy of putting Negroes into dirty and dangerous jobs with no hope of advancement. Although Marshall was allowed to observe the trial, as a civilian he was ineligible to take an official role in the men's defense. After hearing five of the men defend themselves, Marshall spoke to the 50 men and then conferred with Veltmann's defense team. The next day, Marshall held a press conference, charging that Judge Advocate Coakley was handling the case in a prejudicial manner. Marshall said that, from a review of the proceedings and his conversations with the accused, he could only see these men being tried for lesser charges of individual insubordination, not mass mutiny.|$|E
5|$|On several {{occasions}} {{over the course}} of the trial, the prosecution showed films of the concentration camps and other atrocities. Everyone present, including Göring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and Erhard Milch, tried to portray Göring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family. When testifying on his own behalf, Göring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the <b>witness</b> <b>stand</b> as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war. During cross-examination, chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after Kristallnacht, a major pogrom in November 1938. At the meeting, Göring had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom. Later, David Maxwell-Fyfe proved it was impossible for Göring not to have known about the Stalag Luft III murdersthe shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from Stalag Luft IIIin time to have prevented the killings. He also presented clear evidence that Göring knew about the extermination of the Hungarian Jews.|$|E

50|$|All appellate {{courts are}} capable of hearing {{evidence}} (and also to be finders of fact), for example where there is an allegation of bias in the lower court, or where fresh evidence is adduced to persuade the court to allow a retrial. In those cases witness evidence may be necessary and many appellate courts have <b>witness</b> <b>stands.</b>|$|R

"It was my good, or my evil, fortune," [...] went on Lysbeth, in a {{voice of}} ice, [...] "to see the written {{evidence}} upon which my husband, your brother Foy, and Martin were condemned to death, {{on the grounds of}} heresy, rebellion, and the killing of the king's servants.

50|$|The appellant, Marsh, a Jehovah's <b>Witness,</b> <b>stood</b> {{near the}} post office one day, and began distributing {{religious}} literature. Marsh was warned that she needed a permit to do so, and that none would be issued to her. When {{she was asked to}} leave, she refused {{on the grounds that the}} company rule could not be constitutionally applied to her. The deputy sheriff arrested her and she was charged with the Alabama criminal code's trespassing equivalent.|$|R
5000|$|Jennifer Lisa Smith was {{a convicted}} prostitute and drug addict. She was in Rogers' truck {{parked in a}} lot located off of SE McLoughlin Blvd in Oak Grove in unincorporated Clackamas County, when he stabbed her 11 times in the breasts, abdomen, and back. She {{fell out of the}} truck where she was {{attended}} by witnesses from a nearby Denny's restaurant and later died at the hospital. [...] One <b>witness</b> <b>stood</b> by a window relaying the action to another patron who could not see the parking lot; that patron called the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office.|$|R
25|$|The {{prosecution}} called Brown's sister, Denise, to the <b>witness</b> <b>stand.</b> She tearfully {{testified to}} many episodes {{of domestic violence}} in the 1980s, when she saw Simpson pick up his wife and hurl her against a wall, then physically throw her out of their house during an argument. Her testimony was punctuated by a barrage of defense objections and sidebar conferences with the judge.|$|E
25|$|With {{the jury}} absent, Fuhrman was {{called back to}} the <b>witness</b> <b>stand</b> by the defense to answer more {{questions}} about {{the discovery of the}} blood marks and leather glove that he found on Simpson's property. When questioned by attorney Gerald Uelmen, Fuhrman, with his lawyer standing by his side, pleaded the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination and further questioning after his integrity was challenged.|$|E
25|$|Power {{lost the}} congressional election, and his trial against Morrison began on Dec. 3, 1924. State Rep. George Lommen {{was the first}} to take the <b>witness</b> <b>stand</b> on Power’s behalf. Morrison had {{attacked}} Lommen in the past, accusing him of collecting bribes from the operators of slot machines, as well as declaring that he was such a flip-flopping “political chameleon,” he would probably end up a Communist.|$|E
50|$|The complex has {{incorporated}} many post-9/11 {{security measures}} into its design, such as large steel barriers {{that can be}} raised to prevent cars from entering the glass atrium. One difference between the CCC and conventional buildings {{is its ability to}} withstand structural damage. The structure has been designed to remain standing even after 2/3s of the exterior columns on the first six floors have experienced failure. This is possible because each tower contains more structural steel than both of the 52 story Bankers Hall towers combined, rendering the building virtually airplane-proof. The courtrooms feature bullet-proof judges' benches, jury boxes, and <b>witness</b> <b>stands.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{second floor}} {{consists}} of a centrally located, two-story courtroom and a one-story courtroom located on the south end, each accessed by leather-clad, wood doors. The two-story courtroom was extensively renovated in 1998. The walls consist of gypsum board and plaster. Fluted pilasters divide the upper portion of the walls. New elevated benches and <b>witness</b> <b>stands</b> were also added in 1998. The smaller, one-story courtroom contains plaster walls with wood wainscoting and bronze grilles, and a decorative plaster ceiling. The ceiling consists of recessed panels and cross beams featuring decorative medallions. The furniture in the smaller courtroom was relocated from a federal building in Youngstown, Ohio.|$|R
25|$|Aleinu is recited {{with all}} the congregants standing. One {{reason for this is}} noble sentiments are expressed, but also that the first and last letters of the prayer spell עד—"witness"—and it is {{appropriate}} for a <b>witness</b> to <b>stand</b> when testifying.|$|R
25|$|The court called Hitler {{to appear}} on the <b>witness</b> <b>stand</b> on 8 May 1931. Litten set out to show that the SA Sturm 33 ("Storm 33") was a rollkommando (a small, mobile {{paramilitary}} unit, generally murderous) and that its attack of the Eden and the resulting murders were undertaken with the knowledge of the party leadership. This would mean that the Nazi Party was not, in fact, a legal and democratic organization and would undermine Hitler's efforts {{to be seen as a}} serious politician and statesman.|$|E

As time passes, she makes progress, though she is arrested one day for murder, as {{she was in the}} car with her cousin when she was {{involved}} in a drive-by shooting. Graciela is tried and found guilty as an adult because of a cousin's lies on the <b>witness</b> <b>stand,</b> and thus being sent to adult prison. The cousin later recants, but Graciela is murdered in a gang retaliation before Amy can get her out of prison.|$|E
25|$|Eric Black, {{played by}} Blake Bashoff: He is a gay {{teenager}} {{who had been}} so badly abused that he was blind for two years. When all else fails, Maxine reluctantly takes him into her home, where he rapidly bonds with the family; afterwards, Sean becomes his foster father. Eventually, Eric protectively confronts and kills a stalker after Amy and Lauren. He is tried and found not guilty, but does so by lying on the <b>witness</b> <b>stand.</b> Maxine is disappointed in him, so he decides to move to Canada with his boyfriend, Mark.|$|E
50|$|Alaska's {{relatively}} large Eastern Orthodox Christian population is notable. The large Eastern Orthodox (with 49 parishes {{and up to}} 50,000 followers) population {{is a result of}} early Russian colonization and missionary work among Alaska Natives. In 1795, the First Russian Orthodox Church was established in Kodiak. Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society. As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches gradually became established within Alaska. Alaska also has the largest Quaker population (by percentage) of any state. Also, as of 1994, there were 3,060 Jews in Alaska. Jehovah's <b>Witnesses</b> <b>stands</b> at a little less than 2,400. Estimates for the number of Alaskan Muslims range from 1,000 to 5,000.|$|R

500|$|From {{the day of}} {{sentencing}} to death, {{prisoners were}} kept in a concrete-floored cell in New Division. They were vigilantly observed to prevent them escaping their sentence through suicide. With hangings taking place on Monday mornings, at 8:00am, condemned prisoners were woken three hours earlier, and provided with a last meal, shower, and clean clothes. Afterwards, handcuffed, they were moved to a holding or [...] "condemned cell" [...] nearby the gallows, and allowed a couple of sips of brandy to calm their nerves. Shortly before 8:00am, they were hooded, {{led up to the}} execution chamber, which could hold as many as eleven <b>witnesses,</b> <b>stood</b> over the trap door, had a noose put around their neck, and were hanged by dropping through the opening trap door. After medical examination, the deceased was removed for burial.|$|R
25|$|When on the <b>witness</b> <b>stand,</b> Erickson gave a {{detailed}} description of Ferguson strangling Heitholt, despite apparently not remembering any details following the murders and during the interrogation. The defense countered that all of the evidence found at the crime scene pointed elsewhere. None of the hair, blood, or fingerprint samples collected at the crime scene were consistent with Ferguson or Erickson, and no traces of the victim's blood were found in the vehicle Ferguson was driving the night of the murder. Ferguson was convicted of second-degree murder and robbery and sentenced to 40 years in prison.|$|E
25|$|During the hearings, a {{photograph}} of Schine was introduced, and Joseph Welch accused Cohn of doctoring the image to show Schine alone with Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens. On the <b>witness</b> <b>stand</b> Cohn and Schine both insisted that the picture entered into evidence (Schine and Stevens alone) was requested by Stevens {{and that no one}} was edited out of the photograph. Welch then produced a wider shot of Stevens and Schine with McGuire AFB wing commander Colonel Jack Bradley standing to Schine's right. A fourth person also edited out of the picture (his sleeve was visible to Bradley's right in the Welch photograph) was identified as McCarthy aide Frank Carr.|$|E
25|$|If {{any type}} of {{photographic}} evidence is involved, the expert witness has to request permission from the judge or attorney prior to the trial {{to make sure that}} the photographs that are to be presented aren’t prejudiced and have the ability to sway the jury. Finally, it is important that the expert witness realizes that replying “I don’t know” to a question is perfectly fine; it is preferable to say that you don’t have the expertise in that particular area than to claim that you do and make yourself look like a liar. Before leaving the <b>witness</b> <b>stand,</b> proper notification will be given to the expert witness to see if he is dismissed or if he will be recalled later.|$|E
5000|$|Marian Rivera, {{plays the}} role of Judge MD, who goes between two parties to resolve bizarre and petty conflicts. Rivera sits on the judge's seat, but unlike the typical {{courtroom}} setting, the defendant and plaintiff, portrayed by celebrity guests, face each other in two <b>witness</b> <b>stands.</b> Also part of the skit are Valeen as court clerk and Jose as police officer. As a parody in the common dialogue of judges - [...] "Order in the court", which is used to demand silence in the courtroom, a waiter (played by Jerald), will come out from the backroom to take the judge's food order. The segment ended on hiatus when Marian temporarily leaves the show for her maternal leave. Judge MD returns on the day Marian's comeback on TV after months of her maternity leave.|$|R
60|$|Miss Tox, being, in good time, bonneted and shawled, and Polly too, Rob hugged his mother, and {{followed}} his new mistress away; {{so much to}} the hopeful admiration of Polly, that something in her eyes made luminous rings round the gas-lamps as she looked after him. Polly then put out her light, locked the house-door, delivered the key at an agent's hard by, and went home as fast as she could go; rejoicing in the shrill delight that her unexpected arrival would occasion there. The great house, dumb as to all that had been suffered in it, and the changes it had <b>witnessed,</b> <b>stood</b> frowning like a dark mute on the street; baulking any nearer inquiries with the staring announcement that the lease of this desirable Family Mansion was to be disposed of.|$|R

25|$|The {{government}} then reinstated {{charges in}} February 1940 against Gold, the NTWIU and 28 other labor leaders based on allegations not pursued in 1933. Charges against six labor leaders were dropped on March 20, 1940, and four others but Gold and 17 others were tried. Despite one witness recanting {{most of his}} accusatory testimony on the <b>witness</b> <b>stand,</b> Gold and IFWU Vice President Irving Potash were convicted of these additional antitrust charges. As the union raised a $100,000 defense fund for Gold and Potash, the government brought a fresh set of charges against Gold on May 17, 1940, accusing him of jury tampering during his first trial. As the jury deliberated Gold's fate, a group of employers sued Gold and the NTWIU for $3 million in damages under the Clayton Antitrust Act, and accusations of witness tampering were levied against Gold.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{agreed to}} provide boats and other {{provisions}} for the expedition. However, on November 10, he learned from a military captain that Burr's plans apparently included seizure of New Orleans, then part of the Louisiana Territory of the United States, and incorporating it, along with lands won from the Spanish, into a new empire. He was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of Brigadier General James Wilkinson, whom he deeply disliked, in the plan. Jackson acted cautiously at first, but wrote letters to public officials, including President Thomas Jefferson, vaguely warning them about the scheme. In December, Jefferson, a political opponent of Burr, issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the West and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators. Jackson, safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail, organized the militia. Burr was soon captured, and the men were sent home. Jackson traveled to Richmond, Virginia, to testify on Burr's behalf in trial. The defense team decided against placing him on the <b>witness</b> <b>stand,</b> fearing his remarks were too provocative. Burr was acquitted of treason, despite Jefferson's efforts to have him convicted. Jackson endorsed James Monroe for President in 1808 against James Madison. The latter {{was part of the}} Jeffersonian wing of the Democratic-Republican Party.|$|E
25|$|If {{the law is}} made as it {{now stands}} respectable {{families}} in Aiken, Barnwell, Colleton, and Orangeburg will be {{denied the right to}} intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified. At least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge. They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers. Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of… colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice and greed; to statements on the <b>witness</b> <b>stand</b> that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins. Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.|$|E
