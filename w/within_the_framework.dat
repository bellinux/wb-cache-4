5|$|One of {{the deepest}} {{problems}} in modern physics {{is the problem of}} quantum gravity. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is formulated <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>framework</b> of classical physics. However, nongravitational forces are described <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>framework</b> of quantum mechanics, a radically different formalism for describing physical phenomena based on probability. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the appellate}} {{provision}} of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the appellate {{provision of the}} act of February 27, 1801 was not explicitly limited to civil cases (except insofar as it incorporated the former by reference).

5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>framework</b> of its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment {{had to do with}} Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E

He formulated a suitable classification of exact solutions to Einstein's field equations and proved the Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem that justifies the application of simple, general-relativistic model universes to modern cosmology. He created a spacetime-oriented description of gravitational lensing and clarified the relationship between models formulated <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>framework</b> of general relativity and those of Newtonian gravity. In addition, Ehlers had a keen interest in both the history and philosophy of physics and was an ardent populariser of science.|$|E

His first assignment in that department was for the District of Beisan and northern Palestine (the Galilee and northern Samaria). He was also an Arabist and was enthusiastic about the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, expecting that the new Ottoman government would institute reforms and grant the Arabs autonomy <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>framework</b> of the empire.|$|E

5|$|When the Treaty of Shimonoseki was {{finalized}} on 17 April 1895, Taiwan was ceded by the Qing Empire to Japan. Taiwan's {{incorporation into}} the Japanese political orbit brought Taiwanese aborigines into contact with a new colonial structure, determined to define and locate indigenous people <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>framework</b> of a new, multi-ethnic empire. The means of accomplishing this goal took three main forms: anthropological study of the natives of Taiwan, attempts to reshape the aborigines in the mould of the Japanese, and military suppression. The Aboriginals and Han joined together to violently revolt against Japanese rule in the 1907 Beipu Uprising and 1915 Tapani Incident.|$|E
