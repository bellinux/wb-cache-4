25|$|In October 1970 a technicians' dispute {{turned into}} a <b>work-to-rule</b> when sound staff were denied a pay rise given to camera staff the year before for working with colour {{recording}} equipment. The terms of the <b>work-to-rule</b> were that staff refused {{to work with the}} new equipment (though the old black and white equipment had been disposed of by then) and therefore programmes were recorded and transmitted in black and white, including Coronation Street The dispute was resolved in early 1971 and the last black and white episode was broadcast on 8 February 1971.|$|E
50|$|<b>Work-to-rules</b> can be misconstrued as {{malicious}} {{even when}} it is only a removal of good-will, such as employees insisting on taking all legally entitled breaks, or refusing a request to work unpaid overtime.|$|R
5000|$|Section 81 {{defines a}} strike very broadly. Almost any act that {{deviates}} from normal working practices or breaks an employment agreement is included. Go-slows, black bans on persons or products, <b>work-to-rules,</b> reducing normal output {{and refusing to}} do overtime are all strike actions. Media statements by Air NZ pilots in 1991, that Air NZ planes may be not be airworthy were held to be a strike, even though the pilots were working as normal, that is, flying planes they had said may not be [...] "airwothy".|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues was education. All three parties pledged to increase spending by $2 billion, but Premier Eves also pledged to ban teacher strikes, lock-outs, and <b>work-to-rule</b> campaigns during the school year, a move the other parties rejected. Teacher strikes had plagued the previous Progressive Conservative mandate of Mike Harris, whose government had deeply cut education spending.|$|E
25|$|A {{second round}} of talks between {{striking}} dock workers and the contractors, mediated by the Labour Department, ended without agreement on 11 April, but both sides said they would consider each other's proposals. Another negotiation failed to reach agreement on 12 April. The two unions present at the meeting were the Federation of Trade Unions, whose members are not on strike, and the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, representing the Hong Kong Docks and Ports Industry Unions whose 300 workers are employed directly by the port operator, HIT, and who were staging a <b>work-to-rule.</b> The FTU says it will not accept a five percent pay-rise and a two percent increase in welfare benefits. The two unions insisted on 12 percent.|$|E
2500|$|For most of 2005, {{the police}} {{union and the}} Toronto Police Services Board (the {{civilian}} governing body) were involved in lengthy contract negotiations.

2500|$|Later in the year, Miller became {{involved}} in a labour dispute between the Police Services Board and the Toronto Police Association. The board, led by councillor Pam McConnell, wanted to save revenue by clawing back existing rates of retention pay and eliminating lunch-hour pay for officers on inactive duty during compressed shifts. [...] The police association argued that the proposals would cause an exodus of officers and result in lower pay for officers working compressed schedules.

2500|$|Abbott {{introduced}} {{two bills}} in 2004: the School Amendment Act, a government bill, expanded {{the responsibilities of}} teachers to include participation in curriculum development, assistance in developing provincial exams, and supervision of student teachers; {{the effect of this}} was to prevent teachers from withdrawing these services in <b>work-to-rule</b> situations. [...] The bill also amended the process by which it was decided whether suspended teachers would be dismissed or permitted to return to the job. [...] The bill passed the legislature. [...] Abbott's second bill of 2004, the Insurance (Demerit Offences) Amendment Act, was a private member's bill that never reached second reading. [...] It would have made it illegal for insurance companies to charge higher insurance premiums based on demerits assigned to drivers more than two years prior to an application for insurance.|$|E
50|$|Around 1,300 {{jobs were}} lost, 500 from the Coventry headquarters, the {{remainder}} from local offices. The restructuring process was {{challenged by the}} PCS Union, with a strike that took place on 28 April 2006, and a <b>work-to-rule</b> commencing in May 2006. The <b>work-to-rule</b> ceased on 26 June 2006 after PCS and LSC representatives reached agreement.|$|E
50|$|An {{overtime}} ban {{is similar}} to a <b>work-to-rule,</b> in that both involve employees refusing to do more than is strictly required of them. However, and in contrast with a <b>work-to-rule,</b> when an overtime ban is in place workers may still perform duties not required of them, providing they do not go outside their contracted hours.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes <b>work-to-rule</b> can be {{considered}} by employers as malicious compliance as they pursue legal action against workers.|$|E

50|$|A boycott is {{a refusal}} to buy, sell, or {{otherwise}} trade with an individual or business. Other tactics include go-slow, sabotage, <b>work-to-rule,</b> sit-in or en-masse not reporting to work. Some labour law explicitly bans such activity, none explicitly allows it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Work-to-rule</b> is an {{industrial}} action in which employees {{do no more}} than the minimum required by the rules of their contract, and precisely follow all safety or other regulations, which may cause a slowdown or decrease in productivity, as they are no longer working during breaks or during unpaid extended hours and weekends (checking email, for instance). Such an action is considered less disruptive than a strike or lockout, and obeying the rules is less susceptible to disciplinary action. Notable examples have included nurses refusing to answer telephones, teachers refusing to work for free at night and during weekends and holidays, and police officers refusing to issue citations. Refusal to work overtime, travel on duty, or sign up to other tasks requiring employee assent are other manifestations of using <b>work-to-rule</b> as industrial action.|$|E
5000|$|The IRA {{defines a}} [...] "strike" [...] in a {{sufficiently}} broad manner to include <b>Work-to-Rule,</b> and Go-Slow actions.

5000|$|Another {{unconventional}} tactic is <b>work-to-rule</b> (also {{known as}} an Italian strike, in Sciopero bianco), in which workers perform their tasks exactly as {{they are required to}} but no better.

50|$|Following the Gol incident, the {{situation}} deteriorated rapidly, with controllers commencing a <b>work-to-rule</b> protest which culminated in massive flight delays and protests from passengers and airlines alike. The {{apex of the}} crisis occurred in December 2006. Due {{to a combination of}} equipment failures, understaffed ATC and the holiday travel season, travel at many Brazilian airports stopped altogether for some days. With the airlines unable to clear the backlog of passengers due to the canceled flights, and under pressure to solve the crisis from the general public, the government pressed into service several Brazilian Air Force jets, including one of the president's own planes.|$|E
50|$|Social {{partnership}} {{was confined}} to the Labour government, and did not continue after {{the establishment of the}} Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010. Instead, the union lodged a formal trade dispute with the government over workload, conditions of service, pensions, and jobs. In November 2011, members of the NASUWT voted by a 4-to-1 margin (on a 39% turnout) to take strike action, and begin working to the letter of their contracts. The NASUWT set aside historical differences with the National Union of Teachers; a joint declaration in May 2012 led to a co-ordinated <b>work-to-rule</b> and strike action in autumn 2013.|$|E

50|$|The KMB {{services}} stopped operating {{during the}} Pacific War and Japanese occupation. After the war, Louey largely expanded his Company from {{about a hundred}} vehicles to more than seven hundred. Before his death, he ordered {{more than a hundred}} buses from the United Kingdom which would make the number of his buses rose to 895. Louey had also experienced a few labour disputes during his office. In June 1956 and October 1961, the KMB workers launched <b>work-to-rule</b> strikes against the Company's change of policies. In early December 1962 when the workers took the industrial action, Louey later on announced to raise the wage of the bus drivers.|$|E
5000|$|He {{set up the}} Cable and Wireless Staff Association in 1970 {{and became}} one of its leaders until 1975. The {{association}} negotiated with the company and successfully gained the collective bargaining. In April 1973 when Chan was the chairman and deliberately demoted, the association called for <b>work-to-rule</b> and made the company agree to negotiate. When the negotiation broke down in October, the association called for a go-slow and sit-in and the company dismissed 53 workers which made the association going back to the negotiation table. The incident probably led to the introduction of the [...] "cooling off period". Until the end of 1973 both sides agreed to hook the workers' wage to the civil servants.|$|E

5000|$|Malicious {{compliance}} is the behaviour of intentionally inflicting harm by strictly {{following the}} orders of a superior (no definition of [...] "superior".

[...] and similar others), knowing that compliance with the orders will not have the intended result. The term usually implies the following of an order in such a way that ignores the order's intent but follows its letter. It is usually done to injure or harm a superior while maintaining a sense of legitimacy. A specific form of industrial action that utilizes this behavior is <b>work-to-rule.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Russell {{was elected}} mayor of Cambridge in January 1984; {{it was his}} fourth attempt for a mayor's seat. At first, the city council was split, with {{incumbent}} Alfred Vellucci and three other candidates, including Russell, competing for the job; media predicted a protracted campaign like that of 1948, when it took 43 weeks to elect a candidate. Russell, this time in alliance with liberal council members, nevertheless was elected after only four weeks of debate. He was immediately involved into clashes around the firing of long-term School Superintendent William Lannon, accused of political patronage but supported by the parents; the situation temporarily defused only {{in the end of}} October and was followed by a <b>work-to-rule</b> action by schoolteachers in November. He also had to moderate local campaign against nerve gas testing at Arthur D. Little. In another controversial move, Russell spoke to [...] "stop the expansion of MIT and Harvard into Cambridge's neighborhoods" [...] and intervened against Harvard University plans, declaring his intention to take the property owned by Harvard on eminent domain terms and redevelop it into low-income public housing.|$|E
