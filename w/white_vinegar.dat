5|$|The most ideal {{food was}} that which most closely matched the humour of human beings, i.e. {{moderately}} warm and moist. Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained {{to achieve a}} true mixture of all the ingredients. White wine {{was believed to be}} cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and <b>white</b> <b>vinegar.</b> Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist. Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.|$|E

Then came silence, the silence of wonder, and slowly the priceless pearl melted in the strong acid. When it was melted she lifted the glass and shook it, then drank the vinegar, to the last drop.|$|E

40|$|A common {{technique}} {{used to control}} phorid fly infestations on stingless bee?s nests {{is the use of}} traps with commercial vinegars, especially the red wine vinegar, which is stated to be more efficient than the <b>white</b> wine <b>vinegar.</b> However, the claims on its greater efficacy are only circumstantial, not based on experiments. Thus, the aim of this work was to test the efficacy of traps composed of red wine or <b>white</b> wine commercial <b>vinegars</b> on the attractiveness of adult Pseudohypocera kerteszi Enderlein (Diptera Phoridae) females that infested colonies of Melipona fasciculata Smith, and Melipona seminigra Friese. The comparisons were made by placing one trap of red wine vinegar and other of <b>white</b> wine <b>vinegar</b> in infested colonies of the studied species for a week to check for possible differences in their attractiveness on phorids. We also tested the possibility that traps could attract phorid flies from outside the nests, thus potentially increasing an infestation. This was tested by placing traps of red wine vinegar in empty hives in the meliponary, thus eliminating bee?s odours and food stores as factors that could attract phorid flies. There was no difference on the attractiveness of traps composed of red wine or <b>white</b> wine <b>vinegars</b> (Wilcoxon matched-pairs test), and traps did not any attract phorid flies from the outside to the interior of hives. Thus, the red wine and <b>white</b> wine <b>vinegars</b> can be equally used to capture phorid flies that invade nests of stingless bees, and they do not attract flies from outside the nests, thus not increasing infestations. The other objective of this work was to correlate the body size, particularly the maximum head width of the captured phorids and their abundance, with the monthly rainfall levels during the experimental period. We noticed an increase of abundance of phorid flies on the rainy periods, but there was no correlation with body size, which we suggest to be a consequence of the weakening of bee colonies that normally occur during the rainy season, which ease the invasion of them by phorid flies from the environment. 201...|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{the total}} D-amino acid {{concentrations}} in high-brix apple <b>vinegar,</b> <b>white</b> wine <b>vinegar,</b> balsámico, tomato vinegar and lactic fermented tomato vinegar were 520.0, 10.1, 69.5, 237.7 and 3, 773.2 μM, respectively (Table  3). Among the 11 types of vinegar tested in this study, the highest total D-amino acid concentration was detected in lactic fermented tomato vinegar (3, 773.2 μM). Notably, tomato vinegar produced {{from the same}} source material but without lactic fermentation showed a much lower total D-amino acid concentration (237.7 μM, 4 kinds). This suggests it is the lactic fermentation that is mainly responsible {{for the production of}} D-amino acids.|$|R

50|$|Cantonese {{sweet and}} sour sauce is the direct {{ancestor}} of sauce {{of the same name}} in the West, and originally developed for {{sweet and sour}} pork. The late renowned chef from Hong Kong, Leung King, included the following as his sweet and sour source sauce recipe: <b>white</b> rice <b>vinegar,</b> salt, Chinese brown candy, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and dark soy sauce. Hong Kong's gourmet Willie Mak, himself a long time friend of Leung, suggests contemporary eateries not to resort to cheap bulk manufactured versions of vinegar, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce, or the sauce will risk being too sharp in taste and might break the balance of flavours. He suggests the more acidic <b>white</b> rice <b>vinegar</b> could be replaced with apple cider vinegar, and ketchup and Worcestershire sauce should be of renowned gourmet brands.|$|R
