5|$|Gustav {{spent the}} early part of its {{existence}} as a subtropical storm, and was the first such storm to be named from the current lists by the National Hurricane Center. Previously, subtropical storms <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> names. The cyclone was also the latest-forming first hurricane of the season since 1941.|$|E

5|$|Hitchcock {{did most}} of the {{promotion}} on his own, forbidding Leigh and Perkins to make the usual television, radio, and print interviews for fear of their revealing the plot. Even critics <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> private screenings but rather had to see the film with the general public, which, despite possibly affecting their reviews, certainly preserved the secret.|$|E
5|$|In {{its debut}} month, the NPD Group {{reported}} that Immortal Throne reached #13 in the dedicated PC gaming charts.

5|$|A New Zealander, Aaron Saxton's {{parents were}} Scientologists. Saxton's father {{committed}} suicide {{when he was}} 14, and this {{had a significant impact}} on him. At age 15 he joined the Scientology group called the Sea Org, an elite unit within the organisation. After joining Scientology staff, Saxton moved to work with the organisation in Sydney, Australia. Saxton's mother signed over guardianship of her son to Scientology when he was 16 years old. Saxton was assigned to become a security officer for the organisation. According to Saxton staff in Scientology <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> sufficient drugs or medical attention, and so he removed his own teeth without usage of medication for pain.|$|E

5|$|According to Ming Pao, {{family members}} of the victims were {{dissatisfied}} with the official investigation and held a sit-in protest, calling for a fair judgement. Some locals blamed the official rescue work by comparing it with a large emergency response exercise on a 330-meter building several days before, and the successful firefighting for a blaze at Shanghai World Financial Center in 2007. Others blamed an ineffective firefighting system for the high death toll, and were dissatisfied that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> more details about the fire.|$|E
5|$|Commanding {{his forces}} from Pleiku, Major General Phạm Văn Phú, the III Corps commander, was given {{adequate}} warnings {{of the impending}} North Vietnamese attacks, but they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> serious consideration. Phú was deceived by an elaborate North Vietnamese communications charade and his belief that PAVN movements toward Buôn Ma Thuột were diversionary operations designed to distract him from the true objective, Pleiku. The defense of Buôn Ma Thuột, therefore, was entrusted to a single Ranger group and provincial Popular and Regional Force units (approximately 4,000 men). They were augmented {{at the beginning of}} March by 53rd Regiment of the 23rd ARVN Division.|$|E
5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over, and when it had finally come to an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible. Understandably, defence issues <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> a high priority as people tried to rebuild their lives {{after the war and}} as such it was not until 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E

5|$|During 1957, hurricanes {{that formed}} east of 140°W <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> names {{by the local}} warning center. Those that either crossed or formed west of that point were named by the National Weather Bureau in Honolulu, Hawaii. These names {{were taken from the}} names used for Pacific typhoons. Three names were used in 1957, they were Kanoa, Della and Nina. Due to the lack of major damage from these storms, their names were not retired. However, once the Central Pacific adopted its own naming scheme, these names were no longer used.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{as part of}} Remembrance Week observances for the Canadian Senate, five {{family members}} of the {{soldiers}} who died in the crash were presented with Memorial Crosses. Other family members were due to receive them at a later date. The dead <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> posthumous Canadian Volunteer Service Medals as they never reached the Korean theatre; Tom Boutillier, a survivor of the crash, considers that an injustice and has campaigned for medals to be awarded.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{there was}} little {{opposition}} during the consultation period before the alterations were made. However, opposition to {{the reduction of the}} water area grew. The process that resulted in the alteration was criticised for being non-transparent and sneaky. Some organisations complained that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> an opportunity to express their opinion before the change was gazetted, and many politicians and the chief town planner were not informed. Critics bitterly insinuated that politically influential members of the Royal Canberra Golf Club, whose course was situated on the location of the proposed West Lake, were responsible for the change in policy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{table of}} means on the left, below, shows a {{quantitative}} interaction [...] - [...] treatment A is beneficial both when B is given, and when B <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>given,</b> but the benefit is greater when B <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> (i.e. when A is given alone). The table of means {{on the right}} shows a qualitative interaction. A is harmful when B is given, but it is beneficial when B <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>given.</b> Note that the same interpretation would hold if we consider the benefit of B based on whether A is given.|$|R

5|$|On 12 February 2009 Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik {{said that}} Pakistani {{national}} Javed Iqbal, who acquired VoIP phones in Spain for the Mumbai attackers, and Hamad Ameen Sadiq, who had facilitated money transfer for the attack, had been arrested. Two other men known as Khan and Riaz, but whose full names <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given,</b> were also arrested. Two Pakistanis {{were arrested in}} Brescia, Italy (east of Milan), on 21 November 2009, after being accused of providing logistical support to the attacks and transferring more than US$200 to Internet accounts using a false ID. They had Red Corner Notices issued against them by Interpol for their suspected involvement and it was issued after the last year's strikes.|$|E
5|$|Since they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> {{boarding}} {{passes for}} Flight11 in Portland, Atta and Omari checked in {{and went through}} security in Boston. In the rushed check-in after the flight from Portland, airline officials did not load Atta's bags on Flight11. Suqami, Wail al-Shehri, and Waleed al-Shehri also checked in for the flight in Boston. Wail al-Shehri and Suqami each checked one bag; Waleed al-Shehri did not check any bags. CAPPS selected all three for a detailed luggage check. As the CAPPS' screening was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint.|$|E
5|$|Sneak King is one {{of three}} promotional Burger King-themed {{releases}} for North American winter 2006. The other two games are Pocketbike Racer and Big Bumpin'. The Burger King exclusive marketing run was from November 19 through December 24, 2006. The games were available for $3.99 with any purchase of any Burger King value meal.

It was reported that more than 3.2 million copies were sold, although Sneak King distinct sales <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given,</b> in Game Developers April 2007 issue.|$|E

5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} the orders had been made without any notice or hearing, and they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> an {{opportunity}} to explain or correct the allegations against them. This was contrary to natural justice, which requires a person {{to be given the}} right to be heard before his or her interest is violated. As natural justice is an essential aspect of both {{the rule of law and}} the equal treatment by the law of all persons, the appellants argued that the deprivation of their right to a fair hearing was a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which affords to all persons equality before the law and equal protection of the law.|$|E
5|$|The early 1900s lacked modern {{forecasting}} and documentation. The hurricane database {{from these}} years is sometimes {{found to be}} incomplete or incorrect, and new storms are continually being added {{as part of the}} ongoing Atlantic hurricane reanalysis. The period from 1911 through 1914 was reanalyzed in 2005. Two previously unknown tropical cyclones were identified using records including historical weather maps and ship reports, and information on the known storms was amended and corrected. These storms are referred to simply by their number in chronological order, since tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> official names until much later.|$|E
5|$|Using MVP voting results, {{historical}} {{surveys and}} sabermetric analysis, historian Bill Deane projected in 1989 that Pierce {{would have won}} the American League Cy Young Award in 1953 and 1956 {{if it had been}} given at the time; the award was not created until 1956 (when the National League's Don Newcombe won the award by unanimous vote), and awards <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> for both leagues until 1967. In 1988, baseball historian and statistician Bill James chose Pierce as having had the tenth greatest career value among left-handers, ahead of six Hall of Famers.|$|E
