5|$|In 1799 the 49th was {{assigned}} to the Helder Expedition against the Batavian Republic (now known as the Netherlands), to be led by Sir Ralph Abercromby. During the troop landings, Brock saw his first combat on 10 September 1799 under the command of then-Major-General John Moore. Given that the 49th was in poor shape when Brock took command, they saw little actual combat. Likely Moore was sparing them and using more experienced troops to establish the beachhead. Finally on 2 October the 49th <b>was</b> <b>actively</b> involved in heavy combat at the Battle of Alkmaar, where they acquitted themselves well, sustaining only 33 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Kepler's primary {{obligation}} as imperial mathematician {{was to provide}} astrological advice to the emperor.

In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolph <b>was</b> <b>actively</b> interested in the work of many of his court scholars (including numerous alchemists) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.|$|E

She was the first Russian ship to fire on enemy targets on land during World War I, the first to be hit by a German airstrike, and the first to destroy a submarine, albeit a Russian one. In April 1918 the fleeing Bolsheviks abandoned Rostislav in Sevastopol. A year later the British occupation forces permanently disabled her engines. The White forces used the ship as a towed floating battery, then scuttled her in the Strait of Kerch in November 1920.|$|E
5|$|Thallium {{can also}} be {{obtained}} from the smelting of lead and zinc ores. Manganese nodules found on the ocean floor contain some thallium, but the collection of these nodules has been prohibitively expensive. There is also the potential for damaging the oceanic environment. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and/or silver. These minerals are rare, and they have had no commercial importance as sources of thallium. The Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia was the only area where thallium <b>was</b> <b>actively</b> mined. This deposit still contains an estimated 500tonnes of thallium, and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals, for example lorándite.|$|E
