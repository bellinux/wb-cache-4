2500|$|This {{particular}} Fourier {{series is}} troublesome {{because of its}} poor convergence properties. It is not clear a priori whether the series converges pointwise. Because of Fourier analysis, since the Fourier coefficients are [...] "square-summable", the Fourier series converges in L2 which is all <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> this particular theory to function. We mention for the interested reader {{that in this case}} we may rely on a result which says that Fourier's series converge at every point of differentiability, and at jump points (the function x, considered as a periodic function, has a jump atnbsp&) converges to the average of the left and right limits (see convergence of Fourier series).|$|E
2500|$|The Bahá'í teachings see {{minority}} group members as full {{members of the}} broader society, and thus {{see the need for}} unique cultural rights. Language is strongly attached to culture. In Bahá'í literature, one's mother tongue is described as [...] "the most profound characteristic of a people", [...] "the garment of the spirit of the people", the [...] "native air which <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> living and dying, which surrounds us from cradle to grave, which is and remains our most personal property." [...] Whereas both cultural and linguistic change are normal and ever-greater world unity expected, the precipitous extinction of non-dominant languages and cultures is therefore undesirable. Since the Bahá'í teachings on oneness of humankind emphasize the value of both diversity and unity in the sense of harmony rather than simple sameness, minority cultural rights {{can be seen as a}} matter of cultural justice, and language rights a subset of those cultural rights.|$|E

5000|$|Eisenhower {{appointed}} his friend, {{retired general}} Lucius Clay, {{to lead a}} presidential commission to study highway design proposals. In January 1955 they recommended a 10-year construction program costing $101 billion to build 41,000 miles of divided highways that would link all medium and major cities. Clay talked Eisenhower out of using toll roads. After compromising with Democrats in 1956, the system was financed by a trust fund based on gasoline taxes of four cents a gallon and taxes on tires. The Federal share of the funding was 90%; the states built, owned and maintained the highways. Clay stated: It was evident <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> better highways. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> them <b>for</b> safety, to accommodate more automobiles. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> them <b>for</b> defense purposes, if that should ever be necessary. And <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> them <b>for</b> the economy. Not just as a public works measure, but for future growth.|$|R

Going by railroad I do not consider as travelling at all; it is merely [...] "being sent" [...] to a place, and very little different from becoming a parcel; the next step to it would of course be telegraphic transport, of which, however, I suppose it has been truly said by Octave Feuillet, ...|$|E

Among them are two great metal contrivances, outside the Dipsey and near her bows, which open into the water, and also communicate with the inside of her hull. These are called electric gills, and they separate air from the water around us in a manner somewhat resembling the way in which a fish's gills act.

This--this is the dawn of a new day in human living. At the climax of that civilisation which had its beginning in the hammered flint and the fire-stick of the savage, just when it is becoming apparent that our ever-increasing needs cannot be borne indefinitely by our present sources of energy, we discover suddenly the possibility of an entirely new civilisation.
