5|$|Whale vocalization {{is likely}} to serve several purposes. Some species, such as the {{humpback}} whale, communicate using melodic sounds, known as whale song. These sounds may be extremely loud, depending on the species. Humpback whales only have been heard making clicks, while toothed whales use sonar that may generate up to 20,000 <b>watts</b> <b>of</b> sound (+73dBm or +43dBw) and be heard for many miles.|$|E

5|$|The isotope plutonium-238 has a {{half-life}} of 87.74years. It emits a {{large amount}} of thermal energy with low levels of both gamma rays/photons and spontaneous neutron rays/particles. Being an alpha emitter, it combines high energy radiation with low penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding. A sheet of paper can be used to shield against the alpha particles emitted by plutonium-238. One kilogram of the isotope can generate about 570 <b>watts</b> <b>of</b> heat.|$|E
5|$|A spherical shell Dyson sphere in the Solar System with a {{radius of}} one astronomical unit, {{so that the}} {{interior}} surface would receive {{the same amount of}} sunlight as Earth does per unit solid angle, would have a surface area of approximately , or about 550 million times the surface area of Earth. This would intercept the full 384.6 yottawatts (3.846 × 1026 <b>watts)</b> <b>of</b> the Sun's output. Non-shell designs would intercept less, but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar System at this point of the Sun's evolution. This is approximately 33 trillion times the power consumption of humanity in 1998, which was 12 terawatts.|$|E

25|$|KFIZ began {{experimental}} broadcasting at 1100 kHz and 100 <b>watts</b> <b>of</b> {{power in}} May 1922 with licensed operation beginning in July 1923. In 1928, the station changed frequencies to 1120kHz {{and again in}} 1930 to 1420kHz, still at 100 watts. In 1942, KFIZ moved to its current frequency of 1450kHz and in the mid-1940s the station increased signal power to 250 watts. KFIZ currently broadcasts with 1,000 <b>watts</b> <b>of</b> power.|$|E
25|$|Color of {{the beam}} (for visible wavelengths). In general, the eyes of pilots in an {{illuminated}} nighttime cockpit are most sensitive to greenish-yellow light (of wavelength around 500600 nanometers, peaking at 555nm). A blue or red laser will appear much dimmer—and thus less distracting—than a green or yellow laser of equal power (wattage). To give a specific example, a 10-watt continuous-wave YAG laser at 532 nanometers (green) can appear brighter to the eye than an 18-watt continuous-wave argon-ion laser that outputs 10 <b>watts</b> <b>of</b> 514nm (green-blue) light plus 8 <b>watts</b> <b>of</b> 488nm (blue) light.|$|E

5000|$|The {{definition}} {{tells us}} that 1 <b>watt</b> <b>of</b> pure green 555 nm light is [...] "worth" [...] 683 lumens. It does not say anything about other wavelengths. Because lumens are photometric units, their relationship to watts depends on the wavelength according to how visible the wavelength is. Infrared and ultraviolet radiation, for example, are invisible and do not count. One <b>watt</b> <b>of</b> infrared radiation (which is {{where most of the}} radiation from an incandescent bulb falls) is worth zero lumens. Within the visible spectrum, wavelengths of light are weighted according to a function called the [...] "photopic spectral luminous efficiency." [...] According to this function, 700 nm red light is only about 0.4% as efficient as 555 nm green light. Thus, one <b>watt</b> <b>of</b> 700 nm red light is [...] "worth" [...] only 2.7 lumens.|$|R
