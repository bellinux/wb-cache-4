5000|$|In 2006, {{voters in}} six states (Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, and Ohio) {{approved}} statewide {{increases in the}} state minimum wage. The amounts of these increases ranged from $1 to $1.70 per hour and all increases were designed to annually index to inflation. Some politicians in the United States have advocated linking the minimum wage to the Consumer Price Index, thereby increasing the wage automatically each year based on increases to the Consumer Price Index. So far, Ohio, Oregon, Missouri, Vermont and Washington have linked their minimum wages to the consumer price index. Minimum <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> also takes place each year in Florida, San Francisco, California, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} of {{estimating}} a <b>wage</b> <b>index</b> is proposed and implemented. We construct a <b>wage</b> <b>index</b> by controlling for quantity, as well as quality of labor. Our approach uses a set of year dummies {{as the basis for}} calculation of a <b>wage</b> <b>index.</b> The March Current Population Survey Supplement (1983 - 2000) is employed, and empirical wage equation models are estimated in this paper. The estimation results of the proposed <b>wage</b> <b>index</b> suggest that the existing Employment Cost Index perhaps overestimates the increases in wages adjusted for quality. quality of labor...|$|R

50|$|However, {{because of}} wage {{inflation}} {{the federal government}} indexes wages so that $35,648.55 earned in year 2004 {{is exactly the same}} as $23,753.53 earned in 1994. Those two figures came from the yearly list of National Average <b>Wage</b> <b>indexing</b> series. This series gross up earlier years wages so that all years earnings up to age 60 are put on equal footing. Because it takes more than one year to fully collect such data, and because some people have January birthdays, the age 62 calculation done in 2006 must be based on the most recent data which is the 2004 national average wage. By law, all covered workers who attain age 62 in 2006 must be treated the same with respect to wage indexation so the 2004 figure for national average wage must be used for the entire 2006 year. Thus the age 61 and age 62 wages will get a bonus because they will not be indexed downward.|$|E
40|$|The {{automatic}} {{adjustment of}} earnings {{to the cost}} of living usually had two objectives, to protect wages {{in whole or in part}} from the effects of inflation and to avoid a spate of destabilising wage claims. Recently, however, in Italy a third aim has been added, that of reducing the differences in remuneration. The present article looks at the experience and prospects of <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> in Italy, limiting the analysis to the sliding-scale in industry. The author first considers how <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> works in Italian industry. The average effectiveness of <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> is then examined.

40|$|While a {{standard}} academic presumption {{has been that}} wage indexation reduces the cost of disinflation, policymakers generally contend that <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> makes disinflation more difficult. To shed light on these views, this paper reexamines the effects of <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> on the output loss caused by money-based stabilization. It finds {{that the cost of}} disinflation with indexed wage contracts tends to be smaller than that with contracts that specify preset time-varying wages, but larger than that with contracts that specify fixed wages. Thus the academic and policymakers views can be both appropriate depending on the standard of reference. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{empirical}} {{analysis of the}} relationship between wage indexation, discretionary wage adjustment and inflation in Italy, by specifying and estimating (on quarterly time series for 1963 - 85) a short-term model for the price-wage nexus in the industrial sector of a small open economy. The influence of <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> is considered {{in the light of the}} concept of optimum degree of indexation (for which empirical estimates are provided), and the links between indexing and discretionary wage adjustment. The main conclusion is that, at least since 1973, institutional interventions on the degree of indexation seem to be only partially determined by variations in the optimum degree of indexation. As a result, <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> has increased price variance without this being justified by the fact that wages are closer on average to their equilibrium level. On the other hand, the estimates show no impact of <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> on the average inflation rate, as price expectations come into wage determination only to the extent of the complement to one of the degree of wage indexation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Rogoff (1985) {{proposition}} {{that it is}} socially optimal to delegate monetary policy to a conser-vative central banker has been challenged by a literature that argues {{that if there is}} an inflation-averse monopoly union in the economy, it is optimal to delegate monetary policy to an “ultra-liberal ” central banker, that is, a central banker that is interested only in stabilizing output. In this paper, we examine whether introducing <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> into the later models has any effect on the optimal degree of central bank conservativeness.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{studies and}} {{contributes}} to the literature regarding central bank independence and central bank transparency. The thesis is split into three parts with the first part (which coincides with the first chapter of the thesis) providing in-depth reviews of the issues and key papers of both the theoretical and empirical literature on the central bank independence and transparency. Furthermore, there is an extensive review of the goals and functions of the European Central Bank (ECB) as well a short survey concerning the issues of independence and transparency of the ECB. In the second part we examine how <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> affects the optimal degree of central bank conservativeness. In particular, in the third chapter of the thesis we develop a theoretical model when there is a monopoly worker union in the economy which is explicitly inflation-averse and examine how <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> affects the optimal degree of central bank conservativeness. In the fourth chapter we study the same issue but in a dynamic setting where the economy is characterized by employment persistence. In the third part we examine the relationship between central bank independence, central bank transparency and public debt policy. In particular, in the fifth chapter we empirically estimate the relationship between central bank transparency and the percentage of nominal debt for various OECD countries. In the sixth chapter we develop a theoretical model where we examine the inter-relationships between central bank independence, transparency and public debt issuing policy. The last part of the thesis reviews the results of the thesis and draws conclusions and recommendations towards the ECB. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{potential}} {{component of}} the administration’s Social Security proposal is to shift from “wage indexing” of benefits to “price indexing. ” This change sounds modest, but, in fact, would {{change the nature of}} the Social Security program. Price indexing would preserve the purchasing power of Social Security benefits, but these benefits would represent an ever-declining percentage of earnings before retirement. This Just the Facts discusses the reasons for keeping benefits up-to-date with either prices or wages. Then it describes the mechanics of both wage and price indexing, and the impact of shifting from wages to prices. Finally, it explores the implications of price indexing in terms of possible long-run responses — periodic adjustments or increased reliance on welfare programs. price indexing, <b>wage</b> <b>indexing,</b> social security benefits...|$|E
40|$|In July of 1998, {{the method}} for {{determining}} payments for Medicare services in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) began a three-year transition from retrospective cost-based reimbursement to a SNF prospective payment system (SNF PPS).

40|$|Real {{exchange}} rate appreciation usually accompanies stabilization programs {{based on the}} {{exchange rate}}. One thing that causes the real exchange rate to appreciate is the capital inflows that follow liberalization of the capital account and the financial market. Capital inflows cause the exchange rate to appreciate {{in part because of}} the resulting increase in expenditures. This appreciation is exacerbated if there is some price rigidity, and if control of the money supply is only partial. All these conditions existed during Chile's experiment with exchange rate-based disinflation between 1978 and 1981. Simulating what might have been, the authors study how exchange rate based disinflation affects expenditures switching and reduction when wages are partially indexed in some segments of the labor market.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{capability}} of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with staggered price setting and real wage rigidities to fit the data with reasonable average durations of price and wage contracts. The authors implement a Bayesian approach for parameter estimation and for model comparison with other models that only incorporate nominal rigidities. Their main results can be summarized as follows: First, the authors find that, on average, prices are fixed for three quarters, nominal wages are fixed for five quarters, {{and half of the}} wage setters follow a real <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> rule of thumb. Second, when the authors remove real wage rigidities and reestimate the model, the parameter on price duration increases. Hence, the lack of endogenous persistence due to real wage rigidities is substituted by a high degree of price stickiness. Third, the authors find little evidence of backward-looking behavior in price inflation. Finally, using the marginal likelihood as a comparison criterion, their model performs best.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that contemporaneous wage indexation stabilizes output and employment {{in the face of}} monetary shocks, but hampers the adjustment of the economy to real shocks that require changes in the real wage. Another feature of <b>wage</b> <b>indexing</b> is that it reduces the incentive of the government to raise output through unexpected inflation, since wages react automatically to prices. In this paper I construct a simple model where the decision on the degree of wage indexation is not taken by atomistic agents, but by a "large" agent such as the government. Under this assumption I show that the optimal degree of indexing depends not only on the variance of real shocks, but also on the "inflation bias" of the government, due to the incentive to raise employment above the market-clearing level. In particular the model predicts that wage indexation will be low not only if real shocks are large, but also if the government is inflation-averse. The ability of monetary policy to offset monetary disturbances makes them irrelevant to the determination of the optimal degree of indexing...|$|E
