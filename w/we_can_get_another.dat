If <b>we</b> <b>can</b> really <b>get</b> <b>another</b> male ally to join us at this trying moment, it will aid us much; and I am not without hope that when the savages find that we are able to keep the lake, they will offer to give up their prisoners in {{exchange}} for skins, or at least for the keg of powder {{that we have in the}} house." ...|$|R

Certainly, that will be the best plan, and will avoid the {{necessity}} of spoiling the yacht's speed, which may be of vital importance to us at a critical moment.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2008 {{speech by}} Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Donald Kerr, [...] "Our National Counterproliferation Center {{is trying to}} lead the way in {{developing}} a plan to have a Counterproliferation Reserve Corps. It's really an adjunct to the Intelligence Reserve Corps that we already have, but we're really trying to bring these people back in a way that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>another</b> ten years or so out of their accumulated knowledge. It's going to be very important not just in the proliferation area. I think {{there are a number of}} others where we're going to have that same issue." ...|$|E

Applying flexible beam technology to space probe-cone docking mechanism, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>another</b> way to buffer docking impact shock. In this paper, a simplified model of probe-cone docking impact based on the finite element method is built firstly; the influence of flexible structure to impact shock effect is discussed...|$|E
6000|$|Answering her daughter's {{questions}} downstairs, {{the landlady}} described her guest as a nice-looking {{man dressed in}} deep mourning. [...] "Young, my dear, with beautiful dark brown hair, and a grand beard, and a sweet sorrowful look. Ah, his eyes would tell anybody that his black clothes are not a mere sham. Whether married or single, of course I can't say. But I noticed the name on his travelling-bag. A distinguished name in my opinion--Hugh Mountjoy. I wonder what he'll order to drink when he has his dinner? What a mercy it will be if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> rid of <b>another</b> bottle of the sour French wine!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Luz de Vida is {{a charity}} album benefiting the Tucson Together Fund, {{supporting}} those {{affected by the}} 2011 shooting in Tucson, Arizona, United States. Similar to <b>Can</b> <b>We</b> <b>Get</b> Together, <b>another</b> album with the same cause, Luz de Vida (whose title is Spanish for [...] "Light of life") features a large lineup of Tucson-based artists, but unlike that album, a number of nationally-famous acts from Tucson are featured. The album was released by Fort Lowell Records on October 18, 2011 on Bandcamp and as a limited-edition 12-song vinyl, and was sanctioned by Music Against Violence, a coalition of Tucson-based writers, recording engineers, and venue operators. As of April 29, 2016, the album is still available for purchase on Bandcamp.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Watch That Man' {{was very}} much a Stones-sounding thing, with the vocal used as an {{instrument}} rather than as a lead. When it came to mixing the track, to get the sort of power of it, I just put everything up front, which meant losing the vocal. So I did the mix the way I felt. When we delivered the tapes of the album, I heard from MainMan, 'Great, but <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>another</b> mix on [...] "Watch That Man" [...] with the vocal more up front so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> hear a bit more of David?' So I said, 'Fine,' and did the mix with David more up front. The problem though is that with the vocal more up front, the other instruments have to drop back. Then, a couple of weeks later, I get a phone call from RCA, and they said 'You were right in the first place. We'll go with the original.' ...|$|R
3000|$|This {{implies that}} the reduced {{operator}} RL has only coefficients for the even powers of the derivative, so the equation is self-adjoint. If the boundary conditions are appropriate (we will clarify this statement in Theorem  4.4), then the Green’s function is symmetric [18]. Observe that c_ 0 =a_ 0 ^ 2 -b_ 0 ^ 2. Also, if L=∑_i= 0 ^n (a_iφ^*+b_i [...])D^i with a_n 0 or b_n 0, then we have that c_ 2 n=(- 1)^n(a_n^ 2 -b_n^ 2). Hence, if a_n=± b_n, then c_ 2 n= 0. This shows that composing two elements of R[D,φ^*], <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>another</b> element that has simpler terms {{in the sense of}} derivatives of lower order. This is quite difficult when computing the Green’s functions since, in this case, we could have one, many, or no solutions of our original problem [16]. The following example is quite illustrative.|$|E
40|$|Short {{two-dimensional}} compact chains adsorbed on {{the attractive}} surface at different temperatures were investigated {{by using the}} enumeration calculation method. First we investigate the chain {{size and shape of}} adsorbed chains, such as characteristic ratios of mean-square radii of gyration (S- 2) (x) /N and (S- 2) (y) /N, shape factor (delta), and the orientation of chain bonds (cos(2) theta) to illuminate how {{the size and shape of}} adsorbed compact chains change with increasing temperatures. There are some special behaviors for the chain size and shape at low temperature, especially for strong attraction interaction. In the meantime, adsorbed compact chains have different behaviors from general adsorbed polymer chains. Some thermodynamics properties are also discussed here. Heat capacity changes non-monotonously, first increases and then reduces. The transition temperature T-c is nearly 1. 0, 1. 4, 2. 0 and 4. 2 (in the unit of T-o) for the case of epsilon = 0, - 1, - 2 and - 4 (in the unit of kT(o)), respectively. Average energy per bond increases while average Helmholtz free energy per bond decreases with increasing temperatures. From these two thermodynamics parameters <b>we</b> <b>can</b> also <b>get</b> <b>another</b> transition temperature T-c', and it is close to 0. 7, 1. 1, 1. 5 and 3. 4 for epsilon = 0, - 1, - 2, and - 4, respectively. Therefore, T-c is greater than T-c' under the same condition. These investigations may provide some insights into the thermodynamics behaviors of adsorbed protein-like chains...|$|R
