500|$|In 1989, the Whitney Museum held a {{retrospective}} of her work, Yoko Ono: Objects, Films, marking Ono's reentry into the New York art world after a hiatus. At {{the suggestion of}} Ono's live-in companion at the time, [...] interior decorator Sam Havadtoy, she recast her old pieces in bronze after some initial reluctance. [...] "I realized that for something to move me so much that I would cry, there's something there. There seemed like a shimmering air in the 60s <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> these pieces, and now the air is bronzified. Now it's the 80s, and bronze is very 80s in a way - solidity, commodity, all of that.

500|$|McCain was {{mentioned}} as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination beginning in 1997, but he took few steps to pursue it, instead concentrating on his 1998 senate re-election. [...] The decision of General Colin Powell not to run helped persuade McCain {{that there might be}} an opening for him. [...] McCain later wrote that he had a [...] "vague aspiration" [...] of running for president for a long time. [...] He would also be candid about his motivation: [...] "I didn't decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism. In truth, I wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to become president. I was sixty-two years old <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> the decision, and I thought it was my one shot at the prize." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the second}} European leg of Madonna's Sticky & Sweet Tour in 2009, the {{performance}} of [...] "Hung Up" [...] {{was removed from the}} setlist and was replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen". This performance was included on the show's fourth and final Rave segment, where it was set between the performances of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". The video backdrops used for this performance featured outtakes from the song's original music video directed by Chris Cunningham. Madonna sampled DJ Calvin Harris' 2009 single [...] "I'm Not Alone" [...] into the performance. Harris praised the version saying, [...] "I never imagined <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> it in my little purple room in Glasgow in my flat that it would reach far and wide as it has– it's always a privilege." [...] Six years later, on October 1, 2015, Madonna performed an acoustic version of [...] "Frozen" [...] on the Detroit stop of her Rebel Heart Tour. Four days later, she repeated the performance on the San Jose stop.|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, {{the track}} was {{released}} as the album's buzz single, {{not intended to}} be the first release of Raymond v. Raymond, but to generate reception and feedback. In March 2010, Usher continued to support Garrett's original claims, stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended. Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond: [...] "I think people would have immediately alluded to the fact I was talking about my wife <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> that record — and now my ex-wife," [...] he said. [...] "When the song was recorded, I wasn't divorced. It was some reality in the contrast of trying to make it all work, having to balance a career and having a normal life. Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when you have those type of relationships. I felt that in a way, the story did touch on certain things at the time. I didn't know how realistic it would become. I didn't know I would become divorced. I did know it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance this world of being married and having this responsibility that's like a marriage at the same time. The song spoke to that place. Unfortunately, it did become a reality." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} from lecturing in London in January 1939 Renoir left Paris {{to work on}} a script. He told a reporter that his next film would be [...] "A precise description of the bourgeois of our age." [...] Renoir, Carl Koch and Zwoboda went to Marlotte to work on the script. Because Renoir wanted to allow the actors to improvise their dialogue, only one-third of the film was scripted and the rest was a detailed outline. Renoir later said that his [...] "ambition <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> the film was to illustrate this remark: we are dancing on a volcano." [...] Renoir called the film a [...] "divertissement" [...] for its use of baroque music and aspects of classical French comedies. Renoir's initial inspiration by Les Caprices de Marianne led to the film's four main characters correlating with those of the play; a virtuous wife, a jealous husband, a despairing lover and an interceding friend. In both the play and the film the interceding friend is named Octave. Octave is also the only of the four characters inspired by the play that shares traits with its counterpart. In both works Octave is a [...] "sad clown" [...] full of self-doubt and self-pity. The characters' names constantly changed between versions of the script; Renoir said that in an early draft André Jurieux was an orchestra conductor rather than an aviator.|$|E
500|$|... "I Luv This Shit" [...] {{was written}} by August Alsina, The Exclusives (Sean McMillion and Ralph Jeanty), Samuel Irving III, Christine Massa, and Trinidad James and was {{produced}} by Knucklehead. It was recorded by McMillion and Cody Sciara at Goldie's Playhouse and Zac Recording Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Trehy Harris at Larrabee Sound Studios, North Hollywood. Vocals were produced by The Exclusives. Knucklehead told Vibe in 2014 that he created the song's beat and {{knew it would be}} successful, stating: [...] "I just knew what [...] voice was gonna do over my beat. And that beat didn't sound like thing else at the time that was out ... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> the beat, I called him immediately after I finished it." [...] After playing the beat to Alsina and The Exclusives, they recorded the song in one hour. It is an R song instrumented by guitar, synthesizer, synth-horns and a heavy bassline. The production was compared by Spin Brandon Soderberg to the work of The-Dream. It revolves around about partying with alcohol and drugs with the central hook [...] "I love this shit", and references the vodka Ciroc, yet {{there is an element of}} sorrow to Alsina's vocals. James' verse contemplates human nature, according to Gregory Adams of Exclaim!. [...] "I Luv This Shit" [...] was originally recorded for Alsina's mixtape The Product 2 (2013), and was included on his debut EP [...] (2013). It was also a bonus track on his first studio album, Testimony (2014).|$|E
500|$|... "Back Up, Dancer" [...] {{was written}} by Tracy Poust and Jon Kinnally and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 23, 2004. It was confirmed in mid-2004 that singer Janet Jackson would guest star as herself on the television series Will & Grace. She recorded her lines {{in front of a}} live audience on August 17. Jackson's role in the show had been her first television acting role in nearly two decades. Jackson's last prime-time role was on NBC's Fame. She also appeared in the television shows Diff'rent Strokes and Good Times. In addition, Jackson's appearance came nine months after the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. She told the entertainment news program Access Hollywood that she was a [...] "big fan" [...] of the show, and that she could not wait to join the cast for her stint. Also in this interview, she believed that Sean Hayes, who plays Jack, was a decent dancer. [...] "I thought he studied dance. I really did, It's so funny. I have to catch myself because I'm cracking up in rehearsals. It's just funny to watch [...]" [...] Jackson [...] "had a tough time" [...] on the set because she constantly messed up her lines. She admitted that it was not as easy as she had hoped it would be. [...] "I flubbed my lines and got so frustrated <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> those mistakes. I haven't done TV since Different Strokes, and it's not like Saturday Night Live where you can read cue cards. On Will & Grace, they're always rewriting, so you're always memorising." [...] Jackson, however, said that the dancing was the [...] "easy part of playing myself".|$|E

The film has also effectively redefined {{the use of}} the term [...] "zombie". While the word [...] "zombie" [...] itself is never used—the word used in the film is ghoul—Romero's film introduced the theme of zombies as reanimated, flesh-eating cannibals. Romero himself didn't initially consider the antagonists in the film zombies, later saying [...] "I never thought of my guys as zombies, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> the first film...To me, zombies were still those boys in the Caribbean doing the wetwork for [...] Lugosi." ...|$|E

[...] Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment bought the film rights to the Taylor Stevens novel The Informationist in October 2012 with plans for Cameron to direct it. A screenwriter will be hired to adapt the novel while Cameron works on the Avatar sequels. Another project Cameron has announced is a personal commitment to shoot a film on the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as told through the story of Tsutomu Yamaguchi, a man who survived both attacks. Cameron met with Yamaguchi just days before he died in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a lengthy}} musical break, Norwood {{established}} a flourishing acting career with her sitcom Moesha. She eventually entered recording studios on October 1997, {{to begin work}} on her second studio album, barely satisfied with the material that was presented to her. However, the recording of the album was postponed several times as Norwood felt that many songs wouldn't express {{what she wanted to}} tell at this point of her career. [...] "Many of the songs I heard were not 'me'," [...] the singer stated during a promotional interview with Jet in 1999, [...] "And If I can't feel it, then I won't sing it.

Portis said that if Vick is charged and convicted of dog fighting, [...] "then you're putting him behind bars for no reason. I don't {{know if he was}} fighting dogs or not, but it's his property. It's his dog. If that's what he wants to do, do it." [...] Those comments were sharply criticized by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. The Redskins and Portis himself later apologized, stating that his controversial remarks about dog fighting were insensitive and that he now realizes he [...] "shouldn't have made the comments."

2500|$|Although Kobach's {{campaign}} treasurer, Tom Arpke, possessed campaign experience, {{losing a}} state senate race in 2008, winning a Salina City Council seat the next year, {{and a state}} House seat in 2010, he {{was found to have}} under-reported contributions by $35,000 and nearly $43,000 in expenditures in Kobach's 2010 campaign, resulting in a maximum $5,000 fine. Kobach complained that he was being discriminated against because former Republican Governor Bill Graves received a much smaller fine for similar violations. Kobach alleged, [...] "The only real distinction I can see is that I'm a conservative and he's a moderate." [...] The chair of the Kansas ethics commission said [...] "The commission does not condone lack of candor before the commission."

Treated [...] "like a slave," [...] by her in-laws, Hirono said, in 1951 Laura left her abusive marriage. The deciding moment for her had come after Akira, who had returned to Hawaii after the war, had sent some money for a school uniform for Laura's youngest son Wayne, but her husband had taken it to buy an overcoat. As Laura later recounted, [...] "My brother sent {{money to buy a}} school uniform for my son. My husband took the money, went to town and never came back home.

That's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> up my mind to leave." [...] After telling her in-laws she would be taking her elder son and Hirono to school in her hometown, Laura left the house, never to return.
