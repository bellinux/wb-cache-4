Concertus Manila, a Philippine based company, provides the possibility of giving metro Manila {{a chance to see}} high-end productions. In 2016, they did a production of Les Miserables, in 2014 they did , and Wicked <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> back in 2017. At the moment, there is currently a production of Sister Act and Kinky Boots in the Metro-Manila area.|$|E
25|$|Assigned to Earth, Rider {{is confronted}} with the {{challenge}} of balancing dual lives as a member of both the Nova Corps and the New Warriors. Rider encounters a Nova Corps member from an alternate timeline named Nova 0:0, who prepares him to stop the Deathstorm, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> to destroy Earth. Because Rider defies Xandar's Queen Adora to stop the Deathstorm, he is temporarily stripped of his powers and rank, but is given back his powers when his replacement sacrifices himself.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} casting was announced, Barber told a {{reporter}} for the Herald Sun that he loved his character and said his determination and focus would get him into trouble. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said Rhys's arrival would cause a stir in Erinsborough and may not go down well with some of the local residents. Barber also called Rhys ambitious and said that while he is not a villain, he is not an entirely good guy either. The actor explained [...] "He rides that line and that's {{a lot of fun to}} play. There are a lot of different dynamics. He can be very persuasive, bordering on manipulative, but he has a sensitive side as well, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> out gradually." [...] Barber told a writer for Inside Soap that Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life, and can easily switch from one to the other. Barber quipped that Rhys knows how to have a good time, while the official Neighbours website said he considers himself [...] "a bit of a ladies' man". A Herald Sun reporter said Rhys would [...] "rile" [...] his colleague, Karl Kennedy. Alan Fletcher, who plays Karl, revealed that his character and Rhys would share many scenes. Fletcher explained that it can be [...] "somewhat galling" [...] for Karl to be faced with Rhys, who is an enthusiastic young doctor. The actor added [...] "So expect some fun confrontation but also cleverly the writers have explored what Rhys and Karl might have in common." ...|$|E

2500|$|Frederick Lewis Taylor {{claims that}} a {{kneeling}} volley fire {{may have been}} employed by Prospero Colonna's arquebusiers {{as early as the}} Battle of Bicocca (1522). However this has been called into question by Tonio Andrade who believes this is an over interpretation as well as mis-citation of a passage by Charles Oman suggesting that the Spanish arquebusiers kneeled to reload, when in fact Oman never made such a claim. European gunners might have implemented the volley fire to some extent since at least 1579 when the Englishman Thomas Digges suggested that musketeers should, [...] "after the old Romane manner make three or four several fronts, with convenient spaces for the first to retire and unite himselfe with the second, and both these if occasion so require, with the third; the shot [...] having their convenient lanes continually during the fight to discharge their peces." [...] The Spanish too displayed some awareness of the volley technique and described it in a military manual dating to 1586: [...] "Start with three files of five soldiers each, separated one from the other by fifteen paces, and they should comport themselves not with fury but with calm skillfulness [...] such that when the first file has finished shooting they make space for the next (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> up to shoot) without turning face, countermarching [...] to the left but showing the enemy only the side of their bodies, which is the narrowest of the body, and [...] about one to three steps behind, with five or six pellets in their mouths, and two lighted matchlock fuses … and they load [...] promptly … and return to shoot when it's their turn again." ...|$|E

60|$|How strange it is {{that the}} great {{emotional}} scenes of history, one of <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> along almost immediately, always begin in this prosaic way Shakespeare tries to conceal the fact, but {{there can be little doubt}} that Romeo and Juliet edged into their balcony scene with a few remarks on the pleasantness of the morning.|$|E

60|$|Down {{the road}} of the Ticino valley I felt again my terror of this new world <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> into being on top of us.

6000|$|My friends, we see God doing thus {{in these}} very days by great nations, by great {{branches}} of industry.
