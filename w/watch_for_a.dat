5|$|King Henry's Mound, a Neolithic burial barrow, is {{the highest}} point within the park and is located within the public gardens of Pembroke Lodge. At various times the mound's name has been {{connected}} with Henry VIII or with his father Henry VII. But {{there is no evidence}} to support the legend that Henry VIII stood on the mound to <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sign from St Paul's that Anne Boleyn had been executed at the Tower and that he was then free to marry Jane Seymour.|$|E
5|$|On July20, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> portion of the southwestern Mexico coast from Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco; this watch remained posted until {{the early hours of}} July21. Several hours later, another tropical storm watch was issued for coastal areas of the Baja California Peninsula from Agua Blanca to Buenavista, and was later upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning as Dora neared the coast. However, the warning was lifted after the hurricane weakened and moved away from land. In Guerrero, the threat of flooding prompted the state government to prepare 900shelters, while boaters were ordered to exercise caution due to rough seas generated by the nearby tropical cyclone.|$|E
25|$|The enigmatic Tom Bombadil {{appeared}} to be unaffected by the Ring and to have some power over it; when he wore the Ring, it did not make him invisible, and Frodo could not become invisible to him by wearing the Ring. Also, Tom played with the Ring like a conjurer borrowing someone's <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> trick, seemingly making it disappear and reappear.|$|E

25|$|The High Lamas used {{several ways}} in which they can {{increase}} the chances of finding a person they claim to be the reincarnation. High Lamas often visit Lhamo La-tso, a lake in central Tibet, and <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sign from the lake itself. This may be either a claimed 'vision' or some 'indication' of the direction in which to search, and this was how Tenzin Gyatso was determined to be the next Dalai Lama.|$|E
25|$|Some party cadres were {{temporarily}} outside Indonesia at {{the time}} of the 30 September events. Notably a sizeable delegation had traveled to the People's Republic of China to participate in the anniversary celebrations of the Chinese Revolution. Others had left Indonesia to pursue studies in Eastern Europe. In exile a party apparatus continued to function. It was, however, largely isolated from political developments inside Indonesia. In Java, some villages that were known to be refuges for members or suspected sympathizers were identified by authorities and were kept under careful <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> considerable time.|$|E
500|$|Captain Cooper of Anderson {{first called}} the USCG in Sault Ste. Marie at 7:39p.m. on channel16, the radio {{distress}} frequency. The USCG responders instructed {{him to call}} back on channel12 {{because they wanted to}} keep their emergency channel open and they were having difficulty with their communication systems, including antennas blown down by the storm. Cooper then contacted the upbound saltwater vessel Nanfri and was told that she could not pick up Fitzgerald on her radar. Despite repeated attempts to raise the USCG, Cooper was not successful until 7:54p.m. when the officer on duty asked him to keep <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> [...] boat lost in the area. At about 8:25p.m., Cooper again called the USCG to express his concern about Fitzgerald and at 9:03p.m. reported her missing. Petty Officer Philip Branch later testified, [...] "I considered it serious, but {{at the time it was}} not urgent." ...|$|E

This group, under orders from the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, held {{the section of the}} Beersheba defence stretching north from the Wadi es Saba towards the Beersheba-to-Tel el Fara road. The 53rd (Welsh) Division (with a brigade of the 10th (Irish) Division attached) was deployed on a [...] line stretching west to about [...] from the Karm railway station. They would <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> counterattack from Hareira to the north, and capture the Beersheba garrison if it attempted to retreat along the road to Gaza. The remainder of the 10th (Irish) Division in XX Corps reserve was deployed east of the Wadi Ghuzzee at Shellal, where the Yeomanry Mounted Division (under Allenby) was to deploy a line of outposts connecting the XX and XXI Corps (holding the Gaza end of the line near el Mendur).|$|E
500|$|When {{the system}} was first {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone on June14, the government of Mexico issued hurricane watch and a tropical storm <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> portion of the Mexican Coast from Barra de Tonala to [...] Later that day, the watch was upgraded into a hurricane warning. Meanwhile, authorities issued an orange alert for most of Oaxaca, the second highest alert, and a yellow alert, the third highest alert, for northern Oaxaca, Chiapas and Guerrero. A green alert was issued {{for the state of}} Puebla, and blue alert, the second lowest alert, for southern Veracruz, Tabasco, Tlaxcala, Morelos and Michoacán. In Oaxaca, officials arranged evacuations for residents in low-lying areas to go to schools, halls, and churches. In the fishing port of Puerto Angel, boating access was restricted. and the port of Salina Cruz was closed. To avoid family separations, schools were closed for several states. The government electricity agency channeled 608 electrical workers due to the threat of damage in the states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. A total of 23 plants were moved to provide emergency power supply.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 August, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> [...] stretch {{of land in}} Florida, between Apalachicola and Fort Walton Beach. The next day, as these hurricane watches were upgraded to a hurricane warning, thousands of people boarded up their homes and evacuated inland. During the afternoon of 16 August, the weather bureau ordered that a hurricane watch should be placed in force for the coastline from Biloxi to St Marks, Florida. Later that day, the hurricane watches were upgraded to a hurricane warning for the northwestern Florida coast, from Fort Walton to St Marks.|$|E

2500|$|After a night raid on 11 July, the {{division}} was relieved by the 25th Division and began training intensively for trench-to-trench attacks, on ground marked to represent German {{positions on the}} objective. A large model was built and a large-scale map produced for officers and men to study and reconnaissance was conducted by officers and staffs to see the ground up to the objective. The divisional artillery was reinforced with the 25th Divisional artillery, three army field brigades, a counter-battery double-group, (one with , [...] and [...] howitzers, the other with [...] and [...] guns) a double bombardment group (one group with [...] and [...] howitzers, the other with , [...] and [...] howitzers).

2500|$|South of Verdun, the Third Army {{was renamed}} Army of Lorraine and was to <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> German {{offensive}} from Metz, which left {{the remainder of}} the Third Army free to concentrate on the offensive into Belgium. The French armies invaded Belgium with nine infantry corps but ten German corps and six reserve brigades of the 4th and 5th armies lay between Metz and the north of Luxembourg. The German 4th Army under Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg and 5th Army of Crown Prince Wilhelm had moved slower than the 1st, 2nd and 3rd armies and the French offensive towards them was reported on 21 August. The French armies had few maps and were unaware {{of the size of the}} German force opposite, as the Third Army brushed aside small German detachments. On 22 August in the Third army area, the V Corps attacked dug-in German troops at Longwy at [...] in thick fog and heavy rain, with no artillery support.|$|E
