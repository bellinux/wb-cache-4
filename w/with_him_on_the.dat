5|$|Lapierre {{was born}} in Saint-Léonard, Quebec {{and grew up in}} Repentigny, Quebec. Beginning to play hockey at age nine, Lapierre's midget team was based out of Cap-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec. One of his teammates, Jean-François Jacques, went on to play <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hamilton Bulldogs, as well.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's {{frequent}} co-star, Pat O'Brien, appeared <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> British chat show Parkinson in {{the early}} 1980s and they both made a surprise appearance at the Queen Mother's command birthday performance at the London Palladium in 1980. His appearance on stage prompted the Queen Mother to rise to her feet, the only time she did so during the whole show, and she later broke protocol to go backstage to speak with Cagney directly.|$|E
5|$|Canavan is from Glencull, near Ballygawley, County Tyrone and was {{the tenth}} of eleven children. His older brother, Pascal, played <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Tyrone panel {{for most of the}} 1990s. He is married to Finola (sister of former Tyrone team-mate Ronan McGarrity), and has four children, Aine, Claire, Darragh and Ruairi, and has been a Physical Education teacher in Holy Trinity College, Cookstown, {{throughout}} most of his career (Gaelic games are amateur sports). While there, he taught Eoin Mulligan his point-taking technique, and the pair have been known in the media as 'master and student' ever since, particularly by television commentators.|$|E

5|$|Coffin died on September 16, 1877 {{at around}} 2:30p.m. {{at his home}} in Avondale, Ohio. His funeral was held at the Friends Meeting House of Cincinnati. The Cincinnati Daily Gazette {{reported}} that the crowd was too large to be accommodated indoors; hundreds had to remain outside. Four of Coffin's eight pallbearers were free blacks who had worked <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Underground Railroad. Coffin was interred in Cincinnati's Spring Grove Cemetery in an unmarked grave. Coffin's wife, Catharine, who died four years later on May 22, 1881, is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery as well.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{failure to}} secure {{independence}} concurrently {{with the end}} of the Federation caused his Cabinet's support for him to waver during late 1963 and early 1964. The RF caucus in January 1964 revealed widespread dissatisfaction <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds that the British seemed to be outwitting him. The Prime Minister was put under immense pressure to win the colony's independence. Field travelled to England later that month to press Douglas-Home and Sandys for independence, and raised the possibility of UDI on a few occasions, but returned empty-handed on 2 February.|$|E
5|$|Grampa steals Marge's car {{and takes}} Bart <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road to Branson {{to win back}} Zelda. When realizing that Grandpa and Bart are heading to Branson, Homer, Marge, Lisa, and Maggie take a bus there. At the theater, Grampa calls out to his lady from on-stage, but then denounces {{her in front of}} everyone, who then call her (in a chant) a hoochie, sending her fleeing off the stage in tears. Grampa then reconciles with Homer.|$|E
50|$|Tildesley's brother Christopher, {{who had had}} an {{argument}} <b>with</b> <b>him</b> earlier <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day of his disappearance, was initially the prime suspect. However, {{it soon became clear}} that this could not be the case.|$|R

5|$|In autumn 1943, Hergé {{had decided}} that he wanted Jacobs to {{collaborate}} <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Adventures of Tintin. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. Jacobs and Hergé became close collaborators and greatly influenced each other, while together they developed the plot for the next Adventure of Tintin, The Seven Crystal Balls, which began serialisation in Le Soir in December 1943.|$|E
5|$|Just as Herzog had {{predicted}} {{when he told}} Smith the Cardinals would win the pennant <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team, Smith found himself as the team's starting shortstop in the best-of-seven 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. During the contest Smith scored three runs, had five hits, and did not commit an error in the field. When St. Louis was trailing 3–1 with one out in the sixth inning of Game 7, Smith started a rally with a base hit to left field, eventually scoring {{the first of the}} team's three runs that inning. The Cardinals scored two more runs in the 8th inning for a 6-3 win and the championship.|$|E
5|$|Regehr {{was born}} in Brazil, and spent his early {{childhood}} in Indonesia before his parents settled back in Canada. At 19, he was the youngest nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy in NHL history after he made his NHL debut less than four months after suffering two broken legs in a serious automobile accident. He {{is best known for}} his strong defence and physical ability. His younger brother Richie briefly played <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Flames. Regher announced his retirement from the NHL on April 11, 2015. In early 2016 Regehr announced that he would return to the Calgary Flames and retire in their colours.|$|E

5|$|Three weeks later, Rymkus and Baugh, who {{had worked}} <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Oilers' staff, were named {{assistant}} coaches for the Detroit Lions. When Harry Gilmer was fired as Lions' head coach after the 1966 NFL season, however, Rymkus was once again out of work. He {{got a job as}} an assistant for the Akron Vulcans of the Continental Football League and was appointed the team's head coach and general manager in 1967. Rymkus stayed in the position until the team folded later that year due to financial difficulties; the team's owner, Frank Hurn, ran out of money and stopped paying the Vulcans' bills.|$|E
5|$|Weiner {{conceived}} {{of the script}} in 2000 {{while working as a}} writer for the television sitcom Becker. Before writing the pilot episode, he studied American literature and cinema of the 1950s and 1960s to get a perspective on American culture during that period. Weiner sent the script to The Sopranos creator David Chase, who recruited Weiner to work <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Sopranos. Weiner shelved the project for seven years to focus on Chase's program; interest for Mad Men did not surface until the conclusion of The Sopranos final season.|$|E
5|$|Actress Jennifer Ehle {{was chosen}} out {{of half a}} dozen serious {{candidates}} to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest girl, and her father's favourite. At the time in her mid-20s, Ehle had first read Pride and Prejudice at the age of 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule. Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted Colin Firth, a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the time, to play the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy. Birtwistle had worked <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mid-1980s comedy film Dutch Girls, but he repeatedly turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen's feminine perspective nor believed himself to be right for the role. Birtwistle's persistent coaxing and his deeper looks into the Darcy character finally convinced him to accept the role. Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which only received media attention after the couple's separation.|$|E
50|$|Boxleitner's first {{marriage}} (1977-1987) was to American actress Kathryn Holcomb, who co-starred <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> How <b>The</b> West Was Won. They had two sons together: Sam (born 1980) and Lee (born 1985). Holcomb {{went on to}} marry English actor Ian Ogilvy. Ogilvy also guest-starred on Boxleitner's series Babylon 5.|$|R

50|$|On 15 October 1940, Colonel Jenő Nagy {{asked for}} a meeting <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> phone. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> meeting Colonel Nagy asked Tartsay to help the anti-German {{underground}} movement in Budapest. Tartsay agreed {{to help with the}} conditions, that his help wouldn't be against of his duty as an officer of the Hungarian Army, and his involvement wouldn't constitute a threat to the governmental and social system of Hungary. As Nagy agreed with his conditions, Tartsay joined the underground movement.|$|R
5|$|All {{four major}} {{networks}} {{turned down the}} new Star Trek series, as they were not willing to commit to a twenty-six-hour first season with a guaranteed unchanging time slot {{as well as a}} promotional campaign for the show. The team proceeded with the project with the backing of Paramount. Roddenberry began putting together a production crew which included colleagues who had worked <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> original series, including Robert H. Justman, David Gerrold, and Eddie Milkis. Justman proposed three ideas to the others on October 17, including families on board the ship, a concept which later became the holodeck and both an android and a Klingon character. One idea discussed by the production team was for Deanna Troi to have three breasts to which writer D. C. Fontana objected.|$|E
5|$|Although Deal was the bassist of the Pixies, {{she wanted}} to play guitar for the Breeders, because she felt it was an easier {{instrument}} to handle when singing at the same time. Deal recruited Josephine Wiggs of Perfect Disaster to be the Breeders' bassist; the two knew each other from when Perfect Disaster had toured with the Pixies in Europe in 1989. Deal wanted Steve Albini to record the album; she had previously worked <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pixies' Surfer Rosa. She hoped to have Kelley Deal be the Breeders' drummer, but the latter {{was not able to}} take time away from her program analyst job. Albini suggested they try Britt Walford of the band Slint instead. Before recording began, Deal, Wiggs, and Walford rehearsed at Wiggs' house in Bedfordshire, England for a week, and then joined Donelly in London to practice more. Albini was involved in the pre-production of the songs, which Donelly found beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Calvin's {{theology}} caused controversy. Pierre Caroli, a Protestant {{minister in}} Lausanne accused Calvin {{as well as}} Viret and Farel of Arianism in 1536. Calvin defended his beliefs on the Trinity in Confessio de Trinitate propter calumnias P. Caroli. In 1551 Jérôme-Hermès Bolsec, a physician in Geneva, attacked Calvin's doctrine of predestination and accused him of making God the author of sin. Bolsec was banished from the city, and after Calvin's death, he wrote a biography which severely maligned Calvin's character. In the following year, Joachim Westphal, a Gnesio-Lutheran pastor in Hamburg, condemned Calvin and Zwingli as heretics in denying the eucharistic doctrine of the union of Christ's body with the elements. Calvin's Defensio sanae et orthodoxae doctrinae de sacramentis (A Defence of the Sober and Orthodox Doctrine of the Sacrament) was his response in 1555. In 1556 , a Dutch dissident, held a public disputation with Calvin {{during his visit to}} Frankfurt, in which Velsius defended free will against Calvin's doctrine of predestination. Following the execution of Servetus, a close associate of Calvin, Sebastian Castellio, broke <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue of the treatment of heretics. In Castellio's Treatise on Heretics (1554), he argued for a focus on Christ's moral teachings in place of the vanity of theology, and he afterward developed a theory of tolerance based on biblical principles.|$|E

5|$|Darabont looked {{initially}} {{at some of}} {{his favorite}} actors like Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall {{for the role of}} Andy Dufresne, but they were unavailable; Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman were also considered. Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Kevin Costner were offered, and passed on the role —Hanks due to his starring role in Forrest Gump, and Costner because he had the lead in Waterworld. Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage, and Charlie Sheen were also considered for the role at different stages. Cruise attended table readings of the script, but refused to work for the inexperienced Darabont. Darabont said he cast Robbins after seeing his performance in the 1990 psychological horror Jacob's Ladder. When Robbins was cast he insisted that Darabont use experienced cinematographer Roger Deakins, who had worked <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for the role, Robbins observed caged animals at a zoo, spent an afternoon in solitary confinement, spoke with prisoners and guards, and had his arms and legs shackled for a few hours.|$|E
5|$|Hammond was {{selected}} for the M.C.C. tour of Australia in 1932–33. Known as the Bodyline series, it became notorious for the controversial English tactic of bowling short on the line of leg stump, making the ball rise towards the batsman's body to create deflections that could be caught by leg-side fielders. Hammond, {{one of the first}} players selected, was part of the selection committee on tour, and the M.C.C. captain, Douglas Jardine, may have discussed tactics <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outward journey. Hammond disapproved of Bodyline bowling, believing it to be dangerous, although he understood some of the reasons for its use. He kept his feelings hidden during the tour, preferring to go along with his captain {{and the rest of the}} team. It was not until 1946 that he openly voiced his opinion.|$|E
5|$|He {{makes it}} to her in time and administers the {{antidote}} before the infection can take hold. Bennett then contacts him and Hansen makes him promise that if he gives Bennett the research, Bennett will save Anna. He soon discovers that Kamsky infected himself with a strain of exocel DNA, and now wishes {{to do the same}} to Anna. Hansen finds Kamsky's laptop and transmits the antidote data to Bennett, but nothing else. As a furious Bennett berates Hansen, he and Anna agree to blow up the rig using C4. As Hansen plants the charges, he learns Kamsky had gone completely insane; after infecting himself with exocel serum, he released the imprisoned exos on the rig and planted a group of exocels on the Eastern Spirit. He then went into hiding to await his metamorphosis. When Hansen has planted all of the charges, he heads to the heliport to meet Anna. Before they can take off however, they are attacked by a mutated Kamsky; the same creature who rescued Anna from the sea. Kamsky is desperate for Anna to remain <b>with</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rig, but Hansen is able to fight him off and kill him. He and Anna then escape in a helicopter as the rig explodes below them.|$|E
