5|$|The {{scientific}} discovery of A.bradleyi occurred in 1871, <b>when</b> <b>Frank</b> Howe Bradley collected {{a number of}} specimens near Coal Creek, on Walden's Ridge in East Tennessee.

5|$|Little {{more was}} {{discovered}} about Venus until the 20thcentury. Its almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like, {{and it was}} only with the development of spectroscopic, radar and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed. The first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, <b>when</b> <b>Frank</b> E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.|$|E
5|$|The young {{municipality}} got {{its first}} boost in 1889 <b>when</b> <b>Frank</b> Ross and James McLaren opened {{what would become}} Fraser Mills, a $350,000, then state-of-the-art lumber mill on the north bank of the Fraser River. The District of Coquitlam was incorporated in 1891. By 1908, a mill town of 20 houses, a store, post office, hospital, office block, barber shop, and pool hall had grown around the mill. A mill manager's residence was built that would later become Place des Arts.|$|E
5|$|Idaho {{police officer}} Hal Jackson (William Boyett) {{arrives at the}} funeral for young Frank Dixon, Jr. (Bill Agee), who has {{died in a car}} accident. Hal, a friend of the Dixon family, does not go inside, feeling it would be too {{difficult}} to take. Hal finds it hard to believe that, only a few days ago, the Dixons were a relatively regular family. In flashback, he recounts what led to Frank Jr.'s death. Frank Jr. has returned home for the summer to aid his father, Frank Sr. (Harold Agee), on the family farm. He also visits his girlfriend Betty Hutchins (Christine Lynch). <b>When</b> <b>Frank</b> Sr.'s new tractor arrives at the local train station, Frank Jr.'s brother Alan (Tim Bosworth) wishes to drive it, having recently taken a driver's test. His father disallows it, so Frank Jr. drives it home.|$|E
60|$|Ammon Quatia himself, {{sword in}} hand, had just sprung {{to the door}} of the hut {{prepared}} to sell his life dearly, <b>when</b> <b>Frank's</b> guard fired. The affair was so momentary that he had hardly time to realize what had happened before his assailants were in full flight.|$|R
60|$|He had {{scarcely}} finished speaking <b>when</b> <b>Frank's</b> rifle poured forth its contents. The loud {{echoes of}} the crags reverberated as the smoke floated away to leeward.

50|$|The Steelers {{traveled}} to Miami {{to take on}} the Dolphins. In the first quarter, the Dolphins struck first <b>when</b> Andrew <b>Franks</b> kicked a 30-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead. The Steelers got on the board later on in the quarter taking the lead when Darrius Heyward-Bey ran for a 60-yard touchdown (with a successful 2-point conversion) for an 8-3 game. In the second quarter, it was all Dolphins as they closed out the half by first coming within 2 <b>when</b> <b>Franks</b> kicked a 23-yard field goal to make the score 8-6. The Dolphins eventually took the lead back <b>when</b> <b>Franks</b> kicked another 30-yard field goal for an 9-8 game. They would move ahead by a touchdown when Damien Williams ran for one from a yard out to take a 16-8 lead at halftime. In the third quarter, the Dolphins got back to work when Jay Ajayi ran for a 1-yard touchdown to make the score 23-8 for the only score of the period. The Steelers tried to rally when Ben Roethlisberger found Cobi Hamilton on a 23-yard touchdown pass shortening their deficit to 8, 23-15. Though the Steelers rush defense stalled with less than a minute left in the game and Ajayi ran for a 62-yard touchdown to seal the game with the final score 30-15.|$|R
5|$|In 1963, teenaged Frank Abagnale {{lives in}} New Rochelle, New York {{with his father}} Frank Abagnale, Sr., and French mother Paula. <b>When</b> <b>Frank</b> Sr. is denied a {{business}} loan at Chase Manhattan Bank due to unknown difficulties with the IRS, the family is forced to move from their large home to a small apartment. Paula carries on an affair with Jack, a friend of her husband. Meanwhile, Frank poses as a substitute teacher in his French class. Frank's parents file for divorce, and Frank runs away. When he runs out of money, he begins relying on confidence scams to get by. Soon, Frank's cons increase and he even impersonates an airline pilot. He forges Pan Am payroll checks and succeeds in stealing over $2.8 million.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Frank {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts House of Representatives where he served for eight years. He {{made a name for himself}} in the mid-1970s as a {{political}} defender of the Combat Zone, Boston’s notorious red light district. Neighborhoods in Frank’s district bordered the Combat Zone. As a means of dealing with crime in the area (including violence, police corruption and the infiltration by organized crime), he introduced a bill into the Massachusetts General Court that would have legalized the sex-for-hire business but kept it quarantined in a red light district, which would have been moved to Boston’s Financial District. The bill, which had the support of Boston’s Police Commissioner, never came up for a vote. Later, <b>when</b> <b>Frank</b> was running for Congress, opponents erroneously portrayed him as having attempted to permit red-light districts in all Bay State communities.|$|E
5|$|Lynch's {{original}} {{rough cut}} ran for approximately four hours. He was contractually obligated {{to deliver a}} two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes. He also made cuts {{at the request of}} the MPAA. For example, <b>when</b> <b>Frank</b> slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at what he has just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA's concerns about violence. Lynch thought that the change only made the scene more disturbing. In 2011, Lynch announced that footage from the deleted scenes, long thought lost, had been discovered. The material was subsequently included on the Blu-ray disc release of the film. The final cut of the film runs at just over two hours.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision {{on behalf of}} Franks, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded in part, for further judicial ruling (Section 5, para. 2). The court said that Lane’s speech was protected under the first amendment. However, [...] "previous precedent, specifically Morris v. Crow, had held that public employee testimony was unprotected speech, and thus <b>when</b> <b>Franks</b> fired Lane, he was not violating a clearly established constitutional right" (Para. 4).|$|R
5000|$|While in Prescott, Frank {{worked at}} Miller's Ranch outside of Prescott. On October 18, 1877, newly hired cook Jesus Bega brought Frank tea instead of coffee, and after an {{argument}} Frank shot Bega through the lung, killing him. Frank was later acquitted {{on the grounds}} of self-defense. <b>When</b> <b>Frank's</b> brother Simpson left Arizona for Fort Davis, Texas Frank remained in Arizona. He worked as a teamster for C.

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Frank</b> Sels {{left the}} Studio in 1967, Karel Biddeloo took {{over most of}} the {{realistic}} series of Vandersteen. He made Karl May from 1967 until 1969, when the Bessy-studio took over the job. He also took over Biggles, which ended in 1969, when it was replaced by the jungle series Safari, inspired by Daktari. At the start of the series, Vandersteen did most of the creative work, but after a few albums he left most of the work to Biddeloo. The series ended in 1974. Biddeloo then devoted most of his time to De Rode Ridder, where he started inking the stories by Vandersteen in 1967 and took completely over in 1969, when Vandersteen lost his interest. He continued working on it until his death in 2004.|$|E
5|$|After {{a fairly}} cagey first 21 minutes, {{the first major}} {{incident}} of the game occurred when Paul Scholes and Claude Makélélé clashed in mid-air, resulting in both players being booked and Scholes having to leave the field for treatment to a bloody nose. The first goal of the game came five minutes later, when an interchange of passes between Scholes and Wes Brown after a throw-in on the right flank gave Brown time to pick out a cross for Cristiano Ronaldo, who directed his header past Petr Čech. Chelsea almost equalised in the 33rd minute <b>when</b> <b>Frank</b> Lampard's cross was headed back into the goal area by Didier Drogba. United's Rio Ferdinand, under pressure from Michael Ballack, was forced to head the ball towards his own goal and Edwin van der Sar pulled off a one-handed save to deny Chelsea a goal. United {{spent the rest of}} the first half pressing for a second goal, and had two good opportunities to extend their lead, but were denied by a double-save from Čech. Wayne Rooney delivered a long ball into the path of Ronaldo and the United goalscorer placed his cross on the head of the diving Carlos Tevez, only for Čech to deny him. Chelsea's failure to clear the loose ball gave Michael Carrick the chance to extend his side's lead, but Čech was again equal to the task with another save.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, receiving a bye as a Premier League club. Their opening match was a goalless draw against First Division club Port Vale at home, meaning the game was replayed at Vale Park, eleven days later. In the replay, Arsenal won 4–3 on a penalty shoot-out, having drawn 1–1 in extra time. In the fourth round, Arsenal played Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium. Overmars scored the opening goal inside 68 seconds for the visitors and Parlour added a second to give Arsenal a commanding lead, going into the interval. Although Paul Merson scored {{in the second half}} for Middlesbrough, Arsenal did enough to progress into the fifth round. A 0–0 draw at home against Crystal Palace meant Arsenal needed to play a fifth round replay at Selhurst Park on 25 February 1998. Goals from Anelka and Bergkamp ensured victory for an understrength Arsenal team. Against West Ham United in the quarter-finals, Arsenal conceded the first goal <b>when</b> <b>Frank</b> Lampard's corner kick was converted into the goal net by Stuart Pearce, through a first-time shot. Although Bergkamp scored a penalty to equalise, Arsenal had to settle for a replay, staged at Upton Park, where it ended 4–3 on penalties after another draw. A goal by Wreh against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the semi-finals meant Arsenal reached their 13th FA Cup final.|$|E
5000|$|Frank Lyman Austin {{was born}} in Burlington in 1874 to Zachary T. Austin, a local contractor. [...] The Austin firm went back to around 1865, <b>when</b> <b>Frank's</b> grandfather, Lyman, {{established}} himself as a carpenter. Frank Austin worked in his father's office, and trained as an architect. In 1904, he left his father's firm and opened an office on his own account. Upon his father's death in 1910, Austin completed the leftover work and absorbed the firm's assets.|$|R
60|$|He {{found her}} {{waiting for him}} in the room where the breakfast was laid. She was walking restlessly to and fro, with her head {{drooping}} on her bosom and her hair hanging disordered over her shoulders. The moment she looked up on his entrance, the captain felt the fear which Mrs. Wragge had felt before him--the fear that her mind would be struck prostrate again, as it had been struck once already, <b>when</b> <b>Frank's</b> letter reached her in Vauxhall Walk.|$|R

5|$|Frank Arthur Worsley {{was born}} on 22 February 1872 in Akaroa, New Zealand, one of three {{children}} of a farmer, Henry Worsley, and his wife Georgiana. His grandfather, Henry Francis Worsley (1806–1876), had migrated from Rugby in England aboard the Cornwall to Lyttelton, where he arrived with his large family in December 1851. The family lived in Grehan Valley, high up above Akaroa. Worsley's mother died {{while he was a}} toddler. He was sent to school in Akaroa but when his father moved his family to take up work clearing bush from land at Peraki, he was homeschooled for a time. From age 10, he helped with clearing land for sheep pasture and growing cocksfoot. <b>When</b> <b>Frank</b> was 11, his older brother, Harry, left to join the New Zealand Shipping Company as an apprentice and at about the same time, his father moved his family, which was now just Frank and his 13-year-old sister, to Christchurch. Frank attended Fendalton School and marked his final year of schooling by being made head boy.|$|E
5|$|Healey {{played at}} centre forward for The North in an amateur trial match in February 1910; his side lost 3–2, {{and he was}} not {{selected}} for the upcoming fixtures. His first international selection {{came in the form of}} a last-minute call-up <b>when</b> <b>Frank</b> Monk and Vivian Woodward dropped out of the England Amateur XI's visit to mainland Europe in March 1911. Healey made his debut against the French national team at the Stade de Paris, opening the scoring as his team won 3–0, and scored again a couple of days later against Switzerland in a 4–1 win. His next involvement at international level was nearly a year later, against the Wales Amateur XI at the ground of his former club, Bishop Auckland, in February 1912. He was involved in the buildup to the second goal, scored by Sydney Sanders, and scored the third himself as England won 3–0. He was selected as a reserve for matches at home to the Netherlands and away to Belgium in March and April, but did not make his next, and what turned out to be final, appearance until November against Belgium, in which he scored the second of England's four goals. He had to withdraw from the selection to face Wales in February 1913, and was an unused reserve for the visits to Germany and Belgium in March and to Wales the following February.|$|E
5|$|His father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach {{farmer in}} his home town of Gaffney who {{died at the age}} of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm <b>when</b> <b>Frank</b> was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father {{attended}} a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, of which the bank manager was a member. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public, but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life. He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however, Underwood was influenced by him. Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery. Underwood has said that when he was 13, he walked in on his father putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to pull the trigger, which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance.|$|E

Now friends, Tarconi takes care of his house in Cap Roux <b>when</b> <b>Frank's</b> on a mission. Frank turns to him when he needs an official police intervention, but always in a way that Tarconi can deny any involvement with the Transporter. He maintains his status as an officer of the law but allows Frank to bend the rules somewhat.|$|R
5|$|Shortly thereafter, Frank is shot by Lucas Goodwin, in an {{assassination}} attempt, and {{falls into a}} coma. While Frank is in surgery, Claire helps guide Frank's vice president Donald Blythe through a diplomatic crisis with Russia. While Frank is receiving a liver transplant, she declines {{going to the hospital}} in favor of negotiating a treaty with Petrov, and strong-arms him into accepting the U.S.' terms. <b>When</b> <b>Frank</b> recovers from surgery, he agrees to let Claire be his vice president. He and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill {{for the sole purpose of}} creating an atmosphere divisive enough to pick off the potential running mates. In the ensuing open convention, they publicly endorse Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) for the job, while working behind the scenes to undermine her and ensure that Claire wins enough delegates to be nominated. Meanwhile, she reluctantly honors her mother's request to help her die. She and Frank then use the public sympathy from Elizabeth's death to win the nomination; they are now running mates.|$|E
5|$|The scene then flashes {{forward to}} a plane {{returning}} Frank home from prison, where Carl informs him that his father has died. Grief-stricken, Frank escapes from the plane {{and goes back to}} his old house, where he finds his mother with the man she left his father for, as well as a girl who Frank realizes is his half-sister. Frank gives himself up and is sentenced to 12 years in prison, getting visits from time to time from Carl. <b>When</b> <b>Frank</b> points out how one of the checks Carl is carrying as evidence is fake, Carl convinces the FBI to offer Frank a deal by which he can live out the remainder of his sentence working for the bank fraud department of the FBI, which Frank accepts. While working at the FBI, Frank misses the thrill of the chase and even attempts to fly as an airline pilot again. He is cornered by Carl, who insists that Frank will return to the FBI job since no one is chasing him. On the following Monday, Carl is nervous that Frank has not yet arrived at work. However, Frank eventually arrives and they discuss their next case.|$|E
5|$|The Burnets {{moved to}} Terang in 1909, <b>when</b> <b>Frank</b> was posted {{to be the}} bank manager there, having {{declined}} a post in London. Burnet {{was interested in the}} wildlife around the nearby lake; he joined the Scouts in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activities. While living in Terang, he began to collect beetles and study biology. He read biology articles in the Chambers's Encyclopaedia, which introduced him to the work of Charles Darwin. During his early teens, the family took annual holidays to Port Fairy, where Burnet spent his time observing and recording the behaviour of the wildlife. He was educated at Terang State School and attended Sunday school at the local church, where the priest encouraged him to pursue scholastic studies and awarded him a book on ants as a reward for his academic performance. He advised Frank to invest in Mac's education and he won a full scholarship to board and study at Geelong College, one of Victoria's most exclusive private schools. Starting there in 1913, Burnet was the only boarder with a full scholarship. He did not enjoy his time there among the scions of the ruling upper class; while most of his peers were brash and sports-oriented, Burnet was bookish and not athletically inclined, and found his fellow students to be arrogant and boorish. During this period he kept his beetle-collecting and disapproval of his peers a secret and mixed with his schoolmates out of necessity. Nevertheless, his academic prowess gained him privileges, and he graduated in 1916, placing first in his school overall, and in history, English, chemistry and physics. The typical university path for a person of his social background was to pursue studies in theology, law or medicine. By this time, he was becoming disillusioned with religion and chose medicine. Due to World War I, military service was a possibility and he felt that a medical background would increase his chances of being given a non-combat post.|$|E
50|$|Democratic Party leaders {{originally}} backed Connelly in her 2000 Congressional bid, until in September 1999, <b>when</b> <b>Franks</b> {{announced his}} candidacy for New Jersey's vacant U.S. Senate seat. Franks became a Senate candidate after Gov. Christine Todd Whitman announced {{she would not}} seek the Senate seat. Democratic Party leaders, no longer considering Franks' seat to be unwinnable, decided to support Union County Manager Michael Lapolla for Congress instead of Connelly. Following this decision, Connelly did not bow out of the Congressional race as party leaders suggested. She continued her campaign and defeated Lapolla in the primary.|$|R
