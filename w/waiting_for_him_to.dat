5|$|Over {{the next}} few days PATU and RLI patrols arrested five insurgents, two of whom were deserters. One of these {{defected}} and agreed to guide the security forces to the ZIPRA base camp, where he said there were two guerrillas <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return, unaware of his desertion and subsequent defection. Shown the way by the ex-cadre an RLI patrol attacked the camp on 24 January and killed one of the two; the other fled and was captured a few days later. The members of Gang 1 were now all killed or captured while only one was outstanding from Gang 2. Gangs 3 and 4 were revealed to be near Sipolilo on 21 January by a black shopkeeper, and two Gang 3 members were encountered by Henson's troop on 24 January. Henson himself opened fire and killed one, who it emerged was the Gang 3 commander. His troop then followed about 10 men until 26 January, when they lost the insurgents' tracks.|$|E
5|$|Batman, Robin and Batgirl {{decide to}} go after Freeze together. By {{the time they get}} to the {{observatory}} where Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen. Batgirl and Robin are attacked by Bane. They eventually defeat him by kicking apart his venom tubes, stopping the flow of venom to his body. Bane collapses before transforming back to his original diminutive size of Antonio Diego and is left helpless on the ground. Meanwhile Batman and Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman defeating Freeze. Batgirl and Robin manage to unfreeze Gotham; and Batman shows Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl. Freeze learns that Ivy has betrayed him over the death of wife. Ivy blamed Batman for Nora's death, but she informs Batgirl that it was her idea. Freeze is angered by the betrayal and is informed by Batman that his wife is not dead; she is restored in cryogenic slumber and has been moved to Arkham <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> finish his research. Batman proceeds to ask Freeze for the cure Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome to administer to Alfred. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him medicine he had developed. Ivy is detained in Arkham alongside Freeze, who promises to torment Ivy during their sentence. After Alfred is cured, everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at Wayne Manor.|$|E
25|$|When Trent Reznor was {{originally}} asked by director David Fincher to score The Social Network, he initially declined, {{partly due to}} just finishing up a long touring and recording schedule.

25|$|Iban Mayo, {{struggling}} the {{day before}} already, had trouble getting up the climbs from the first few meters yet again. He was also extremely annoyed by the cameraman following him and filming his struggle, as that camerman knew Mayo was probably {{going to give up}} and was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do so. In the end Mayo was fined for 200 Swiss Francs for incorrect behaviour in front of the camera. He abandoned when the cameraman stopped following him.|$|E
25|$|Ralph's Wife's Lane is {{the main}} road {{connecting}} Banks with Crossens to the south. Its name has two origins: one that Ralph was a fisherman lost at sea or Ralph was a smuggler, again lost at sea. His wife's ghost {{is supposed to be}} looking for him. It has been reported that people have seen the ghost on dark winter nights walking from by St Stephens Church to Fiddler's Ferry holding a lamp waiting for her loved one to return home. The story states that she lit a lamp in her window every night and sat by it so he knew that she was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return home. The site of the house is occupied by two bungalows.|$|E

When released, Steven goes off his medication. He tries to apologise to Jane and Ian, but finds them hostile. Hoping he will leave Walford, Ian humiliates and rejects Steven several times, going {{as far as to}} break a snow globe he had given to Steven when he was young right in front of him. Once again depressed, Steven tries {{to commit suicide}} by dousing himself in petrol; however, Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) stops him from setting fire to himself. When Ian discovers what Steven has been planning to do, he reconciles with him. Displeased, Jane fights against Steven being part of her family, but eventually relents and in January 2008, she agrees to let Steven move into the Beales' home; however, she makes it clear that she is <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> mess up so he will be gone from her life for good.|$|E

500|$|Hearst's {{attacks against}} Welles went beyond {{attempting}} {{to suppress the}} film. Welles said {{that while he was}} on his post-filming lecture tour a police detective approached him at a restaurant and advised him not {{to go back to his}} hotel. A 14-year-old girl had reportedly been hidden in the closet of his room, and two photographers were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> walk in. Knowing he would be jailed after the resulting publicity, Welles did not return to the hotel but waited until the train left town the following morning. [...] "But that wasn't Hearst," [...] Welles said, [...] "that was a hatchet man from the local Hearst paper who thought he would advance himself by doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Anubhavam Pudhumai" [...] is {{loosely based}} on a 1940 Spanish song titled [...] "Bésame Mucho". Philips, an {{autodidact}} guitarist, played the guitar for [...] "Anubhavam Pudhumai" [...] and [...] "Malarendra Mugamondru". The original soundtrack edition omits the songs [...] "Maadimele" [...] and [...] "Kadhalikka Neramillai", which are included on the track list of Raaga.com; the website omits the song [...] "Viswanathan Velai Vendum" [...] which was included on the original soundtrack edition. Viswanathan {{and his wife were}} spending a vacation in Yercaud for a week, when Kannadasan, Gopu and Sridhar were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> begin composing the songs. The day when Viswanathan returned and arrived at Chithralaya office, Kannadasan said, [...] "Ennappa..Viswanathaa...Velai kodu.." [...] (...)

500|$|Klepacki's {{next project}} {{was a game}} {{collaboration}} by SEGA and Petroglyph named [...] As of December 2006, he had composed several songs for various factions and enjoyed the [...] "opportunity to create something new again, not based on...existing intellectual property. Klepacki [...] "began by taking into account what songs were identified as fan favorites in...past related work". He was interviewed about the creative process on March 27, 2007 by Kevin Yu, a Petroglyph community manager, and provided a detailed tour of his studio at the company. His office included {{one of the fastest}} computers at Petroglyph and a vocal booth where unit responses and other vocalizations were tested and tweaked before voice actors performed finishing work. Klepacki was glad that Universe of War did not demand strict obedience to a particular style. He declared that surprises were in store for Command & Conquer fans <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return to his [...] "roots" [...] and [...] "adrenaline-pumping soundtrack style", and suggested that they [...] "imagine my mindset...when Command & Conquer first came out, and add about fifteen years experience to that."

500|$|Mallow accompanies Mario as {{they travel}} through the Kero Sewers to Tadpole Pond, in which they must defeat Belome, a dog-like creature, along the way. There they meet Mallow's grandfather, who reveals that Mallow isn't really a tadpole and claims that his real parents are <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return home. The duo travel to Rose Town where they meet a star spirit who has taken control of a doll named Geno. After battling the bow-like creature, Bowyer, who is immobilizing {{residents}} of Rose Town with his arrows, they retrieve another Star Piece and Geno joins Mario and tells him that the Star Piece {{is a part of}} the shattered Star Road, where he resides. A surviving Aero, who is one of Bowyer's minions, runs off to warn Smitty. Geno has been tasked with repairing Star Road and defeating Smithy, so that the world's wishes may again be heard, and he must find the seven pieces held by members of the Smithy gang. The three head to the Mole Mountains where they fight Croco again, rescue two trapped mole children, and retrieve the third Star Piece from Punchinello before heading to Booster Tower (the home of the eccentric amusement-venue owner, Booster) where they encounter Bowser, whose minions have all bailed out on him.|$|E
500|$|Earlier, Håkan {{stops and}} kills a passerby {{on a busy}} {{footpath}} near a main road to harvest fresh blood for Eli, but he fails to return with any when he is interrupted by an approaching dog walker. Eli is prompted to waylay and kill a local man, Jocke, making {{his way home from}} a bar after having said goodnight to his best friend, Lacke. A local cat-loving recluse, Gösta, witnesses the attack from his flat. He does not believe what he has seen and decides not to report the incident. Håkan hides Jocke's body in an ice-hole in the local lake. Håkan later makes another well-prepared but incompetently executed effort to obtain blood for Eli by trapping a teenage boy in a changing room after school. The boy's friends are <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> emerge, and go to see what is holding him up. Before he is discovered, Håkan pours concentrated hydrochloric acid onto his own face, disfiguring it to prevent the authorities from identifying him and tracing Eli. Eli learns that Håkan has been taken to the hospital and scales the building to access his restricted room. Håkan opens the window for Eli and offers his neck to her for feeding; after she has fed, Håkan falls out of the window onto the snow and dies. Now alone, Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which time they agree to [...] "go steady". While Eli states, [...] "I'm not a girl", Oskar (ambiguously) either ignores this or accepts the unclear nature of the relationship.|$|E
500|$|After her rescue, {{the princess}} {{initially}} returns to Mushroom Kingdom but later joins the party as its final member while her grandmother takes {{her place in}} the castle disguised as Toadstool. They locate the fourth Star Piece on Star Hill and learn that Mallow's real parents are still <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return. The five travel to Seaside Town, where the residents inform them that a Star Piece has fallen in the sunken ship in the lake that is owned by the Jonathan Johnny Jones, a shark pirate. After defeating a giant blooper named King Calamari (who was responsible for sinking the ship) and challenging Jones and his crew to a fight, they win the fifth Star Piece. Returning to Seaside Town, they discover that the townsfolk are actually Yaridovich (another member of the Smithy Gang) in disguise. He threatens the real townsfolk in order to force Mario to hand over the Star Piece. He tries to escape with it but is unable to when his ride doesn't arrive. Jones prevents Yaridovich's escape and Mario and friends defeat him and recover the Star Piece (as well as freeing the real townsfolk). After recovering six of the Star Pieces, Mario's group learns that the final piece is held by Smithy in Bowser's castle. Upon battling their way through the assembled enemies and fighting Exor, they discover that he is actually a gateway to Smithy's factory, where Smithy mass-produces his army. After defeating Exor, he inhales them, sending them to the factory.|$|E

2500|$|Travolta's {{entire career}} becomes [...] "backstory", {{the myth of}} a movie star who has fallen out of favor, but still resides in our memory as the king of disco. We keep <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> shed his paunch, put on a white {{polyester}} suit, and enter the 2001 Odyssey club in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he will dance for us and never, never stop. Daniel Day-Lewis couldn't have woken such a powerful longing in us. He isn't part of America's own mad cosmology... Tony Manero [...] an angel sitting on Vince's shoulder... actual dance may {{be closer to the}} choreography of Anna Karina's shuffle with her two bumbling gangster boyfriends in Bande à part, but even that reference is lost to us, and we're with Tony again...|$|E
2500|$|Outside the xxxHolic and Tsubasa manga, Watanuki has {{appeared}} in the film [...] where he visits a collector's mansion and he investigates the mystery behind multiple disappearances. In the original video animation (OVA) xxxHolic Rō, Watanuki, as the new shop's owner, receives a tape with Yūko's voice. In the second OVA, Watanuki is requested by the spirit of Dōmeki's grandfather, Haruka, to investigate his grandson's dreams. Watanuki appears as the protagonist of the manga xxxHolic Rei where he is featured as Yūko's assistant. While seeing several of Yūko's cases, Watanuki realizes that his boss is <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> make an important decision. Eventually, he learns that he is living in an alternate dimension where Yuko is not dead. After saying goodbye to his boss, Watanuki returns to reality to give Syaoran a group of items. In Tsubasa World Chronicle he meets Syaoran and gives him the items. Shota Sometani plays Watanuki in the live action TV series. The video game xxxHolic ~Watanuki no Izayoi Sowa~ also features Watanuki. He is also a prominent character in the novelization Another Holic by Nisio Isin.|$|E

2500|$|Rambo started {{performing}} cataract operations after successfully removing two cataracts from a patient's eye. He {{was initially}} hesitant to perform more surgeries, having had limited experience in ophthalmology, but began to treat more patients after {{a large number}} of blind individuals approached him for operations. Under Rambo's leadership, the hospital became well known for its work in restoring sight through the use of [...] "eye camps," [...] surgical teams from the hospital that traveled to villages and performed eye surgeries, often cataract removal surgeries. Rambo thought of the idea of an [...] "eye camp" [...] after speaking with a patient who suggested that he come to the villages to perform operations, because he knew many individuals who had lost their vision and could not make the journey out to the distant mission hospital. He was originally hesitant to pursue the idea, knowing the potential risks of operating in a non-sterilized environment. After consulting with Hira Lal, who suggested Rambo test the concept, he decided to go to a village about nineteen miles from Mungeli. When he arrived at the village, there were about fifty people <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> begin operating. He operated on their eyes using a teacher’s desk as a table and was able to remove nineteen cataracts that day successfully.|$|E
2500|$|His square stance {{made the}} cover drive {{difficult}} and Barrington eliminated {{it from his}} scoring strokes, even so bowlers attacked the off-stump, as Richie Benaud explained [...] "It wasn't that he was weak there, but merely he was less strong". Barrington never lost his ability as a spinner, and it made him very effective against spin bowling, especially that of Benaud. His Surrey teammate Jim Laker wrote [...] "His concentration was such that when facing slow bowlers, he would actually watch the ball spinning {{in the air and}} play it accordingly". His one weakness that he was not a good runner, he seldom wanted to relinquish the strike and thought quick singles tired a batsman out. Sometimes a keen batting partner would rush up the wicket only to find Barrington <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> scramble back. John Edrich called him [...] "the worst in the world", and his West Country accent meant that [...] "won" [...] (one or run) and [...] "wait" [...] sounded alike. His greatest strength was that he was a good tourist, averaging 69.18 in Tests abroad, though his home average of 50.71 was hardly negligible. He also made 14 of his 20 Test hundreds in foreign fields, which led to his being appreciated by overseas more than he was at home, where his good humour when playing to the crowd won him widespread admiration in Australia and hero-worship in India.|$|E
