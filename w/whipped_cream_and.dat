This was to support the film's DVD/VHS release.|$|E
5|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as {{laughing}} gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned <b>whipped</b> <b>cream,</b> <b>and</b> was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot {{be considered to be}} the anhydride of hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.|$|E

In the summer of 2015, they introduced a frozen drink called Creamy Chocolate Chill which was essentially a chocolate milkshake topped with chocolate <b>whipped</b> <b>cream</b> <b>and</b> drizzled with chocolate syrup.

The reissues included all of the pre-1969 albums, 1979's Rise, and also included a new album, Lost Treasures, consisting of unreleased material from Alpert's Tijuana Brass years.

25|$|In modern times, {{a common}} method for {{producing}} ice cream {{at home is}} to use an ice cream maker, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an inbuilt freezing element. A newer method is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for home cooks, is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes. Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in <b>whipped</b> <b>cream,</b> <b>and</b> immediately freezing the mixture. Another method {{is to use a}} pre-frozen solution of salt and water, which gradually melts as the ice cream freezes.|$|E
25|$|In Iceland, the day {{is known}} as Sprengidagur (Bursting Day) and is marked by eating salted meat and peas. In Lithuania, {{the day is}} called Užgavėnės. People eat pancakes (blynai) and Lithuanian-style doughnuts. In Sweden, the day is called Fettisdagen (Fat Tuesday), and is {{generally}} celebrated by eating a type of pastry called fastlagsbulle or semla. In Finland, the day is called laskiainen and is generally celebrated by eating green pea soup and a pastry called laskiaispulla (sweet bread filled with <b>whipped</b> <b>cream</b> <b>and</b> jam or almond paste, same as the Swedish semla). The celebration often includes downhill sledging. In Estonia, the day is called Vastlapäev and is generally celebrated by eating pea soup and whipped-cream or whipped-cream and jam filled sweet-buns called vastlakukkel, similar to the Swedish fastlagsbulle or semla. Children also typically go sledding on this day.|$|E

25|$|A banana split is an ice cream-based dessert. In its classic form it {{is served}} in a long dish called a boat. A banana is cut in half {{lengthwise}} (hence the split) and laid in the dish. There are many variations, but the classic banana split is made with scoops of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream {{served in a}} row between the split banana. Although the banana as an exotic fruit {{was introduced to the}} American public in the 1880s, it was later in 1904, that the banana split was invented in the town of Latrobe, Pennsylvania by 23-year-old pharmacy apprentice David Strickler, who was inspired to create a new sundae after seeing a soda jerk during a visit to Atlantic City. According to The Food Chronology, written in 1995 by James Trager, Strickler concocted his sundae to include three scoops of ice cream on a split banana, topped with chocolate syrup, marshmallow, nuts, <b>whipped</b> <b>cream,</b> <b>and</b> a cherry that sold for a dime. Other soda jerks soon imitated Strickler's banana split, albeit in other forms.|$|E

Willa Paskin of New York magazine praised Perry's {{looks in the}} video as [...] "detailed, outlandish, [...] semi-gorgeous rainbow-kabuki". Kara Warner from MTV News also praised her appearance in the video, calling her an [...] "angelic alien princess". She also felt the video was Perry's [...] "most complex, stylized and out-there video production yet". Joseph Brannigan Lynch of Entertainment Weekly felt that West's rap verses helped the song top the Billboard Hot 100, and called the video an [...] "awesomely bizarre sci-fi video, which impressively resists any obvious Spielberg references". Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone described the video as [...] "a sequel to Avatar or a Katy Perry video game", and felt the song and video were [...] "a bold move away from Perry's usual silliness and sexuality". Los Angeles Times described the video as a [...] "sweeping visual manifestation". In a more negative review, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine criticized Perry, saying she looked like an [...] "animated video-game character", while saying West was a [...] "non-presence". Cinquemani later went on to say: [...] "It's a step up from bras that shoot <b>whipped</b> <b>cream</b> <b>and</b> fireworks, but this is ultimately Sigimondi's vision, and it's far from her finest five minutes." [...] At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, the video for [...] "E.T." [...] won awards for Best Collaboration and Best Special Effects.|$|E

50|$|One {{traditional}} {{recipe for}} cranachan is 3 oz pinhead oatmeal, 1/2 imppt ml double (or <b>whipping)</b> <b>cream,</b> <b>and</b> 2 tablespoons (35 ml) of whisky.

The oatmeal is soaked in whisky overnight and then added to the <b>whipped</b> <b>cream,</b> {{with a little more}} whisky added to the mixture. Some raspberries are placed {{in the bottom of the}} serving glass before adding the cream mixture. An option is to break up some of the raspberries and gently blend into the mixture. The volume of whisky used may be adjusted to personal taste.|$|R
500|$|As a retailer, Marcus {{believed}} {{strongly in}} making his store {{into a place}} where everything a customer needed could be found and, if necessary, brought to the customer's front door. He {{was said to have}} helped one customer discover the shoe size of Queen Elizabeth II so as to give the gift of stockings and a pair of shoes, and he ordered that the store stock such items as a set of Steuben plates with the Mexican national crest, [...] "because sooner or later somebody will be going to call on the President of Mexico and need a proper gift." [...] He personally delivered a fur coat to a St. Louis, Missouri, customer who could not make the trip to Dallas. Another story often recounted is that of a shopper who, in searching for a present for his wife, said that he was not sure what to buy, but that he would know it when he saw it. In response, Marcus inquired about the woman's clothing sizes and asked the customer to wait briefly. Taking an oversized brandy snifter from a display, Marcus gathered cashmere sweaters of various colors, arranged them in imitation of a pousse-café, topped with a white angora sweater to simulate <b>whipped</b> <b>cream,</b> <b>and</b> in place of a cherry, garnished the concoction with a 10-karat ruby ring, at a total cost of $25,350, which the customer gladly paid. When one customer decided his Christmas purchases were not sufficiently impressive, Marcus helped to arrange a full duplication of the store's display window, complete with mannequins and lighting, inside the man's home.|$|E

[...] "Liberace recreates—if that is the word—each composition in his own image. When it is too difficult, he simplifies it. When it is too simple, he complicates it". His sloppy technique included [...] "slackness of rhythms, wrong tempos, distorted phrasing, an excess of prettification and sentimentality, a failure to stick to what the composer has written".|$|E
