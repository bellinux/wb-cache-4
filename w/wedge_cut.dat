40|$|An {{improved}} {{design for}} radiation absorption and heat flow into materials with low thermal conductivity is demonstrated. The design {{was developed for}} application in fixed bed two step solar water splitting redox reactors. The fixed bed {{was assumed to be}} made from porous ceramic. The low thermal conductivity of the porous ceramic redox material is compensated for by changing the profile of the fixed bed. The profiling used was <b>wedges</b> <b>cut</b> into the material which allows concentrated solar radiation to be incident on a larger area of redox material than for a flat monolith design. The design is demonstrated to efficiently transfer heat to the bulk and greatly reduce re-radiation. For a wedge 9 cm in depth and 1. 6 cm wide at the opening, heated with 500 kWm 2 incident radiation for 300 s, approximately double the amount of radiation is absorbed. The effects of thermal conductivity, emissivity and scaling on the efficiency of the design were investigated. The radiation absorption performance improved when scaled up. The improvement of the design over a flat plain bed is greater for lower emissivity. The improvement provided by the wedge design was found to decrease for increasing thermal conductivity, and eventually for high conductivity values it reduced performance. Using this method a larger amount of material with low thermal conductivity can be heated with the same power input and reduced radiation losses. The heat flow simulations were then coupled to an Arrhenius rate equation to investigate the possible improvement to the reaction efficiency and yield offered by the wedge design. Over a time of 300 s the efficiency and yield were seen to be approximately a factor of 4 times higher in the wedge case. Finally a concentrated solar cavity reactor based on the design is proposed...|$|R

Tapered absorber <b>wedges</b> were <b>cut</b> out of four different commercially available semi-rigid absorber ma terials and inserted in a backshorted micromachined waveguide cavity for characterization. The absorption properties of these materials are only specified at 10 GHz, and their absorption behavior above 100 GHz was so far unknown. To study {{the effect of the}} geometry of the absorber wedges, the return loss of different absorber lengths and tapering angles was investigated. The results show that longer and sharper sloped wedges from the material specified with the lowest dielectric constant, but not the highest specified absorption, are superior over other geometries and absorber materials. The best results were achieved for 5 mm long absorbers with a tapering angle of 23 ° in the material RS- 4200 from the supplier Resin Systems, having a return loss of better than 13 dB over the whole frequency range of 220 to 325 GHz. These absorber wedges are intended to be used as matched loads in micromachined waveguide circuits.

5000|$|Some {{years before}} the Civil War a speculating land company bought a tract of 69000 acre on the slope of Shavers Mountain. Their tract fronted for about seven miles km along {{the eastern side of}} the mountain. To survey and mark their {{holdings}} the company hired a crew of men who must have found rough going in this wilderness.

In this area the angle of declination is about four degrees, a significant source of error on a seven-mile km front…. An experienced Virginia surveyor, in checking the data, discovered the error but said nothing about it. Presently, however, when the sale was being concluded and the deeds recorded, he brought the error to light, and under a sort of “doctrine of vacancy” claimed the wedge of land left by a corrected survey.

40|$|Eucalyptus nitens {{is widely}} planted for pulpwood, and {{increasingly}} also for solid-wood timber products, in cool-temperate climates. This thesis investigated {{the potential of}} tree breeding to improve the properties of E. nitens grown for sawn boards, pulpwood and veneer products. Two studies were undertaken using a 14 - 15 year old E. nitens provenanceprogeny trial established in Tasmania and comprising 420 open-pollinated families collected from three native races. In the first study, methods were developed to track the identities of 560 pedigreed trees through harvesting, transportation and sawmill processing. A second study tracked 548 trees from the same trial through a rotary peeled veneer production system. Genetic parameters were estimated {{for a total of}} 20 tree, log and wood traits relevant to sawn board, veneer and pulpwood products. Genetic differences among races of E. nitens were significant in wood stiffness, growth, stem form and pulpwood traits, but not significant for log end-splitting and sawn board checking traits. The Southern race had the most favourable mean values. Significant additive genetic variation within races was observed in all traits except log-taper, demonstrating that the quality of plantation-grown E. nitens wood products could be improved through breeding. Strongly positive genetic correlations among diameter at breast height (DBH) at ages 4, 9 and 14 years and between DBH all ages and the traits survival, log volume and stem straightness, demonstrated that early-age selection for DBH would not compromise stem straightness and would improve product volume recovery. Log end-splitting was under moderate genetic control but there was a negative genetic correlation between end-splitting and solidwood product volume. Sawn board and veneer sheet stiffness was highly heritable, and strongly correlated with acoustic wave velocity (AWV), measured in standing trees and logs. Consistent with previous studies in E. nitens, wood basic density, near infra red-(NIR) predicted kraft pulp yield (KPY) and cellulose content (CC) had moderate-to-high heritabilities, although coefficients of additive genetic variation for these traits were small. Estimated genetic correlations between standing tree AWV and each of the traits veneer sheet modulus of elasticity (MOE), sawn-board MOE, KPY, CC and basic density were highly significant and strongly positive, suggesting that standing tree AWV could be adopted as an indirect non-destructive selection criterion for improving solid-wood product stiffness, while simultaneously improving wood chemical traits favoured by the pulpwood industry. Basic density had no significant genetic relationship with KPY and CC, although other studies have reported moderate to strong significant values. Surface and internal checking in sawn boards, which are important defects leading to value downgrade, were shown to be under moderate levels of additive genetic control. Internal checking in <b>wedges</b> <b>cut</b> from log disks and in wafer sections cross-cut from processed boards were strongly and positively genetically correlated. However, the genetic correlation of checking traits with density and AWV were generally not significant. Work presented in this thesis clearly demonstrates the potential for genetic improvement of E. nitens for pulpwood, sawn-boards and veneer production. A new method of tracking trees in processing studies has been established. Methods for assessing checking have been developed, and the utility of nondestructive AWV and NIR techniques has been confirmed for use in E. nitens breeding programs, aiming to simultaneously improve the quality and recovered volume of pulpwood and solid-wood products...|$|R

40|$|The Shetland {{ophiolite}} {{was derived}} from an intra-continental, ocean-floored basin that opened shortly after 600 Ma on {{the eastern edge of}} Laurentia, during the tensional opening of the Iapetus Ocean. The precursor sedimentary and volcanic extensional basin is exposed in the south of Shetland and can be followed northeastwards by offshore geophysical anomalies. Eastward subduction of the floor of the basin led to hydration of the descending slab and the overlying mantle wedge. At about 500 Ma pressure from the east caused westward obduction of part of the subducting slab. The obduction thrust originated in the overlying mantle <b>wedge</b> and <b>cut</b> through the descending slab from above into underlying mantle. The result is a nappe cutting steeply through the sub-ocean-floor layers. The obducted nappe over-rode highly metamorphosed Shetland-Dalradian schists and gneisses and now forms the Lower Nappe of the Shetland Ophiolite Complex. The exposed pseudo-stratigraphic succession extends from several kilometres deep in the mantle, as exposed in the west, through the lower crust {{to the base of the}} sheeted dykes in the east, before passing beneath the sea; a surface distance of some 6 km. The ophiolitic pseudo-stratigraphy occurs as steeply dipping layers within the nappe, which gravity modelling shows to be about 3 km thick. The section through the ophiolite is lying on its side. After its obduction, erosion of the nappe and nearby metamorphic basement led to deposition of fine-grained, laminated siliceous sediments, locally graphitic and conglom-eratic. Resumed pressure from the east during the Scandian orogeny telescoped the Lower Nappe, thereby emplacing an Upper Nappe over the Lower Nappe. The two nappes are separated by an imbricate zone incorporating siliceous sediments, ophiolitic hornblende schist and slices of the ophiolite nappes.

40|$|The {{rollback}} of a segmented slab of oceanic lithosphere {{is typically}} accompanied by vertical lithospheric tear fault(s) along the lateral slab edge(s) and by strike slip {{movement in the}} upper plate, defined as a STEP fault (Subduction Tear Edge Propagator). The Neogene evolution of the Central Mediterranean {{is dominated by the}} interaction between the slow Africa-Eurasia convergence and the SE-ward rollback of the Ionian slab, that leads to the back-arc opening of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Here, we present post-stack time migrated and pre-stack depth migrated Archimede (1997) multichannel seismic lines, that were acquired offshore eastern Sicily, {{at the foot of the}} Malta escarpment. First, we identify the recent deformation along the lateral ramp of the Calabrian accretionary wedge. Towards the east, the Calabrian wedge is formed by the accretion of the post-evaporitic sediments, above a decollement at the base of the Messinian evaporites. At the latitude of Syracuse, 50 km east of the Malta escarpment, a major N 150 degrees E trending crustal scale and vertical fault slices through the entire accretionary <b>wedge.</b> This fault <b>cuts</b> by several kilometers, through the pre-evaporitic Messinian sediments and into the basement. The vertical offset along this vertical fault decreases from north to south, and the fault is no longer observed on the seismic lines, 50 km SE of the Alfeo seamount. A previously published Moho depth isocontour map, offshore Sicily and the recent GPS data, combined with the presence of strike slip movements NE onshore Sicily, allow us to identify this 200 km long crustal-scale fault as the surface expression of a STEP fault. The presence of syntectonic Pleistocene sediments on top this crustal-scale fault suggests a recent lithospheric vertical movement of the STEP fault, in response to the rollback of the Ionian slab and to the SE-ward advance of the Calabria-Peloritan block...|$|R
50|$|The Stavka pulled {{together}} aircraft from various commands {{to supply the}} encircled city from the air on 13 September. The Civil Air Fleet contributed PS-84s (Lisunov Li-2s) from both the Special Northern Aviation Group (OSAG). Six Squadrons from The Moscow Air Group (MAGON GVF). The DBA contributed aircraft from 7 TBAP and 39 TBAE from KBF's transport fleet. Apart from three of MAGON GVF's squadrons, which flew directly from Moscow to Leningrad, most operated out of Tikhvin. Through late September, 100 tons arrived daily from Soviet civil aviation. In October, it increased to 150 tons daily. Losses were light owing to the Soviet tactic of flying in fog and darkness, avoiding German fighters. When Tikhvin was captured in November, TB-3s from 14 TBAP in addition to 7 TBAP. On 9 November, Stalin personally ordered that 200 tons daily were to be flown in over the following five days. 127 IAP and 154 IAP were handed over for escort operations. Although some formations were intercepted, most went undetected. The transports made a considerable contribution to the starving city. The MAGON GVF flew in 6,186 tons, including 4,325 tons of food and 1,271 tons of ammunition from 10 October to the 25 December. Soviet fighters flew 1,836 sorties escorting them.A Soviet counter offensive on 14 September drove the Germans back from Sosnovka and Finskoye Koyrovo, {{with support from the}} VVS and Red Banner Fleet. The Luftwaffe responded with an aerial onslaught that surpassed the pressure exerted on the first day. German bomber units flew 606 operations against Soviet positions. Three large ships were spotted by German air reconnaissance trying to make it through to Leningrad across Lake Ladoga (it had not yet frozen). Ju 87s from StG 2 were sent to intercept and sank two of them. The VVS also made a maximum effort against German forces. JG 54 was called upon to protect German supply columns and spearheads under attack on the Luga-Leningrad highway south of Krasnogvardeysk. On Friday 19 September, six major air attacks against Leningrad caused serious damage. Bombs hit a hospital killing 442 people. Soviet air defences claimed 17 German bombers but Fliegerkorps I record the loss of one Bf 110, three Ju 87s and two Ju 88s only. Logistics issues struck soon after, and the declining number of operational German fighters and increased demands from the German bomber crews for escort against increasingly resistant Soviet fighters left the VVS in control of the air over Leningrad. A combination of this and aggressive Soviet air attacks forced Hitler to abandon Leningrad's capture. Instead, he turned east, toward the <b>wedge</b> that had <b>cut</b> the city off from the Soviet hinterland, and to the Red Army forces that were trying to break it.|$|R
40|$|In Argentina {{heat waves}} have regular {{frequency}} specially during summer-time. There {{are two of}} them with an important recurrence period: one observed {{at the end of}} December, known as Christmas Heat Wave (CHW), and the other during the second fortnight of January, generally after the 20 th. A heat wave is defined when the minimum temperature is greater than the average of the higher minimum temperature, and when the maximum temperature is greater than the average of the lower maximum temperature. This definition is valid for the central west of Argentina and must occur at least during two days. During CHW of December 1994 maximum temperature reached 41. 9 °C on 30 th in Mendoza Aero (SAME) located at 32. 500 S 68. 47 °W; on CHW of December 2000 maximum temperature reached 40. 10 C on 25 th. On January 30 th 2003 was registered 44. 4 °C, the highest maximum temperature in SAME since records exist. The goal of this work is to analyze the prevailing meteorological conditions during the occurrence of three Extreme Maximum Temperature Episodes (EMTE) from synoptic, thermodynamic and dynamic point of view in order to establish differences and similitudes between them. Surface data were obtained from Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) Argentina and Dirección Meteorológica de Chile (DMC); the aerological data reconstructed from NOAA Air Resources Laboratory Real Time Environmental Aplications and Display System (ARL). Reanalysis from the National Center for Enviromental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR), and ETA model from Centro de Previsao e Estudos Climaticos (CPTEC) Brazil. The principal results were obtained at the following levels: at 850 hPa the height pattern in the continent is similar in all EMTE´s analyzed. Height value in 330 S is almost 50 mgp less on December 2000, justifying the presence of the Norwestern Argentinian Low (NAL) and the displacement toward the south for it habitual position helping to the occurrence of Zonda wind in surface. At SAME latitude the height pattern at 600 hPa level shows a downward trough in the EMTE December 25 th 2000, zonal flow on Decembre 30 th 1994 and the presence of a height <b>wedge</b> with a <b>cut</b> off high in January 30 th 2003. The EMTE 1994 occured {{at the end of a}} long heat wave started at the beginning of December; the zonda wind was detected above 600 hPa level. The Christmas EMTE 2000 was a classic zonda wind event, like in winter, characterized by a cold front approaching and a deep trough associated over Pacific Ocean close to the continent. All EMTE´s analyzed were produced by heat waves events and reforcing by zonda wind episodes of different intensity. To improve the prediction of this kind of EMTE, in a global warming scenary that is coming up, it would be necessary to adjust regional mesoscale models and use satellite imagery.
