5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians <b>who</b> <b>view</b> themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E

40|$|Students viewed {{one of six}} lectures which varied only in {{substantive}} teaching points (content) {{covered and}} seductiveness. These 207 students then rated {{the effectiveness of the}} presentation (satisfaction ratings) and completed a 26 -item achievement test. Students <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> high seduction lectures performed better on the achievement test than did students <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> low seduction lectures. Similarly, students <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> lectures high in content performed better on the cognitive test than did students <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> low-content lectures. The relationship between staisfaction ratings and student achievement was not perfect. Students gave higher ratings to seductive lectures. However, ratings reflected differences in content-coverage only under low seduction conditions. The ratings were not sensitive to variations in content-coverage when lectures were highly seductive. The 2 ̆ 2 Doctor Fox Effect 2 ̆ 2 appears to be more than an illusion. Seductiveness affects both student ratings of instruction and achievement...|$|R
50|$|Perception of peers’ sexual {{attitudes and}} {{behaviour}} {{can increase the}} amount of sexual content watched by adolescents; this, in turn, can influence sexual behavior. Believing that one’s friends approve of sexual activity and have a high level of non-coital sexual experience predicts heavier viewing of sexual material, relative to other types of television. Collins and colleagues found a relationship between the amount of sexual content in television viewed and sexual behavior in adolescents. Adolescents <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> one standard deviation more sexual content than average showed sexual behavior similar to adolescents, 9 to 17 months older, <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> an average amount of sexual programming. Adolescents <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> the highest level of televised sexual content doubled the likelihood of initiating intercourse within the following year, compared to adolescents <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> average amounts. However, the inability to control for prior interest in sex before television viewing may affect the accuracy of the results.|$|R

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the extent to}} which time spent watching television is associated with obesity and super-obesity among 6, 138 employed adult males. After adjustment for age, smoking status, length of work week, measured physical fitness, and reported weekly hours of exercise, people <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> TV more than three hours/day were twice as likely to be obese as those <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> less than 1 hour/day. Those <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> for 1 to 2 hours daily had a relative risk of 1. 60 (1. 21, 2. 11).

Research indicates that whether a woman views menopause as a medical issue or an expected life change is correlated with her socio-economic status.

25|$|The archaeological sub-discipline of {{rock art}} studies first {{developed}} in the late-19th century among Francophone scholars studying the Upper Palaeolithic rock art found in the cave systems of Western Europe. Rock art continues to be of importance to indigenous peoples {{in various parts of}} the world, <b>who</b> <b>view</b> them as both sacred items and significant components of their cultural patrimony. Such archaeological sites are also significant sources of cultural tourism, and have been utilised in popular culture for their aesthetic qualities.|$|E
25|$|The Crown is the {{pinnacle}} of the Canadian Forces, with the constitution placing the monarch {{in the position of}} commander-in-chief of the entire force, though the governor general carries out the duties attached to the position and also bears the title of Commander-in-Chief in and over Canada. Further, included in Canada's constitution are the various treaties between the Crown and Canadian First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples, <b>who</b> <b>view</b> these documents as agreements directly and only between themselves and the reigning monarch, illustrating the relationship between sovereign and aboriginals.|$|E
25|$|The idea of '{{resilience}} building' is debatably at {{odds with}} the concept of resilience as a process, since it is used to imply that it is a developable characteristic of oneself. Those <b>who</b> <b>view</b> resilience as a description of doing well despite adversity, view efforts of 'resilience building' as method to encourage resilience. Bibliotherapy, positive tracking of events, and enhancing psychosocial protective factors with positive psychological resources are other methods for resilience building. In this way, increasing an individual's resources to cope with or otherwise address the negative aspects of risk or adversity is promoted, or builds, resilience.|$|E

25|$|Expression on {{instruments}} can {{be closely}} related {{to the role of the}} breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions. Whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, <b>who</b> <b>view</b> expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable emotion, ideally causing a sympathetic emotional response in its listeners. The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a national anthem), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.|$|E
25|$|LGBT-affirming Apostolic Pentecostals {{share the}} same basic doctrinal beliefs as other Apostolic (Oneness) Pentecostals. These include the Oneness of God, the plan of {{salvation}} consisting of repentance, water baptism by immersion in Jesus' name for the forgiveness of sins, and receiving the infilling of the Holy Ghost with the initial evidence of speaking in other tongues. One major area of difference {{is the belief that}} homosexuality is not sinful, and that God blesses same-sex marriage. Affirming Apostolics maintain that scripture in the original languages did not condemn homosexuality, but did record same-sex marriage. This view is disputed by mainline Apostolics, <b>who</b> <b>view</b> homosexuality as sinful and satanic in origin.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} psychological time {{with regards to}} a memory recognition task. The participants rated images on a 5 -point scale of attractiveness. There were two different conditions, one having 40 male faces and the other containing 40 female faces. After they finished rating the faces, they made a retrospective time estimate of how long they thought they spent viewing the faces. Following this they took the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale (MSBS) to test what state of boredom they were currently experiencing. Finally they performed a memory recognition test. We noticed {{statistically significant differences between}} the two conditions based on target gender. Women <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> the female condition made lower time estimates than women <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> the male condition. Women also scored better on the recognition test in the female face condition. They also rated the female face condition overall higher on attractiveness than the male face condition. All in all, women <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> the female condition seemed to be more attentionally engaged than women <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> the male condition...|$|R
