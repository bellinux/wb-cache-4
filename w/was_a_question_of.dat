The half-hour test show {{featured}} a power failure and a fire drill, which involved a full evacuation of the audience and crew. The first programme filmed at MediaCityUK was Don't Scare the Hare in February 2011, {{and the first to}} transfer <b>was</b> <b>A</b> <b>Question</b> <b>of</b> Sport, the same month. BBC employees started transferring to the development in May 2011, a process that took 36 weeks. BBC Director General Mark Thompson confirmed that up to a further 1,000 jobs could be created or transferred to the site. In January 2012 the BBC was accused of not supporting the community by MP, Hazel Blears, after it was reported that only 26 of 680 jobs created at the development had gone to residents of Salford.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the court {{acknowledged}} that using a 15-gram differentia {{might not be}} the best method of furthering the social object of the MDA. However, the matter of what would constitute a better differentia was one which reasonable people may not necessarily agree on, and so this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> social policy best left to the legislature, not the judiciary. Addressing Yong's contention that in reality the mandatory death penalty only had a limited deterrent effect on drug traffickers, the Court said that it was not within the its purview to determine the mandatory death penalty's efficacy as a deterrent to drug trafficking. Such an issue <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> policy and should be left to the legislature to decide. If any changes to the mandatory death penalty or the death penalty in general were to be effected, these had to be done by the legislature and not by the Judiciary under the pretence of constitutional interpretation. In addition, while the court acknowledged {{it could be argued that}} there was insufficient evidence of the mandatory death penalty's deterrent effect on serious offences like murder, it could also be said there was insufficient evidence that the mandatory death penalty did not have a deterrent effect.|$|E

25|$|And so, {{in modern}} times, when liberties {{are to be}} taken, and the {{intrusive}} passions of men to be indulged, precedent and permission, or what sounds like them, may be easily found and quoted for everything. But Samuel, in God's Name, silenced all this, giving them to understand, that in His sight the whole <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> motive and purpose, not of ostensible and colourable argument;—in His sight, I say, to Whom we, as well as they, are nationally responsible for {{much more than the}} soundness of our deductions as matter of disputation, or of law; we are responsible for the meaning and temper in which we deal with His Holy Church, established among us for the salvation of our souls.|$|E
25|$|In United States v. Jackalow (1861), the Court {{held that}} Article Three venue must be {{established}} by facts found by a jury. The act of piratical murder by Jackalow was alleged to have occurred on the high seas, between the waters within {{the jurisdiction of the}} states of New York and Connecticut; New Jersey was the first state into which Jackalow was brought upon capture. An 1820 anti-piracy statute provided that, if the crime occurred on the high seas, venue was proper in the first state into which the defendant was brought after capture. The Court held that—although the boundary of New York and Connecticut state waters were a question of law for the judge—the location of the crime <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> fact for the jury. Thus, Jackalow was granted a new trial.|$|E
25|$|Another price {{explosion}} for tantalum in 2000/2001 {{forced the}} development of niobium electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte, which have been available since 2002. Niobium is a sister metal to tantalum and serves as valve metal generating an oxide layer during anodic oxidation. Niobium as raw material is much more abundant in nature than tantalum and is less expensive. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> {{the availability of the}} base metal in the late 1960s which led to development and implementation of niobium electrolytic capacitors in the former Soviet Union instead of tantalum capacitors as in the West. The materials and processes used to produce niobium-dielectric capacitors are essentially the same as for existing tantalum-dielectric capacitors. The characteristics of niobium electrolytic capacitors and tantalum electrolytic capacitors are roughly comparable.|$|E

25|$|Colon's {{self-confidence}} is remarkable. He had {{a strong}} regard for right and justice. Firmly, though respectfully, he reproved Rabbi Israel Bruna, the foremost German talmudist of his time, for overstepping the bounds of his authority. Responsum No. 4, addressed to the congregation of Regensburg, is highly important. A number of Jews of that community having been falsely accused, and a sum of money having to be raised for their ransom, the surrounding places and neighboring communities refused to contribute, at least insofar as it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> paying a fixed tax instead of making voluntary contributions. Colon decided that the communities in question could not refuse to pay their share, since the same false accusation might be made against them also, and if the accused in this case were proved innocent and ransomed, they would then be safe from danger.|$|E
25|$|It {{is certain}} that John Paul I would not have {{reversed}} Paul VI's teaching, namely on contraception, since it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> sexual ethics and Church doctrine, rather than one of personal opinion. Nevertheless, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in Humanae vitae as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did. Luciani had mixed feelings in regards to the traditional stance on contraception. In 1968, as Bishop of Vittorio Veneto, he submitted a report to his predecessor as the Patriarch of Venice, Giovanni Urbani, that argued that the contraceptive pill should be permitted. It was agreed on by fellow Veneto bishops and was later submitted to Pope Paul VI. When Humanae vitae was released, Luciani defended that document. But he seemed to contradict that defence in a letter he wrote to his diocese four days after the release of the encyclical. In May 1978, Cardinal Luciani was invited to speak at a Milanese conference to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the encyclical. He refused to speak at the event or even attend it.|$|E

Nicholas also defended Dworsky's work against Gehry's attacks, denying that there were any problems with the Dworsky drawings not attributable to fast-tracking. Nicholas said: [...] "They were not 'bad' drawings. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> the subs not understanding them." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1940s and 50s, Unwin had {{developed}} [...] "Unwinese", a nonsense language that distorted {{words and phrases}} into a form of gibberish, that sounded unintelligible but which in fact retained some fragments of meaning. Recalling Unwin's radio and television performances, Anderson thought that the self-made language would suit the character of an eccentric undercover operative, and could produce humour if demonstrated to have a confusing effect on enemies. He elaborated, [...] "As far as I was concerned, Stanley came first and then the idea had to accommodate him. It wasn't that the story called for someone who could speak gobbledegook, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> how we could fit him into the storyline." ...|$|E
500|$|Occasionally, the {{distinction}} between errors of law and errors of fact can be fuzzy. Where a public authority {{is alleged to have}} committed an error of mixed fact and law, the High Court is more likely to leave the matter to the authority and decline to intervene. This can be the case where a statutory term evaluated by the authority is so general and ambiguous that reasonable people may peg different meanings to it. In such a situation, it is generally left to the authority to evaluate the meaning of the term. This is illustrated by Puhlhofer v. Hillingdon London Borough Council (1986), which involved a public authority that bore a statutory responsibility for providing homeless people with accommodation. The applicants were a married couple who lived with their two children in a single room in a guest house. Their application for permanent accommodation was rejected because the authority claimed they were not [...] "homeless" [...] within the meaning of the statute. The House of Lords upheld this decision, determining that the issue of whether the applicants had accommodation <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> fact to be determined by the public authority: ...|$|E

[...] I had to earn money to help support the family." [...] At that time, Lat's father had fallen seriously ill and could not work; Lat had to become the breadwinner of his family. [...] Aside from taking the job, he continued contributing cartoons to other publications. [...] Lat was later transferred to Beritas parent publication, New Straits Times. [...] Moving throughout the city to report on crimes gave Lat opportunities to observe and interact with the myriads of lives in the urban landscape, enabling him to gather material for his cartoons and increasing {{his understanding of the}} world. [...] Nevertheless, he felt he lacked the persistently inquisitive nature needed to succeed as a crime reporter. [...] Furthermore, his [...] "breathtakingly detailed, lurid and graphically gory descriptions" [...] of the aftermaths of crimes had to be frequently toned down by his seniors. [...] Lat became convinced that he was a failure at his job, and his despondency led him to tender his resignation. [...] Samad, believing Lat had a bright future with the press, furiously rejected the letter.|$|E
