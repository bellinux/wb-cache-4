25|$|City's relegation to the Conference National in 2003 kick-started a {{major change}} in the club's structure. On 14 May 2003, John Russell and Mike Lewis were arrested over {{allegations}} of financial irregularities at the club. It later emerged that Uri Geller <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who had contacted the police. Following Russell and Lewis' arrest, then Trust chairman Ian Huxham, chief executive Terry Pavey and Julian Tagg, all of which were prominent members of the Exeter City Supporters' Trust at the time, were appointed as directors of the club. Shortly after, Doble asked the Trust to take over the day-to-day running of the club. Complex legal arguments with both Inland Revenue and football authorities meant that City's first season of non-league football was plagued by off-the-field uncertainty. The claim was finally dropped in June 2004.|$|E

During his tenure there, Manstein <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> responsible for the development of [...] Fall Rot (Case Red), a defensive plan to protect Germany from attack by France. During this period Manstein came into contact with Heinz Guderian and Oswald Lutz, who advocated drastic changes in warfare, emphasising the role of the Panzer. However, officers like Ludwig Beck, Chief of the Army General Staff, were against such drastic changes, and therefore Manstein proposed an alternative: the development of Sturmgeschütze (StuG), self-propelled assault guns that would provide heavy direct-fire support to infantry. In World War II, the resulting StuG vehicles proved to be among the most successful and cost-effective German weapons.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"" [...] trio of episodes {{started a}} new mythology for the series, {{questioning}} the origin of human life. Series creator Chris Carter claimed {{to be interested in}} the subject for a while, citing the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement in great extinctions that had happened millions of years ago. Carter claimed that early in the show he had met with a man who <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> responsible for leading the project of mapping the human genome and that he was interested enough in the subject to tie it into the show's alien mythology. The scientific basis for extraterrestrials pursued the writers to help Mulder an Scully's beliefs come together, which was furthered in the later seasons of the show. Frank Spotnitz claimed that the ideas used in this episode had been discussed between him and Carter for a few years, and had become easier to bring up after clearing away elements of the conspiracy in the episodes [...] "Two Fathers" [...] and [...] "One Son".|$|E

Her rehabilitation was then moved to the Royal North Shore Hospital, where she met Christie Dawes (née Skelton), who she would later race with in the Australian 4x100m relay team at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics. Because her brother had spina bifida, and was already [...] "in the [...] system", her parents insisted that Angie continue at a regular school, rather than one specifically for disabled students.
