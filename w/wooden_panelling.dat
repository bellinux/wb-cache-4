5|$|The hall has a hammerbeam roof; {{the louvre}} in the centre is now glazed, but was {{originally}} {{the only means}} of escape for smoke rising from a fireplace in the centre of the floor. The <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> was designed by Ninian Comper and was erected in 1911 in place of some previous 19th-century Gothic type, though even earlier panelling, dating from 1710, is evident in the Buttery.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{has been changed}} and expanded over the centuries. It now consists of a main 3 storey block with two wings. The interior includes fine <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> and plaster ceilings. Some of the original fireplaces survive {{and many of the}} rooms include decorative stained glass. It is surrounded by landscaped grounds including a sunken garden and a knot garden. There is a 17th century barn adjacent to the house.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the ship {{was intended to be}} as similar as possible to the original. Tillberg Design of Sweden was contracted to produce drawings replicating Titanic's original interiors. However, the original <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> does not conform to modern fire regulations, so as in Queen Mary 2, veneers would have had to be used. Plans showed a layout broadly similar to the original, but with the third-class cabins modernised, and consideration being given to en-suite cabins throughout the ship. The room freed up by eliminating the steam boilers of the original ship would have been used for crew quarters and various services.|$|E
50|$|Sir Richard Wallace {{used the}} Back State Room to {{entertain}} guests to Hertford House. During his lifetime it had <b>wooden</b> boiserie <b>panelling</b> on the wall; the great chandelier, by Jacques Caffiéri, dating from 1751, {{remains in the}} room.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the house}} restoration, an {{inscription}} was uncovered behind the <b>wooden</b> pearwood <b>panelling</b> in the parlour. Written in pencil it reads “John Edwards joiner Holywell 15th of May 1926”. This {{implies that the}} old panelling {{was introduced to the}} house as late as 1926.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{materials}} used {{in the construction of}} the building were reclaimed such as the <b>wooden</b> wall <b>panelling</b> which was from a public house in the East End of London and the flooring was from American pre-fabricated buildings. The doors came from Fred's Scrap Yard (now known as Fred's (F.H. Ives) Timber Yard).|$|R
25|$|Furtwängler resumed conducting. On April 25, 1935, he {{returned}} to the Berlin Philharmonic with a program dedicated to Beethoven. Many people who had boycotted the orchestra during his absence came to the concert to support him. He was called out seventeen times. On May 3, in his dressing room before conducting the same program, he was informed that Hitler and his entire staff would attend the concert. He was given the order to welcome Hitler with the Nazi salute. Furtwängler was so furious that he ripped the <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> off a radiator. Franz Jastrau, the manager of the orchestra, suggested that he keep his baton in his right hand all the time. When he entered the hall, all the Nazi leaders were present making the Hitler salute, but Furtwängler kept hold of his baton and began the concert immediately. Hitler probably could not have imagined that such an affront was possible but decided to put up a good show: he sat down and the concert went on.|$|E
500|$|A private {{staircase}} {{between the}} Parlour and the Withdrawing Room {{leads to the}} first floor. The Withdrawing Room has 16th-century carved <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling,</b> and a wooden ceiling with moulded coffering, which probably dates from 1559 when the Great Hall ceiling was added. The bay window in this room was also added in 1559, {{at the same time}} as the one in the Great Hall. The pair of windows bear the following inscription underneath their gables: ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{south-west}} side of {{the court}} is the hall, a 16th-century design incorporating an earlier hall on the same site. [...] wide, the hall was originally [...] high, with a roof made of Irish oak, lit and ventilated by a cupola in the middle. A large oriel window lit {{the end of the}} hall occupied at dinner by the earls of Worcester, which by the time Raglan was built would have been used only for larger formal occasions. Originally, the hall would have been fitted with carved <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> and a minstrel's gallery.|$|E
50|$|Natural Swimming Pools have {{historically}} been available only in bespoke designs and therefore cheap alternatives {{have been hard to}} come by. However, in 2011 a natural kit pool was developed in the UK based on a number of set design features mainly using <b>wooden</b> wall <b>panelling</b> to maintain the natural look and feel of a traditional natural pool.|$|R
5000|$|On 7 June 2012, {{a four-year-old}} girl entered a near month-long coma after falling 14ft from the ride's raised queue line. The <b>wooden</b> fence <b>panelling</b> was untreated, and {{had over the}} years rotten due to weathering. The girl lent on the fencing while she waited, before it gave way and she fell. Severe {{injuries}} occurred, including broken ribs, a cracked skull, and bleeding on the brain.|$|R
50|$|Unusually {{complete}} C19 pub {{interior of}} pine fittings including dado panelled skittles room with original leather and wood skittles {{set in the}} form of a chair, front parlour panelled with built in settles and cupboards, rear parlour with wooden mantelpiece, cambered <b>wooden</b> cupboard, <b>panelling</b> and built in settles, panelled corridor with wooden doors and tiled floors throughout. A rare and unusually complete rural pub interior of this date.|$|R
500|$|The oldest {{part of the}} house, {{the north}} front, {{was built in the}} Elizabethan era but {{incorporates}} parts of the earlier priory grange on the site. The front has sloping gables which reduce the load on the walls beneath them. The porch which was added in 1610 has tuscan columns supporting a balustrade with a statue of [...] "Bungey", a favourite spaniel of John Harrington. It leads into a passage and the [...] "oak room" [...] which has <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> with a moulded ceiling and 17th century fireplace. Similar features {{can be found in the}} hall and dining room. The ceiling of the library is an imitation of that at Audley End House, while the woodwork is mostly Jacobean. The staircase to the bedrooms incorporates the base of a tree trunk growing under the house.|$|E
500|$|The chapel, {{which was}} {{dedicated}} in 1621 and extended in 1636, was extensively altered in 1864 {{under the supervision}} of the architect George Edmund Street. The alterations have had their supporters and their critics; one historian of the college (Ernest Hardy, principal from 1921 to 1925) described the work as [...] "ill-considered". [...] The hall's original hammerbeam roof was hidden by a plaster ceiling in 1741 when rooms were installed in the roofspace. The principal's lodgings, the last part of the first quadrangle to be constructed, contain <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> from the early 17th century. The Fellows' Library in the second quadrangle dates from 1679 and contains 11,000 antiquarian books; it was restored at a cost of £700,000 in 2007. A new Junior Common Room, about twice the size of its predecessor, was completed in the third quadrangle in 2002. Further student and teaching rooms were added in Ship Street, opposite the college, in 2010.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} of the building has been changed many times since its construction. The decorative features include several brought in from other buildings. Panelling was brought from Judge Jeffreys' house at [...] No 18, Fore Street, Taunton. An over-mantel was imported from Field Marshal Sir Lintorn Simmons' house Over Langford Manor. In addition sections of <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> were brought from Over Langford Manor. The result of these additions lead to the room being called The Langford Room. a fine plaster ceiling and carved frieze were brought to Nailsea Court from Ashley Manor in Bristol. The dining room door, which dates from around 1590, {{is also known as}} the [...] "Nailsea door". It is decorated with a large arcaded and elaborately carved upper panel. In the hall there is a framed ceiling, this is formed into six bays each of which has chamfered and stopped beams. There is also a stone fireplace in the hall.|$|E

5|$|Internally, Salvin knocked through {{existing}} {{rooms to}} create the Outer Hall, a new gallery on the first floor, a billiard room, a new library and a drawing room. Much of the <b>wooden</b> 17th-century <b>panelling</b> in the parlour and the hall had to be stripped out {{as part of the}} renovations. As part of his work, Salvin appears to have used a number of rolled wrought-iron beams to span the resulting structural gaps in the building, an advanced use of that technology for the time. The house was refurnished with newly bought 16th and 17th-century artwork, two brass Italian cannons and a stuffed polar bear.|$|R
5000|$|The present {{building}} {{is only a}} small part of the château originally built by Louis XI in the 15th century. The original château had three wings in the shape of a U. The room where Louis XI died can be visited. It has late 15th-century <b>wooden</b> linenfold <b>panelling.</b> The first floor has paintings and sculpture devoted to St. Francis of Paola, whom Louis XI summoned to live near him until his death. Inside the château is a display of iron cages which were suspended from the ceiling and used to hold prisoners. The cages were so small that the prisoners were unable to stand.|$|R
500|$|A doorway behind {{where the}} family would have sat {{at the far end}} of the hall leads to the Parlour, known as the Little Parlour in {{surviving}} 17th-century documents. Together with the adjoining Withdrawing Room and the Great Hall, the Parlour is structurally part of the original building. The <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> is a Georgian addition, behind which the original painted panelling was discovered in 1976. The decoration consists of painted imitations of marble and inlay, and Biblical scenes, some of which were painted directly onto the plaster and others on paper that was then pasted to the wall. [...] "Crudely drawn" [...] but nevertheless [...] "elaborate", the paintings tell the story of Susanna and the Elders from the Apocrypha, a [...] "favourite Protestant theme". The Moreton family's wolf head crest and the initials [...] "J.M." [...] suggest a date before John Moreton's death in 1598. Similar painted decoration is found in other Cheshire houses of the late 16th and early 17th centuries.|$|E
500|$|The State Dining Room is {{very much}} as Blore {{designed}} it, and has a panelled ceiling with pendants, and <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> up {{to the line of}} the dado. [...] The room contains a large fireplace in early Renaissance style, made from white and variegated marble, and containing the family arms. [...] Also in the room are sculptures by Joseph Wilton. [...] The Staircase Hall is by Salvin, and is divided from the Sculpture Gallery by three semicircular archways. [...] On the walls are portraits of the Bromley family. [...] The staircase has a wrought iron balustrade decorated with acanthus and roundels with the crests of the Bromleys and the Davenports. [...] The Davenport crest consists of a felon with a rope around his neck; in these roundels the felon has the face of William Gladstone, a political opponent of the Davenports. [...] There are four further ground floor rooms, all by Salvin.|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} of the college resides in the lodgings, a Grade I listed building, {{on the north side}} of the first quadrangle between the chapel (to the east) and the hall (to the west). They were the last part of the first quadrangle to be built. Sir Eubule Thelwall, principal from 1621 to 1630, built the lodgings at his own expense, to include (in the words of the antiquarian Anthony Wood) [...] "a very fair dining-room adorned with wainscot curiously engraven". Tyack said that [...] "the carved <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> of the main rooms [...] a new standard of luxury for the heads of colleges". Pevsner commented that the panelling, set in three tiers with ovals placed vertically rather than horizontally, [...] "looks both dignified and splendid". In 1637, the lodgings were considerably changed with the installation of five [...] "studyes". The shell-hood over the doorway (which Pevsner and Casson both called [...] "beautiful") was added at some point between 1670 and 1740; Pevsner dates it to about 1700. It is elaborately carved on the inside with a decorated cartouche and a cherub-head. Casson called it the college's [...] "most engaging" [...] feature. The original gables over the front of the lodgings were removed and replaced with battlements between 1733 and 1740.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, {{at some time}} between 1660 and 1680 the floor level {{appears to have been}} raised across the whole house, thus forming one {{complete}} level ground floor with the creation of a common or service hall with a low basement area and potentially the creation of the stair hall. In response to this work, the ceiling heights also appear to have been raised some 0.40-0.50 m on the ground floor. The interior walls of the house at this time would have all been plastered with no <b>wooden</b> wall <b>panelling.</b> The earliest oak wall panelling was most probably added in the early to mid-18th century, with pine panelling added later.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the church}} is an old and, in terms of art history, meaningful, <b>wooden</b> pulpit with <b>panelling</b> showing Southwest Asian motifs. In the {{transept}} stands the organ built in 1808 by the brothers Philipp Heinrich and Johann Georg Bürgy. It has 13 stops on one manual keyboard, and a pedalboard. In the tower hang three bells, none of which comes from the bellmaker's that originally did business in the town.|$|R
500|$|A 2007 promotional leaflet {{revealed}} that architecture firm Poole Philips had {{recently completed a}} design for the [...] "restoration and enhancement" [...] of South Stoneham House {{to be used as}} a conference centre. The design combined the historical original house with [...] "a modern glass structure". By 2011 the western part of the house (the end closest to the 1960s extension) had been water damaged leading to a substantial dry rot infestation. To remedy this several of the original timber lintels, <b>wooden</b> wall <b>panelling,</b> plasterwork and some steps from the staircase had all been removed and it was planned to remove the entire staircase from the house. The lintels were to be replaced with new wood and the walls were to be replastered.|$|R
500|$|One {{of the few}} {{tangible}} {{reminders of}} the old Sophiatown is the Anglican Church of Christ the King in Ray Street. The architect was Frank Flemming, who designed 85 churches throughout South Africa. The church was constructed in 1933. The bell tower was added in 1936. So little money was made available for the construction that the architect called it a [...] "Holy Barn". The church's distinctive feature was a mural {{that is no longer}} visible. It was painted between 1939 and 1941 by Sister Margaret. The church was an icon of the liberation struggle in South Africa. In 1940 Trevor Huddleston was appointed Rector. He was an outspoken opponent of apartheid. In 1955 during the forced removals, Huddleston was recalled to England. His ashes reside next to his former church. On the north-eastern side of the church there is a mural depicting Huddleston walking the dusty streets of Sophiatown. This mural was painted by 12 apprentice students under patronage of the Gerard Sekoto Foundation. It shows two children tugging at his cassock as well as Sekoto's famous yellow houses. The entire Sophiatown community was removed by the end of 1963; the church was deconsecrated in 1964 and sold to the Department of Community Development in 1967. In the 1970s it was bought by the Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk, which used it for Sunday School. The church changed hands again and the Pinkster Protestantse Kerk bought the building and altered it significantly. The nave was enclosed, a large font was built and <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> and false organ pipes changed the look of the interior. In 1997 the Anglicans bought the church back and it was reconsecrated; the changes were reversed and the building was largely restored to its former self. However, the hall and gallery the Pinkster Protestantse Kerk had built were retained.|$|E
2500|$|Constructed in 1692–93, the Ropewalk {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} buildings in Karlskrona and the longest wooden building in Sweden. Its length of some [...] is explained by the need to manufacture long stretches of rope. Apart from the rendered brick and granite buildings housing the ropewalk machinery at either end of the two-storey structure, the facility is constructed of heavy timber with <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> along the outer walls. The elaborately designed premises were also used for storing hemp and other raw materials.|$|E
2500|$|Fournier Street was {{designed}} to be both well appointed and of a higher standard than previous residential developments in the local area and consequently the houses were purchased and leased by the 'master' silk-weavers and silk mercers. These buildings are notable for their [...] fine <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> and elaborate joinery such as carved staircases, fireplaces and highly detailed door-cases which were constructed by the craftsmen of the day. Silk-weaving activities occupied the uppermost floors to gain the best light for the looms – hence the development of the unusual highly glazed lofts in these houses. [...] The ground floor rooms commonly served as elaborate showrooms for the finished products.|$|E
50|$|Many {{churches were}} very richly decorated, {{both inside and}} out. Sculpture and {{architectural}} details were often bright with coloured paint of which traces remain at the Cathedral of Chartres. <b>Wooden</b> ceilings and <b>panelling</b> were usually brightly coloured. Sometimes the stone columns of the nave were painted, and the panels in decorative wall arcading contained narratives or figures of saints. These have rarely remained intact, but may be seen at the Chapterhouse of Westminster Abbey.|$|R
2500|$|As {{demand for}} coypu fur declined, coypu have since become pests in many areas, {{destroying}} aquatic vegetation, marshes, and irrigation systems, and chewing through human-made items, such as tires and <b>wooden</b> house <b>panelling</b> in Louisiana, eroding river banks, and displacing native animals. Damage in Louisiana has been sufficiently severe since the 1950s to warrant legislative attention; in 1958, the first bounty {{was placed on}} nutria, though this effort was not funded. [...] By the early 2000s, the Coastwide Nutria Control Program was established, which began paying bounties for nutria killed in 2002. [...] In the Chesapeake Bay region in Maryland, where they were introduced in the 1940s, coypus {{are believed to have}} destroyed [...] of marshland in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. [...] In response, by 2003, a multimillion-dollar eradication program was underway.|$|R
500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the sinking, hundreds of passengers and crew were left dying in the icy sea, surrounded by debris from the ship. [...] Titanics disintegration during her descent to the seabed caused buoyant chunks of debris– timber beams, <b>wooden</b> doors, furniture, <b>panelling</b> and chunks of cork from the bulkheads– to rocket to the surface. These injured and possibly killed some of the swimmers; others used the debris to try to keep themselves afloat.|$|R
2500|$|The {{interiors}} of the 1972–73 extensions reflect fashions of the time, although <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> {{was used for}} the walls, in keeping with the older parts of the building, but with an unequivocally 1970s style. [...] On the Representatives side, the extensions necessitated the demolition of the Prime Minister's suite of offices (originally intended for the Speaker) and the original Cabinet Room. [...] The rooms are now left in the condition they were in at the time they were occupied by Bob Hawke, immediately prior to the move to New Parliament House in May 1988. [...] Similar extensions were made on the Senate side, with a new suite of rooms being constructed for the President of the Senate in a similar style.|$|E
2500|$|Originally the Great Hall, {{the library}} {{on the first}} floor remains the {{principal}} reception room of the house. It is separated from the landing at the south end by a [...] "magnificent" [...] carved wooden screen, which probably dates from the early 17th century. The [...] "handsome and boldly-carved design" [...] includes pilasters with lions on the bases flanking paired double doors with arched heads and satyrs in the spandrels, and also incorporates carved cherubs and grotesques, and painted panels to the external (landing) face; it is surmounted by a central emblem. The carved <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> above the stone fireplace incorporates four painted portraits, including Henry VIII and Sir George Cotton, and dates from the 16th and 17th centuries. The remaining panelling in the library is not original. The hammerbeam roof is concealed by a decorated plasterwork ceiling, probably dating from the 17th century. It has broad coving decorated with [...] painted coats of arms, probably added in the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|The Anglican chapel survives in the {{northern}} part of the cemetery; it is an expansive building of knapped flint in the Gothic Revival style. Bath Stone was used in places as well. [...] The plan consists of a chancel and nave without separation, a vestry, a tall stone porte-cochère and a wooden belfry with a spire on top of a slate roof. [...] At the liturgical east end, there is a lancet window with tracery in its four panes, and the vestry has a similar window with three lights. [...] The porte-cochère has a low five-light window with stepped lancets and two smaller windows above. [...] It is buttressed at the corners and has a pointed-arched entrance. [...] Original fittings inside include stained glass windows, reredos, <b>wooden</b> <b>panelling</b> and encaustic tiling to the floor. The chapel is protected as a Grade II listed building. [...] The other chapel, now demolished, was for Nonconformists; it stood to the southwest and had a narrow spire. [...] Nonconformist and Roman Catholic burials were carried out in separately consecrated parts of the cemetery around this chapel. [...] Another demolished building associated with the cemetery was a large Gothic Revival flint-walled gateway with a castellated turret. [...] It apparently dated from the late 19th century, and was pierced by a wide carriage arch. [...] There were rooms above this, then the round turret. [...] The Council mortuary building opened in August 1962 on the same site.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout Hudsons Coffee's operation, {{the chain}} has kept their outlets' colour scheme dark, maroon in colour, with <b>wooden</b> tables and <b>panelling</b> {{complementing}} the look. Since 2008, Hail Design was {{employed by the}} company to give its outlets a refresh which included a slightly updated logo supported by quirky hand-drawn illustrations on the walls, various products and packaging which Hail Design states, [...] "help create a feeling of warmth, fun and energy." [...] Since August 2012 that look stopped being rolled out to existing stores.|$|R
25|$|The men {{are well}} dressed, Graham smokes a pipe while wearing a fur-lined red velvet cape {{and a red}} velvet cap which is {{slightly}} askew. The grey coat he wears with a white neckerchief is opened at the chest, revealing a gold-brocade waistcoat, his lower half is clothed in breeches, stockings and slippers. The chaplain wears a black coat with a white collar, grey stockings and black shoes with gold buckles, the costume of a social inferior to Graham, but indicating his educated status. The clerk's dress is similarly simple, a brown jacket, bluish-green waistcoat and white collar, while the steward wears a white apron, smock and cap with a black collar, and brown trousers. The black servant's dress is richer, a white cap and pink neckerchief, and a green buttoned velvet coat with a yellow waistcoat. Trump wears Graham's wig. The colours of the painting are mostly of cool greys, blues and reds, with the brown {{of some of the}} clothes and the <b>wooden</b> pilaster <b>panelling,</b> and the lighter blue through the window on the left of the painting.|$|R
50|$|The Fox Inn is {{a public}} house in Green Lane, Hanwell, in the London Borough of Ealing. It is a largely unspoilt and {{original}} mid-Victorian pub. It has received a 'local listing' from Ealing Council as a building of local interest. It is constructed out of local golden yellow brick with more expensive red bricks used for detailing on corners and chimneys. Rich brown glazed tiles are used for the ground floor exterior walls with coloured stained glass in the fan lights. The upper storey has Mock Tudor detailing, including dentils on the two outward-facing gables. Most of the interior is also original, although the dividing former off-licence sales door has been closed off and its wall removed to create one large 'L' shaped bar area. The present day eating area retains its original <b>wooden</b> wall <b>panelling.</b> One end is used mainly by diners. At {{the far side of}} the other end it is also possible to play darts. A wide screen television is situated at the elbow of the bar for screening special sports events. On the east of the building itself is a sizeable, sheltered beer garden with wooden decking. There is additional out-front seating in front of the building and a well ventilated smoking area warmed by radiant heat lamps.|$|R
