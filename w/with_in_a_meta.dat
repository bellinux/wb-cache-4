One way to explic-itly model publication bias is via selection models or weighted probability distribu-tions. In this package we provide implementations of several parametric and nonparamet-ric weight functions. The novelty in Rufibach (2011) is the proposal of a non-increasing vari-ant of the nonparametric weight function of Dear & Begg (1992). The new approach poten-tially offers more insight in the selection process than other methods, but is more flexi-ble than parametric approaches. To maximize the log-likelihood function pro-posed by Dear & Begg (1992) under a monotonicity constraint we use a differential evolution al-gorithm proposed by Ardia et al (2010 a, b) and implemented in Mullen et al (2009). In addi-tion, we offer a method to compute a confidence interval for the overall effect size theta, ad-justed for selection bias as well as a function that computes the simulation-based p-value to as-sess the null hypothesis of no selection as described in Rufibach (2011, Section 6) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Algebraic compilers {{provide a}} {{powerful}} and convenient mech-anism for specifying language translators. With each source language operation one associates a computation for constructing its target lan-guage image; these associated computations, called derived operations, are {{expressed in terms of}} operations from the target language. Some-times the target language operations are not powerful enough to specify the required computations and one may then need to extend the tar-get language algebras with more computationally expressive operations. A better solution is to package them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meta</b> language which can be automatically composed with the target language operations to ensure that all operations needed or desired for performing a translation are provided. In this paper, we show how imperative and functional meta languages can be composed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> target language <b>in</b> <b>an</b> example which implements a temporal logic model checker as an algebraic compiler and show how meta languages can be seen as components to be combined with a source and target language to generate an algebraic compiler. ...|$|R

The general principle is that a program which has been typechecked (at compile time) is guaranteed to satisfy a particular runtime property: for example (traditionally) that all functions are called with the correct number and type of arguments, or (more exotically) that some security property, such as secrecy, holds. In order for typechecking to give a proper guarantee of [...] ...|$|R

Overall strength of association between risk factors and sexual recidivism was calculated. Results suggest that sexual recidivism is low (12 %), and most re-offended generally (53 %). Sexual deviancy and antisocial traits are significantly related to sexual recidivism, and victim characteristics are good predictors of sexual re-offending.
