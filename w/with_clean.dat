5|$|In Pennsylvania, then-governor Dick Thornburgh {{allocated}} $1million {{in emergency}} {{aid for the}} disaster areas, and activated 600National Guardsmen to help <b>with</b> <b>clean</b> up. After nine water plants were closed, the companies relied on reserves to provide water supply to local residents while also encouraging cutting back on usage. About 2,900people in Washington County lost access to clean water.|$|E
5|$|The AEC {{withdrew from}} the island in 1973, though {{scientists}} continue to visit the island for monitoring purposes.

5|$|In 1917, landowners {{along the}} slough had formed three {{drainage}} districts to control floods. They dug ditches, deepened existing water channels, and built levees {{to keep the}} rivers and the slough from flooding agricultural, industrial, and commercial property. Hoping to flush the slough <b>with</b> <b>clean</b> water from the river, city engineers created the crosscutting Peninsula Canal. The project largely failed because daily tides reversed the slough's flow and because {{both ends of the}} canal were at nearly the same elevation.|$|E

Although some models were operated manually by foot pedals, some chain pumps were powered by a horizontal waterwheel which rotated large toothed gears and a horizontal axis beam. Their primary use was for lifting water into irrigation ditches, but chain pumps were also used in public works programs, such as when Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE) had an engineer build several of them to lift water into pipes that provided the capital Luoyang and its palaces <b>with</b> <b>clean</b> water.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{residents}} across Guam {{were critical}} of the delayed response by the U.S. government; no aid had arrived within two days of the storm, but unsafe conditions at airports had prevented aircraft from landing. With the majority of homes destroyed across Guam, structures that remained standing were used as temporary shelter for those left homeless. Similarly, damaged military installations at Anderson Air Force Base were made available to all civilians. By November14, the USS Daniel I. Sultan arrived in Guam with 1,100troops to provide emergency power. A U.S. Air Force AC-130 landed on the island that day carrying the first package of relief supplies. About 400troops and 80public works employees were sent from Hawaii on November14. The Red Cross and civil defense offices were placed in charge of coordinating recovery efforts. Water distribution centers were set up across the island to provide residents <b>with</b> <b>clean</b> drinking water.|$|E
