Traditional {{regenerated}} cellulose fiber (viscose or viscose fiber) had a poor <b>wet</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> and wet modulus, which {{to some extent}} limited {{the application of the}} fiber. Hollow viscose was difficult to get for its instability during the cellulose regenerating process. This paper introduced one kind of new spinning method for hollow viscose through a spinneret of concentric shaft structure using HWM technology. The hollow viscose fiber produced in this experiment had a big crystalline structure and an excellent fibril orientation which gifted the fiber a good mechanical performance even under wet circumstances. The fiber had a bright future in textile application as one component of blending fabrics...|$|E

After ten, twenty, thirty, forty, and fifty washings all the fabrics were analyzed for ash, percentage of light absorbed, shrinkage, <b>wet</b> warp <b>breaking</b> <b>strength,</b> elongation at <b>breaking</b> load, and weight. The silks and wool were analyzed for total nitrogen and sulfate sulfur, the wool for total sulfur, and cellulose acetate for acetyl;The acetyl value of the cellulose-acetate rayon increased by 0. 5 percent in ten washings but then remained constant;With each detergent the ash of the cellulosic fabrics decreased {{and that of the}} proteic fabrics increased with increasing number of washings. The increase in ash for wild silk and wool was greatest with silicated soap and least for wool with sulfated alcohol;Total nitrogen of the residual wild silks shows loss of non-nitrogenous sizing during washing, that of silk and wool the increased weight of the residual fabrics;Repeated washings bleached cellulose, and this effect was greatest with silicated soap. Silk, wild silk, and wool became darker upon repeated washing with sulfated alcohol;Fabrics other than wool shrank but little in any of the detergents;The wet strength of all the fabrics decreased with increasing number of washings {{in each of the three}} detergents. The wet strength of silk decreased 76 percent with sulfated alcohol, ten percent with silicated soap and 24 percent with soap in fifty washings. Wild silk lost 74 percent of its wet strength with sulfated alcohol, nineteen percent with silicated soap, and 21 percent with soap in fifty washings;The residual sulfur of wool washed with silicated soap or soap remained constant and that of wool washed with sulfated alcohol increased. Silk and wild silk also retained sulfate sulfur from the sulfated alcohol;The loss in weight of the cotton and wild silk fabrics upon washing is explained by their loss of sizing.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The major {{purposes}} of the research were {{to determine whether there}} were significant differences in <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> and elongation of the following types of seams in a polyester double-knit fabric: 1. seams stitched with threads of (a) mercerized cotton, (b) core-spun polyester/cotton, and (c) bonded nylon monocord. 2. seams stitched with (a) a narrow zigzag stitch, (b) a lockstitch made while stretching the fabric, and (c) an elastic straight stitch. 3. seams stitched (a) parallel to the wales and (b) parallel to the courses. 4. seams stitched with settings of (a) 9 stitches per inch, (b) 12 stitches per inch, and (c) 15 stitches per inch. Results indicated that the polyester/cotton core-spun thread produced seams with greater <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> and elongation than mercerized cotton thread for all comparable sets of specimens. Seams constructed with polyester/cotton core-spun thread also tended to exhibit greater seam <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> and elongation than those seamed with bonded nylon monocord thread. The nylon thread, in turn, tended to produce stronger and more extensible seams than did mercerized cotton thread. The elastic straight stitch (a triple lockstitch) produced seams with greater <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> and elongation than either of the other stitch types. Most seams stitched with the lockstitch with stretch had a higher mean seam <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> and elongation than comparable seams stitched with the zigzag stitch, Stitch length affected seam <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> and elongation to a greater extent with the zigzag than with the lockstitch with stretch. For most comparable sets of zigzag specimens, increases in the number of stitches per inch were accompanied by increases in seam <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> and elongation. With the lockstitch, those differences which were significant indicated that the shorter stitches were related to greater <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> and elongation.

40|$|The {{possible}} role of collagen in texture {{variations among}} Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) grown under commercial conditions at a Norwegian farm was studied. The texture was determined instrumentally as the <b>breaking</b> <b>strength,</b> and collagen and its salt (SSC), acid (ASC), pepsin (PSC) and insoluble (IF) fractions were analysed {{in order to}} determine the collagen aggregation degree. The collagen solubility and its overall amino acid (AA) composition showed no correlation to the <b>breaking</b> <b>strength,</b> but a positive correlation was observed between the <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> and glycine (r = 0. 74) and alanine (r = 0. 87) contents of the PSC fraction. Salmon with high <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> had higher T peak (temperature of transition) and ΔH (enthalpy of transition), and the collagen seemed to have triple helix structures mainly stabilized by covalent associations as compared to salmon with low <b>breaking</b> <b>strength.</b> The glycosylation degree was also positively correlated to the <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> (r = 0. 88, p ≤ 0. 05).

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effects of number of washings, curing time and heat treatment on the <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> of no-bake chromite sand-furan resin cores. The Hevi chromite sand produced by a single stage washing of chromite sand was found to exhibit lower <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> in service. Forty five samples of no-bake chromite sand mixes were prepared with furan resin at room temperature and 39 % humidity from chromite sand washed in single and two stages and cured at 2, 4 and 24 hours. Eighteen of the samples washed in single and two stages were tested for <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> without heat treatment, while the 27 obtained from single stage washing sand mix were heated to 900 oC and held at 12, 14 and 16 minutes before cooling.

The results obtained showed that highest <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> occurred in heat treated and cured samples with the highest occurring at curing period of 24 hours and 900 oC with holding time of 16 minutes. For re-washed samples held in room atmosphere, there was a decrease in <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> compared to the single stage washed samples. The implication of this work is that Hevi chromite sand has better <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> when heat treated at 900 °C and held in the temperature for 16 minutes.

At the end of the 3 rd, 6 th, 9 th and 11 th laying month, approximately 40 hens were randomly chosen from each housing system and slaughtered (478 hens in total). Humerus and tibia strengths were analysed using a three-point-bending machine. Keel bone status was evaluated on a scale from 1 (severe) to 4 (no deformity). Shell <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> was measured every four weeks, totalling 4, 887 eggs. Statistical analyses were performed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Humerus and tibia strengths of LS layers housed in SG were significantly higher compared to LS hens kept in FC. Bone <b>breaking</b> <b>strengths</b> of humerus and tibia in LS and LT layers were highest in the aviary system and the differences to the other housing systems were significant. No significant differences in tibia and humerus bone <b>breaking</b> <b>strengths</b> were found between SG and FC for LT hens.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the effect of}} freezing and thawing on the flesh quality of the cultured carp (Cyprinus carpio) during storage in ice, we examined the changes in ATP related compounds (K values %), expressible water (%), <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> (N/cm 2) and histological observation. During storage in ice, the increasing speed of K value in the freeze-thawing group was 1. 6 -fold higher than the unfrozen group. In addition, the rate of expressible water in the freeze-thawing group was higher than the unfrozen group through the storage period, implying that the ice crystals produced by frozen were melted and effluxed to extracellular space. The <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> after freezing and thawing was {{lower than that of}} the unfrozen. Although the <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> of the unfrozen group was decreased with storage in ice, the <b>breaking</b> <b>strength</b> of the freeze-thawing group remained at low level until the end of storage period. These results suggest that the freezing and thawing processes deteriorate the flesh quality through the increase in the incresing ratio of K value and expressible water, and a decrease in <b>breaking</b> <b>strength.</b> 本研究では，養殖コイを用いて未凍結群と凍結融解群を作製し，K値，圧出水分，破断強度，氷結晶の形成からみた凍結融解による魚筋肉の品質に及ぼす影響を検討した。未凍結群と凍結融解群のK値 40 ％レベルまでのK値上昇率を求めたところ，凍結融解群は未凍結群よりも平均値レベルで 1. 6 倍高かった。また圧出水分量は，凍結融解群では平均値レベルで常に未凍結群より高値を示し，特に保存初期（氷蔵０日目）では約２倍高かった。これは凍結により生じた氷結晶が融解し，細胞外に流出したためと考えられた。一方で破断強度は，凍結融解群では，保存初期（氷蔵０日目）から平均値レベルで未凍結群の６割程度の低値しか示さず，その後も同程度の低値であった。これは凍結で生じた氷結晶により細胞が破壊された影響によるものと考えられた。以上，本研究から，魚筋肉では凍結融解すると未凍結よりもK値上昇が速くなり，圧出水分が増え，破断強度が低下することが明らかとなった。すなわち，凍結融解した魚筋肉は鮮度低下が速くなるうえ，肉質が軟らかくなるという肉質劣化が起こると考察された...|$|R
