5|$|In 1953 {{he became}} {{only the third}} Australian in {{a quarter of a}} century to score 2,000 runs on an Ashes tour. Bradman (three times) and Stan McCabe were the others. He made 2,040 at 65.80 and his ten centuries <b>were</b> <b>twice</b> that of the next best in the side.|$|E
5|$|Canberra {{has one of}} {{the highest}} rates of active travel of all Australian major cities, with 7.1percent of commuters walking or cycling to work in 2011. An ACT Government survey {{conducted}} in late 2010 found that Canberrans walk an average of 26minutes each day. According to The Canberra Times in March2014, Canberra's cyclists are involved in an average of four reported collisions every week. The newspaper also reported that Canberra is home to 87,000 cyclists, translating to the highest cycling participation rate in Australia; and, with higher popularity, bike injury rates in 2012 <b>were</b> <b>twice</b> the national average.|$|E
5|$|On 11 December 1971, {{the bridge}} opened for traffic, {{and on the}} same day, the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry was terminated. In February 1972, there <b>were</b> <b>twice</b> as many cars as there {{had been on the}} ferry in February 1971. The {{official}} opening by King Olav V took place on 25 May 1972. The bridge cost NOK39.8 million to construct. This included NOK650,000 for the county road between Knarrevik and Brattholmen, which had been paid for by the state. The cost the company had to pay was NOK23.45 million. The final estimates for the project were for NOK34 million, and the whole cost above this was covered by the state. When it opened, the bridge was the longest in Norway.|$|E

5000|$|Aristides Quintilianus (writing {{probably}} in the 3rd century AD) enumerates the incomposite intervals: [...] "the smallest, so far as their use in melody is concerned, is the enharmonic diesis, followed—to speak rather roughly—by the semitone, which <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> the diesis, the tone, which <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> the semitone, and finally the ditone, which <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> the tone".|$|R

5|$|A later report {{covering}} the use the Tallboy bomb {{was able to}} directly compare {{the performance of the}} Mk. XIV and SABS in similar mission profiles. Eliminating bombs that fell far from the target as gross errors, those that fell near the target <b>were</b> <b>twice</b> as close to it when using SABS. Additionally, the number of gross errors with the Mk. XIV was double that of the SABS. The report noted that this additional accuracy did not confer any sort of superiority because the Mk. XIV's tactical freedom in terms of manoeuvring offset any advantage when a long bomb run was not possible. They also noted that a mission using SABS to drop bombs on a target marker would not be any more accurate than the Mk. XIV.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{combined}} {{data from}} SAMHSA's 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use & Health, {{the rate of}} past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% {{of those who did}} not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males <b>were</b> <b>twice</b> as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{the rear of}} the Grosvenor Road End was cordoned off as cracks had {{appeared}} in the rear wall, and this section of the ground was later segregated and allocated to away supporters. Extensive improvements were made over the mid 1980s, including new turnstiles, refurbished dressing rooms, new referees' changing room and physiotherapist's treatment room being readied, hospitality boxes being built to the Main Stand and crash barriers being strengthened. The David Longhurst Stand was constructed over the summer of 1991, and was named after the York player who collapsed and died from heart failure in a match a year earlier. It provided covered accommodation for supporters in what was previously the Shipton Street End, and was officially opened for a friendly match against Leeds United. In June 1995, new floodlights were installed, which <b>were</b> <b>twice</b> as powerful as the original floodlights.|$|E

5|$|Fantastic Adventures was {{initially}} published in bedsheet format, {{the same size}} as the early sf magazines such as Amazing, perhaps in order to attract fans who were nostalgic for the larger format. It started as a bimonthly, but in January 1940 began a monthly schedule. Sales were weaker than for Amazing, however, and with the June issue the schedule reverted to bimonthly. The size was also reduced to a standard pulp format, since that was cheaper to produce. Sales did not improve, and Ziff-Davis planned to make the October issue the last one. That issue carried Robert Moore Williams' Jongor of Lost Land, and had a cover by J. Allen St. John; the combination proved to be so popular that October sales <b>were</b> <b>twice</b> the August figures. This convinced Ziff-Davis that the magazine was viable, and it was restarted in January 1941as a bimonthly at first, but switching to monthly again in May of that year.|$|E
5|$|Paskevich, who {{observed}} the artillery duel from Fort 55, {{became convinced that}} his Polish counterpart would {{not come to the}} rescue of Fort 56. Initially hesitant, he finally ordered Russian infantry to attack Fort 56 around 10:00. The attack was carried out by 13 infantry battalions (ca. 6,900 men) from columns commanded by General Lüders and Martinov. The forces of Lüders stormed the obstacles and crossed the stockade, but Polish defenders met them with rifle volleys from within the fort, and the attack was repelled. Lüders quickly ordered his second line (2,300 men) to advance as well. The new forces <b>were</b> <b>twice</b> pushed back into the moat by the commander of the northern wing, Maj. Franciszek Biernacki, but in the end the Polish defenders were overpowered and had to withdraw further into the fort. The Russians followed, but their battalions lost cohesion, which allowed the numerically inferior force under Biernacki to hold out inside the fort and cover the flank of the central wing.|$|E
5|$|The Family Stand {{was opened}} in the Main Stand in 1992, and manager John Ward ran the London Marathon to help raise funds for the project. Bootham Crescent first hosted a {{play-off}} match when York beat Bury 1–0 on 19 May 1993 in the Third Division play-off semi-final; the attendance of 9,206 was the ground's highest in seven years. During 1993–94 the Main Stand paddock was seated and covered, and the recent work to the stand cost £220,000. The ground's capacity fell to 9,459, including seating for 3,645, after the renovations to the David Longhurst and Main Stands. In May 1995, a new drainage system was installed for £11,000, {{to improve the quality}} of the pitch during winter. New floodlights were installed in June 1995 at a cost of £122,000, and despite being shorter in height <b>were</b> <b>twice</b> as powerful as the original floodlights. A water tower was installed in the late 1990s, to further help the pitch quality.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 31 July, 3rd Battalion {{proceeded}} east on the Mt. Tenjo road towards the island capital of Agana, which it liberated the same day after token resistance. By 1045, 15minutes after its platoons entered the city, 3rd Battalion had reached the central plaza and stopped at the northern outskirts by noon. Resuming the offensive at 1545, 3rd Battalion pushed forward 1,500yards to seize key road junctions {{that led to the}} towns of Finegayan and Barrigada. For the remaining ten days of the campaign, the battalion marched northeast up the coast, encountering occasional Japanese resistance, until the island was declared secure on 10 August. However, the Japanese were not totally defeated. On 7 August, as 3rd Battalion led the regimental advance towards Road Junction 460, Japanese artillery shells began landing among the advancing Marines. After Marines discovered the source of fire, a 75mm artillery piece, the Japanese fled. The final action by 3rd Battalion during the campaign was on 9 August when a nearby battalion came under heavy Japanese tank and infantry attack. Blazing a trail through the jungle, 3rd Battalion rushed towards the action but the Japanese tanks vanished before the battalion could arrive. Casualties for the 3rd Battalion <b>were</b> <b>twice</b> that of Bougainville, with 300 wounded and 97 killed.|$|E

2500|$|With {{respect to}} the base plane the slope of a face (2) <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> that of an edge (...) , {{corresponding}} {{to the fact that}} the horizontal distance covered from the base to the apex along an edge <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> that along the median of a face. In other words, if C is the centroid of the base, the distance from C to a vertex of the base <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> that from C to the midpoint of an edge of the base. This follows from the fact that the medians of a triangle intersect at its centroid, and this point divides each of them in two segments, one of which <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> as long as the other (see [...] ).|$|R
