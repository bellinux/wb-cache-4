Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.|$|E
5|$|Lilly van Java (Lily of Java), {{also known}} as Melatie van Java (Jasmine of Java), is a 1928 film from the Dutch East Indies {{directed}} by Nelson Wong. Initially meant to be produced by South Sea Film and shot by an American director, the film– which follows a <b>woman</b> <b>told</b> to marry a man she does not love– was ultimately completed by Wong's Halimoen Film. Details on its cast and performance are contradictory, although the film is recognised as {{the first of a}} long series of ethnic Chinese-produced films in the country. It is likely a lost film.|$|E

Bailey and four other black youths tried to enter the party at about 11:00p.m. According to U.S. Attorney Washington, they were told by a woman that no one was allowed inside without an invitation. The youths persisted, stating that some friends were already at the party. A white male, who was not a student, moved in front of the woman and a fight ensued. After the fight broke up, the <b>woman</b> <b>told</b> both the white male and the black {{students}} to leave the party. Once outside, the black students were involved in another fight with a group of white males who were not students. Justin Sloan, a white male, was charged with battery {{for his role in the}} fight and was put on probation. Bailey later said that one of the white males broke a beer bottle over his head, but there are no records of Bailey receiving medical treatment.|$|E

[...] Daisuke Miyao, in The Oxford Handbook of Japanese Cinema, states that the film and its narrative of a religion collision [...] "emphasize the difficulty for a Japanese woman to become submissive to Christianity and the American family system", stating that the film is first and foremost [...] "an archetypal fable pitting the civilized West, embodied by an American sailor, against the primitive East, embodied by the Japanese <b>woman,</b> <b>told</b> as a religious battle between Buddhism and Christianity".|$|E
500|$|The beach films led a wave {{of films}} that made the bikini pop-culture symbol. In the sexual {{revolution}} in 1960s America, bikinis became quickly popular. Hollywood stars like Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, Gina Lollobrigida, and Jane Russell helped further {{the growing popularity of}} bikinis. Pin-up posters of Monroe, Mansfield, Hayworth, Bardot and Raquel Welch also contributed significantly to its increasing popularity. In 1962, Playboy featured a bikini on its cover for the first time. Two years later, Sports Illustrated featured Berlin-born fashion model Babette March on the cover wearing a white bikini. The issue was the first Swimsuit Issue. It gave the bikini legitimacy, became an annual publication and an American pop-culture staple, and sells millions of copies each year. In 1965, a <b>woman</b> <b>told</b> Time it was [...] "almost square" [...] not to wear one. In 1967 the magazine wrote that 65% of [...] "the young set" [...] were wearing bikinis.|$|E

[...] The British Journal reported that on 7January 1727 she appeared at the Courts of Quarter Sessions at Westminster, charged [...] "for being an abominable cheat and imposter in pretending to be delivered of several monstrous births". [...] Margaret Toft had remained staunch, and refused to comment further. [...] Mist's Weekly Journal of 24December 1726 reported that [...] "the nurse has been examined as to the person's concerned with her, but either was kept in the dark as to the imposition, or is not willing to disclose what she knows; for nothing can be got from her; so that her resolution shocks others." ...|$|E

500|$|James {{had several}} unique {{experiences}} while {{living with the}} Smith family in Nauvoo. She recorded that often, as she went about doing the washing and cleaning for the Smiths, either Emma (Joseph's wife) or Lucy (Joseph's mother) would stop her and talk with her. One day while James was in Joseph's mother's room, the <b>woman</b> <b>told</b> her to [...] "bring me that bundle from the bureau and sit down here." [...] According to Jane, she was shown the Urim and Thummim, the tools used by Joseph Smith to translate the Book of Mormon. Lucy then said to her, [...] "You will live long after I am dead and gone {{and you can tell}} the Latter-day Saints that you was permitted to handle the Urim and Thummim". Another time, Emma asked James if she would like to be adopted by and sealed to her and Joseph. Not understanding at the time, James said nothing. Emma encouraged her to think about it. Two weeks later, she asked James again, at which time she said [...] "no m'am". James would say later that she did not understand what that meant, or she would have taken the couple up on their offer. This early decision {{had a significant impact on}} James' later life as a member of the Latter Day Saint church.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian <b>woman</b> <b>told</b> the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} many claimants to the poem's authorship, {{including}} attributions to traditional and Native American origins. Dear Abby author Abigail Van Buren researched the poem's history and concluded in 1998 that Mary Elizabeth Frye, who was living in Baltimore at the time, had written the poem in 1932. According to Van Buren's research, Frye had never written any poetry, but the plight of a German Jewish woman, Margaret Schwarzkopf, who was staying with her and her husband, had inspired the poem. Margaret Schwarzkopf was concerned about her mother, who was ill in Germany, {{but she had been}} warned not to return home because of increasing unrest. When her mother died, the heartbroken young <b>woman</b> <b>told</b> Frye that she never had the chance to [...] "stand by my mother's grave and shed a tear". Frye, according to Van Buren's research, found herself composing a piece of verse on a brown paper shopping bag.

Over a week later, streets in eastern Queens still had remained unplowed by the city, enraging the borough's residents, many who felt that the city's other boroughs always took a back seat to Manhattan. Lindsay traveled to Queens, but his visit was not well received. His car could not make its way through Rego Park, and even in a four-wheel-drive truck, he had trouble getting around.
