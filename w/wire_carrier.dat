DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for cohesively joining two metallic connection structures each having a planar or curved contact area region, which has a contact area with elevated microstructure elements that is assignable to the contact area region, comprises mutually contacting the two connection structures {{in such a way that}} material bonds form between the microstructure elements and the opposite connection structure, providing the microstructure elements on the contact area of the connection structure in the form of crystallites, which are elevated orthogonally with respect to the contact area, are formed like lines of ribs and with steep flanks and have a sharp-edged rib burr, where the arrangement of the contact area and formation in terms of form and size are subjected to stochastic distribution, and joining together the two connection structures in such a way that the microstructure elements of one of the connection structures contacted by their rib burrs with the contact area region of the other connection structure. The crystallites have a triangle-like base form in a cutting plane oriented orthogonal to the contact area, mutually touch or penetrate through along their respective rib lines, and provide by triangularly characterizable burr points locally along their rib burr in each case. The burr points have a point fillet with a radius of smaller than 1 mu m. The microstructure elements provided on the contact area of the connection structure have an average element height of 0. 5 - 10 mu m against the contact area. The crystallites have a rib longitudinal extension of 100 mu m at their basis in the region of the contact area and a rib thickness of up to 25 mu m. A surface portion conditioned by the rib burr at the entire contact area per connection structure is 20 %. The crystallites include a burr angle (alpha) of smaller than 60 degrees, where the burr angle is included by two crystal flanks. The microstructure elements are obtained in a way of direct galvanic deposition directly or indirectly on a substrate surface. The substrate surface consists of an electrically conductive material and/or is coated with an electrically conductive layer. The microstructure elements are deposited on the substrate surface or on the electrically conductive layer. The crystallites consist of metallurgical composition. The joining of the two connection structures takes place in a force-actuated manner, so that parts of the microstructure elements provided on one of the connection structures subject a deformation and/or penetrate with their rib burr into the other connection structure. The microstructure elements partially and mutually penetrate through the connection structures in case of providing the microstructure elements on the both connection structures during joining. The force-actuated joining of both connection structures is supported by ultrasonic introduction and/or thermal energy introduction into the joining area between the connection structures. The connection structures are formed for surface connection between the following components such as electronic components, integrated circuits, rigid or flexible <b>wiring</b> <b>carrier</b> in the form of a ceramic substrate, a printed circuit board or a flexible polymer substrate.

Device physics simulations of lightly doped n-Si wires in radial contact with the 1, 1 ′-dimethylferrocene^(+/ 0) –CH_(3) OH redox system showed that the carrier-collection efficiency should be a strong function of the wire diameter and the carrier lifetime within the wire.

The aim of the diploma work has been to simulate the heat transfer on a hydrogen gas sensor component and its closest surroundings consisting of a carrier mounted on a printed circuit board.

The prominent lymphotropism of vCJD prions raises the possibility that some surgical procedures may be at risk of iatrogenic vCJD transmission in healthcare facilities. It is therefore vital that decontamination procedures applied to medical devices before their reprocessing are thoroughly validated.
