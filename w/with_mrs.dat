5|$|In {{addition}} to his deformities, {{at some point during}} his childhood, Merrick suffered a fall and damaged his left hip. This injury became infected and left him permanently lame. Although affected by his physical deformities, Merrick attended school and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother. She was a Sunday school teacher, and his father worked as an engine driver at a cotton factory, as well as running a haberdashery business. On 29 May 1873, less than three years after the death of her youngest son William, Mary Jane Merrick died from bronchopneumonia. Joseph Rockley Merrick moved with his two children to live <b>with</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Emma Wood Antill, a widow with children of her own. They married on 3 December 1874.|$|E
5|$|In the {{regional}} finals on March 31 against Florida, Michigan built a 13–0 lead and never led {{by less than}} 10 {{the rest of the}} game. Several players had career-highs in the game: Stauskas with 6 three-point shots, Burke 8 rebounds, McGary 5 steals and off the bench Albrecht 7 points and 3 steals. Eight of McGary's 11 points came as Michigan built the initial 13–0 lead and 5 of Stauskas' 6 three-pointers came as Michigan built a 41–17 lead and closed the half with a 47–30 lead. Burke was named South Regional Tournament Most Outstanding Player. McGary and Stauskas joined Burke on the five-man South All-Regional team.

5|$|Queen Adelaide {{attended}} the dying William devotedly, {{not going to}} bed herself {{for more than ten}} days. William IV died {{in the early hours of}} the morning of 20 June 1837 at Windsor Castle, where he was buried. As he had no living legitimate issue, the Crown of the United Kingdom passed to Princess Victoria of Kent, the only child of Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, George III's fourth son. Under Salic Law, a woman could not rule Hanover, and so the Hanoverian Crown went to George III's fifth son, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland. William's death thus ended the personal union of Britain and Hanover, which had persisted since 1714. The main beneficiaries of his will were his eight surviving children by Mrs. Jordan. Although William IV is not the direct ancestor of the later monarchs of the United Kingdom, he has many notable descendants through his illegitimate family <b>with</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Jordan, including former Prime Minister David Cameron, TV presenter Adam Hart-Davis, author and statesman Duff Cooper, and the first Duke of Fife, who married Queen Victoria's granddaughter Louise.|$|E

40|$|Objective : Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) is {{very rarely}} {{observed}} after ischaemic stroke. Sodium valproate (SV) {{is one of}} the agents used in the treatment of CSE, but its role still controversial, and its degree of efficacy in treating CSE that develops following stroke is unclear. Method : We evaluated 19 patients who were treated with intravenous (IV) SV (20 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg/h- 12 h) after diazepam. Patients&# 8217; modified Rankin scores (mRS), SE types, and changes in biochemical parameters after treatment were assessed. Results : CSE was successfully treated in 12 (63. 15 %) patients. Side effects such as hypotension and allergic reactions were observed in two patients. Refractory SE development was observed in 5 (29. 4 %) patients <b>with</b> high <b>mRS</b> (&# 707; 3). No significant deterioration in patients&# 8217; laboratory evaluations, conducted before and after status, was observed.

40|$|The major repeat {{sequence}} (MRS) {{is found}} {{at least once}} on all but one chromosome in Candida albicans, but as yet it has no known relation to the phenotype. The MRS affects karyotypic variation by serving as a hot spot for chromosome translocation and by expanding and contracting internal repeats, thereby changing chromosome length. Thus, MRSs on different chromosomes and those on chromosome homologues can differ in size. We proposed that the MRS's unique repeat structure and, more specifically, {{the size of the}} MRS could also affect karyotypic variation by altering the frequency of mitotic nondisjunction. Subsequent analysis shows that both natural and artificially induced differences {{in the size of the}} chromosome 5 MRS can affect chromosome segregation. Strains with chromosome 5 homologues that differ in the size of the naturally occurring MRSs show a preferential loss of the homologue <b>with</b> the larger <b>MRS</b> on sorbose, indicating that a larger MRS leads to a higher risk of mitotic nondisjunction for that homologue. While deletion of an MRS has no deleterious effect on the deletion chromosome under normal growth conditions and leads to no obvious phenotype, strains that have the MRS deleted from one chromosome 5 homologue preferentially lose the homologue <b>with</b> the <b>MRS</b> remaining. This effect on chromosome segregation is the first demonstration of a phenotype associated <b>with</b> the <b>MRS...</b>|$|R

5|$|Adapted from The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens, {{the film}} has been {{shortened}} and streamlined for the single reel format. The film focuses on a grandfather who gambles himself into poverty. He dotes on his granddaughter, Little Nell, and desires to give her every luxury. The grandfather turns to gambling to try and earn money, firmly believing that luck would favor him. His gambling results in losing everything and Nell fears {{that he will be}} taken away to an asylum. At night, Nell flees with him and they find refuge and shelter <b>with</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Jarley. The grandfather, seeking to win money, robs Nell of her money and proceeds to gamble it away. The grandfather is coerced by men to steal to pay the debts, but Nell intervenes and flees with her grandfather again. Exhausted and feeble in health, Nell meets a kind schoolmaster and appeals to him for aid before falling unconscious at his feet. The schoolmaster takes the two in, but it is too late to save Nell and she dies. Her grandfather is brokenhearted and is found dead on her grave several days later.|$|E

Brandon calls on the Dashwoods and explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced then abandoned his young ward, Eliza Williams, who has given birth to his child. Mrs. Ferrars (Jean Marsh) learns of Edward's engagement to Lucy and threatens to disinherit him unless he calls it off, but Edward refuses. Brandon later offers him a living on his estate at Delaford, which Edward gladly accepts. While staying <b>with</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Jennings' daughter, Marianne goes walking in a storm and collapses. Brandon finds her and brings her home, where she falls seriously ill with a fever. During Marianne's recovery, Willoughby comes to talk with Elinor. He insists that he loved Marianne and would have married her, {{but he had to}} marry a rich woman because his aunt disowned him after learning of his behaviour toward Eliza. After Marianne recovers, the sisters return home and Marianne begins spending time at Delaford, eventually falling in love with Brandon. Elinor learns that Lucy Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars, and assumes that Lucy and Edward have married. However, Edward arrives at the cottage and explains to the Dashwoods that Lucy has wed his brother Robert (Leo Bill). Edward then declares his love to Elinor and proposes. They marry, as do Marianne and Brandon.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, {{however, the}} son, Clarence, {{repeated}} {{the story and}} published a book in the United States, My Uncle George V, in which he claimed {{he was born in}} London in September 1890, about nine months after Albert Victor's meeting <b>with</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Haddon. In 1933, he was charged with demanding money with menace and attempted extortion after writing to the King asking for hush money. At his trial the following January, the prosecution produced documents showing that Haddon's enlistment papers, marriage certificate, officer's commission, demobilisation papers and employment records all showed he was born in or before 1887, at least two years before Albert Victor met Mrs. Haddon. Haddon was found guilty and the judge, believing Haddon to be suffering from delusions, did not jail him but bound him over for three years on the condition that he made no claim that he was Albert Victor's son. Haddon breached the conditions and was jailed for a year. Dismissed as a crank, he died a broken man. Even if Haddon's claim had been true, as with other royal illegitimacies, it would have made no difference to the royal line of succession.|$|E

However, the midterm outcome for patients undergoing this procedure varies considerably with baseline characteristics. To determine the impact of baseline characteristics on outcomes following carotid artery stenting, data from 107 eligible patients with a first episode of ischemic stroke were collected by retrospective chart review. A modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to divide patients into two baseline groups, mRS ≤ 2 and mRS > 2. A three-step decision-tree statistical analysis was conducted. After weighting the decision-tree parameters, the following impact hierarchy was obtained: admission low-density lipoprotein, gouty arthritis, chronic kidney disease, ipsilateral common carotid artery resistance index, contralateral ophthalmic artery resistance index, sex, and dyslipidemia. The finite-state machine model demonstrated that, in patients <b>with</b> baseline <b>mRS</b> ≤ 2, 46 % had an improved mRS score at follow-up, whereas 54 % had a stable mRS score. In patients <b>with</b> baseline <b>mRS</b> > 2, a stable mRS score was observed in 75 %, improved score in 23 %, and a poorer score in 2 %. Admission low-density lipoprotein was the strongest predictive factor influencing poststenting outcome. In addition, our study provides further evidence that carotid artery stenting can be of benefit in first-time ischemic stroke patients <b>with</b> baseline <b>mRS</b> scores > 2.

STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-one healthy term neonates with documented fetal inflammatory response after maternal chorioamnionitis underwent {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} (<b>MRS),</b> <b>with</b> voxels placed in basal ganglia (BG) and frontal white matter. Bayley III examinations were performed at 12 months of age. RESULT: Infants with below average outcomes did not show the same increase in NAA/Cho ratios postnatally as the group with normal outcomes. Decreased NAA/Cho and increased Lac/Cr in BG correlated with lower motor and cognitive composite scores, respectively, controlling for postnatal age. In males, increased lactate/NAA in BG were associated with lower motor scores. Funisitis severity was associated with decreased NAA/Cho and increased mI/NAA in males.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{clinical}} efficacy and safety of mechanically assisted thrombolysis in the treatment of acute cerebral infarction. Mechanically assisted intra-arterial urokinase thrombolysis was conducted on 28 patients with acute cerebral infarction with a disease onset time of 90 - 450 min. The maximum level of urokinase was 1, 150, 000 units. Thrombus disruption with a microwire, retrieval with a microcatheter and stent-assisted revascular-ization were performed. The recanalization rate, bleeding complications and modified Rankin scale (mRS) score were observed within 3 months of surgery. Our results showed that mechanically assisted thrombolysis was successfully conducted on 23 patients, with a recanalization rate of 82. 1 % (23 / 28), average recanalization time of 65. 22 min and mRS score ≤ 3. 5. Five cases of recanalization were invalid, including 2 cases of mortality, 1 case <b>with</b> an <b>mRS</b> score of 4 and 2 cases <b>with</b> an <b>mRS</b> score ≤ 3. In the recanalization group, the mechanically assisted thrombolysis did not increase the number of bleeding complications. Our study demonstrated that the safety of mechanically assisted thrombolysis for the treatment of acute cerebral infarction is equivalent to that of simple intra-arterial thrombolysis, but that the former has a higher efficiency. Mechanically assisted thrombolysis is able to reduce the urokinase dosage and recanalization time, and increase the recanalization rate...|$|R
