Para tanto, utilizamos uma metodologia qualitativa embasada nos princípios da fenomenologia existencial. Para o estudo, inquirimos nove mães que estavam com seus filhos internados em uma UTI neonatal, no período de abril a julho do ano de 2004, com a seguinte questão norteadora: O que você sentiu ao ver o seu filho nascer prematuro? A partir de leituras atentivas dos depoimentos, emergiram três categorias: temor ante a sua facticidade existencial; angústia perante a situação vivenciada pelo filho; sentimentos de esperança avivados pela fé. Este estudo nos fez compreender que escutar e olhar atentamente tornam-se instrumentos imprescindíveis para que a equipe de saúde compreenda as mães de crianças prematuras em suas singularidades. Dessa forma, seremos capazes de assisti-las autenticamente, de uma forma mais humana e efetiva, auxiliando no fortalecimento da relação entre mãe e filho The {{study is}} to {{understand}} the existentiality of the premature newborn mothers that need assistance in a neonatal intensive care unit.

This construct {{has been found to}} emerge once a child reaching three to four years of age and continues to develop until adolescence. Müge Artar conducted a study comparing adolescents identified as having higher levels of egocentrism with adolescents exhibiting more emotional inference and looked into their relationships with their parents. An adolescent's ability to infer a family member's thoughts is considered an important developmental stage. Social-emotional questions were based on the adolescents’ understanding of their mother and father’s beliefs. Participants were asked questions such as “When you have problems with your mother/father, what does your mother/father feel? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel?</b> Does your mother/father think what you feel?” [...] Most of the adolescents perceived their relationship with parents relevantly and also accurately perceived images about family network.|$|E

40|$|A Clinical Paper {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Nursing-Family Nurse PractitionerCurrently, two {{out of every three}} Americans are overweight or obese. Healthcare providers frequently recommend dieting as a primary obesity intervention despite the lack of empirical evidence demonstrating its long term effectiveness (Yaskin, Toner, & Goldfarb, 2009). Few nursing researchers have explored the experiences of obese people with dieting. The purpose of this qualitative, descriptive {{study was to examine the}} attitudes of obese women toward dieting, their experiences with dieting, and what they felt would assist them in improving their health and wellness. The theoretical framework for this study was based on the Neuman Systems Model (Neuman & Fawcett, 2002). Participants were recruited from a patient population who sought healthcare services from a bariatric clinic in the Midwest. Informed consent and a demographic questionnaire were completed prior to each interview. Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. The following questions were asked; 1) What has been your experience with dieting? 2) <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> were positive aspects of the dieting programs? 3) <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> perceive to be barriers to long term weight loss maintenance with the dieting programs? 4) What would be helpful to you now in dealing with your obesity? Data analysis incorporated Spiegelberg's (1965) three-step process of 1) intuiting, 2) analyzing, and 3) describing. Colaizzi's (1978) method of analysis was used to develop an exhaustive description of the phenomenon of dieting experiences of adult women. The following themes emerged after data analysis: (a) If at first you don't succeed, try,try, and fail again; (b) Recognizing the problem is easy; finding a solution is difficult; (c) The great dieting barriers: stress and emotion; and (d) Exercise is a four letter word. The primary implications for advanced nursing practice included the importance of treating the obese woman with a holistic approach, as well as development of an individualized plan of care to assist her in achieving increased health and wellness. Understanding the limitations of dieting for many obese patients reinforces the need for practitioners to explore alternative interventions for future obesity management...|$|R

The sample was comprised by 25 women in the age group from 18 to 59 years, users of the Mother-Child Health Center in Barbalha-CE-Brazil. Data collection happened between May and June 2009 using semi-structured interviews with the following guiding questions: What {{do you know about}} the purpose of the preventive examination of uterine cervical cancer? What made you seek the health unit to perform this examination? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> when you undergo the examination? Data were analyzed based on the subjects’ speeches categorization, and later discussed according to the literature concerning the subject. Results: The investigation showed that the subjects {{understand the}} preventive examination with a healing perspective, since most seek the service facing some symptoms; shame and fear are the main expressed feelings concerning the examination. These factors can contribute to the non adherence to Pap test. Conclusion: The women interviewed showed to have superficial and often wrong knowledge on the examination of cervical cancer. This reveals the need for re-orientation of health services focusing on health promotion, providing the users knowledge and awareness to act as jointly responsible for their health, by adhering to the examination and probably reducing the number of cases of uterine cervical cancer...|$|E

The points were selected purposefully so we could guide students in their thinking by testing the forces felt at each of the designated locations. Students first tested the forces felt at each location independently, and they were then prompted to compare them. For each point (i.e., locations A, B, and C), and for each charge configuration, students were asked to report their thinking by answering the following questions: What are your initial observations? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel?</b> How do you interpret the force in point X in the context of the visualization? To elicit students’ comparisons of the forces felt at the three points, students were then asked: What is the difference or relationship between the forces felt at points A, B and C (do they increase or decrease, and at what rate?) Finally, students were prompted to explore the effect of changing the sign of the test charge and report their observations about variations in the force exerted on it by the different charge distributions: Press ‘N’ to change the charge of the test point charge from positive to negative.

Previous studies of the HRQOL using the WHOQOL-BREF mainly focused on adult; however, there has been less work carried out on assessing the HRQOL on early adolescence. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine the applicability of the WHOQOL-BREF Taiwan version in early adolescent sample. A total of 365 junior high school students participated in this study. Participants completed the WHOQOL-BREF Taiwan version and five visual-analogue items on HRQOL evaluation. The results supported the originally designed four-factor model, and also indicated good item discrimination, internal reliability, factorial validity (by using confirmatory factor analysis) and construct validity (e. g., predictive validity, discriminant and convergent validity) after deleting two physical health items (i. e., “To <b>what</b> extent <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that your pain hinders <b>you</b> in <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> need to do”; “Do you need medical treatment to cope with your daily life?”) and one social relationships item (i. e., “Are you satisfied with your sex life?”). Overall, this study provides the applicability of the WHOQOL-BREF Taiwan version in early adolescence. In addition, the WHOQOL-BREF Taiwan version may be of use to health professionals in the assessment and comparison of different age groups from early adolescence to adulthood...|$|R
