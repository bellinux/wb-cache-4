For example, the historian Robert Hartwell has estimated that per capita iron output rose sixfold between 806 and 1078, such that, by 1078 China was producing 127000000kg (125,000t) in weight of iron per year. However, historian Donald Wagner questions Hartwell's method used to estimate these figures (i.e. by using Song tax and quota receipts).|$|E
5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is that women should be educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E

25|$|Two years later, in 1562, another {{writer from}} the Engadine, Durich Chiampel, {{published}} the Cudesch da Psalms, {{a collection of}} church songs in the Vallader dialect. These early works are generally well written and show that the authors had {{a large amount of}} Romansh vocabulary at their disposal, contrary to <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> expect of the first pieces of writing in a language. Because of this, the linguist Ricarda Liver assumes that these written works built on an earlier, pre-literature tradition of using Romansh in administrative and legal situations, of which no evidence survives. In their prefaces, the authors themselves often mention the novelty of writing Romansh, and discuss an apparently common prejudice that Romansh was a language that could not be written.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{decades have}} revived his secular cantatas and <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> call 'secular oratorios' or 'concert operas'. Of the former, Ode for St. Cecilia's Day (1739) (set to texts by John Dryden) and Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne (1713) are noteworthy. For his secular oratorios, Handel turned to {{classical}} mythology for subjects, producing such works as Acis and Galatea (1719), Hercules (1745) and Semele (1744). These works {{have a close}} kinship with the sacred oratorios, particularly in the vocal writing for the English-language texts. They also share the lyrical and dramatic qualities of Handel's Italian operas. As such, they are sometimes performed onstage by small chamber ensembles. With the rediscovery of his theatrical works, Handel, {{in addition to his}} renown as instrumentalist, orchestral writer, and melodist, is now perceived as being one of opera's great musical dramatists.|$|E

Dalrymple wrote that [...] "the response to the Stephen Lawrence case is another example of how the rule of law is to be supplanted by the rule of sentiment—and it is yet one more instance of <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> call the Dianafication of British public life, in which transitory popular enthusiasm trumps venerable tradition". In a 2004 essay, he analysed how sentimentality towards children was closely linked with violence and neglect, particularly in the poorest sections of British society: [...] "The upbringing of children in much of Britain is a witches' brew of sentimentality, brutality, and neglect, in which overindulgence in the latest fashions, toys, or clothes, and a television in the bedroom are regarded as the highest—indeed only—manifestations of tender concern for a child's welfare".|$|E

500|$|Overall, Viking metal is hard {{to define}} since, apart from certain {{elements}} like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled {{as part of the}} genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, [...] "it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident." [...] Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or [...] "etiquette" [...] than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that [...] "The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly shifting, as trends and fads emerge and fade." [...] From its origins in black metal, Viking metal [...] "has diversified (at least in aural terms), and now covers a range of styles that run the gamut between black metal and <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> justifiably term classic rock".|$|E

Judging from the literature available, migrants’ imagined constructions of their future – as individuals and members of families and broader communities – are quite understudied. This is unfortunate, since revisiting their biographical narratives in this optic can illuminate the subjective and emotional drivers of their life trajectories overseas, under a twofold pressure: the multi-sited relational settings in which their life projects are embedded, and the changing external structures of opportunities.|$|R
5000|$|The term canzone is {{also used}} interchangeably with canzona, an {{important}} Italian instrumental form of the late 16th and early 17th century.

2500|$|A supertaster is {{a person}} whose sense of taste is {{significantly}} more sensitive than average.

However, contrary to <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> think, these people actually tend to consume more salt than the average person.

The range for blast effects increases with the explosive yield of the weapon and also depends on the burst altitude. Contrary to <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> expect from geometry, the blast range is not maximal for surface or low altitude blasts but increases with altitude up to an [...] "optimum burst altitude" [...] and then decreases rapidly for higher altitudes. This is due to the nonlinear behaviour of shock waves. When the blast wave from an air burst reaches the ground it is reflected. Below a certain reflection angle the reflected wave and the direct wave merge and form a reinforced horizontal wave, this is known as the 'Mach stem' (named after Ernst Mach) and is a form of constructive interference.|$|E
