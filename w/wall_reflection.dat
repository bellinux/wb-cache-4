40|$|The {{approaches}} {{developed to}} describe radiative transfer of electron cyclotron (EC) radiation in a plasma in local thermodynamic equilibrium, taking due {{account of the}} nonlocal nature of the process owing to reabsorption and <b>wall</b> <b>reflection,</b> are reviewed. As for a cylindrical plasma with specularly reflecting walls an analytical solution of the equation of radiative transfer can be derived, an exact formula for the net power density radiated locally can be given in this case. Making use of an improved expression for the EC absorption coefficient, a detailed numerical analysis {{can be carried out}} varying both the <b>wall</b> <b>reflection</b> coefficient and the radial profile of the plasma temperature, which reveals that a reversal of the net power density profile can occur on the plasma out-board for sufficiently high wall reflectivity. A comparison with bremsstrahlung radiation profiles as well as approximate EC net power density profiles as calculated with the CYTRAN code developed by Tamor is performed. The total EC radiated power is also evaluated; its scaling with the reflection coefficient is found to be very well described by a scaling following from a recently established global model for the EC radiation, which improves the well-known Trubnikov scaling. The results obtained are discussed in view of their possible relevance to affecting the plasma temperature profile...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low-rank and jointly-sparse approach for imaging stationary targets using multipolarization through-wall radar (TWR). The proposed approach exploits two important characteristics of multichannel TWR signals: low-rank {{structure of the}} <b>wall</b> <b>reflections</b> and jointly-sparse structure of the polarization images. The task of removing <b>wall</b> <b>reflections</b> and reconstructing multichannel images of the same scene behind-the-wall is formulated as a regularized least squares optimization problem, where the low-rank regularization is imposed on the wall returns and the joint-sparsity constraint is enforced on the multichannel images.

40|$|Abstract—Front <b>wall</b> <b>reflections</b> are {{considered}} one of the main challenges in sensing through walls using radar. This is especially true under sparse time-space or frequency-space sam-pling of radar returns which may be required for fast and efficient data acquisition. Unlike homogeneous walls, heterogeneous walls have frequency and space varying characteristics which violate the smooth surface assumption and cause significant residuals under commonly used wall clutter mitigation techniques. In the proposed approach, the phase shift and the amplitude of the <b>wall</b> <b>reflections</b> are estimated from the compressive measurements using a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) procedure. The estimated parameters are used to model electromagnetic (EM) wall returns, which are subsequently subtracted from the total radar returns, rendering wall-reduced and wall-free signals.
