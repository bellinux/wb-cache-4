His upcoming album is currently untitled and expected {{to be released in}} Spring 2012. One of the first singles on his album is [...] "Move On" [...] a semi-biographical song about his transition from cricket to music. [...] Banks explained to Basil Walters of the Jamaica Observer, [...] "In life we tend to go through different ups and downs, {{but the most important thing}} is that <b>we</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> and grow from it. That's what the song is about really. I wrote the song and the music, but on the track itself it has a number of big name musicians like Junior Jazz, Glen Browne, Robbie Lyn and Sly Dunbar. Steven Stanley produced the track." ...|$|E

From there there are three or four passes by which we could pour into Bohemia. Saxony is a rich country, too, and will afford us a fine base for supplies, as <b>we</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> I suppose the Austrians will collect an army to oppose us, in Bohemia. When we have thrashed them, I expect we shall go on straight to Vienna." ...|$|E
6000|$|Civilization does not, I think, {{make the}} race any better. It makes men know more: and if {{knowledge}} makes them happy {{it is useful}} and desirable. The one purpose of every sane human being is to be happy. No one can have any other motive than that. There {{is no such thing}} as unselfishness. We perform the most [...] "generous" [...] and [...] "self-sacrificing" [...] acts because we should be unhappy if we did not. <b>We</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> lines of least reluctance. Whatever tends to increase the beggarly sum of human happiness is worth having; nothing else has any value.|$|E

'And so <b>we</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> Past Chimney Rock we fly--noble {{shaft of}} six hundred feet; then just before landing at Minnieska our {{attention}} is attracted by a most striking promontory rising over five hundred feet--the ideal mountain pyramid. Its conic shape--thickly-wooded surface girding its sides, and its apex {{like that of}} a cone, cause the spectator to wonder at nature's workings. From its dizzy heights superb views of the forests, streams, bluffs, hills and dales below and beyond for miles are brought within its focus. What grander river scenery can be conceived, as we gaze upon this enchanting landscape, from the uppermost point of these bluffs upon the valleys below? The primeval wildness and awful loneliness of these sublime creations of nature and nature's God, excite feelings of unbounded admiration, and the recollection of which can never be effaced from the memory, as we view them in any direction.|$|E

6000|$|All this {{encounter}} is a passage of high invention. The adventures in Anahuac are such as Bishop Erie may have achieved {{when he set}} out to find Vinland the Good, and came back no more, whether he was or was not remembered by the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl. The tale of the wanderers was Mr. Morris's own; all the rest are of the dateless heritage of our race, fairy tales coming to us, now [...] "softly breathed through the flutes of the Grecians," [...] now told by Sagamen of Iceland.

Once more literature has a narrator, on the whole much more akin to Spenser than to Chaucer, Homer, or Sir Walter.

6000|$|For we, {{whatever}} {{our political}} opinions, certainly {{never think of}} our public men like that. If we hold the opinion that Mr. Lloyd George is a noble tribune of the populace and protector of the poor, we do not admit that he can ever have paltered with the truth or bargained with the powerful. If we hold the equally idiotic opinion {{that he is a}} red and rabid Socialist, maddening mobs into mutiny and theft, then we expect him to go on maddening them&mdash;and us. We do not expect him, let us say, suddenly to go into a monastery. We have lost the idea of repentance; especially in public things; that is why we cannot really get rid of our great national abuses of economic tyranny and aristocratic avarice. Progress in the modern sense is a very dismal drudge; and mostly consists of being moved on by the police. <b>We</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> because we are not allowed to move back. But the really ragged prophets, the real revolutionists who held high language in the palaces of kings, they did not confine themselves to saying, [...] "Onward, Christian soldiers," [...] still less, [...] "Onward, Futurist soldiers"; what they said to high emperors and to whole empires was, [...] "Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?" ...|$|E
60|$|The banquet is {{certainly}} the best preparative for the ball, if its blessings be not abused, for then you get heavy. Your true votary of Terpsichore, and of him we only speak, requires, particularly in a land of easterly winds, which cut into his cab-head at every turn of every street, some previous process to make his blood set him an example in dancing. It is strong Burgundy and his sparkling sister champagne that make a race-ball always so amusing a divertissement. One enters {{the room with a}} gay elation which defies rule without violating etiquette, and in these county meetings there is a variety of character, and classes, and manners, which is interesting, and affords an agreeable contrast to those more brilliant and refined assemblies the members of which, being educated by exactly the same system and with exactly the same ideas, think, look, move, talk, dress, and even eat, alike; the only remarkable personage being a woman somewhat more beautiful than the beauties who surround her, and a man rather more original in his affectations than the puppies that surround him. The proof of the general dulness of polite circles is the great sensation that is always produced by a new face. The season always commences briskly, because there are so many. Ball, and dinner, and concert collect then plentiful votaries; but as <b>we</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> the dulness will develop itself, and then come the morning breakfast, and the water party, and the fête champêtre, all desperate attempts to produce variety with old materials, and to occasion a second effect by a cause which is already exhausted.|$|E
