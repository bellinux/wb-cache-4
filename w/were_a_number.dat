5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it.

5|$|Besides, there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> {{of small}} posterns. The heads and limbs of {{executed}} criminals were regularly displayed above the ports. Of the six ports, the Netherbow {{was the only}} one which took the form of a large fortified gateway. Repairs to the Netherbow are recorded in 1538, and a drawing of 1544 shows the Netherbow as a wide arched gate flanked by two round towers. In 1571, the gateway between the towers was rebuilt, and a central clock tower was added above the gateway, topped by an octagonal stone spire. This structure was repaired in the early 17th century.|$|E

To guard against future uprisings, a series of forts were constructed to protect Kuching, including Fort Margherita, completed in 1871. By that time Brooke's control of Sarawak was such that defences were largely unnecessary.|$|E

Historical sources indicate that there were also Jains in Anuradhapura during the reign of Valagamba.|$|E

5|$|For {{hundreds}} of years mining was an important industry for the area, and there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of mines in Midsomer Norton, e.g. Old Mills, Norton Hill, and Welton.

Generations of miners {{who worked in the}} difficult conditions of the local collieries are remembered at the Radstock Museum. The coming of the railways, particularly the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S) in 1874, transformed the conveyance of coal out of the area.|$|E

The approach is based on determination of a consensus relation which is in "nearest distance " from all initial rankings shaped by multiple sensors of each network node. Statistically and probabilistically based analytical models useful for assuring network performance and providing reasonable number values n – k and m are proposed and discussed, where n – k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of packets transmitted to the sink; n <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of the network sensor nodes; k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of dropped packets due to a congestion; and m <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of node sensors (or rankings) ...|$|R
