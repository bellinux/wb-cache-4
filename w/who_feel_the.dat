Opponents include the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, (who question the constitutionality of creating race-based governments), libertarian activists, (who challenge the historical accuracy of any claims of injustice), and other Native Hawaiian sovereignty activists, (<b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> legislation would thwart their hopes for complete independence from the United States).|$|E

500|$|Writing in December 1967, Richard Goldstein of The New York Times {{said that}} [...] "Hello, Goodbye" [...] "sounds like a B-side" [...] and {{described}} it as [...] "interesting but subordinate". In his single review for Melody Maker, Nick Jones wrote: [...] "Superficially it's a very 'ordinary' Beatles record without cascading sitars, and the involved, weaving hallucinogenic sounds that we've grown to love so much. However, all the Beatles soul and feeling is shining through..." [...] More impressed, Derek Johnson of the NME welcomed the simplicity of [...] "Hello, Goodbye", describing it as [...] "Supremely commercial, {{and the answer to}} those <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>The</b> Beatles are going too way out".|$|E
500|$|Whatever the privations, the St Kildans were {{fortunate}} in some respects, for their isolation spared them {{some of the}} evils of life elsewhere. Martin noted in 1697 that the citizens seemed [...] "happier than the generality of mankind as being almost {{the only people in}} the world <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> sweetness of true liberty", and in the 19th century their health and well being was contrasted favourably with conditions elsewhere in the Hebrides. Theirs was not a utopian society; the islanders had ingenious wooden locks for their property, and financial penalties were exacted for misdemeanours. Nonetheless, no resident St Kildan is known to have fought in a war, and in four centuries of history, no serious crime committed by an islander was recorded there.|$|E
500|$|Barney herself {{contributed a}} chapter to Idylle Saphique {{in which she}} {{described}} reclining at de Pougy's feet in a screened box at the theater, watching Sarah Bernhardt's play Hamlet. During intermission, Barney (as [...] "Flossie") compares Hamlet's plight with that of women: [...] "What is there for women <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> passion for action when pitiless Destiny holds them in chains? Destiny made us women {{at a time when}} the law of men is the only law that is recognized." [...] She also wrote Lettres à une Connue (Letters to a Woman I Have Known), her own epistolary novel about the affair. Although Barney failed to find a publisher for the book and later called it naïve and clumsy, it is notable for its discussion of homosexuality, which Barney regarded as natural and compared to albinism. [...] "My queerness," [...] she said, [...] "is not a vice, is not deliberate, and harms no one." ...|$|E

500|$|Christensen {{points out}} that [...] "although there is no {{evidence}} that Lord Byron, padrone and amico, was ever so vulgar as to set an exact market value on his sexual arrangements in Greece, Nicolo Giraud, Eustathius's replacement in Byron's affections, was employed as 'dragoman and Major Domo', a position that almost certainly entailed payment in love and money". D. L. MacDonald's 1986 biography simply describes Giraud as [...] "The great love of Byron's Eastern tour", and D. S. Neff's 2002 work describes the two as part of [...] "an amorous relationship". Others, such Jay Losey and William Brewer in their analysis of 19th-century sexuality, speculate that Byron's relationship with Giraud was modeled on a Grecian form of pederasty, and homosexual studies scholar Louis Crompton believes that pederasty was a facet of Byron's life and that his letters hinted towards a sexual relationship between Byron and Giraud. As Paul Douglass, in an analysis of Byron biographical studies, points out, Crompton also claims that biographers like Marchand ignored the nature of Byron's relationship with Giraud. Douglass also mentions that Crompton's work, Byron and Greek Love [...] "focuses Byron's life around a single issue, rather than attempting to create a larger view. Such studies prompt negative responses from those <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> writer warps Byron to fit the theme, presenting a one-sided account".|$|E
500|$|Several {{videos were}} {{intended}} to demonstrate the album's central theme of [...] "finding the beauty in imperfection". While working on [...] "Flawless", Beyoncé was reminded of her loss on television competition Star Search as a child, which she saw as a defining moment in her career, and believed that the competition had {{taught her how to}} embrace imperfection in the future. The theme was represented in the videos by the recurring use of trophies, which the singer saw as referencing [...] "all of the sacrifice I have made as a kid, all of the time that I lost". It was also carried into how the visuals were created, with the videos for [...] "Drunk in Love", [...] "Yoncé", [...] "No Angel", [...] "XO" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] shot without prior preparation, as the singer found enjoyment in the spontaneity of the filming locations and in resisting the urge to perfect them. Noting some of the visuals' explicit content and exposure of her body, Beyoncé said she found shooting them liberating and expressed her intention to demonstrate sexuality as a power that women should have, and not lose after becoming a mother. She went on to say, [...] "I know finding my sensuality, getting back into my body, being proud of growing up, it was important to me that I expressed that... I know {{that there are so many}} women <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> same way".|$|E

2500|$|... "With You" [...] is a [...] "folksy" [...] R song. According to {{the music}} sheet {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "With You" [...] utilizes styles of urban and contemporary R music and has a moderate tempo of 86 beats per minute. It is written in a key of E♭ major while Brown's vocals range from E♭4 to B♭5 The song follows a basic sequence of E♭5-E♭maj7-A♭7-B♭ as its chord progression. It consists of a slow stuttering beat and an acoustic guitar arrangement that has garnered comparisons to that present in Stargate's other produced song, Beyoncé's [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] (2006). Kelefa Sanneh of New York Times said the song could be a cover of [...] "Irreplaceable", while Nick Levine of Digital Spy called the two songs [...] "kissing cousins". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt that the song [...] "openly mimics [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] {{right down to the}} acoustic guitar riff."

2500|$|The Edison Chen photo scandal brought {{people to}} harbour {{doubts about the}} Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance, which criminalizes the {{distribution}} of obscene articles {{and the distribution of}} indecent articles without proper warnings to persons under 18. On 2 February 2008, Commissioner of Police Tang King Shing warned that sharing the photos via email, and even storing them on a personal computer, might be illegal, even if there was no record of distribution. This inaccurate statement of the law led to the objection of Leung Kwok-hung, who accused the police of sowing confusion and creating an atmosphere of [...] "white terror" [...] among netizens. Leung urged Commissioner Tang to clarify whether merely keeping the pictures violated the law. The police later amended Mr. Tang's statement, saying that looking at the photos or emailing them between mutual friends isn't against the law, although posting them to Web sites is. The police's exuberance and inconsistency in cracking down on naked photos of celebrities triggered a public backlash from some netizens, <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> police was curbing their freedom of expression in order to serve the powerful. The public reaction caused the government to table a review and public consultation of the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance.|$|E
2500|$|In 1891, now {{a member}} of the Kansas City Art association, she took part in the opening of an exhibit. This same year she wrote the book, Which will win? or Which wins?, and co-wrote a play. [...] "Mary H. Ford… says in her preface to the book that there are many men, like Wagner's Parsifal, whose eyes turn inward, <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> sufferings of others so vividly that they will turn their backs upon worldly {{prosperity}} and sacrifice all worldly profit for the good of their fellow-creatures. With such men lies the possibility of the race for real reform, and they represent proportion of humanity much larger now than at any other time, she thinks.…" [...] The book was dedicated to the Farmers' Alliance and covers life on farms and the effect mortgage systems had on it, and specifically examined the ways a woman's inheritance could be taken away. It was well reviewed locally, in Chicago and beyond. From a Boston review: [...] "although the work of an unknown author, is regarded… as likely to arouse attention. Nothing is known of Mrs. Mary H. Ford of Kansas City, …(but) a woman of extended acquaintance both in political and social circles.… The didactic moral of the book is interwoven with a love-tale, the idea evidently being to reach the story reading public {{in the same way that}} Bellamy reached the public with his 'Looking Backward'." [...] However another reviewer said [...] "If the 'labor question' could be settled by writing weak or sensational novels concerning it, all difficulties would speedily vanish… Which Wins, by Mary H Ford… would be likely to interest the farmer more if it had less about Parsifal in it." [...] A Letter-to-the-editor campaign by George Ward supported it in several newspapers.|$|E
