(M98) The same {{vigorous}} {{currents of}} national vitality {{that led to}} new endeavours {{for the education of}} the poor, had drawn men to consider the horrid chaos, the waste, and the abuses in the provision of education for the directing classes beyond the poor. Grave problems of more kinds than one came into view. The question, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>education?</b> was nearly as hard to answer as the question of which we have seen so much, What is a church? The rival claims of old classical training and the acquisition of modern knowledge were matters of vivacious contest. What is the true place of classical learning in the human culture of our own age? Misused charitable trusts, and endowments perverted by the fluctuations of time, by lethargy, by selfishness, from the objects of pious founders, touched wakeful jealousies in the privileged sect, and called into action that adoration of the principle of property which insists upon applying all the rules of individual ownership to what rightfully belongs to the community. Local interests were very sensitive, and they were multitudinous. The battle was severely fought, and it extended over several years, while commission upon commission explored the issues.|$|E

[...] "Oh," [...] he said, sadly, [...] "which of us knows {{whether he has}} natural ability or not, and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>education,</b> and what is life as one sees it, and what is technical training? Do these poor young fellows think that one is tall or short by taking thought? It {{is the same as}} that, it seems to me; or if you prefer a mystical solution, I should say, if you have a longing, from your earliest consciousness, to write poetry or fiction, and cannot keep from doing it for any long time together, you are possibly born with a gift for it. But this may be altogether a mistake; it may be the effect of your early and incessant scribblings on the minds of spectators wholly incompetent to judge of your abilities, such as your fond parents. This must rather often happen if we can judge from what nine-tenths of what is called literature is composed of. If your longing to write is the real thing, or is not, still education will not help or hinder you in doing it. No man was ever yet taught any art. He may be taught a trade, and that is what most of the versing and prosing is, I suppose. If you have the gift, you will technically train yourself: that is, you will learn how to be simple and clear and honest. Charm you will have got from your great-grandfather or great-grandmother; and life, which is only another sort of school, will not qualify you to depict life; but if {{you do not want to}} depict life, you will perhaps be able to meet the demands of what our friend calls the current editors." ...|$|E

The Utopian vision of education, in which lifelong learning was originally framed, has given way to a view of education as instrumentalism and performativity. This view is exacerbated by and through the Bologna process, such as it has been orchestrated through the European Commission and national governments. The paper concludes that these projects illustrate the power and {{influence of}} supranational regimes and raises serious questions concerning the future of education...|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to provide}} some {{background}} knowledge on the procedure that is known as female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), and {{sometimes referred to as}} female circumcision. This practice has been illegal in the UK since 1985 and is now deemed a form of child abuse. Nevertheless, there exist opposing standpoints within some FGM-affected communities where the practice is a social norm and is deeply rooted in their culture. This opposition creates a gap and the need for a research that listens to FGM-affected communities’ opinions and the motivations that lie behind the continuation of this practice. I am from an FGM-affected community and I am conducting research that examines perspectives on FGM among affected communities in the UK. My purpose in writing this article is, first and foremost, to explain what FGM is and then focus on the impact that education can have on the eradication of FGM. Instead of asking what is FGM doing in a periodical for research in teacher education, maybe I should ask <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>education</b> doing about FGM...|$|E
40|$|What is {{research}} today? Good {{research has}} to be indexed within appropriate mechanisms to be visible, considered and finally useful. These mechanisms are based on quantitative research methods and codes that are often very academic. Consequently, they impose rigorous constraints on the way results should be obtained and presented. In addition, everything people learn in academia needs to be graded. This leads to standard packaging of what should be learned and results in making people executants and not creators nor inventors. In other words, this academic standardization precludes freedom for innovation. This paper proposes Human-Centered Design (HCD) {{as a solution to}} override these limitations and roadblocks. HCD involves expertise, experience, participation, modeling and simulation, complexity analysis and qualitative research. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>education</b> today? Education is organized in silos with little attempt to integrate individual academic disciplines. Large system integration is almost never learned in engineering schools, and Human- Systems Integration (HSI) even less. Instead, real-life problemsolving requires integration skills. What is design research? We often hear that design {{has nothing to do with}} research, and conversely. Putting design and research together, as complementary disciplines, contributes to combine creativity, rigorous demonstration and validation. This is somehow what HCD is about...|$|E

Based on this data, the paper reveals how perceptions differ for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from remote communities compared with people who come from elsewhere. The analysis points to the need for some alternative indicators of ‘success’ to match the aspirations of local people living in remote communities. It also points to the need for school and system responses that resonate with community expectations of education, and to develop narratives of aspiration and success alongside community views...|$|E
