Public playtesting began on May 24, 2012. At Gen Con 2012 in August, Mike Mearls, lead developer for 5th Edition, said that Wizards of the Coast had received feedback from more than 75,000 playtesters, but that the entire development process would take two years, adding, [...] "I can't emphasize this enough... we're very serious about taking the time <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this right."

In April 2014, Carey confirmed that she and Q-Tip had worked together on a song which was yet to be mixed in {{an interview}} with Radio.com. Of the collaboration, Carey said [...] "He's angry with me because he thinks that I didn't allow him to do his mix, but really it's okay. He loves me, we're going to make this work. And that's good because it's one of my favorite songs. I'm going to call him soon... I think <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that ready."

500|$|The band {{released}} teaser trailers first, and {{the full}} video premiered on June 27, 2011, 1 pm (Eastern Time), on the band's website. Jon Blistein of Billboard commented that the video [...] "is sweet and will probably make you smile." [...] AOL's The Boot also liked the video, writing, [...] "If the storyline itself doesn't make you fall head over heels, the gorgeous scenery surely will, as the clip was shot in various picturesque places around the world." [...] Amy Sciarretto of Taste of Country noted that the video was [...] "heart-pinching". The Tennessean wrote that the [...] "sweet sentimentality should score with fans of ... 'Need You Now'." [...] However, Melinda Newman of HitFix deemed the video [...] "sugary". Robbie Daw of Idolator wrote, [...] "Lady A's [...] "Just A Kiss" [...] video got us choked up after one viewing.

500|$|On September 28, the Mets {{came into}} Philadelphia for a three-game {{series against the}} Phillies. The Mets were [...] games out of first with six games left: three against the Phillies and the last three against the first-place Cardinals. They had an {{opportunity}} to win the division and were playing the Phillies, against whom they had a season record of 12–3. The Mets won the opener, 1–0, to move within two games back with five remaining to play. However, the Phillies effectively ended their season on September 29. As the Cardinals swept a doubleheader from the Montréal Expos, the Phillies' Don Carman pitched a complete-game one-hitter, facing only 28 batters to shut out the Mets. After the game, Mets manager Davey Johnson said, [...] "How does it feel now? Empty? Not yet. But <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> help. When you play 162 games and you're eliminated, then you feel empty. And sick." [...] He promised reporters, [...] "We're going to win tomorrow night.". The following night, Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden struck out 10, and left after pitching nine innings with the score tied at three runs each, but the Phillies' Luis Aguayo won the game with a 10th-inning pinch-hit home run off of Orosco, clinching at least a tie for first place in the division for the Cardinals.|$|E
500|$|Penn State's {{defense had}} excelled {{in their first}} two games, but regressed {{significantly}} against Central Florida, particularly with poor tackling, which some attributed to their practice strategy of [...] "thud" [...] tackling, in which one does not actually take a player to the ground, instead making a [...] "thud" [...] to stop a player. Several media outlets speculated that the Lions used this due to their lack of scholarship players {{in the wake of}} sanctions imposed due to the Penn State child sex abuse scandal. Defensive coordinator John Butler renounced that assertion, commenting he employed [...] "thud" [...] when he coached at South Carolina. Penn State's linebackers were also criticized; Glenn Carson and Nyeem Wartman received criticism for not being as strong as the 2012 team's Michael Mauti and Gerald Hodges. In addition, 2012 Big Ten Freshman of the Year defensive end Deion Barnes [...] "barely wreaked any havoc", and DaQuan Jones, whose strong play had previously compensated for Barnes' weak play, was held to just five tackles. The offense, however, was considered a [...] "bright spot"; they gained 455 total yards, though receiver Allen Robinson commented that a fast start would have helped them gain more early momentum: [...] "We are in the Big Ten playing against some great offenses {{and people are going to}} put points up early, so <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> going early and start off fast." [...] Freshman quarterback Christian Hackenberg earned Big Ten Freshman of the Week accolades for the second time in the first three weeks of the season.|$|E

2500|$|After {{musician}} Jim Corr {{appeared on}} the first episode of The Saturday Night Show in 2010, D'Arcy said it was [...] "irresponsible" [...] for Corr to have discussed his views on the 2009 flu pandemic. Corr rang the radio show and the two engaged in what the Dundalk Democrats Gary McLaughlin described as [...] "the mother of all radio battles", with D'Arcy at one point saying [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> down to this level with you" [...] over {{the possibility of the}} government purposefully providing dangerous vaccines and Corr saying D'Arcy was [...] "very patronising" [...] and urging him, [...] "Just be careful not to misquote me in the future".|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics of}} CBS and Dan Rather argued that by {{proceeding}} {{with the story}} when the documents had not been authenticated, CBS was exhibiting liberal bias and attempting to influence {{the outcome of the}} 2004 U.S. Presidential Election.

2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} appointment, he {{announced}} his intention to reform land law, to enshrine customary ownership of lands, and ensure that lands could not be leased {{without the consent of}} their collective traditional owners. This would be achieved by drawing inspiration from the Australian Northern Territory’s Northern Land Council, which is designed to safeguard Aboriginal customary land ownership. Describing himself as a “notorious critic” of free trade and foreign ownership of lands, he added: [...] "New Zealand, Australia and the World Bank are saying that <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from , but I totally disagree. We need to enshrine it so that cultural land-owning groups or land-stewarding groups never lose control of the resource". He suggested that the government should encourage and support an agriculture-based economy, empowering customary land-owners.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of preseason, Vancouver hoped to add six young rookies to the team. While the goaltending {{situation}} almost assured that one rookie would be added, forwards Hunter Shinkaruk, Brendan Gaunce, Nicklas Jensen, and Horvat were also attempting to make the team. Defenceman Frank Corrado was looking to secure a regular spot after he played the final three regular season, and four playoff games for the Canucks in 2012–13. When asked about adding youngsters to the line-up Tortorella stated: [...] "We’re not going to force it, but <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some kids in our lineup." [...] In Vancouver's first preseason game Shinkaruk and Gaunce scored goals, while Läck stopped 25 of 27 shots in two periods of work. Vancouver lost the game 3–2 to San Jose as the Sharks out shot the Canucks 42–15.|$|E

We kind of felt like <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> what made us excited to be in this band in the beginning, and what made us happy to be doing this and working together, because you kind of take it for granted after a while. I think we had taken some things for granted and we weren’t really enjoying it as much. It kind of turned into work, you know?" [...] - Lead guitarist Jimmy Stafford.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the success}} of Miss America, Virgin didn't pick up the option for third album, leaving the band looking for another label. Shortly thereafter, the band signed on to eOne, to release Bringing Down the Giant. The Saving Abel {{frontman}} Jared Weeks told to Alternative Addiction later: “It {{was one of those}} moments where they were as glad to sign us as we were to be signed. They came in and did about eight months of work in only two months; they supported us, gave us everything <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> going and get back out on the road." ...|$|R
5000|$|Indeed, {{the lengthy}} {{sessions}} for the album {{would put the}} band deeper into debt with Warner Bros. Records — specifically, a total cost of $180,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) for Aoxomoxoa. It was their most ambitious and costly venture to date {{and the last time}} the band would ever run up such high studio bills. Kreutzmann later commented, [...] "Sometime in 1969, when we realized the colossal debt we got ourselves into with the decidedly indulgent making of Aoxomoxoa, we realized that <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a handle on our finances. We were a group of altruistic troubadours, a traveling psychedelic circus." ...|$|R
2500|$|As I've been a {{governor}} {{and seen the}} impact {{that the federal government}} can have holding down the interest of the teachers' unions and instead putting the interests of the kids and the parents and the teachers first, I see that the Department of Education can actually make a difference. So I supported No Child Left Behind. I still do. I know there are a lot in my party that don't like it, but I like testing in our schools. I think it allows us to get better schools, better teachers; allows us to let our kids have the kind of hope that they ought to have."

2500|$|As {{the stadium}} {{is owned by}} the City of Toronto, their consent is {{required}} for any modifications. [...] The City insisted that any renovations included making the playing surface longer to fit a CFL field so it could house the Argonauts, who had to vacate their current home Rogers Centre by the end of 2017 season. [...] Mark Grimes, Chairman of Exhibition Place's Board, began negotiating with MLSE on the project and said [...] "I think I have Mr. Leiweke's ear in that I am a big CFL fan and that <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the Argos on stable ground." [...] Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly said that [...] "the Argos have got to play there" [...] and that [...] "I think there is a very good chance that they will."

2500|$|Xenomania had {{initially}} only created two songs for the album, [...] "Sound of the Underground" [...] and [...] "No Good Advice".

We did that and allowed the album to stand up as a body of work." [...] Sound of the Underground remains Girls Aloud's only studio album not to be entirely written and produced by Brian Higgins and Xenomania. Girls Aloud worked {{with a variety of}} mostly British musicians and producers, such as Betty Boo and the Beatmasters, Graham Stack, and Steve Anderson. [...] "White Lies" [...] was co-written and produced by Tim Kellett, a former member of The Durutti Column, Simply Red, and Olive.

2500|$|The Huskies, with a 5–2–1 {{record to}} this point, entered their November 4–5 home series against Minnesota State ranked #16 in the USCHO.com poll. It {{was the first}} time the team had been nationally ranked in four years.

Minnesota State failed to score on six power play opportunities and Josh Robinson stopped all 29shots. In the second game, Huskies goals from Jacob Johnstone, Blake Pietila and Tanner Kero were matched by Minnesota State, and the game was tied 3–3 after two periods.

I {{would also like to}} thank Mr. Lampson from Texas as the Chairman of the Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, and Mr. Ose from the State of California, who have devoted much of their time to raising our level of awareness of the growing problem of international child abduction. [...] We are taking action on this measure {{on behalf of}} the parents of our abducted and wrongfully retained children. These left-behind parents have put their faith and trust in an international agreement, The Hague Convention, which is clear and explicit on the obligation of signatory governments to return an abducted or wrongfully retained child to his or her country of habitual residence. Nevertheless, we have found that in a number of nations, for a variety of reasons, this does not occur, and the resultant frustration, heartbreak and outrage has led us to act on the measure before us today. [...] I should also add that we need to have our State Department do more to promote compliance with The Hague Convention. The return of an abducted or illegally retained child should be on the top of the Secretary’s meetings with any official of a country involved in such cases. [...] This is not a problem that should be handled as a routine exchange of diplomatic notes or phone calls by junior U.S. officials to their foreign counterparts. We need to see some concern and some concrete actions by the highest levels of our government to redress what is, evidently, a growing international problem. [...] It is our hope that by adopting this resolution, and sending it to the floor for speedy action, we will send a strong signal that this is an issue that we care deeply about. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the attention of the Governments of Germany, Sweden, Austria, Mexico, and Honduras that they cannot expect The Hague Convention to be a one-way street.|$|E
