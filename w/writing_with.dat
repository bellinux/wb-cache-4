5|$|Aristotle's {{work was}} {{influential}} throughout the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, {{as well as}} in Europe during the Renaissance. Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from, and defined it in opposition to prose, which was generally understood as <b>writing</b> <b>with</b> a proclivity to logical explication and a linear narrative structure.|$|E
5|$|Basil was no {{more than}} the name of {{bachelor}} uncles, courgette was printed in italics as an alien word, and few of us knew how to eat spaghetti or pick a globe artichoke to pieces....

5|$|Veronica Nicholson, {{a friend}} with {{connections}} in the publishing trade, persuaded David to continue <b>writing,</b> <b>with</b> the aim that she write a book. She showed some of David's work to Anne Scott-James, {{the editor of the}} British magazine Harper's Bazaar, who thought the writing showed a widely travelled person with an independent mind. She offered David a contract, and David's work began appearing in the publication from March 1949.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, in {{recognition}} of his forthcoming 60th birthday, an article dedicated to Moser was published in Sydowia. The piece, compiled by Franz Schinner, C. Furrer-Siogas and Egon Horak, contained a detailed biography and a full bibliography of the 116 research publications Moser had authored or co-authored between 1949 and 1983. Moser, <b>writing</b> <b>with</b> Walter Jülich, published {{the first volume of}} the book series Farbatlas der Basidiomyzeten in 1985, presenting specimens of various Basidiomycota taxa. By the time of Moser's death, 19 volumes had been published; some subsequently published volumes have listed Moser as an author.|$|E

5|$|Stephen King criticised the {{reactions}} of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work. He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that {{the subject matter of}} the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been <b>writing</b> <b>with</b> the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared the works in this respect to Huckleberry Finn and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.|$|E
5|$|The film had a panel at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 22 and was {{released}} in North America on July 23, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on August 18, 2010. Salt grossed $294 million at the worldwide box office and received generally positive reviews, with praise for the action scenes and Jolie's performance, but drawing criticism on the <b>writing,</b> <b>with</b> reviewers finding the plot implausible and convoluted. The DVD and Blu-ray Disc were released December 21, 2010, and featured two alternate cuts providing different endings for the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the book led to offers of work from The Sunday Times—for which she was paid an advance of 60 guineas—Go, a travel {{magazine}} owned by the newspaper, and Wine and Food, {{the journal of the}} Wine and Food Society. In August 1950 David and her husband went on their final holiday together with the money from the new contracts, although they had trouble with the car they were using for touring and the holiday was unsuccessful. On her return she invited Felicité, her youngest sister, to move into the top flat in her house. David was a reluctant and unskilful typist—she preferred the feel of <b>writing</b> <b>with</b> a pen—and in exchange for a low rent, Felicité expertly typed her articles and books, and later acted as her principal researcher.|$|E

5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and <b>writing,</b> <b>with</b> the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
5|$|During mid-1997, Jackson and Walsh began <b>writing</b> <b>with</b> Stephen Sinclair. Sinclair's partner, Philippa Boyens, {{was a major}} fan of {{the book}} and joined the writing team after reading their treatment. It took 13–14 months to write the two film scripts, which were 147 and 144 pages respectively. Sinclair left the project due to {{theatrical}} obligations. Amongst their revisions, Sam is caught eavesdropping and forced to go along with Frodo, instead of Sam, Merry, and Pippin figuring out about the One Ring themselves and voluntarily going along after confronting Frodo about it, as occurs in the original novel. Gandalf's account of his time at Orthanc was pulled out of flashback and Lothlórien was cut, with Galadriel doing what she does in the story at Rivendell. Denethor attends the Council with his son. Other changes included having Arwen rescue Frodo, and the action sequence involving the cave troll. The writers also considered having Arwen absorb Éowyn's role entirely by having her kill the Witch-king.|$|E
5|$|Gisele meets Pierre {{the next}} day when she is picking up a {{painting}} where he spots odd behavior in her such as <b>writing</b> <b>with</b> the wrong hand, which leads him to return to her castle to investigate further. Gisele begins growing ill from her previous experiment and calls upon Professor Julian to aid her. As he leaves, Joseph awakens in Julian's lab. Pierre triggers an alarm which has him race out the castle where he meets the disoriented Joseph. Pierre takes Joseph to the police station where he reveals he was the kidnapper of the young women but the people in the castle are the real murderers. The police arrive looking for Marguerite but only find Gisele who denies any knowledge of Joseph. Pierre and the police explore the castle without finding clues. On leaving, Gisele begins transforming back into Marguerite before their eyes prompting for an emergency search of the castle. A gun battle ensues between Professor Du Grands assistant and the police leaving the assistant and Professor Du Grand shot. This leads the police to open his grave where they find Lorette. Lorette is sent home and Inspector Chantal reveals that Giselle confessed to the crimes and died shortly after.|$|E

5|$|However, known {{cases of}} the {{diffusion}} of writing, such as Sequoyah's invention of the Cherokee syllabary after seeing the power of English-language newspapers, or Uyaquk's invention of the Yugtun script inspired by readings from Christian scripture, involved greater contact than the signing of a single treaty. The glyphs could be crudely written rongorongo, {{as might be expected}} for Rapa Nui representatives <b>writing</b> <b>with</b> the novel instrument of pen on paper. The fact that the script was not otherwise observed by early explorers, who spent little time on the island, may reflect that it was taboo; such taboos may have lost power along with the tangata rongorongo (scribes) by the time Rapanui society collapsed following European slaving raids and the resulting epidemics, so that the tablets had become more widely distributed by Eyraud's day. Orliac points out that Tablet C would appear to predate the Spanish visit by at least a century.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, the {{traditional}} ceremony for granting assent in parliament was regularly used until the 21st century, long {{after it had}} been discontinued in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. One result, conceived {{as part of a}} string of acts intended to demonstrate Canada's status as an independent realm, was that King George VI personally assented to nine bills of the Canadian parliament during his 1939 tour of Canada—85 years after his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had last granted royal assent personally in the United Kingdom. Under the Royal Assent Act 2002, however, the alternative practice of granting assent in <b>writing,</b> <b>with</b> each house being notified separately (the Speaker of the Senate or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the governor general regarding the written declaration of Royal Assent), was brought into force. As the act also provides, royal assent is to be signified—by the governor general, or, more often, by a deputy, usually a Justice of the Supreme Court, at least twice each calendar year: for the first appropriation measure and for at least one other act, usually the first non-appropriation measure passed. However, the act provides that a grant of royal assent is not rendered invalid by a failure to employ {{the traditional}} ceremony where required.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} <b>writing</b> <b>with</b> the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E
