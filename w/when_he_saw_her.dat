He makes an origami crane every time he kills someone, a trait which was influenced by Woo's daughter <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> making them. Tony's character is shown as living alone and detached from others. Woo stated that this was influenced by Alain Delon's character in the French crime film Le Samouraï.

5|$|Riefenstahl {{eventually}} {{came to the}} notice of Hitler who was immediately captivated by her work. She is described as fitting in with Hitler’s ideal of Aryan womanhood, a feature he had noted <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> starring performance in Das Blaue Licht. After meeting Hitler, Riefenstahl was offered the opportunity to direct Der Sieg des Glaubens ("The Victory of Faith"), an hour-long propaganda film about the fifth Nuremberg Rally in 1933. The opportunity that was offered was a huge surprise to Riefenstahl. Hitler had ordered Goebbels Propaganda Ministry to give the film commission to Riefenstahl, but the Ministry had never informed her. Riefenstahl agreed to direct the movie {{even though she was}} only given {{a few days before the}} rally to prepare. She and Hitler got on well, forming a friendly relationship. The propaganda film was funded entirely by the NSDAP.|$|E
25|$|Fox Film {{songwriter}} Jay Gorney {{was walking}} out of the viewing of Temple's last Frolics of Youth picture <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> dancing in the movie theater lobby. Recognizing her from the screen, he arranged for her to have a screen test for the movie Stand Up and Cheer! Temple arrived for the audition on December 7, 1933; she won the part and was signed to a $150-per-week contract that was guaranteed for two weeks by Fox Film Corporation. The role was a breakthrough performance for Temple. Her charm was evident to Fox executives, and she was ushered into corporate offices almost immediately after finishing Baby Take a Bow, a song and dance number she did with James Dunn. On December 21, 1933, her contract was extended to a year at the same $150/week with a seven-year option and her mother Gertrude was hired on at $25/week as her hairdresser and personal coach. Released in May 1934, Stand Up and Cheer! became Shirley's breakthrough film. Within months, she became the symbol of wholesome family entertainment. In June, her success continued when she was loaned out to Paramount for Little Miss Marker.|$|E

25|$|The Tigillum Sororium was a rite (sacrum) of the gens Horatia {{and later}} of the State. In it Janus Curiatius was {{associated}} to Juno Sororia: {{they had their}} altars {{on opposite sides of}} the alley behind the Tigillum Sororium. Physically this consisted of a beam spanning the space over two posts. It was kept in good condition down to the time of Livy at public expenses. According to tradition it was a rite of purification that served at the expiation of Publius Horatius who had murdered his own sister <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> mourning the death of her betrothed Curiatius. Dumézil has shown in his Les Horaces et les Curiaces that this story is in fact the historical transcription of rites of reintegration into civil life of the young warriors, in the myth symbolised by the hero, freed from their furor (wrath), indispensable at war but dangerous in social life. What is known of the rites of October 1 shows at Rome the legend has been used as an aetiological myth for the yearly purification ceremonies which allowed the desacralisation of soldiers at the end of the warring season, i.e. their cleansing from the religious pollution contracted at war. The story finds parallels in Irish and Indian mythologies. These rites took place in October, month that at Rome saw the celebration of the end of the yearly military activity. Janus would then the patron of the feria as god of transitions, Juno for her affinities to Janus, especially on the day of the kalendae. It is also possible though that she took part as the tutelary goddess of young people, the iuniores, etymologically identical to her. Modern scholars are divided on the interpretation of J. Curiatius and J. Sororia. Renard citing Capdeville opines that the wisest choice is to adhere to tradition and consider the legend itself as the source of the epithets.|$|E

[...] "(Besides) Paradise & angels ... she has a prodigious list of saints—and is always talking of the Bambino ...

[...] However, though Shelley thought the little girl was more serious and contemplative than he remembered, he said she had not lost her [...] "excessive vivacity." [...] After five months in the convent school, her behaviour had also improved; she obeyed the nuns readily and was well-disciplined, though Shelley didn't think the nuns had been too severe with her. The child asked Shelley to [...] "tell her mother she wanted a kiss and a gold dress and would he please beg her Papa and Mammina to visit her." [...] Allegra no longer had any real memory of Clairmont, but had grown attached to [...] "her Mammina," [...] Byron's mistress Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, who had mothered her. Teresa gave the little girl her own childhood toys and played with her when she spent weeks recovering from a childhood illness.|$|E

500|$|Ronalds was {{separated}} from her American husband, but they never divorced. Social conventions of the time compelled Sullivan and Ronalds to keep their relationship private.

Ronalds was apparently pregnant {{on at least two}} occasions and procured abortions in 1882 and 1884. Sullivan had a roving eye, and his diary records the occasional quarrel when Ronalds discovered his other liaisons, but he always returned to her. She was a constant companion up to the time of Sullivan's death, but around 1889 or 1890, the sexual relationship seems to have ended. He started to refer to her in the diary as [...] "Auntie", and the tick marks indicating sexual activity were no longer there, although similar notation continued to be used for his relationships with other women who have not been identified, and who were always referred to by their initials.|$|E

In the women's Cross-Country team pursuit Canadian Sara Renner broke one of her poles and, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> dilemma, Norwegian coach Bjørnar Håkensmoen decided to lend her a pole.

Christopher Lee, Peter Bowles, Anthony Head, {{and five other}} actors were set to play the ghost narrators, but their roles were cut (Head does appear in an uncredited cameo as a gentleman who congratulates Depp after the shaving contest). According to Lee, these deletions were due to time constraints caused by a break in filming during March 2007, while Depp's daughter recovered from an illness. Burton's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter was cast in October 2006, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen. In December 2006, Alan Rickman was cast. In January 2007, Laura Michelle Kelly was cast as Lucy Barker.

500|$|Tricky {{eventually}} grew {{frustrated with}} {{his role in}} Massive Attack, finding it limiting, and wanted to record an album with a female vocalist whose singing would offer another dimension to his lyrics and their meaning. In 1993, he discovered Martina Topley-Bird, then a teenager at Clifton College, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> sitting against a wall near his house, singing to herself. [...] "That's really how it happened," [...] she recalled. [...] "A few weeks later, I went around to his house with some friends. We'd been drinking cider after our GCSEs. We were banging on his door, but he wasn't in. Then Mark Stewart, who lived there, came up to us and said: 'Yeah, this is Tricky's house, jump in through the window.'" [...] Tricky, whose lyrics had matured from raps about street violence and sex to more personal and introspective writing, said Topley-Bird found his songs [...] "quite depressing", which he believed was because of her more privileged background: [...] "It's just reality. She's been a student all her life, grew up in Somerset, and I don't think she's ever faced the real world. She finds it all a bit weird. But she's my best mate." [...] They would form a musical and romantic partnership over subsequent years, and their first recording together, [...] "Aftermath", later appeared on Maxinquaye. After offering the song to Massive Attack, who {{were not interested in}} including it on their 1991 album Blue Lines, Tricky released [...] "Aftermath" [...] independently to local record stores in September 1993 before he signed a record deal with 4th & B'way.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{primitive}} highlands of Arcadia, where old practices lingered, the Erymanthian boar {{was a giant}} fear-inspiring creature of the wilds that lived on Mount Erymanthos, a mountain that was apparently once sacred to the Mistress of the Animals, for in classical times it remained the haunt of Artemis (Homer, Odyssey, VI.105). A boar was a dangerous animal: [...] "When the goddess turned a wrathful countenance upon a country, as {{in the story of}} Meleager, she would send a raging boar, which laid waste the farmers' fields." [...] In some accounts, Apollo sent the boar to kill Adonis, a favorite of Aphrodite, as revenge for the goddess blinding Apollo's son Erymanthus <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> bathing. Robert Graves suggested that Aphrodite had been substituted for Artemis in this retelling of the mytheme of the eponymous Erymanthus. The most commonly accepted version, however, states that Ares turned himself into a boar and killed Adonis out of jealousy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1897, Philippide {{married a}} Romanian woman. This was Lucreția Nemțeanu, a young novice at Agapia Monastery, where {{her sister was}} a nun. Her father, {{the former mayor of}} Vânători-Neamț, was the {{administrator}} of the mental hospital in Târgu Neamț. He first learned of Lucreția <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> photograph in the hands of her brother, a student of his, and asked to meet her; {{a month and a half}} later, the two were married. This time, both a civil and a religious (Romanian Orthodox) service were held, probably at the insistence of his new in-laws. Although remarking on her [...] "rotten poverty", he admired Lucreția's youth, beauty and kindness, considering her the opposite of Johanna. Their son, born in 1900, was the future poet Alexandru A. Philippide. The latter would recall the Spartan education received from his father, involving a strict program of Homeric verse in the original Greek. The elder Philippide drew a sharp distinction between science, which he regarded as the province of manly, knowledge-seeking personalities; and literature, particularly poetry, which for him was an unserious activity for sensitive small minds. Although he had flirted with poetry as a young man, he was saddened to see his son adopt it as a profession.|$|E
2500|$|Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai {{explained}} why God carved {{the first two}} Tablets but Moses carved the second two, as God instructed in [...] Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai compared it {{to the case of}} a king who took a wife and paid for the paper for the marriage contract, the scribe, and the wedding dress. But <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> cavorting with one of his servants, he became angry with her and sent her away. Her agent came to the king and argued that she had been raised among servants and was thus familiar with them. The king told the agent that if he wished that the king should become reconciled with her, the agent should pay for the paper and the scribe for a new wedding contract and the king would sign it. Similarly, Moses spoke to God after the Israelites had committed the sin of the Golden Calf. Moses argued that God knew that God had brought the Israelites out of Egypt, a house of idolatry. Then God answered that if Moses desired that God should become reconciled with the Israelites, then Moses would have to bring the Tablets at his own expense and God would append God's signature, as God says in [...] "And I will write upon the tablets." ...|$|E
