5|$|An {{official}} opening was planned for 19 July 1919 {{but it was}} delayed until Saturday, 26 July 1919 so that Scouts could participate in the Official Peace Festival commemorating the end of World War I. Invitations were changed by hand to save money. Significant remodeling and construction <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s. Because of limited finances, few improvements were made during the Great Depression of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|For choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who {{had been}} trained by Gene Kelly. For a location, they did not find {{anything}} suitable in the Catskills (as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point), so they decided {{on a combination of}} two locations: Lake Lure, North Carolina and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Newport, Virginia, and with careful editing made it look like all shooting <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same area.|$|E
5|$|No British {{aircraft}} were encountered {{and much}} damage <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area {{south of the}} fortress. The South Mole and a large ship in the harbour were heavily damaged. In {{the northern part of}} Gibraltar, fires broke out.|$|E

5|$|The {{department}} of entomology has done several studies in apiculture, chemical ecology, horticultural pollination, and the behavior of honeybee and bumblebee colonies. Although some research <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apiary yards, the majority of data had to be collected with higher numbers of colonies at different experimental stations.|$|E
5|$|The soils in {{the valley}} of Muncy Creek are deep but {{relatively}} poor. However, farming <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley in the late 1800s and still is as of the late 1900s. The valley has forested hills on either side. The Morris-Oquaga-Wellsboro soil series is found along the creek in Sullivan County.|$|E
5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tunnel to insure that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E

5|$|All {{editions of}} the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first {{publication}} of it <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States by I. Bernard Cohen. The book is Franklin's only scientific work, and is recognized by historians Gary F. Kurutz and Dennis Smith as America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century. The publication for his scientific observations on electricity made Franklin famous throughout Europe as a serious scientist. Eighteenth-century British polymath Joseph Priestley writes in his book The History and Present State of Electricity (1767) that nobody had written an in-depth study of electricity {{with the use of}} scientific experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Black Creek is {{situated}} within the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. Rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pottsville Formation, and the Llwellyn Formation. Coal {{beds in the}} watershed include the Lower Red Ash bed, the Upper Red Ash bed, the Lower Ross bed, the Upper Ross bed, and the Baltimore Bed. Ridges of mine waste also occur in the creek's drainage basin. Mining <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed {{as early as the}} winter of 1836-1837, but it stopped in 1955. The creek and the surrounding areas were the subject of a joint study by several federal and state organizations in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|HMS Zealous {{was given}} a {{straight}} stem and a rounded stern, but her hull was otherwise unmodified from her original form; it had been found that lengthening the hull, as <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earlier , led to longitudinal weakness. Her conversion to a central battery ironclad therefore cost {{less than that of}} any of her contemporaries, though this was offset with a shorter battery and therefore a less effective broadside. She also carried less armour than the earlier class, and was nearly a knot slower; however, as she was built to serve in distant waters, and not expected to face opposing ships of significant force, these shortcomings were thought acceptable.|$|E

5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} {{more in the}} world than he has {{accomplished}} in improving the coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E
5|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in North America and Europe {{in the fall}} of 1996. The short tour of North America focused on the East Coast of the United States. As with Vitalogy, very little touring <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States to promote No Code because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venues. The band chose to use alternate ticketing companies for the shows. A European tour followed {{in the fall of}} 1996, of which the band's November 3, 1996 show in Berlin, Germany at Deutschlandhalle was broadcast on many radio stations worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Russian customs {{officials}} twice {{refused to let}} the target enter the country because of missing or incomplete paperwork. Over the span of a few days, the target traveled over the Atlantic Ocean five times. On its arrival in Russia in June 2009, the berkelium was transferred to Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (RIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Ulyanovsk Oblast, where it was deposited as a 300-nanometer-thin layer on a titanium film. In July 2009, it was then transported to Dubna, where it was installed in the particle accelerator at JINR. The calcium-48 beam was generated by chemically extracting the small quantities of calcium-48 present in naturally occurring calcium, enriching it 500 times. This work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closed town of Lesnoy, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia.|$|E
40|$|By {{explicitly}} {{describing what}} has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, surveys implicitly outline what can (and sometimes should) <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} second semi-final, a winner's press conference was held for the ten {{qualifying}} countries. As part of this press conference, the qualifying artists {{took part in a}} draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently participate in. This draw <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> order the countries were announced during the semi-final. Austria was drawn to compete in the first half. Following this draw, the shows' producers decided upon the running order of the final, as they had done for the semi-finals. Austria was subsequently placed to perform in position 11, following the entry from Greece and before the entry from Germany. On the day of the grand final, Austria was considered by bookmakers to be the second most likely to win the competition, placed only behind the entry from Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Tangascootack Creek's {{watershed}} covers 36.4 {{square miles}} (94km2) {{in the southern}} part of Clinton County, half of which is the watershed for North Fork Tangascootack Creek. A small amount of the watershed, less than 1%, has occasional residential uses, including sport camps and summer retreats. In formerly strip-mined areas there are patches of grassland and reforestation. Almost all of the area that is considered impaired by the Environmental Protection Agency, is forested. However, in areas where strip mining <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, there are patches of grassland or reforested land. This land includes sports camps and summer retreats.|$|E
5|$|The sinking killed 977 of her crew, the {{majority}} of the 1,147 French naval personnel killed in the attack. Some initial salvaging work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of the attack, but the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942 interrupted the work. Because she was an impediment to the work of extension of the military harbour (which was now a full military complex with anti-atomic bunkers), Bretagne ultimately was salvaged from 1952 to 1954. The hull was cut into big parts, which were raised and scrapped ashore.|$|E

5|$|The telenovela was {{produced}} by Pol-ka based on a premise by Adrián Suar, which he formulated nearly {{six months before the}} show's premiere, after discussion with his partner Javier Blanco y Tevah. The premise involves a rich businessman and former Formula 1 racing driver who {{falls in love with a}} poor woman looking for work in his emporium. Suar requested scripts from Ernesto Korovsky and Sebastian Parrotta, the authors of Gasoleros and El sodero de mi vida, and Hombres de honor and Padre Coraje respectively. The program was directed by Daniel De Felippo and Rodolfo Antúnez and produced by César Markus González. Most of the filming <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pol-ka studio at the Colegiales neighborhood, using outdoor scenes unconventional for the genre.|$|E
5|$|Although {{identified}} {{early as}} a vital strategic outpost, Port Moresby, the most significant Papuan town, had just two airfields and basic port facilities in early 1942. An enormous amount of work was required to transform it into a major base for both air and land operations against the Japanese. This <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of frequent Japanese air raids. During {{the course of the}} Kokoda Track campaign, the two original airfields were improved, and five new airfields were developed. To make them operational, the engineers had to construct more than just runways; taxiways, hardstands, facilities and access roads all had to be built. The operation of the base depended on shipping, but the port facilities were limited. To increase the capacity of the port, a causeway was built to Tatana Island, where pontoon docks were emplaced. Engineers also built roads, warehouses, and a water treatment plant. They ran the town's electricity and water supply, and quarried stone for the roads and airstrips.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{watershed}} of Black Creek {{as early}} as the winter of 1836–1837. Several people operated in the area until 1865, when it was leased to the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company for 99 years. However, the mining was stopped by a strike in 1872 and for some time thereafter mining was done by several smaller companies. The mine in the watershed was run by the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad between 1901 and 1921. The Glen Alden Corp. then operated it until 1938, at which point underground mining in the watershed stopped. Strip mining was already underway there and it continued until 1955, when all mining stopped. During World War II, coal waste in the watershed was rerun through a coal processing plant to recover coal. In 1971, the land was owned by the Blue Coal Company. A total of 22 million tons of coal have been mined in the area.|$|E
