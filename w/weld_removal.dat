The dual torsion bar system, designed by Professor Ernst Lehr, allowed for a wide travel stroke and rapid oscillations with high reliability, thus allowing for relatively high speed travel over undulating terrain. The extra space required for the bars running across {{the length of the}} bottom of the hull, below the turret basket, increased the overall height of the tank and also prevented the provision for an escape hatch in the hull bottom.

40|$|Research {{shows that}} the fatigue {{strength}} of a Very High Strength Steel (VHSS) can be significantly negatively effected by welds in a structure. The fatigue lifetime may be extended after cracking occurs by means of fatigue crack repair. A better insight by means of Finite ElementModelling (FEM) can help in understanding {{the effects of a}} repair procedure in awelded connectionwhich can results in the optimisation of the repairing process. The FEM model needs to be verified with experiment but measurement of residual stresses in a specimen requires either expensive or highly specialised equipment. Therefore, a more simple approach for model verification could aid in the accessibility of modelling of welding. The aim of this thesis is to establish a finite element model for a repair weld in a welded connection, and investigate to what extent the model can be verified by welding distortion. A weld repair experiment, consisting of an initial <b>weld,</b> segment <b>removal</b> and repair <b>welding,</b> is performed to retrieve experiment data to be used as verification and input for the FEM model. First the modelling of the initial weld is described, consisting of a thermal analysis and subsequent thermomechanical analysis. Regarding the thermal analysis, a mesh sensitivity analysis is performed as well as 2 Dmodel results are compared with 3 D results. The thermal analysis is performed by Goldak heat distribution and after calibration of the heat input, show a good agreement with temperature data retrieved from experiment. Regarding the thermo-mechanical analysis, an Abaqus subroutine was established to retrieve information of the weld pool during the thermal analysis. This information is used in a subroutine during the thermo-mechanical analysis to assign differentmaterial behaviour to different elements of the weld, based on thermal history. In the thermo-mechanical model distortion results show a good agreement with experiment distortion results. As a result of unexpected movement during clamping of the experiment, calibration was required of the mechanical boundary conditions in the model to find matching results. Modelling of the <b>weld</b> segment <b>removal</b> was performed, and similar trends of distortion between experiment and model results were found. However, further measurement of residual stresses is required to further evaluate the correlation between residual stress and distortion. Results of the thesis show that for a defect or faulty weld section, the measurement of the residual stresses is of great importance. Modelling of the full weld repair procedure proved to be {{beyond the scope of this}} thesis, since Finite Element work was more time consuming than initially anticipated.

30|$|In the air {{carbon arc}} cutting (CAC) process, the molten metal {{generated}} by the electric arc is swept off by a strong dry airflow rate of 700 to 1000  l/min and a working pressure up to 6  kg/cm 2. The electric arc is generated by a graphite electrode (typically 90 % C) with other metallic elements (Cu, Ni, Fe, among others). The composition is chosen to facilitate the passage of current and to avoid corrosion of the sample due to the pressurized air (American Society of Heating 2011; Victor Technologies, Inc. 2013; Varkey et al. 2013; Gutiérrez 2006; IS 1979; U.S. Department of Transportation 1994; AWS 1980; Das and Abarna 2015).

40|$|Ultrasonic {{inspection}} is {{the primary}} technique {{for the detection of}} planar flaws within the nuclear industry. Current inspections are typically limited to the application of rigid wedge, single element transducers to components with regular surface geometry. This thesis addresses some of the limitations of this approach and develops new methods and techniques that are suitable for application in an industrial environment. Inspection modelling is a cost effective technique for inspection design and qualification; {{it can be used to}} aid understanding of the inspection process, and provides valuable insight into inspection data interpretation. In this work semianalytical and numerical modelling tools have been used to accurately and efficiently simulate the ultrasonic inspection of large complex components. Modelling tools have also been applied to aid in the design of a membrane coupled conformable phased array device. The membrane coupled array is a low-cost, robust device that uses a conventional phased array coupled to the outer surface of the component under test via a water path encapsulated by low-loss membrane. Early design of this device was performed by Long and Cawley at Imperial College, London. The work reviewed in this thesis discussed the further development of this membrane coupled device and its application for the inspection of a specific target application component. The target application is a safety critical, thick-walled stainless steel section of pipework that contains an austenitic weld. The current inspection of this component is carried out by first removing the component weld cap and then mechanically raster scanning a large number of rigid wedge single element transducers. <b>Weld</b> cap <b>removal</b> is an expensive time consuming task that can lead to excessive wall thinning and the exposure of small surface breaking defects. The motivation for this work is to provide complete inspection of the weld and heat affected zone with the weld cap in place. It is also designed to improve inspection speed and accuracy, and to reduce the amount of user intervention required to complete the inspection in a hostile environment Inspection results from the 2 nd and 3 rd generation membrane coupled device on multiple test-pieces representative of the target application are presented. These results demonstrate that the membrane coupled device can be used to detect defects in locations that cannot be inspected using conventional techniques. The amount of scanning required can be significantly reduced, simplifying the inspection and helping to improve inspection speed by over 60 % in comparison to the single element approach.

40|$|The Waste Package Remediation System remediates waste {{packages}} (WPs) {{and disposal}} containers (DCs) {{in one of}} two ways: preparation of rejected DC closure welds for repair or opening of the DC/WP. DCs are brought to the Waste Package Remediation System for preparation of rejected closure welds if testing of the closure weld by the Disposal Container Handling System indicates an unacceptable, but repairable, welding flaw. DC preparation of rejected closure <b>welds</b> will require <b>removal</b> of the <b>weld</b> {{in such a way that}} the Disposal Container Handling System may resume and complete the closure welding process. DCs/WPs are brought to the Waste Package Remediation System for opening if the Disposal Container Handling System testing of the DC closure weld indicates an unrepairable welding flaw, or if a WP is recovered from the subsurface repository because suspected damage to the WP or failure of the WP has occurred. DC/WP opening will require cutting of the DC/WP such that a temporary seal may be installed and the waste inside the DC/WP removed by another system. The system operates in a Waste Package Remediation System hot cell located in the Waste Handling Building that has direct access to the Disposal Container Handling System. One DC/WP at a time can be handled in the hot cell. The DC/WP arrives on a transfer cart, is positioned within the cell for system operations, and exits the cell without being removed from the cart. The system includes a wide variety of remotely operated components including a manipulator with hoist and/or jib crane, viewing systems, machine tools for opening WPs, and equipment used to perform pressure and gas composition sampling. Remotely operated equipment is designed to facilitate DC/WP decontamination and hot cell equipment maintenance, and interchangeable components are provided where appropriate. The Waste Package Remediation System interfaces with the Disposal Container Handling System for the receipt and transport of WPs and DCs.

The system receives power from the Waste Handling Building Electrical System. The system also interfaces with the various DC systems...|$|R
40|$|Processes {{currently}} {{used throughout the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to remove corrosion and coatings from structures, ground service equipment, small parts and flight components result in waste streams consisting of toxic chemicals, spent media blast materials, and waste water. When chemicals are used in these processes they are typically high in volatile organic compounds (VOC) and are considered hazardous air pollutants (HAP). When blast media is used, the volume of hazardous waste generated is increased significantly. Many of the coatings historically used within NASA contain toxic metals such as hexavalent chromium, and lead. These materials are highly regulated and restrictions on worker exposure continue to increase. Most recently the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reduced the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for hexavalent chromium (CrVI) from 52 to 5 micrograms per cubic meter of air as an 8 -hour time-weighted average. Hexavalent chromium is found in numerous pretreatment and primer coatings used within the Space Shuttle Program. In response {{to the need to}} continue to protect assets within the agency and the growing concern over these new regulations, NASA is researching different ways to continue the required maintenance of both facility and flight equipment in a safe, efficient, and environmentally preferable manner. The use of laser energy to prepare surfaces for a variety of processes, such as corrosion and coating <b>removal,</b> <b>weld</b> preparation, and non destructive evaluation (NDE) is a relatively new application of the technology that has been proven to be environmentally preferable and in many cases less labor intensive than {{currently used}} removal methods. The novel process eliminates VOCs and blast media and captures the removed coatings with an integrated vacuum system. This means that the only waste generated are the coatings that are removed, resulting in an overall cleaner process. The development of a Portable Laser Coating Removal System (PLCRS) started as the goal of a Joint Group on Pollution Prevention (JG-PP) project, led by the Air Force, where several types of lasers in several configurations were thoroughly evaluated. Following this project, NASA decided to evaluate the best performers on processes and coatings specific to the agency. Laser systems used during this project were all of a similar design, between 40 and 500 Watts, most of which had integrated vacuum systems in order to collect materials removed from substrate surfaces during operation...|$|R

Laser systems used during this project were all of a similar design, most of which had integrated vacuum systems in order to collect materials removed from substrate surfaces during operation. Due {{to the fact that the}} technology lends itself to a bide variety of processes, several site demonstrations were organized in order to allow for greater evaluation of the laser systems across NASA. The project consisted of an introductory demonstration and a more in-depth evaluation at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Additionally, field demonstrations occurred at Glenn Research Center and Kennedy Space Center. During these demonstrations several NASA specific applications were evaluated, including the removal of coatings within Orbiter tile cavities and Teflon from Space Shuttle Main Engine gaskets, removal of heavy grease from Solid Rocket Booster components and the removal of coatings on weld lines for Shuttle and general ground service equipment for non destructive evaluation (NDE). In addition, several general industry applications such as corrosion removal, structural coating removal, weld-line preparation and surface cleaning were evaluated. This included removal of coatings and corrosion from surfaces containing lead-based coatings and applications similar to launch-structure maintenance and Crawler maintenance. During the project lifecycle, an attempt was made to answer process specific concerns and questions as they arose. Some of these initially unexpected questions concerned the effects lasers might have on substrates used on flight equipment including strength, surface re-melting, substrate temperature and corrosion resistance effects. Additionally a concern was PPE required for operating such a system including eye, breathing and hearing protection. Most of these questions although not initially planned, were fully explored as a part of this project. Generally the results from tesng were very positive. Corrosion was effectively removed from steel, but less successfully from aluminum alloys. Coatings were able to be removed, with varying results, generally dark, matte and thin coatings were easier to remove. Steel and aluminum panels were able to be cleaned for welding, with no known deleterious effects and weld-lines were able to have coatings removed in critical areas for NDE while saving time as compared to other methods...|$|R
40|$|The Disposal Container Handling System {{receives}} {{and prepares}} new disposal containers (DCs) and transfers {{them to the}} Assembly Transfer System (ATS) or Canister Transfer System (CTS) for loading. The system receives the loaded DCs from ATS or CTS and welds the lids. When the welds are accepted the DCs are termed waste packages (WPs). The system may stage the WP for later transfer or transfer the WP directly to the Waste Emplacement/Retrieval System. The system can also transfer DCs/WPs to/from the Waste Package Remediation System. The Disposal Container Handling System begins with new DC preparation, which includes installing collars, tilting the DC upright, and outfitting the container for the specific fuel it is to receive. DCs and their lids are staged in the receipt area for transfer to the needed location. When called for, a DC is put on a cart and sent through an airlock into a hot cell. From this point on, all processes are done remotely. The DC transfer operation moves the DC to the ATS or CTS for loading and then receives the DC for welding. The DC welding operation receives loaded DCs directly from the waste handling lines or from interim lag storage for welding of the lids. The welding operation includes mounting the DC on a turntable, removing lid seals, and installing and welding {{the inner and outer}} lids. After the weld process and non-destructive examination are successfully completed, the WP is either staged or transferred to a tilting station. At the tilting station, the WP is tilted horizontally onto a cart and the collars removed. The cart is taken through an air lock where the WP is lifted, surveyed, decontaminated if required, and then moved into the Waste Emplacement/Retrieval System. DCs that do not meet the welding non-destructive examination criteria are transferred to the Waste Package Remediation System for <b>weld</b> preparation or <b>removal</b> of the lids. The Disposal Container Handling System is contained within the Waste Handling Building System. This includes the primary hot cell bounded by the receiving area and WP transport exit air locks; and isolation doors at ATS, CTS, and Waste Package Remediation. The hot cell includes areas for welding, various staging, tilting, and WP transporter loading. There are associated operating galleries and equipment maintenance areas outside the hot cell. These areas operate concurrently to accommodate the DC/WP throughput rates and support system maintenance. The new DC preparation area is located in an unshielded structure. The handling equipment includes DC/WP bridge cranes, tilting stations, and horizontal transfer carts. The welding area includes DC/WP welders and staging stations. Welding operations are supported by remotely operated equipment including a bridge crane and hoists, welder jib cranes, welding turntables, and manipulators. WP transfer includes a transfer/decontamination and transporter load area. The transfer operations are supported by a remotely operated horizontal lifting system, decontamination system, decontamination and inspection manipulator, and a WP horizontal transfer cart. All handling operations are supported by a suite of fixtures including collars, yokes, lift beams, and lid attachments. Remote equipment is designed to facilitate decontamination and maintenance. Interchangeable components are provided where appropriate. Set-aside areas are included, as required, for fixtures and tooling to support off-normal and recovery operations. Semi-automatic, manual, and backup control methods support normal, maintenance, and recovery operations. The system interfaces with the ATS and CTS to provide empty and receive loaded DCs. The Waste Emplacement/Retrieval System interfaces are for loading/unloading WPs on/from the transporter. The system also interfaces with the Waste Package Remediation System for DC/WP repair. The system is housed, shielded, supported, and has ventilation boundaries by the Waste Handling Building (WHB). The system is ventilated by the WHB Ventilation System, which in conjunction with ventilation boundaries ensure that airborne radioactivity is confined by high efficiency particulate air filtration units. Electrical power is supplied by the Waste Handling Building Electrical System. The system also interfaces with each of the DC systems. New DCs are received from a commercial transport system...|$|R
