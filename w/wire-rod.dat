5000|$|The {{first ever}} steel mill was {{established}} in 1952 by the H Akberali Group of Industries as the [...] "Bangladesh Steel Re-rolling Mills (BSRM)". Located at Nasirabad, Chittagong, the plant formed re-enforcing bars and structural sections. The mill gradually prolonged, adopting new technological know-how by setting up a cross-nation European mill in 1987 which incorporated a <b>wire-rod</b> mill. The BSRM group added a captive billet manufacturing plants in 1996 {{so as to make}} sure a stable distribution of billets of its plants. In 2006, the company installed pilot cold rolling mill to make ribbed high strength wires.|$|E

40|$|After hot rolling, the presense of {{segregation}} {{in the center}} of <b>wire-rod</b> can lead to a nonuniform transformation, resulting in bands of martensite in the microstructure. This {{is considered to be a}} defect, called center-martensite, because it can cause cracks and breaks during wire drawing. To identify the mechanism for the formation of center-martensite in <b>wire-rod,</b> the structure, macrosegregation and microsegregation in unworked billets were characterized. Based on measurements of secondary dendrite arm spacings, cooling rates during solidification were estimated. It appears that the macrosegregation of carbon and manganese in the billets manifests itself as the microsegregation in <b>wire-rod,</b> which is an agent in forming the center-martensite. Thus, electromagnetic stirring is proposed as a means to reduce the macrosegregation in the billet and, thereby, reduce the occurrence of center-martensite in <b>wire-rod...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this thesis, the FE program MSC. Marc is applied for coupled {{thermomechanical}} simulations of <b>wire-rod</b> rolling. In order to predict material behaviour of an AISI 302 stainless steel at high strain rates generated during <b>wire-rod</b> rolling, a material model based on dislocation density is applied. Then, the evolution of temperature, strain rate and flow stress is predicted in the first four rolling passes of a wire block. In the second part of the thesis, an alternative approach to simulation of shape rolling is evaluated. The approach is applied in order to save the computational time in cases where many shape-rolling passes are to be simulated. The approach is a combination of the slab method and a 2 D FEM with a generalized plane-strain formulation. A number of various isothermal shape-rolling passes are simulated applying the simplified approach. The simulations are carried out using an in-house 2 D FE code implemented in Matlab. The results are compared to fully 3 D FE analyses. The comparison shows that the simplified approach can predict roll forces and roll torques with a fair accuracy, but the predicted area reductions are a bit underestimated. The reasons for the deviations between the simplified approach and the 3 D FEM are discussed. QC 2010112...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. High speed <b>wire-rod</b> rolling is {{a typical}} large {{deformation}} process which includes geometry, material and boundary condition non-linearity, thus it belongs to a highly nonlinear problem. The finite element models of the billet and the rollers in the intermediate rolling region had been established based on actual sizes by using 3 -D thermo-mechanical coupling FEM and advanced contact analysis technology. The deformation field, stress, strain, temperature field and rolling force of the billet were calculated and analyzed in the rolling passes precisely. The distribution and change characteristics of temperature had been discussed especially. The results of the simulation are reliable and precise, which are useful for practical manufacture and the optimization of process-parameters. ...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThis study {{retrospectively}} reviewed 9 {{patients who}} underwent occipitocervical fixation with a newly developed screw-rod fixation system between April 2004 and November 2005. The {{objective was to}} evaluate the clinical result of occipitocervical fixation with the screw-rod fixation system, including symptom relief, fusion rate and complications. MethodsAll 9 patients received occipitocervical fixation surgery with screw-rod fixation system and autologous bone grafts for fusion. Fusion was assessed by plain cervical X-ray films, and the myelopathy by Nurick scale. ResultsFour males and 5 females were enrolled into this study. Mean age was 58. 8 years, and mean follow-up period was 15 months. One female patient experienced surgical site infection with instrument pullout 20 months after surgery; she received a second operation for instrument revision. The overall fusion rate was 100 %. The mean Nurick scores were 3 preoperatively and 2. 1 postoperatively, with advancement of 0. 9 points on average. Seven of 9 patients experienced pain or myelopathy improvement. There were no complications except for the 1 infection mentioned above. ConclusionThe fusion rate, complication rate and improvement in neurological function of occipitocervical fixation surgery using the screw-rod system were {{comparable to those of}} the widely used <b>wire-rod</b> system and screw-plate system...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} : to compare the results {{with the use of}} {{computer-assisted}} Ortho-SUV ExFix and conventional hybrid external fixator. Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis of examination and treatment of 13 patients aged 13 to 17 years with genu recurvatum of different etiology in combination with crus shortening.

40|$|A culture-based colony {{counting}} {{method is}} {{the most widely used}} analytical technique for monitoring bioaerosols in both indoor and outdoor environments. However, this method requires several days for colony formation. In this study, our goal was fast monitoring (Sam-pling: 3 min, Detection: < 1 min) of indoor bioaerosol concentrations with ATP biolumines-cence assay using a bioaerosol sampler. For this purpose, a novel hand-held electrostatic rod-type sampler (110 mm wide, 115 mm long, and 200 mm tall) was developed and used with a commercial luminometer, which employs the Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) biolumi-nescence method. The sampler consisted of a <b>wire-rod</b> type charger and a cylindrical col-lector, and was operated with an applied voltage of 4. 5 kV and a sampling flow rate of 150. 7 lpm. Its performance was tested using Staphylococcus epidermidis which was aerosolized with an atomizer. Bioaerosol concentrations were measured using ATP bioluminescence method with our sampler and compared with the culture-based method using Andersen cascade impactor under controlled laboratory conditions. Indoor bioaerosol concentrations were also measured using both methods in various indoor environments. A linear correla-tion was obtained between both methods in lab-tests and field-tests. Our proposed sampler with ATP bioluminescence method may be effective for fast monitoring of indoor bioaerosol concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In recent years, RFID {{solutions}} are finding {{an increasing number}} of applications {{in a wide variety of}} industries. There are some natural limitations when applying RFID technology in the steel industry, because the tags do not function well in metallic environments. Even though some commercial RFID metal tags are available in the market, they are found to be too expensive by steel companies. This paper proposes a useful and practical RFID tag design for management applications involving steel-bar and <b>wire-rod</b> products manufactured by the steel industry. The dual-function metallic RFID tag, comprising of both an RFID code and a barcode, involves technology advancement in RFID design, and named Window-Tag (WinTag). The maximum read range of this tag can reach about 5. 7 m for the radiated power of 4. 0 W EIRP in free space. In the practical application, the maximum read ranges are about 2. 3 m and 5. 0 m for the worst and best case, respectively. The design methodology as well as simulation and measurement results of the WinTag are presented in this paper. The low profile and low cost features of the WinTag makes the RFID tag well suited for metallic type tag of labeling system that requires integration of RFID technology. 1...|$|E
