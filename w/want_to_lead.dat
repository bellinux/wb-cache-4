[...] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying [...] "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't – frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother {{was one of the}} most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church.

500|$|Da Matta {{appeared}} in victory lane {{and later on}} the podium to celebrate his third win of the season; the victory earned him $1 million. He was happy with the result: [...] "I was pretty confident {{in the car and}} could go flat down to the end. You need to be a little lucky, being {{in the right place at}} the right time. For everybody, it's a very exciting race. We were racing all together all the time." [...] Da Matta stated he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> the race with two laps remaining because of the draft and believed there would be a larger battle for the victory. Second-place finisher Papis said his team were planning a new strategy after the race's distance was reduced and had been looking forward to further racing and congratulated Da Matta on winning the race. Tagliani, who finished in third, revealed that he lifted from his accelerator pedal and ran in fifth gear on the backstraight and stated it was about conserving fuel and avoiding being caught in any incidents.

We were just cruising along. We didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> the thing because of fuel consumption. We were running in the draft, looking real good." [...] Despite his crash on lap 196, Fernández was pleased with his car as he felt comfortable driving along the race track: [...] "We were having a great race. This {{was one of the best}} cars I have had at a superspeedway." [...] Bräck stated his car experienced oversteer while driving alongside other competitors but felt his car ran efficiently. Tracy said his engine failure was a [...] "disappointment" [...] for his team and felt he had a car that could win the race.

2500|$|Manning {{recognized}} the frustration by Canada's right-wing proponents and began discussions towards {{the launch of}} a new pan-Canadian party, using [...] "United Alternative" [...] ("UA") forums to bring grassroots Reformers together with Tories. The goal {{was to create a}} small-c conservative political alternative to the Liberals that could woo Ontarian and Atlantic Canadian voters. Manning was supported by the more right-of-centre [...] "Focus Federally For Reform," [...] while [...] "Grassroots United Against Reform's Demise" [...] ("GUARD") opposed the initiative. The United Alternative proposal created a strong debate in the Reform Party. Manning himself {{wrote a letter to the}} effect that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> Reform anymore, but would only lead a new party. A leadership vote in 1998 managed to officially put aside the differences, with Manning winning a large majority in support of his leadership. Afterwards, Reform steadily progressed towards creating the United Alternative.|$|E
2500|$|A Wii spinoff of {{the game}} now known as Spore Hero has been {{mentioned}} by Will Wright several times, such as in his October 26, 2007 interview with The Guardian.

You know, we're still so early in design and prototyping that I don't know where we're going to end up, so I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> you down one path. But suffice to say that it's being developed with the Wii controls and technology in mind." [...] Eventually, a spin-off under the title [...] "Spore Hero" [...] was announced, an adventure game built ground up for the Wii with a heavier focus on evolution.

2500|$|Between 2011 and 2014, several events {{occurred}} that created rifts in the party. In 2011, after {{years out of}} the political spotlight, Deri announced an interest in returning to politics. After Aryeh Deri announced his return to politics, and following a series of highly publicised {{events that led to}} an increase in the tensions between the Haredi public and the non-Haredi public, Shas's popularity began to falter according to most polls. As a result, Shas chairman Eli Yishai requested that Aryeh Deri join the party instead of establishing an independent party. Shas spiritual leader Ovadia Yosef offered Aryeh Deri the 3rd position on the party list, but Deri rejected it at first and was believed to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> the party, start his own party (which according to polls might win as many as 7 seats), or not participate in the election at all. On 16 October a compromise was reached: Shas would not have a formal chairman, but would instead be jointly led by Deri, Yishai and Housing and Construction Minister Ariel Atias. In May 2013, some months after internal rift following Deri's political comeback, Yishai was ousted and Deri was once again renamed {{as the leader of the}} Shas party. Ovadia Yosef, the Sephardi sage and Shas spiritual leader said regarding his decision to oust Yishai [...] "It was a deposit that he held, and now he can redeem it." [...] Yosef also said he had told Deri at the time of his imprisonment that the position of party leader would be returned to him. 2013 [...] also marked the death of Ovadia Yosef, the party's spiritual leader.|$|E

[...] All of them agreed that Gongsun Du would succeed if he did so.

General, you command thousands of troops, yet you sit here and watch others attack and destroy each other. As a subject of the Han Empire, is this what you should be doing?

Now, General, you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> your forces west to attack Ye? All it takes is one morning to find out the result of this test of survival and destruction. General, I hope you know what is good for you." [...] Gongsun Du's subordinates were shocked when they heard what Liang Mao said.
