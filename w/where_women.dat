She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation <b>where</b> <b>women</b> are forbidden from publicly not doing so, though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs, even being praised in some corners. Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.|$|E
5|$|From 1961 to 1963, Ginsburg was a {{research}} associate and then {{associate director of the}} Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure, learning Swedish to co-author a book with Anders Bruzelius on civil procedure in Sweden. Ginsburg conducted extensive research for her book at Lund University in Sweden. Ginsburg's time in Sweden also influenced her thinking on gender equality. She was inspired observing the changes in Sweden <b>where</b> <b>women</b> were twenty to twenty-five percent of all law students, and one of the judges Ginsburg watched for her research was eight months pregnant and still working.|$|E
5|$|In {{countries}} <b>where</b> <b>women</b> {{have to do}} {{paid work}} in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E

5|$|Kerala's {{sex ratio}} of 1.084 {{is higher than}} that of the rest of India and is the only state <b>where</b> <b>women</b> outnumber men. While having the {{opportunities}} that education affords them, such as political participation, keeping up to date with current events, reading religious texts etc., these tools have still not translated into full, equal rights for the women of Kerala. There is a general attitude that women must be restricted for their own benefit. In the state, despite the social progress, gender still influences social mobility.|$|E
5|$|Sogdian and Chinese merchants {{regularly}} {{traded in}} slaves {{in and around}} Turpan during the Tang dynasty. In 639 a female Sogdian slave was sold to a Chinese man as recorded in an Astana cemetery legal document written in Sogdian. Khotan and Kucha were places <b>where</b> <b>women</b> were commonly sold, with ample evidence {{of the slave trade}} in Turfan thanks to contemporary textual sources that have survived.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to Singh's interpretation of Kabir's gender views, Dass interprets Rag Asa section of Adi Granth as Kabir asking a young married woman to stop veiling her face, {{and not to}} adopt such social habits. Dass adds that Kabir's poetry can be interpreted in two ways, one literally <b>where</b> the <b>woman</b> refers to human female, another allegorically <b>where</b> <b>woman</b> is symbolism for his own soul and Rama is the Lord-husband.|$|R

5|$|Various folk traditions across Europe are analyzed, {{such as the}} Alpine Perchtenlaufen, <b>where</b> <b>women</b> broke social {{conventions}} {{by attacking}} men or engaging in lesbianism. Duerr compares these traditions to the benandanti of early modern Friuli, and to the Livonian werewolf, viewing them as representing the clash between order and chaos. Christian society in the Late Middle Ages began to construe the witch as a creature inside of society rather than outside it, which partly led to the witch trials of the early modern period. Duerr argues that the societies of European Christendom began to increasingly accept female nudity in art and fashion during the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Women have {{traditionally}} been disadvantaged {{in terms of economic}} and social status and power, which in turn reduces their access to the necessities of life including health care. Despite recent improvements in western nations, women remain disadvantaged with respect to men. The gender gap in health is even more acute in developing countries <b>where</b> <b>women</b> are relatively more disadvantaged. In addition to gender inequity, there remain specific disease processes uniquely associated with being a woman which create specific challenges in both prevention and health care.|$|E
5|$|World War II had a {{significant}} impact on changing family roles. Because of the draft, workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women, mainly in nontraditional positions. This increase in working women became one of the few times in history <b>where</b> <b>women</b> were praised for work outside the home. Divorce rates also reached a new high during this period. Not only had many women found a new sense of independence, but cultural shifts were underway, including the rise of feminism and the development of reliable methods of birth control. Such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages.|$|E

5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can be construed as expressions of romantic desire. Much of {{the daily lives of}} women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances <b>where</b> <b>women</b> appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions {{and other}} {{literary}} records indicate the Rashtrakutas selected {{the crown prince}} based on heredity. The crown did not always pass on to the eldest son. Abilities were considered more important than age and chronology of birth, as exemplified by the crowning of Govinda III who was the third son of king Dhruva Dharavarsha. The most important position under the king was the Chief Minister (Mahasandhivigrahi) whose position came with five insignia commensurate with his position namely, a flag, a conch, a fan, a white umbrella, a large drum and five musical instruments called Panchamahashabdas. Under him was the commander (Dandanayaka), the foreign minister (Mahakshapataladhikrita) and a prime minister (Mahamatya or Purnamathya), {{all of whom were}} usually associated with one of the feudatory kings and must have held a position in government equivalent to a premier. A Mahasamantha was a feudatory or higher ranking regal officer. All cabinet ministers were well versed in political science (Rajneeti) and possessed military training. There were cases <b>where</b> <b>women</b> supervised significant areas as when Revakanimaddi, daughter of Amoghavarsha I, administered Edathore Vishaya.|$|E
5|$|On board Arctic, disquiet turned {{increasingly}} into panic as {{it became}} clear that lifeboat capacity was inadequate. Shortly after the port guard boat's departure, the port quarter boat, with around twelve women and five crew aboard, was being readied for lowering into the water when it, too, was rushed by members of the crew. In the general melee the boat was upended, sending all but three of its occupants into the water, where they drowned. On {{the other side of the}} ship, Luce ordered Second Officer Baalham to launch the starboard guard boat and proceed with it to the stern, <b>where</b> <b>women</b> and children passengers would be passed down. No sooner was it launched when it was overwhelmed by men, who leapt into the water and clambered into the boat; all but one of these were crew members. With his boat now full, Baalham disregarded Luce's instructions to pick up women and children, and drifted away. Meanwhile, the upended port quarter boat had been righted, but despite Luce's efforts to give women passengers priority, it was again rushed by crew and male passengers, who thrust aside the waiting women and cut the boat adrift from the ship while it was only partially filled.|$|E

Almost every growing young girl would be the better in health, and therefore handsomer, for two hours of active housework daily; and the habit of usefulness thereby gained would be an equal advantage to her moral development. The labors of modern, well-arranged houses are not in any sense severe; they are as gentle as any kind of exercise that can be devised, and they bring into play muscles {{that ought to be}} exercised to be healthily developed.|$|R
