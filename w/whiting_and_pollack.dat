40|$|Striped {{red mullet}} (Mullus surmuletus) {{belongs to the}} species for which individualization of stocks is {{advanced}} by ICES in western Europe for areas including the Bay of Biscay and the areas bordering the Iberian peninsula. Since 2012, ICES has provided recommendations with regards to this stock. These recommendations are given for two years and are based on an approach adopted by ICES in 2012 in the case of insufficient data for an analytical evaluation (Data Limited Stocks, DLS). For 2013 and 2014, ICES advice consisted in a 20 % reduction in catches (average of the last 3 years:- 2009 - 2011) as a precautionary measure. Since that, no new advice has been formulated, the advice remains the same. Considering the impacts of such measurements on the French fishing fleet, improvement of the data available for stocks in the DLS category is therefore a priority. The project ROMELIGO aims to change this situation by contributing to the improvement of the knowledge on three stocks (striped red mullet, <b>whiting</b> <b>and</b> <b>pollack)</b> {{on the basis of the}} available data (declaring landing data or sampling data for French fishermen, data from scientific campaigns, etc.) or data to be collected (biological parameters). The first phase of the project analyzes the catches and the activity of the French professional fishery with regards to the species (composition and evolution of catches, seasonality, spatial distribution, gear used and discards). This WD provides the results of this phase regarding striped red mullet with as a preamble a bibliographic review on the biology of the species...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{present the}} pollack {{part of the}} study Striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus), whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and pollack (Pollachius pollachius) are three species for which individualization of stocks is advanced by ICES in western Europe for areas including the Bay of Biscay and the areas bordering the Iberian peninsula. Since 2012, ICES has provided recommendations with regards to these stocks. These recommendations are given for two‐year periods and are based on an approach adopted by ICES in 2012 in the case of insufficient data for an analytical evaluation (Data Limited Stocks, DLS). For 2013 and 2014, ICES recommended reducing catches by 20 % as a precautionary measure compared to 2009 ‐ 2011 for the three stocks. Considering that TACs are in force for <b>whiting</b> <b>and</b> <b>pollack</b> in the Bay of Biscay, the lack of diagnosis and the application of a precautionary approach could result in reductions in French fishing possibilities. Rapid improvement of the data available for stocks in the DLS category is therefore a priority. This project aims to change this situation by contributing to the improvement of the knowledge on these three stocks {{on the basis of the}} available data (declaring landing data or sampling data for French fishermen, data from scientific campaigns, etc.) or data to be collected (biological parameters). The first phase of the project will analyze the catches and the activity of the French professional fisheries with regards to the three species (composition and evolution of catches, seasonality, spatial distribution, gear used and discards). For pollack, in addition to the existing data, this phase will also rely on the collection of data on catches on land by professional structures...|$|E
40|$|Samples {{collected}} regularly {{from the}} intake screens of power stations between July 1972 and June 1977 {{demonstrate that the}} Gadidae is the most abundant and diverse teleost family in the inner Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary. The first records for the Severn Estuary of two cold water species, northern rockling and Norway pout, which were present in appreciable numbers, {{may be related to}} the effects of the changes that commenced in south-western English waters during the 1960 s. Maximum numbers of the five most abundant gadoids were attained in different years, with the greatest catches being recorded for <b>whiting</b> <b>and</b> poor cod in 1975 / 6, bib <b>and</b> <b>pollack</b> in 1974 / 5 and northern rockling in 1976 / 7. Peak abundance in the middle estuary was reached by whiting, bib, poor cod <b>and</b> <b>pollack</b> in the autumn and by northern rockling in the winter or early spring. The 0 + age class of these species, which was always by far the most predominant category, showed increases in mean length during their relatively short stay in the estuary. Movement out of the shallows of the inner Severn Estuary by <b>whiting</b> <b>and</b> also apparently by some other gadoids occurred when salinities fell below 10 ‰. The size of poor cod <b>and</b> <b>pollack</b> in the autumn was not as great in 1974 as in 1975 and 1976, presumably reflecting the effect on growth of lower summer temperatures in the first of these years. Poor cod was represented by five age classes and attained at the end of the first to fifth years of life standard lengths of approximately 80 mm (≡ 4. 8 g), 110 mm (≡ 11. 7 g), 140 mm (≡ 23. 0 g), 170 mm (≡ 39. 6 g) and 210 mm (≡ 71. 6 g) respectively...|$|R
5000|$|The {{coastline}} of Pembrokeshire has {{an extensive}} wild fishery with small fishing fleets traditionally {{operating out of}} Fishguard, St Davids, Solva, Tenby and Milford Haven. The larger fishing trawlers operate from Milford Haven, which was recognised by Lord Nelson as [...] "one of the greatest natural harbours in the world". In 1890, there were 1,660 fishing vessels using Milford Haven's docks and it became one of Britain's most successful fishing ports. However, Milford Haven became less busy after World War II, although in 1950 its trawlers still landed about 5-6% of the UK's wet fish (chiefly European hake) and had the UK's fifth largest fleet.Milford Haven now acts mainly {{as a base for}} foreign-registered trawlers which export most of their catch to continental markets. The trawlers and small fishing craft bring prosperity to Milford Haven and exploit the hake-fishery of the west coast and south-west of Ireland, with herring being landed in season. Prime fish landed at the port includes common sole, turbot, plaice, monkfish and European seabass, which fetch high prices. The smaller trawlers catch crab, lobster, crayfish, herring, <b>whiting,</b> <b>pollack</b> <b>and</b> salmon, or line fish for mackerel. The old fish market at Milford Haven docks has closed but a smaller, trade only, market has opened instead. Milford Haven also has a marina and restaurants.|$|R
