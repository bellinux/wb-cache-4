30|$|Of the 30 {{patients}} who started SCM, 8 (27 %) were lost to attrition. Odds of SCM attrition were higher in {{patients who}} lost[*]≤[*] 18.2 % of pre-LMR weight (OR: 12.25, P[*]=[*] 0.035), had lower satisfaction (≤ 7) pre-SCM (OR: 10.11, P[*]=[*] 0.040), and who expected further weight loss of 9.1  kg or more pre-SCM (OR: 10.11, P[*]=[*] 0.040). SCM completers significantly increased weight loss expectations by a median of 2.3  kg from pre-SCM to post-SCM (WSR P[*]=[*] 0.049) that paralleled <b>weight</b> <b>regained</b> post-SCM (2.7  kg).|$|R
50|$|In {{both these}} {{variants}} {{a total of}} only about 45 cm (18 in) of normally absorptive small intestine was retained in the absorptive stream, compared with the normal length of approximately 7 metres (20 ft). In consequence, malabsorption of carbohydrate, protein, lipids, minerals and vitamins inevitably occur. Where the end-to-side technique was used, reflux of bowel content back up the defunctionalized small intestine allowed absorption {{of some of the}} refluxed material, resulting in less weight loss initially and greater subsequent <b>weight</b> <b>regain.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that, in order to maintain their weight reduction, patients must carefully follow post-operative guidelines relating to diet, exercise, and band maintenance. <b>Weight</b> <b>regain</b> is possible with any weight loss procedure, including the more radical procedures that initially result in rapid weight loss. The National Institutes of Health recommendation for weight loss is 1 to 2 pounds (½ to 1 kilogram) per week, and an average banded patient may lose this amount. This is variable based on the individual and their personal circumstances, motivation, and mobility.|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} to {{continue}} and help others, Wing assisted in a project called STOP Regain, where she found that a self-regulation intervention through the internet or face-to-face {{had the ability to}} reduce the risk of <b>weight</b> <b>regain.</b> Knowing this, Wing created a study which compares successful weight losers with normal weight controls and obese controls in terms of behavioral measures and brain responses to food cues. Wing focused on whether successful weight losers who have reduced to normal weight now respond to food cues as always-normal weight controls, or if they continue to respond as if obese.|$|E
30|$|Several {{studies show}} that {{physical}} activity presents several benefits in individuals with obesity: improvement of co-morbidities, mortality, {{and quality of life}} (Flancbaum et al. 2006), and physical activity is important for weight maintenance (Thomas et al. 2015). PA {{plays a major role in}} minimizing the amount of <b>weight</b> <b>regained</b> after initial <b>weight</b> loss. (Swift et al. 2014). Patients with obesity should be encouraged to adhere to PA programs over the long-term regardless of the amount of weight loss achieved, since metabolic and cardiovascular benefits may be achieved even in the absence of weight loss (Swift et al. 2014).|$|R

50|$|Dieters {{who lose}} weight, {{particularly}} {{those with an}} overabundance of fat cells, experience a drop in levels of circulating leptin. This drop causes reversible decreases in thyroid activity, sympathetic tone, and energy expenditure in skeletal muscle, and increases in muscle efficiency and parasympathetic tone. The result is {{that a person who}} has lost weight below their natural body fat set-point has a lower basal metabolic rate than an individual at the same weight who is of that natural weight; these changes are leptin-mediated, homeostatic responses meant to reduce energy expenditure and promote <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> as a result of fat cells being shrunken below normal size. Many of these changes are reversed by peripheral administration of recombinant leptin to restore pre-diet levels.|$|E
5000|$|Cayenne pepper {{consumption}} dilates {{the blood}} vessels and speeds the metabolism due to the high amounts of capsaicin. With the consumption of cayenne peppers, the amount of heat the human body puts off is influenced. In animal studies, capsaicin {{has the ability to}} boost metabolism, which in turn causes weight loss. This increases circulation and blood flow to all major organs, facilitating oxygen and nutrient delivery. Capsaicin may support a healthy energy balance while suppressing appetite. Capsaicin has been shown to increase energy expenditure, so acts as a metabolism booster and is beneficial in long-term weight loss. [...] A correlation has been shown between substrate oxidation and capsaicin. Capsaicin treatment sustained fat oxidation during weight maintenance, but did not affect <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> after modest weight loss.|$|E
5000|$|There was {{resistance}} to give binge eating disorder {{the status of}} a fully fledged eating disorder because many perceived binge eating disorder to be caused by individual choices. Previous research has focused on the relationship between body image and eating disorders, and concludes that disordered eating might be linked to rigid dieting practices. [...] In the majority of cases of anorexia, extreme and inflexible restriction of dietary intake leads at some point to the development of binge eating, <b>weight</b> <b>regain,</b> bulimia nervosa, or a mixed form of eating disorder not otherwise specified. Binge eating may begin when individuals recover from an adoption of rigid eating habits. When under a strict diet that mimics the effects of starvation, the body may be preparing for a new type of behavior pattern, one that consumes a large amount of food in {{a relatively short period of}} time.|$|E
40|$|Yo-yo” dieting, or weight cycling, {{is defined}} as weight loss {{followed}} by subsequent regain of the lost weight. It is a phenomenon most often seen in overweight or obese individuals, but {{those who do not}} need to lose weight, such as athletes, actors, and models, also practice it. This review critically examines the recent literature on weight cycling with respect to metabolic changes, cardiovascular health, chronic disease, mortality, osteoporosis, and immunocompetence. No consistent positive association was found between weight cycling and metabolic changes, cardiovascular health, chronic disease, and mortality. Studies show possible harmful effects for large <b>weight</b> <b>regains</b> and some cardiovascular risk factors and type 2 diabetes in overweight/obese individuals. Harmful metabolic changes may also occur in young, normal weight women who do not need to lose weight, but this finding needs to be repeated.

50|$|In obesity chronically {{elevated}} levels of NPY can be seen, this has been seen in rats fed on a high fat diet for 22 weeks and resulted in a genetic mutation increasing NPY release due to a defective leptin signal compared to control rats. In humans increased levels of free NPY were found in obese women and not in their leaner counterparts, analysing human hypothalamus' for NYP concentration however is more difficult than rats. During weaning in rats there is an early expression of gene mutations that increase hypothalamic release of NPY in rats, however in humans multiple genes are commonly associated {{with the results of}} obesity and metabolic syndrome. In most obesity cases the increased secretion of NPY is a central / hypothalamic resistance to energy excess hormone signals such as leptin, that can be a result of a variety of reasons in the CNS. In rodents resistant to obesity when fed on an obesogenic diet they had a significantly lower amount of NPY receptor in the hypothalamus suggesting an increased activity of NPY neurones in obese rats meaning that the reduction in the release of NPY may be beneficial to the reduction of obesity incidence alongside the consumption of a healthy diet and exercise. This would need to be seen in human research before looking at this avenue of weight loss although currently {{there is some evidence that}} suggests NPY is a significant predictor in <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> after weight loss to maintain old levels of energy storage.|$|E
50|$|The Theory of Planned Behavior {{can also}} be applied in area of applied {{nutrition}} intervention. In {{a recent study by}} Sweitzer, TPB (in conjunction with SCT) was utilized to encourage parents to pack more fruits, vegetables and whole grains (FVWG) in sack lunches of preschool children. Behavioral constructs of TPD were used to develop intervention strategies. Knowledge/behavioral control, Self-efficacy/perceived behavioral control, subjective norms and intentions were measured to see effects on behavior. The results found a significant increase in vegetables and whole grains packed in lunches when interventions were planned using the TPB constructs. Psychosocial variables were useful predictors of lunch packing behaviors of parents and this study provided a divergent application of model-exploration of an area of parental behavior as a {{role in the development of}} young children’s dietary behaviors. In a study by McConnon, the application of the TPB was used to prevent <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> in an overweight cohort who recently experienced a significant weight loss. Using the constructs of TPB, it was found that perceived need to control weight is the most positive predictor of behavior for weight maintenance. The TPB model can be used to predict weight gain prevention expectation in an overweight cohort. The TPB {{can also be}} utilized to measure behavioral intention of practitioners in promoting specific health behaviors. In this study by Chase, dietitians’ intentions to promote whole grain foods was studied. It was found that the strongest indicator of intention of dietitians to promote whole grain foods was the construct of normative beliefs with 97% of dietitians indicating that health professionals should promote whole grains and 89% wanted to comply with this belief. However, knowledge and self-efficacy of instituting this belief was faulted with only 60% of dietitians being able to correctly identify a whole grain product from a food label, 21% correctly identifying current recommendations and 42% of dietitians did not know there was a recommendation for whole grain consumption. Although the response rate to complete mailed surveys for this study was low (39%), the results provided preliminary data on the strong effect of normative beliefs on dietitian intentions to promote whole grain and the need for nutrition need for additional education for practicing dietitians focusing on increase knowledge and self-efficacy for promoting whole grains.|$|E
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} predictors of <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> after significant weight losses. This prospective study examined behavioral and psychological predictors of <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> in 261 successful weight losers who completed an 18 -month trial of <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> prevention that compared a control condition with self-regulation interventions delivered face-to-face or via the Internet. Linear mixed effect models were used to examine behavioral and psychological predictors of <b>weight</b> <b>regain,</b> both as main effects and as interactions with treatment group. Decreases in physical activity were related to <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> across all 3 groups, and increased frequency of self-weighing was equally protective in the 2 intervention groups {{but not in the}} control group. Increases in depressive symptoms, disinhibition, and hunger were also related to <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> in all groups. Although the impact of changes in restraint was greatest in the Internet group and weakest in the face-to-face group, the latter was the only group with increases in restraint over time and consequent decreases in magnitude of <b>weight</b> <b>regain.</b> Future programs should focus on maintaining physical activity, dietary restraints, and frequent self-weighing and should include stronger components to modify psychological parameters...|$|E
50|$|People {{following}} a low-carbohydrate can lose weight, but the diet {{is no more}} effective for this than a low-fat diet. Although weight loss may be rapid, initially {{as a result of}} water loss, when the diet stops <b>weight</b> is <b>regained</b> just as quickly. Any weight loss from following the diet is merely a result of reduced calorie intake. Overweight people pursuing a low-carbohydrate diet experience no superior benefit to cardiovascular health compared to those {{following a}} balanced weight-loss diet.|$|R
40|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} now being {{recognised}} as a global epidemic. Children in developed or industrialised countries, such as the UK and US currently demonstrate high levels of over-weight and obesity. The rise in childhood obesity is likely due to {{a complex set of}} interactions across a number of relevant social, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Each of these factors play pivotal roles on their own, and each requires their own interventions. In general, over-weight and obesity are assumed {{to be the result of}} the excessive intake of the type of calo-ries, fat, and sugar that are commonly found in soda drinks and purchased in "fast food" outlets. These convenience foods are becoming increasingly popular not just in industrialised nations, but in the developing world as well, causing a rise in obesity rates all around the world. Most researchers agree that prevention is the key strategy for controlling the current epi-demic of obesity. Prevention may include primary prevention of overweight or obesity, sec-ondary prevention or prevention of <b>weight</b> <b>regains</b> following <b>weight</b> loss, and avoidance of additional weight increase in obese persons unable to lose weight.

40|$|Background/objective: Weight loss {{is often}} {{followed}} by <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> after the dietary intervention (DI). Cellular stress is increased in adipose tissue of obese individuals. However, {{the relation between}} cellular stress and <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> is unclear. Previously, we observed increased adipose tissue cellular stress of participants regaining weight compared with participants maintaining weight loss. In the current study, we further investigated the relation between <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> {{and changes in the}} expression of stress-related genes and stress protein levels to determine possible predictors of <b>weight</b> <b>regain.</b> Participants/methods: In this randomized controlled trial, sixty-one healthy overweight/obese participants followed a DI of either a 5 -week very-low-calorie diet (500 kcal per day) or a 12 -week low-calorie diet (1250 kcal per day; WL period) with a subsequent 4 -week weight stable diet (WS period), and a 9 -month follow-up. The WL and WS period taken together was named the DI. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were collected in 53 participants for microarray and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. RNA and protein levels for a broad set of stress-related genes were correlated to the <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> percentage. Results: Different gene sets correlated to <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> percentage during WS and DI. Bioinformatics clustering suggests that during the WS phase-defined genes for actin filament dynamics, glucose handling and nutrient sensing are related to <b>weight</b> <b>regain.</b> HIF- 1 (hypoxia-inducible factor- 1) is indicated as an important regulator. With regard to DI, clustering of correlated genes indicate that LGALS 1, ENO 1 and ATF 2 are important nodes for conferring risk for <b>weight</b> <b>regain.</b> Conclusions: Our present findings indicate that the risk for <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> is related to expression changes of distinct sets of stress-related genes during the first 4 weeks after returning to energy balance, and during the DI. Further research is required to investigate the mechanistic significance of these findings and find targets for preventing <b>weight</b> <b>regain.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of obesity is still an issue of high public health significance. Dietary self-monitoring (DSM) {{has been identified as}} the key component in standard behavioral treatment (SBT) for obesity that supports weight loss maintenance. However, {{little is known about the}} process of the <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> in interventions using SBT. Previous research showed the temporal trend of adherence to DSM which preceded <b>weight</b> <b>regain.</b> We hypothesized that participants experienced the failure in adherence to DSM before the onset of <b>weight</b> <b>regain.</b> We then hypothesized that the adherence to daily time-contingent surveys in ecological momentary assessments (EMA) would protect people from behavioral failure and <b>weight</b> <b>regain.</b> Methods: In this study, we provided a data-driven protocol to define and analyze the <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> and behavioral failure. With the self-weighing data, we used piecewise linear model to detect the onset of <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> and classified participants as maintainers and regainers. We used Bai-Perron’s test to detect the failure in DSM adherence before <b>weight</b> <b>regain</b> and classified participants as collapsers and sustainers. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to cluster the longitudinal patterns of adherence to the time-contingent EMA surveys into two groups (the consistent group and the decline group).

40|$|AbstractIntroduction/objective: Jaw Wiring (JW) {{is one of}} the {{controversial}} treatment modalities for obese individuals. It aims at limiting the food intake of the patient resulting in weight loss. The authors conducted a literature review to explore the historical development, effectiveness, indications, advantages and disadvantages of Jaw Wiring (JW) as treatment modality for obese individuals. Data sources: PubMed, Scopus, Medline and Google Scholar have been searched for papers that addressed the effectiveness of JW in the treatment of obesity since 1979 till present. No restriction regarding the type of the articles has been considered. Results: JW as a method of obesity management is a highly controversial issue. Almost all papers are retrospective, uncontrolled trials with a small sample size or anecdotal opinions. However, current data indicate that although JW is efficient in weight loss relatively faster than other treatment modalities, <b>weight</b> <b>regaining</b> is a constant finding in approximately all patients after JW discontinuation. Aspiration of vomit, gingival diseases, teeth decalcification and temporomandibular disorders are potential side effects. Such extreme treatment method should be approached carefully in a properly selected category of obese patients.

40|$|Financial {{incentives}} {{are widely used}} in health behavior interventions. However, self-determination theory posits that emphasizing financial incentives can have negative consequences if experienced as controlling. Feeling controlled into performing a behavior tends to reduce enjoyment and undermine maintenance after financial contingencies are removed (the undermining effect). We assessed participants' context-specific financial motivation {{to participate in the}} Make Better Choices trial—a trial testing four different strategies for improving four health risk behaviors: low fruit and vegetable intake, high saturated fat intake, low physical activity, and high sedentary screen time. The primary outcome was overall healthy lifestyle change; weight loss was a secondary outcome. Financial incentives were contingent upon meeting behavior goals for 3 weeks and became contingent upon merely providing data during the 4. 5 -month maintenance period. Financial motivation for participation was assessed at baseline using a 7 -item scale (α =. 97). Across conditions, a main effect of financial motivation predicted a steeper rate of <b>weight</b> <b>regained</b> during the maintenance period, t(165) = 2. 15, P =. 04. Furthermore, financial motivation and gender interacted significantly in predicting maintenance of healthy diet and activity changes, t(160) = 2. 42, P =. 016, such that financial motivation had a more deleterious influence among men.

40|$|Important {{progress}} has been made in the past few years concerning the Obesity which is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing prevalence in adults and children, and authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21 st century.

Future research needs Public health research aimed at defining realistic goals and strategies to improve health in an environment conducive to high levels of overweight and obesity. Overweight children are more likely to have cardiovascular and digestive diseases in adulthood as compared with those who are lean. Consequently, both over-consumption of calories and reduced physical activity are involved in childhood obesity. Prevention may include primary prevention of overweight or obesity, secondary prevention or prevention of <b>weight</b> <b>regains</b> following <b>weight</b> loss, and avoidance of more weight increase in obese persons unable to lose weight.

Plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone (PA), and arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels and conventional liver and renal function tests were measured before and after 1, 2, and 7 days after the paracentesis. No complications were observed, but patients regained 37 % of the weight lost after 1 wk. Percent <b>weight</b> <b>regained</b> was significantly and directly correlated with PA concentration measured before the paracentesis.

A significant increase in PA occurred after paracentesis, with a maximum peak after 48 h. The increase in PA was not accompanied by changes in PRA, but {{was associated with a}} reduction of urinary sodium excretion.
