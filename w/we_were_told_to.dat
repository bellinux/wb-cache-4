500|$|The K Foundation's art campaign, Money: A Major Body Of Cash, {{failed to}} attract major gallery {{interest}} so, on 23 August 1994, Drummond and Cauty disposed of their one million pounds in an alternate fashion: they burnt {{it on the}} Scottish island of Jura. (See: K Foundation Burn a Million Quid). In an interview with Drummond, Cauty and Gimpo, Gimpo admitted to harbouring guilt about the million pounds burning; that if he'd burnt Whiteread's £40,000 the million pounds burning would never have happened. [...] "I should have burnt it. I had petrol all over the £40,000... We were due to wait until eleven o'clock until she came out, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> wait another two minutes... Rachel Whiteread came running out. She just grabbed the money and dragged it over the fence." [...] Carl Freedman also wished they'd burnt Whiteread's money. [...] "It would have been brilliant.... It {{would have been just}} totally outrageous. People would have been falling out of their-chairs, saying. 'I can't believe they just burned £40,000'".|$|E

Mackay described the incident: [...] "There was an explosion. It was a loud bang", said MacKay. [...] "When it happened, we heard the explosion, we heard the whistle overhead, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> get down and we did." [...] The incident happened {{on the same day}} that a suicide bomber detonated an explosive in Baghlan in the northeastern part of the country killing at least 35 including several politicians. While Taliban insurgents were suspected of being behind the bombing, it was not believed to be related to the attack in Kandahar.|$|E

In his memoirs, an SL activist from Bochnia wrote: [...] "Everything was carefully prepared. Members of Kraków's district of the party came to our village, instructing us what to do and how to act in case of trouble. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> light bonfires on August 14, as a sign that a large meeting of peasants was approaching". Rallies were organized not only in villages and towns, but also in cities. In Kraków, on Sunday, August 15, thousands of peasants with banners and orchestras gathered in the Jablonowski Square. A peasant from Bienczyce, Jakub Pszczola, gave a speech, in which he announced that the strike would begin on the next day. After his speech, leaflets were spread among those gathered, and peasants began singing their informal anthem [...] "Gdy naród do boju" [...] ("When The Nation Fights"). The leaflets informed about demands of the strikers, such as dissolution of the Parliament, release of political prisoners, change of the Constitution, and just distribution of social goods.|$|E

60|$|Now, I did {{not expect}} to draw much of a salary from the ship; so as to retire for life on the profits of my first voyage; but nevertheless, I thought that a dollar or two might be coming.

Therefore, as the second morning after our arrival, had been set apart for paying off the crew, Harry and I made our appearance on ship-board, with the rest. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> enter the cabin; and once again I found myself, after an interval of four months, and more, surrounded by its mahogany and maple.|$|E

40|$|Although aging affects how {{medications}} {{are used}} by our bodies, a major factor affecting how well a medication works {{is whether or not}} we take the medication as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>to.</b> If <b>we</b> don’t use medications as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>to,</b> they may hurt or even kill us. Many older adults do not take their medications correctly. There are a number of reasons why misuse occurs: ■ Not understanding how to take the medications ■ Not hearing how to take the medications ■ Not getting the medication ■ The medication tasting bad or bitter ■ Having a confusing dosage schedule ■ Missing some of the medications or skipping doses ■ Afraid to take the medications ■ Not being able to afford medications (medications costing too much money) ■ Not being able to get to the medication store ■ Not being able to read the labels or see the medications ■ Not being able to open “childproof ” medication bottles On the next page are some ways to avoid medication misuse.

60|$|Following into {{still another}} room, {{we were told}} that this was Sir Walter Raleigh's apartment, while {{confined}} in the Tower, so that it was within these walls that he wrote the History of the World. The room was formerly lighted by lancet windows, and must have been very gloomy; but, if he had the whole length of it to himself, it was a good space to walk and meditate in. On one side of the apartment is a low door, giving admittance, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>told,</b> <b>to</b> the cell where Raleigh slept; so we went in, and found it destitute of any window, and so dark that we could not estimate its small extent except by feeling about.
