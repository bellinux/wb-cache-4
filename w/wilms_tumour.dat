In many reported conditions the rare co-occurrence of <b>Wilms</b> <b>tumour</b> is probably due to chance.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a patient with}} a novel WT 1 pS 50 X germ line mutation, who developed bilateral <b>Wilms</b> <b>tumours,</b> both with stromal‐type histology. Both tumours showed loss of the wild type WT 1 allele (loss of heterozygosity (LOH)) and a tumour specific mutation in catenin beta 1 (CTNNB 1), S 45 P in the left and Δ 45 S in the right tumour. Molecular analysis of microdissected cells from the left tumour revealed the same S 45 P CTNNB 1 mutation in blastema, tubuli, stroma and muscle, and a different CTNNB 1 mutation (T 41 A) in stromal cells isolated from another area of the same slide. Microdissection of two areas of muscle cells from the right tumour revealed the same Δ 45 S mutation and no CTNNB 1 mutation nor LOH of WT 1 in normal kidney cells.

40|$|Background: Most Wilms tumours {{occur in}} {{otherwise}} healthy children, {{but a small}} proportion occur in children with genetic syndromes associated with increased risks of <b>Wilms</b> <b>tumour.</b> Surveillance for <b>Wilms</b> <b>tumour</b> has become widespread, {{despite a lack of}} clarity about which children are at increased risk of these tumours and limited evidence of the efficacy of screening or guidance as to how screening should be implemented. Methods: The available literature was reviewed.

Prospective evidence-based data on the efficacy of <b>Wilms</b> <b>tumour</b> screening would be difficult and costly to generate and are unlikely to become available in the foreseeable future. Conclusions: The following pragmatic recommendations have been formulated for <b>Wilms</b> <b>tumour</b> surveillance in children at risk, based on our review: (1) Surveillance should be offered to children at. 5 % risk of <b>Wilms</b> <b>tumour.</b> (2) Surveillance should only be offered after review by a clinical geneticist.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if there is a significant difference in the risk of developing <b>Wilms</b> <b>tumour</b> between patients with submicroscopic and those with visible deletions of the WT 1 tumour suppressor gene. METHODS: To determine which subjects had WT 1 deletions, high-resolution chromosomal deletion analysis of the 11 p 13 region was carried out in 193 people with aniridia. The rationale for this was that aniridia is caused by loss of function of one copy of the PAX 6 gene, and although most patients with aniridia have intragenic mutations, a proportion has deletions that also include the nearby WT 1 gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of patients with aniridia identifies people with WT 1 deletions regardless of whether they have <b>Wilms</b> <b>tumour,</b> allowing the deletion size to be correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: <b>Wilms</b> <b>tumour</b> was not observed in any case without a WT 1 deletion. Of subjects in whom WT 1 was deleted, 77 % with submicroscopic deletions (detectable only by high-resolution FISH analysis) presented with <b>Wilms</b> <b>tumour</b> compared with 42. 5 % with visible deletions (detectable by microscopy). This difference was significant. CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution deletion analysis is a useful tool for assessing the risk of <b>Wilms</b> <b>tumour</b> in neonates with aniridia.

50|$|There {{are several}} ways {{molecules}} (in this case, also known as ligands) can interact with DNA. Ligands may interact with DNA by covalently binding, electrostatically binding, or intercalating. Intercalation occurs when ligands of an appropriate size and chemical nature fit themselves in between base pairs of DNA. These ligands are mostly polycyclic, aromatic, and planar, and therefore often make good nucleic acid stains. Intensively studied DNA intercalators include berberine, ethidium bromide, proflavine, daunomycin, doxorubicin, and thalidomide. DNA intercalators are used in chemotherapeutic treatment to inhibit DNA replication in rapidly growing cancer cells. Examples include doxorubicin (adriamycin) and daunorubicin (both of which are used in treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma), and dactinomycin (used in <b>Wilm's</b> <b>tumour,</b> Ewing's Sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma).|$|R
