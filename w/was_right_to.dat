5|$|Irene is a Neoclassical tragedy written between 1726 and 1749 by Samuel Johnson. It has the {{distinction}} of being the work Johnson considered his greatest failure. Since his death, the critical consensus has been that he <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> think so.|$|E
5|$|The Abwehr <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> {{worry about}} the {{presence}} of British double agents within their secret service. They were at that time already running 'Garbo' (Juan Pujol), 'Zig-Zag' (Eddie Chapman) and 'Tricycle' (Dušan Popov), supposedly German agents to whom they were paying large sums of money, but who were in reality working for the British and were supplying the Germans with false information.|$|E
5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court. The note argued that establishing such broad legal precedent was outside the bounds of {{the authority of the}} Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> reverse. Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E

5|$|After the South Carolina debate, Biden campaigned in California {{to begin}} May 2007 {{attending}} events in San Francisco. Later {{in the month}} after President George W. Bush enacted economic sanctions against Sudan to pressure the government to end the genocide in Darfur, Biden momentarily shifted focus from Iraq to the crisis in Darfur. He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief that Bush <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> enact the sanctions. However, Biden argued that it was not enough, calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E
5|$|Any large {{project was}} further delayed by the Franco-Prussian War, in which Bartholdi {{served as a}} major of militia. In the war, Napoleon III was {{captured}} and deposed. Bartholdi's home province of Alsace was lost to the Prussians, and a more liberal republic was installed in France. As Bartholdi had been planning {{a trip to the}} United States, he and Laboulaye decided the time <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> discuss the idea with influential Americans. In June 1871, Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic, with letters of introduction signed by Laboulaye.|$|E

25|$|Justice Johnson {{noted that}} Indians are indeed subject to more severe {{punishment}} and a broader prohibition under the Indian Act.

40|$|Academic {{discussions of}} {{securities}} policy often assume that investors are hyperrational and distrustful actors {{who do not}} need the protections of the securities laws to avoid being defrauded. The {{time has come to}} recognize the limitations of this assumption and to consider as well the possibility and implications of investor trust. Experienced policymakers and businesspeople (and certainly experienced con artists) have long known that trust is a potent force in explaining and manipulating investor behavior. They <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> They <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> believe that investor confidence-meaning investor trust-is important to the market. They <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> think that trust has been imperiled by the recent slew of securities frauds and accounting scandals. Finally, they <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> call for swift and sure action to restore investor trust...|$|R

25|$|She went {{on trips}} {{including}} several for missions. In 1860, she published, A Trip to Cuba, which told of her 1859 trip. It had generated outrage from William Lloyd Garrison, an abolitionist, for its derogatory view of Blacks. Julia believed it <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> free the slaves {{but did not}} believe in racial equality.) Several letters on High Newport society were published in the New York Tribune in 1860, as well.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic clergy at {{the time}} of the new Republic were keenly aware that anti-British {{sentiment}} made their canonical allegiance to Bishop Richard Challoner, the vicar-apostolic of the London district, somewhat suspect. As a result, they explored various options. When Bishop Challoner died in 1781, his successor, James Talbot, refused to exercise jurisdiction in the new nation. But the American clergy, then numbering some two dozen, did not feel the time <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have a bishop appointed in the new nation.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{persecution}} of Christians by past Roman Emperors had seemingly only strengthened Christianity, many of Julian's actions were designed to harass and undermine the ability of Christians to organize resistance to the re-establishment of paganism in the empire. Julian's preference for a non-Christian and non-philosophical view of Iamblichus' theurgy seems to have convinced him that it <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> outlaw {{the practice of the}} Christian view of theurgy and demand the suppression of the Christian set of Mysteries.|$|E

It was thought that half a million men could be {{evacuated}} to French North Africa, provided the British and French navies and air forces coordinated their efforts. Either at this meeting or on 16 June he urged Churchill in vain to throw more Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft into the Battle of France, but conceded there and then that Churchill <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> refuse.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{surprising}} in the context that West reacted to U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy differently from her colleagues. They saw a demagogue terrorizing liberals and leftists with baseless accusations of Communist conspiracy. West saw an oaf blundering into the minefield of Communist subversion. For her, McCarthy <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> pursue Communists with fervor, even if his methods were roughshod, though her mild reaction to McCarthy provoked powerful revulsion among those {{on the left and}} dismay even among anti-Communist liberals. She refused, however, to amend her views.|$|E

When a large Uzbek army invaded Khorasan in 1587, Murshid decided the time <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> overthrow Shah Mohammad. He rode to the Safavid capital Qazvin with the young prince and pronounced him king on 16 October 1587. Mohammad made no objection against his deposition and handed the royal insignia over to his son during the following year on 1 October 1588. Abbas was 17 years old.|$|E
