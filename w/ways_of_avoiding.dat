25|$|In 1908, two <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>avoiding</b> {{the paradox}} were proposed, Russell's type {{theory and the}} Zermelo set theory, the first {{constructed}} axiomatic set theory. Zermelo's axioms went well beyond Gottlob Frege's axioms of extensionality and unlimited set abstraction, and evolved into the now-canonical Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC). The essential difference between Russell's and Zermelo's solution to the paradox is that Zermelo altered the axioms of set theory while preserving the logical language {{in which they are}} expressed (the language of ZFC, with the help of Skolem, turned out to be first-order logic) while Russell altered the logical language itself.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Monteverdi {{had little}} enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>avoiding</b> or delaying work on it. He {{would accept the}} commission, he {{informed}} Striggio on 9 December 1616, {{because it was the}} wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide [...] "if you tell me to do so". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi. He informed Striggio that what he had first considered a rather monotonous piece he now thought fully appropriate to the occasion. He began work on the recitative sections, but before he could start setting the more expressive numbers, the duke {{had a change of heart}} and cancelled Monteverdi's commission. Le nozze di Tetide was abandoned; its libretto and whatever music existed have disappeared.|$|E
2500|$|The period {{also saw}} a steady {{increase}} in government involvement, especially in safety matters. The 1840 [...] "Act for Regulating Railways" [...] empowered the Board of Trade to appoint railway inspectors. The Railway Inspectorate was established in 1840, to enquire into the causes of accidents and recommend <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>avoiding</b> them. As early as 1844, a bill had been put before Parliament suggesting the state purchase of the railways; this was not adopted. It did, however, lead {{to the introduction of}} minimum standards for the construction of carriages and the compulsory provision of 3rd class accommodation for passengers - so-called [...] "Parliamentary trains".|$|E

2500|$|ExxonMobil {{integrated}} the then-current {{scientific understanding}} into its corporate operational planning. [...] For example, {{in the early}} 1980s, oil scarcity was a concern, and Exxon promoted unconventional and synthetic fuels based on fossil carbon sources, such as coal liquefaction, oil shale, and oil sands as a plausible solution. These methods increase carbon dioxide emissions, and internal Exxon documents from 1980 said that [...] "if synthetic fuels are not developed, and fossil fuel needs are met by petroleum, then the atmospheric [...] doubling time would be delayed by about 5 years to 2065". Exxon also studied <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>avoiding</b> [...] emissions if the East Natuna gas field (Natuna D-Alpha block) off Indonesia was to be developed.|$|E
2500|$|The best-known {{shortcoming}} is {{the glare}} of sunlight {{in many of the}} labs. [...] Kahn fervently believed in the importance of natural light and strongly preferred to work by a window himself, [...] "refusing to switch on an electric light even on the darkest of days." [...] Although he designed the labs to have an abundance of natural light, he was aware of the potential of having too much sunlight and worked to prevent it. [...] The screening material that he planned to use, however, was cut from the budget, and glare has been a persistent issue. The occupants have handled the problem in uncoordinated fashion by taping sheets of paper to the windows, hanging curtains and placing shelves and equipment in front of the windows. [...] A major preoccupation of Kahn's subsequent career was finding <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>avoiding</b> glare by providing natural light indirectly.|$|E
2500|$|Bennett {{says that}} his {{published}} work reflects interest {{in a number of}} theoretical issues in Religious Studies as well as in teaching and learning. These include the insider-outsider problematic, the relationship between theology, Religious Studies and the study of culture, the issue of objectivity, how colonial and neo-colonial attitudes influence the study of religions and post-modern approaches to textual interpretation. He acknowledges the influence of Edward Said, Clifford Geertz and Wilfred Cantwell Smith as well as Bishop Kenneth Cragg, among others. [...] According to Ahmad Schaffat, Bennett [...] "repeatedly shows concerns about how conclusions are influenced by our assumptions and backgrounds and gives some thought to the <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>avoiding</b> this influence". Bennett [...] "defines his approach in terms of Edward Said's criticism of Orientalism and Cantwell Smith's way of avoiding that type of criticism" [...] so that even when he [...] "describes at length some very hostile views of Christian writers on Islam and its prophet he either counters them by Muslim understanding or his own more favorable opinion." ...|$|E

2500|$|While it {{had been}} {{necessary}} to obtain an Act of Parliament {{to build a new}} railway, the government initially took a laissez faire approach to their construction and operation. The Government began to take an interest in safety matters, with the 1840 [...] "Act for Regulating Railways", which empowered the Board of Trade to appoint railway inspectors. The Railway Inspectorate was established in 1840 to enquire after the causes of accidents and recommend <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>avoiding</b> them. The first investigation was conducted by Colonel Frederic Smith into 5 deaths caused by a large casting falling from a moving train in 1840 (Howden rail crash). He also conducted an enquiry into the derailment on the GWR when a mixed goods and passenger train derailed on Christmas Eve, 1841. The train hit a landslide at Sonning (Railway accident at Sonning Cutting), killing 9 passengers. [...] As early as 1844 a bill had been put before Parliament suggesting the state purchase of the railways; this was not adopted. It did, however, lead to the introduction to minimum standards for the construction of third-class carriages, an issue raised by the Sonning accident, which {{came to be known as}} [...] "Parliamentary Carriages".|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, Swedish offers other <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>avoiding</b> using gender-specific pronouns; e.g., [...] "vederbörande" [...] ("the {{referred}} person") and [...] "man" [...] ("one", as in [...] "Man borde..."/"One should...") {{with its}} objective form [...] "en" [...] or alternatively [...] "en" [...] as both subjective and objective since [...] "man"/"one" [...] sounds {{the same as}} [...] "man"/"male adult" [...] although they are discernible through syntax. [...] "Denne" [...] ("this one") {{may be used to}} refer to a non-gender-specific referent already or soon-to-be mentioned ("Vederbörande kan, om denne så vill,..."/"The referent may, if they wish,..."). One method is rewriting into the plural, as Swedish - like English - has only gender-neutral pronouns in the plural. Another method is writing the pronoun in the referent's grammatical gender ("Barnet får om det vill."/"The child is allowed to, if it wants to." [...] The word [...] "barn" [...] is grammatically neuter, thus the use of the third-person neuter pronoun [...] "det"); some nouns retain their traditional pronouns, e.g., [...] "man"/"man" [...] uses [...] "han"/"he", [...] "kvinna"/"woman" [...] uses [...] "hon"/"she", and [...] "människa"/"human being" [...] uses [...] "hon"/"she". While grammatically correct, using [...] "den/det" [...] to refer to human beings may sound as if the speaker regards the referenced human beings as objects.|$|E
60|$|She {{has become}} a rather {{extraordinary}} rider, under the tutorship of a more than extraordinary teacher--BB, which is her pet name for Buffalo Bill. She pronounces it beeby. He has not only taught her seventeen ways of breaking her neck, but twenty-two <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>avoiding</b> it. He has infused into her the best and surest protection of a horseman--CONFIDENCE. He did it gradually, systematically, little by little, a step at a time, and each step made sure before the next was essayed. And so he inched her along up through terrors that had been discounted by training before she reached them, and therefore were not recognizable as terrors {{when she got to}} them. Well, she is a daring little rider, now, and is perfect in what she knows of horsemanship. By-and-by she will know the art like a West Point cadet, and will exercise it as fearlessly. She doesn't know anything about side-saddles. Does that distress you? And she is a fine performer, without any saddle at all. Does that discomfort you? Do not let it; she is not in any danger, I give you my word.|$|E

60|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} (i. 146) {{that some of}} the old Ionian colonists 'brought no women with them, but took wives of the women of the Carians, whose fathers they had slain. Therefore the women made a law for themselves, and handed it down to their daughters, that they should never sit at meat with their husbands, and that none should ever call her husband by his name.' In {{precisely}} the same way, in Zululand the wife may not mention her husband's name, just as in the Welsh fairy tale the husband may not even know the name of his fairy bride, on pain of losing her for ever. These ideas about names, and freakish <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>avoiding</b> the use of names, mark the childhood of languages, according to Mr. Max Muller, {74b} and, therefore, the childhood of Society. The Kaffirs call this etiquette 'Hlonipa.' It applies to women as well as men. A Kaffir bride is not called by her own name in her husband's village, but is spoken of as 'mother of so and so,' even before she has borne a child. The universal superstition about names is at the bottom of this custom. The Aleutian Islanders, according to Dall, are quite distressed when obliged to speak to their wives in the presence of others. The Fijians did not know where to look when missionaries hinted that a man might live under the same roof as his wife. {75a} Among the Turkomans, for six months, a year, or two years, a husband is only allowed to visit his wife by stealth.|$|E
