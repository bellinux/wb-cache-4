5|$|Hagerstrom {{was then}} sent to Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and Pinnnelas City Air Base in Florida, flying the Bell P-39 Airacobra and Curtiss P-40 Warhawk with the 20th Pursuit Group. In late September he was posted to the 8th Fighter Squadron (8th FS) of the 49th Operations Group and sent to San Francisco, California. After staying at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, he and forty other {{personnel}} moved on to Fort Mason, where sailed to Hawaii along with 1,500 other soldiers. They did not stay long, however, and set sail again, this time flanked by a naval task force. After an overnight stop at Suva, Fiji, they landed at their destination of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Initially there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> and nothing to do until Brigadier General Paul Wurtsmith, the commander of Fifth Fighter Command, organized a refresher session for the new pilots at Charters Towers Airport. In April1943, he and the P-40-equipped 8th FS relocated to Dobodura Airfield Complex in New Guinea. Shortly thereafter, {{he was promoted to}} first lieutenant.|$|E
25|$|During the Arameans' {{siege of}} Samaria, four leprous {{men at the}} gate asked each other why they should die there of starvation, when they might go to the Arameans, who would either save them or leave them no worse than they were. When at twilight, {{they went to the}} Arameans' camp, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there,</b> for God had made the Arameans hear chariots, horses, and a great army, and fearing the Hittites and the Egyptians, they fled, leaving their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and their camp. The lepers went into a tent, ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and {{clothing}} from the tents and hid it.|$|E
500|$|There is an {{apocryphal}} {{story of}} King emulating a famous baseball pitcher of the day, Rube Waddell, by sending all his fielders {{back into the}} pavilion and finishing off the opponent's innings on his own. King and Belmont were playing Trenton in the Halifax Cup at Elmwood Cricket Ground. Some versions of the story have him banishing the fielders and then calling {{one of them to}} a position [...] back and [...] to the leg side. This fielder was stationed there to pick up the bails which landed at his feet after King bowled his trademark [...] "angler". This story was disputed some years later by the captain of Trenton, who claimed that when he [...] "went in to bat that afternoon, King had four balls left in his over." [...] He claimed to have [...] "hit the first delivery to cover point but of course there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> The ball stopped within three feet of the boundary, and King had to chase it. By the time he got back we had run six." [...] The captain claimed to be the only batsmen to have hit four consecutive sixes off King, but commended the bowler on his ability to spin a tale.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; but we {{are certain}} that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there,</b> and that {{probably}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> has <b>been</b> <b>there</b> {{for the past two}} hundred years, and perhaps a good deal longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you mean?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "What rubbish is {{this you}} are talking, Kate?" [...] he added, in a sharper tone. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> that I know of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> Only a lout from Chelwood {{who brought}} me here. The {{people of the}} house are safe enough. They have plenty of secrets of their own to keep." ...|$|R
2500|$|... “I {{always knew}} {{in my heart}} one day'that my work would find its way,'I could not tell you how,'there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> for me to show the way'but I figured it out.'I figured it all through {{for all of you}} to see today.”~Ellie Manette ...|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics {{reflect the}} concern felt by Strummer about world events with the {{reference}} to [...] "a nuclear error" [...] to the incident at Three Mile Island, which occurred earlier in 1979. Joe Strummer has said: [...] "We felt that we were struggling about to slip down a slope or something, grasping with our fingernails. And there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> to help us." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{she looked}} for the girl as we entered. But there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 25. Jenny: Jenny {{arrives at}} school late, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there,</b> except for three strange and mysterious men. It is {{revealed}} {{at the end}} of the chapter that she came to school on a Saturday.|$|R
6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [Rushes to {{the door}} of the room.] It is not enough. I insist on going into this room. You have told me <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there,</b> so what reason can you have for refusing me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another fool's hour like this," [...] he muttered, [...] "and {{the fever}} will have me. Come {{out of the}} shadows, you white-faced, skulking reptile, you--bah! what a blithering fool I <b>am!</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there!</b> How could there be any one?" ...|$|R
60|$|The doctor turned silently away. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> {{to see his}} {{expression}} as he walked towards the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> {{who could}} say," [...] Arnold declared. [...] "There were no {{servants}} {{in that part}} of the house, there had been no visitors, and Mr. Weatherley had been in bed since half-past nine. We telephoned for a doctor, and we fetched Mr. Weatherley out of bed. Then a strange thing happened. We took Mr. Weatherley to the room, which we had left for less than five minutes, and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> The man had been carried away." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{seemed to}} {{indicate}} that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> He took the key, unlocked the door, carried her in, and secured it carefully behind them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I move we stay in Ithaca over night," [...] said Tom. [...] "If {{we got to}} Oak Run {{at three}} in the morning, what would we do? <b>There</b> would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> to meet us, and it's a beastly hour for rousing anybody out." ...|$|R
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> {{why should}} I not look in that room? Arthur, you must {{let me go}} into that room and satisfy myself. Let me know that no eavesdropper has heard my life’s secret. Arthur, you don’t realise what I am going through.|$|R
6000|$|... "Were she not, {{she would}} not want to come to me. Your society is in London, to which she does not come, or in other country houses than your own, to which she is not taken. She lives {{altogether}} at Clavering, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> except your uncle." ...|$|R
6000|$|So, at last, lest he divide us, [...] I {{would put}} them to the test. [...] There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> beside us, [...] Save this interloping guest.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> {{but the old}} people, {{who were}} looking at him in bewilderment. They did not notice any {{confusion}} in Agnes's face. She recovered first.|$|E
60|$|In {{all that}} hall, filled {{with such a}} multitude, there was breathless silence. It was so still that the little mice came out of their holes, {{thinking}} there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{shall see}} whether it is impossible. I have got beyond caring very much what people say now. I know the kind of way papa would be thrown over if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> to back him. I shall be there and I will ask Lord Rufford to his face whether we did not become engaged when we were at Mistletoe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, dear; {{the house}} is desolate and cold. You shall not go there. You shall come to our house, {{and we will do}} for you the best we can there, and you shall <b>be</b> comfortable. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> but mother, and she is kind and gracious. She will {{understand}} that your father has died, and that you are alone." ...|$|R
5000|$|The boys contact {{their friend}} within the police department, former gang member Gabe Moreno, and {{together}} {{they go to the}} hotel to investigate the matter further. When they enter the suite in question with the help of hotel manager Schidlap, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> and <b>no</b> body to <b>be</b> found. The room is supposed to be inhabited by a man named [...] "Silky" [...] Thomas.|$|R
60|$|Just here, Mrs. Chipperton kissed us both again. This {{made several}} times that she had done it. We didn't care so much, as there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> but {{ourselves}} and the Chippertons.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> The cowboys had {{all gone}} to their work, Laura had {{passed out of}} sight across the ridge in the distance. Lenora {{staggered}} to the cook wagon, where the Chinese cook was sitting cleaning plates.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And so,' said Florence, 'though I {{would prefer}} to have gone when there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there,</b> instead of in this {{vacation}} time, when it seems there are some young people staying in the house, I have thankfully said yes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is nothing," [...] {{replied the}} high priest nervously, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> The place <b>is</b> vacant. Once it was used but not now for many years," [...] and he moved on toward the gateway which led back into the palace. Here he and the priests halted while Tarzan with Ko-tan and his warriors passed out from the sacred precincts of the temple grounds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you come}} this way," [...] she said, [...] "into the drawing-room? <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> just now. Most {{of my people}} are upstairs {{dressing}} for dinner. The gentlemen are so particular now, and a good thing too, I say. I was always used to it, and I think it gives quite a tone to an establishment. Please sit down, Miss--dear me, I haven't asked you your name yet." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yehudai ben Nahman (or Yehudai Gaon; Hebrew: יהודאי גאון, sometimes: Yehudai b. Nahman) was {{the head}} of the yeshiva in Sura from 757 to 761, during the Gaonic period of Judaism. He was {{originally}} a member of the academy of Pumbedita, but the exilarch Solomon ben Hisdai appointed him as Gaon of Sura as [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> (at Sura) as distinguished as he is for wisdom".|$|R
60|$|Juliette {{apparently}} had lost {{none of her}} calm, and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> sufficiently interested in her personality to note the tinge of delicate colour which, at the first word of Déroulède, had slowly mounted to her pale cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Maud {{looked out}} on to the balcony. Her heart, which had stood still when the {{rejected}} one opened the window and stepped forth to commune with the soothing stars, beat again. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there,</b> only emptiness and Plummer.|$|E
60|$|He {{took up the}} {{revolver}} with a shaking hand. Four of the chambers were empty. He paused a moment and looked suspiciously out into the night, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> He quickly slipped four cartridges into the empty chambers and locked {{the revolver}} in his drawer.|$|E
5000|$|... "None {{of those}} {{concerned}} with Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistrian settlement plan to violate international law, tear up existing accords, destroy the agreed settlement formats and bomb civilian residents and peacekeepers. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> {{who would like}} to ensure territorial integrity by mass killing of people whom you consider your citizens, residents of your own country. There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> parallels here. Thank God Saakashvili is the sole phenomenon of its kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, Sankey, I {{wish you}} would come over one day next week and dine with me; <b>there</b> will <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>there</b> except my daughter." ...|$|R
60|$|At last, {{sure that}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> in <b>there,</b> he crept in. Then {{he made a}} discovery. There were beech nuts in there and there were seeds.|$|R
