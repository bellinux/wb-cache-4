40|$|Vibration {{and wear}} debris {{analyses}} {{are the two}} main conditions monitoring techniques for machinery maintenance and fault diagnosis. These two techniques have their unique advantages and disadvantages associated with the monitoring and fault diagnosis of machinery. When these techniques are conducted independently, {{only a portion of}} machine faults are typically diagnosed. However, practical experience has shown that integrating these two techniques in a machine condition monitoring program provides greater and more reliable information, bringing significant cost benefits to industry. The objective of this work is to investigate the correlation between vibration analysis and wear debris analysis. This was achieved by investigating different operating conditions of an experimental rig, consisting of a <b>worm</b> <b>gearbox</b> driven by an electric motor. The <b>worm</b> <b>gearbox</b> was initially run under normal operating conditions as a comparative test. A series of tests were then conducted corresponding to lack of proper lubrication, and with different contaminant particles added to the various lubricants. Oil samples and vibration data were regularly collected. Numerical data produced by wear debris analysis were compared with vibration spectra, in order to quantify the effectiveness of the two condition monitoring techniques. The results from this paper have given more understanding on the dependent and independent roles of vibration and wear debris analyses in predicting and diagnosing machine faults. ...|$|E

40|$|Diagnostics of {{worm gear}} defects with {{vibration}} analysis is challenging {{and this is}} reflected in the limited number of publications. However, these gears are commonly used in many applications such as escalators, mills, and conveyors, and significant cost may arise from their down time due to unidentified defects. This paper aims to apply various vibration analysis techniques to diagnose the presence of naturally developed faults within <b>worm</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> The condition of three different <b>worm</b> <b>gearboxes</b> were assessed using various vibration signal analysis techniques including a few statistical measures, Spectral Kurtosis and enveloping. This was undertaken in an attempt to identify the presence of defects within the <b>worm</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> It is shown that irrespective of the predominantly sliding motion of the gears, diagnosis of faults is feasible as long as the appropriate analysis technique is employed. In addition the results show sensitivity to the direction of vibration measurement...|$|R

40|$|Vibration and {{temperature}} monitoring are the techniques for machinery maintenance and fault diagnosis that could predict the gears and bearings failure.,This {{research focuses on}} the condition monitoring of <b>worm</b> <b>gearbox</b> lubricated with contaminated gear oil. <b>Worm</b> <b>gearbox</b> consists of a spirally grooved screw moving against a toothed wheel. The main objectives are to characterize vibration behavior of worm gear as hction contaminated lubricant viscosity. Experimental test rig with inverter, electric motor and gearbox was developed and employed for this research. New gear oil with IS 0 VG 100, 460 and 680 had been indentified to serve the sliding friction of both gears as a comparison to contaminated oil. A predetermine speed of electric motof at 900, 1150 and 1400 WM {{was introduced to the}} gearbox and a set of vibration instrumentations with ICP accelerometer model PCB 393 B 04 was installed as to capture the vibration signal generated. As to enhance the effectiveness of condition monitoring techniques, temperature rising in the gear oil upon the testing period was monitored using PicoLog USB TC- 08 Data Logger and later to be analyzed. The experiment had revealed that oil with higher viscosity will contribute to less vibration spectrum. At 900 RPM for IS 0 VG 100, IS 0 VG 460 and IS 0 VG 680 the vibration reduction percentage within new and contaminated gear oil were 5 1. 02 %, 24. 66 % and 5 1. 3 0 % respectively. The temperature monitoring for IS 0 VG 100, 460 and 680 for new and contaminated oil were observed within 34. 97 "C, 35. 67 "C and 39. 27 "C respectively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental method for determining the efficiency of worm gears. Research into worm gears is primarily aimed at increasing the load carrying capacity, prolongation of life cycle and/or achieving higher efficiency, which can result in a reduction in exploitation costs. A larger share of sliding movement with respect to sliding-rolling movement of gearing contributes to the quiet operation but, on the other hand, causes a significant power loss. Very often, the load limit is not put by the load carrying capacity of gearing but by the ability to carry away the heat caused by friction. In order to design a <b>worm</b> <b>gearbox</b> that would be closer to the optimal solution from the temperature point of view (the heat), it is necessary to determine the operation losses. Besides the geometry of gearing, which influences the efficiency by forming conditions required for the creation of hydrodynamic lubrication, the applied lubricant also plays a significant role. In the research presented in this paper, mineral and synthetic oils were used for the combination of materials CuSn 12 / 16 MnCr 5 used for gears operating at variable output load and two different rotational speeds...|$|E
40|$|Machine {{condition}} monitoring {{has become a}} vital component of maintenance programs in machine intensive operations, such as the mining, mineral processing and manufacturing industries. Vibration and oil analysis have become the two most commonly used techniques for fault detection and tracking. These techniques are generally used independently as expert knowledge is required in each field, and {{due to a lack}} of understanding about how to integrate them. However, numerous case studies of machine failures have reported on the benefit of a correlated approach. This project focused on the development of an analytical strategy that, for the first time analyses vibration data in conjunction with oil and wear debris data for machine health assessment. In order to achieve the goal of developing a strategy for correlated application of vibration, oil and wear particle analysis using artificial intelligence, a number of project objectives were identified. The project objectives were to investigate the fault detection abilities of {{condition monitoring}} techniques as a basis for developing a correlated strategy, and finally to implement this strategy using artificial intelligence. These objectives were collated into a project plan that consisted of a comprehensive survey of condition monitoring techniques and correlation investigation, correlation strategy development, expert system development and a testing phase. The project was performed in a number of stages to allow the progress to be monitored. The first stage comprised a thorough literature review to ascertain the current research status in the condition monitoring field, as well as confirming the project objectives. The second and third stages were concerned with the preparation of spur and <b>worm</b> <b>gearbox</b> laboratory test rigs, and the operation of suitable experiments. The measured condition monitoring data allowed the fault detection of the vibration, oil and wear particle analysis techniques to be assessed. The data was also used for verification of the correlation strategy developed in stage four. Stage five was concerned with the development of three expert systems for vibration analysis, oil and wear particle analysis, and correlated condition analysis respectively. The expert system for correlated condition analysis was constructed using the correlation strategy of stage four of the project. All expert systems were thoroughly tested using laboratory and industry derived data to verify correct operation. The outcomes of this research project contribute to the current academic knowledge of the condition monitoring field, as well as provide industry with potential economic and environmental benefits. The novel strategy for correlation of vibration, oil and wear particle analysis techniques, as well as the demonstration of the effectiveness of the developed expert systems are contributed to the academic research community. The expert systems include additional innovative features such as a fault root-cause analysis algorithm, and a new strategy for machine remaining lifetime estimation using a wear approach that can be updated using condition monitoring data. The fully functional expert system software package complete with user interface is contributed to the industry partner Industrial and Technical Services for potential future commercialisation. The developments of this project can provide significant benefits to the mining, mineral processing and manufacturing industries if the project outcomes are implemented. The correlated condition monitoring strategy allows improved early fault detection, more reliable fault diagnosis and the ability to perform root-cause analysis, compared to conventional vibration, oil and wear particle analysis. These advances combine to improve the efficiency of the maintenance program resulting in increasing machine uptime, reduced maintenance costs and lower environmental impact. The adoption of the project developments could therefore ultimately improve the profitability of the venture, and help Australian operations to remain financially viable on a global scale...|$|E
40|$|Material {{handling}} {{is undoubtedly}} {{the most important}} and in fact an indispensable job in industries for it is encountered at every stage right from the time raw materials enter the factory gate to the point when it leaves in form of finished products. The engineering of material handling falls under two categories depending on form of material: bulk solid handling and unit handling. In case of handling lumpy materials like coals etc., feeder plays a vital role as an uninterrupted source of uniform feed provider to the conveyor system. Although several feeders like belt, apron, screw, feeders etc are available, reciprocating feeders are still in use because it ensures a continuous and controlled feed rate, is low in cost, its drive mechanism is simple, it can handle wide range of miscellaneous materials including lumps, easy in assembly and disassembly and maintenance requirement is quite low. The challenge which we have taken via the project, is to design a drive mechanism for a reciprocating coal feeder. We call it a challenge because we have to design various intricate components like couplings, <b>worm</b> reducers, <b>gearbox</b> etc. We call it complicated since all the components are interdependent on each other to a great extent. So we cannot design anything randomly. We have to take into considerations the smallest of small things like the various forces acting, how each component can fail under various stress conditions. We have to optimize everything right from the motor selection, to speed reduction ratio selection, to the capacity of coal which we can handle. We are going to follow the above-mentioned strategies so that our project does not remain just a theory but can become a reality for industries...|$|R
