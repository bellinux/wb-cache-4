25|$|Unicorns are a cricket team in England {{that was}} formed in 2010 {{specifically}} {{to play in the}} Clydesdale Bank 40 limited overs competition. They played in that competition until 2013 and since 2014 the Unicorns team has competed in the Second XI one-day and Twenty20 competitions. The 2014 season also included a 50-over match against Sri Lanka A. Members of the squad are all players <b>without</b> <b>current</b> full-time contracts with one of the regular first-class counties.|$|E

Virtually {{none of the}} receivers made before 2008 support the new codec, however, thus making them partially obsolete once DAB+ broadcasts begin and completely obsolete once the old MPEG-1 Layer 2 stations are switched off. Most new receivers are both DAB and DAB+ compatible; however, the issue is exacerbated by some manufacturers disabling the DAB+ features on otherwise compatible radios to save on licensing fees when sold in countries <b>without</b> <b>current</b> DAB+ broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 season saw Miles {{play for}} Norfolk, with him making four {{appearances}} {{for the county}} in that seasons Minor Counties Championship. In that same season he also signed for the Unicorns team which would {{take part in the}} 2010 Clydesdale Bank 40, a team formed of players <b>without</b> <b>current</b> full-time contracts with one of the regular first-class counties. He made his List A debut for the team against Sussex. Miles has made twelve further List A appearances for the team, the last of which came against Gloucestershire in the 2011 Clydesdale Bank 40. In his thirteen appearances for the Unicorns, he has taken a total of 10 wickets at an average of 53.10, with best figures of 3/49.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} a u-p {{approximation}} for the dynamic response of a porous seabed to nature dynamic loadings is proposed. Unlike most previous research, {{the effects of}} currents are considered in the new analytical solution. Based on the numerical examples, the significant influence of combined wave and current loadings on seabed response in shallow water is concluded. This influence affects not only the amplitudes of the seabed response but also the distributions of the space region. The relative difference of the maximum pore pressure between different direction currents can reach 8 % of the static water pressure. In addition, the relative difference of maximum liquefaction depth between the previous model (<b>without</b> <b>currents)</b> and the present model can reach 19 % of the maximum liquefaction depth of the case <b>without</b> <b>currents.</b> Full Tex...|$|R

2500|$|In 2011, then-mayor Thomas Menino {{proposed}} ferry service between East Boston and Fan Pier on the South Boston Waterfront, a route <b>without</b> <b>current</b> {{direct transit}} service. In August 2012, the Federal Highway Administration awarded $1.28 {{million to the}} city for the purchase of two boats. In September 2012, the Boston Redevelopment Authority accepted the grant and agreed to rehabilitate the East Boston Marine Terminal for the ferries, which were then expected to begin operation in 2013. In August 2014, the MBTA opened bidding for providing the two boats for East Boston service. Bidding is expected to close on September 10, 2014.|$|E
2500|$|No single {{definition}} of [...] "polyamory" [...] has universal acceptance. Although many individuals would define polyamory as a relationship practice or form, {{some believe that}} it should be classified an orientation or identity (like sexual orientation or gender identity). Most definitions of polyamory center on the concepts provided by Ravenheart's definition. Areas of difference arise regarding the degree of commitment, such as in the practice of casual sexual activities, and whether it represents a viewpoint or a relational status quo (i.e., whether a person <b>without</b> <b>current</b> partners should be considered [...] "polyamorous"). Polyamorous relationships can be open, where the relational partners agree to permit romantic or sexual relationships with other people, or closed, where those involved do not engage in relationships outside of the defined set of committed partners. [...] The practice of engaging in closed polyamorous relationships is sometimes called group marriage or polyfidelity.|$|E

40|$|The {{numerical}} model SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) for the computation of wave conditions {{in shallow water}} with ambient currents is briefly described. The model {{is based on a}} fully spectral representation of the action balance equation with all physical processes modelled explicitly. No a priori limitations are imposed on the spectral evolution. This makes the model a third-generation model. In Holthuijsen et al. (1993) and Ris et al. (1994) test cases for propagation, generation and dissipation have been shown <b>without</b> <b>currents.</b> Current effects have now been added and academic cases are shown here. The model is also applied in a fairly academic case of a shallow lake (Lake George, Australia) and in a complex, realistic case of an inter-tidal area with currents (Friesche Zeegat, the Netherlands). The results are compared with observations. A new development to formulate the model on a curvi-linear grid to accommodate linkage to hydro-dynamic circulation models is presented and a first test is shown...|$|R
