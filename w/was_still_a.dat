5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, there <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision {{would be made}} after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. Not wanting to risk the series being cut off {{in the middle of}} a story, he designed the first six issues to stand alone if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page of issue six so he would be prepared either way.|$|E

In 1976, he enrolled at the Agnita High School, which later became the Agro-Industrial High School. The same year, he gave up handball and began a more formal study of guitar music, using the Maria Boeru textbook as his guide. He debuted as an amateur actor in 1977, with a school theater performance at the Agnita House of Culture.|$|E

5|$|Christopher Báthory fell {{seriously ill}} after his wife's death. At his request, the Diet of Transylvania elected Sigismund voivode in Kolozsvár (present-day Cluj-Napoca in Romania) around 15May 1581. Since Sigismund <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> minor, his dying father tasked a council of twelve noblemen with the government. Christopher Báthory's cousin, Dénes Csáky, and his brother-in-law, Stephen Bocskai, headed the council. Christopher Báthory died on 27May.|$|E

5|$|Cook and Evans argue that, despite {{suffrage}} in Wales {{being introduced}} {{by a new}} generation of immigrant middle-class women, there <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> definite 'Welshness' to the ideology fostered by the nation, which was at loggerheads with their English counterparts. Wales had shown an independent resistance to the EFF and David Lloyd George <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> national institution, despite his prominent role in the government making him an obvious target for disruption. In 1911, after the Women's Coronation Procession, Edith Mansell Moullin formed the Cymric Suffrage Union, a Welsh society based in London. It attempted to link women's suffrage with Wales and Welshness, and sought to unite both Welsh men and women living in the capital to their cause. They distributed hand-bills written in Welsh to the Welsh chapels in London and translated pamphlets of the Conciliation Bill. The Union also expressed their nationality through dressing in traditional Welsh costume during parades and unlike many unions in Wales actually addressed their membership in Welsh as well as the English language at meetings. In 1912 after Lloyd George scuppered the third Conciliation Bill, Mansell Moullin quit the organisation and formed the Forward Cymric Suffrage Union, which had a more militant policy. Members wore red dragon badges with the motto 'O Iesu, n'ad Gamwaith' ('Oh Jesus do not allow unfairness').|$|E
5|$|Despite these precautions, {{pollution}} {{from the power}} stations <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> factor. In 1954, consideration was given to scrapping the plan to build the Union Hall housing estate in Lemington because of probable {{pollution from}} nearby power stations. This was mainly {{because some of the}} houses were as high as, if not higher than, the power stations' chimneys. At times, this meant the estate being exposed to as much as 1.25 parts per million of sulphur dioxide. However the estate was still built, as these peak conditions were thought unlikely to occur on more than 18 days in a year.|$|E
