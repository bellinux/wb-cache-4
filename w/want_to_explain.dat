5|$|Vargas Llosa {{lived with}} his {{maternal}} family in Arequipa until a year after his parents' divorce, when his maternal grandfather was named honorary consul for Peru in Bolivia. With his mother and her family, Vargas Llosa then moved to Cochabamba, Bolivia, where he spent {{the early years of}} his childhood. His maternal family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather, who managed a cotton farm. As a child, Vargas Llosa was led to believe that his father had died—his mother and her family did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> that his parents had separated. During the government of Peruvian President José Bustamante y Rivero, Vargas Llosa's maternal grandfather obtained a diplomatic post in the northern Peruvian coastal city of Piura and the entire family returned to Peru. While in Piura, Vargas Llosa attended elementary school at the religious academy Colegio Salesiano. In 1946, at the age of ten, he moved to Lima and met his father for the first time. His parents re-established their relationship and lived in Magdalena del Mar, a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years. While in Lima, he studied at the Colegio La Salle, a Christian middle school, from 1947 to 1949.|$|E
500|$|... "Showdown" [...] has [...] "bubbly" [...] {{beats and}} its lyrics, about [...] "fighting and making up with carnal relations", include the lines [...] "I don’t {{really want to}} be a tease / But would you undo my zipper, please?" [...] Rolling Stone {{classified}} the song a pop-dancehall. The fourth track, [...] "Breathe on Me", was described as the most sensual song of the record. Containing trip hop influences, Spears sings, [...] "Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air/ And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there" [...] and [...] "Just put your lips together and blow." [...] "Early Mornin'" [...] depicts Spears looking for men at a club in New York City. The song has a percolating beat and featured subdued vocals from Spears, who purrs and yawns through the track. The nightclub Show is referenced. [...] "Toxic", which Spears later named as her favorite song from her career, was originally offered to Kylie Minogue. Released as the album's second single, it contains elements of electropop and bhangra music, and features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers, high-pitched strings and surf guitars. Lyrically, [...] "Toxic" [...] talks about being addicted to a lover. [...] "Outrageous", the fourth and final single from the album, is a hip hop-inspired track that according to MTV features Spears [...] "whisper and moan [...] with a snake charmer melody giving the song an exotic feel." [...] The lyrics talk about materialism and amusement, with the singer referencing in the chorus {{a number of things that}} give her pleasure. In [...] "Touch of My Hand", which Spears felt it was comparable to Janet Jackson's [...] "That's the Way Love Goes" [...] (1993), she sings in a lower register. The instrumentation contains elements of Middle Eastern music and its lyrics refer to masturbation, [...] "I will be bold/ Going to the places where I can be out of control/ Don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> tonight/ All the things I try to hide." ...|$|E
2500|$|An early {{proposed}} storyline {{involved the}} character being transported to Hawaii. Huyck states that this storyline was considered because [...] "we {{thought it would}} be sort of fun to shoot there". According to Katz, they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> how Howard arrived on Earth initially, but later rewrote the screenplay so that the film would begin on Howard's home world. Huyck and Katz wanted to incorporate both lighter, humorous elements and darker, suspenseful elements. Katz states that some readers were confused by the sexual elements of the screenplay, as they were unsure as to whether the film was intended for adults or children. Huyck and Katz wrote the ending leaving the story open for a sequel, which was never produced.|$|E

I went to Molly's room and I was showing her how I set up my computer so I can access it from anywhere. I turned on my camera and saw you {{in the corner of}} the screen and I immediately closed it. I felt uncomfortable and guilty of what happened. Obviously I told people what occurred so they could give me advice. Then Tuesday when you requested the room again I wanted to make sure what happened Sunday wouldn't happen again and not to video chat me from 930 to 12. Just in case, I turned my camera away and put my computer to sleep so even if anyone tried it wouldn't work. I wanted to make amends for Sunday night. I'm sorry if you heard something distorted and disturbing but I assure you all my actions were good natured." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2016, Fox News host Greg Gutfeld {{injected}} {{himself into}} the Chili Peppers/Patton feud taking shots at the Chili Peppers and Kiedis after Flea posted video of him and Koko the gorilla. Gutfeld said, [...] "As most musicians know, this is a vast improvement over the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the worst band on the planet. The ape is better than Anthony Kiedis. By the way, the ape is 45, which is half the age of Anthony Kiedis. Red Hot Chili Peppers, poor man's Faith No More, don't ever forget it." [...] After receiving major backlash from fans, Gutfeld decided to take further shots by saying [...] "Two days ago I said that Red Hot Chili Peppers were the worst band on the planet. I {{received a lot of}} flack from fans all over the world. What I meant to say was the Red Hot Chili Peppers [...] the worst band in the universe. I’d like to apologize for that confusion. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> {{that we live in a}} binary universe," [...] he continued. [...] "You're either a Faith No More fan, or a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. You cannot love Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis, because they are two different people. You have to love Mike Patton, you cannot love Anthony Kiedis. So that is why the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the worst band in the universe, because Faith No More is the greatest band in the universe." [...] Flea responded to Gutfeld's comments a few days later saying [...] "I remember seeing a poll recently that said people who watch Fox News knew less about world affairs than people who watch no news at all. It's clearly a funny program. It doesn't faze me, not really. I heard that. It's funny. I don't care. They're all welcome to hate us. God bless 'em." ...|$|E
