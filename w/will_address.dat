In a custody order, it's common for one parent to have physical custody and the other parent {{to have some sort}} of visitation rights, but legal custody is awarded separately. Thus, even when one parent is the primary custodian, joint legal custody may be awarded either to both of the parents or to only one of the parents, depending on state law and the facts of the case.|$|E

25|$|The {{provision}} of free antiretroviral therapy to rural residents {{and the urban}} poor became policy in 2003 under the 'Four Free and One Care' policy. The National HIV/AIDS Clinical Taskforce {{took the lead in}} establishing the programme, and set up a database to monitor it. As of the end of 2006, more than 30,640 patients have been treated in 800 counties in all 31 provinces. Research to inform further expansion and improvement of the programme is ongoing. Initial reports indicate that the current treatment regimen has a high drop-out rate (at least 8%), mainly due to side-effects, drug resistance, difficulty with adherence, and progression of disease. Therefore, the government is currently exploring options within the pharmaceutical industry to make additional regimens available, which <b>will</b> <b>address</b> both the issues of compliance, by making regimens with fewer side-effects available, and resistance, by making available additional lines of treatment.|$|E
25|$|The MBA {{dissertation}} (or thesis in some universities) will, in general, {{comprise the}} following in some combination: {{a discussion of}} the literature, providing a critical review and structuring of what is known on a given topic, with a view to addressing a specific problem; a case study that goes beyond simple description, containing the analysis of hitherto unpublished material; a test of the application or limitations of some known principle or technique in a particular situation, and / or suggested modifications. As an alternative to the dissertation, some programs instead allow for a major project. Here (part-time) students <b>will</b> <b>address</b> a problem current in their organization; particularly in programs with an action learning orientation, these may be practically oriented. Most MBA programs require additional course work in research methodology, preceding the dissertation or project. Some programs allow that the research component as a whole may be substituted with additional elective coursework.|$|E

25|$|Late on 18 January, {{the main}} railway station in Berlin {{suffered}} from major structural damage. A two-ton girder fell from {{a height of}} 40metres (130ft), damaging an outside stairwell. The station was completely evacuated, as glass plates from the façade were coming loose and falling to the pavement below. On the early afternoon of 19 January, the station was {{opened to the public}} again. Discussion started as to whether the eight-month-old station was suffering from design failures, but these claims were rejected by both Deutsche Bahn and the architect. The girders provide no means of structural support and are, for architectural reasons, only lying on small supports similar to a shelf and not permanently fixed in place. The DB claimed that it <b>will</b> <b>address</b> the problem by welding additional supports in front of the girders, and that they would close the station at winds exceeding 8 bft until the problem was resolved. On the afternoon of 21 January 2007, the station was closed again to the public due to heavy winds at the time. and remained closed until 20:00 CET. Some politicians have suggested opening Berlin's Bahnhof Zoo for long-distance services again to have an alternative to Hauptbahnhof in cases of bad weather until the problem has been addressed, but the Deutsche Bahn has refused these suggestions on the claims that they would be both unfeasible and unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|Chapter VI {{begins by}} saying the next three {{chapters}} <b>will</b> <b>address</b> possible objections to the theory, the first being that often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found, though the theory implies such forms must have existed. As Darwin noted, [...] "Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? [...] Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?" [...] Darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms, combined with {{the small number of}} individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms. This difficulty can be referred to as the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in habitat space.|$|E
500|$|This early launch {{did come}} with some trouble, as {{technical}} problems {{appeared in a}} portion of Xbox 360 units sold. The most well-known problem is the [...] "red ring of death" [...] and Error E74, which received (and still receives) {{a great deal of}} attention due to some users having to replace their consoles multiple times. Microsoft attempted to address this by offering a three-year warranty on all affected consoles and repairing them free of charge. It also retroactively reimbursed owners of affected systems who paid for repairs. According to The Mercury News, new models of the console featuring 65-nanometer technology <b>will</b> <b>address</b> this and other issues; the new technology is expected to reduce heat production, which will lower the risk of overheating and system failures; although, this has never been officially confirmed by Microsoft.|$|E
