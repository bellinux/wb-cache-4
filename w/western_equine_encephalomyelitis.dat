An Alphavirus {{of the family}} Togaviridae, the WEE virus is an arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) transmitted by mosquitoes of the genera Culex and Culiseta. WEE is a recombinant virus between two other alphaviruses, an ancestral Sindbis virus-like virus, and an ancestral Eastern equine encephalitis virus-like virus. There have been under 700 confirmed cases in the U.S. since 1964. This virus contains an envelope that {{is made up of}} glycoproteins and nucleic acids. The virus is transmitted to people and horses by bites from infected mosquitoes (Culex tarsalis) and birds during wet, summer months.|$|E

40|$|Eastern, <b>Western,</b> and Venezuelan <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> are mosquito-borne, viral {{infections that}} can cause severe {{encephalitis}} in horses and humans.

40|$|Hydroxylapatite column {{chromatography}} methods {{were developed to}} characterize selected alphavirus populations. Different conditions of pH and phosphate molarity were required to obtain satisfactory elution profiles and separations for <b>Western</b> <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus strains, compared with Eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus and Semliki Forest virus strains. Raising the pH of the buffers effected earlier elutions of all viruses. Selection of phosphate gradients with more gentle slopes and adjustment to the proper pH effected better separations of virus subpopulations. Elution profiles were not affected by 0. 85 % NaCl, 10 % fetal calf serum, or 1 % bovine serum albumin, which are common constituents of virus-stabilizing diluents. Passage of <b>Western</b> <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> and Semliki Forest viruses in BHK- 21, Vero, or duck embryo cell cultures or in suckling mouse brains did not usually affect elution profiles, unless passage also resulted in {{a shift in the}} plaque size marker. Essentially all infectious virus applied to the column was recoverable in appropriate fractions. This permitted accurate determinations of heterogeneity within alphavirus populations. For <b>Western</b> <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> large-plaque (LP) and small-plaque (SP) virus populations, it was possible to detect ratios of 1 LP in a population of 106 SP, and 1 SP in 103 LP by using linear phosphate gradients. When stepwise elution procedures were used, it was possible to detect ratios of 1 SP in a population of 105 LP.

40|$|A {{radioimmunoassay}} (RIA) {{procedure is}} described for measuring antibodies to alphaviruses in human and other mammalian sera.

Using antibodies produced in humans and guinea pigs, the RIA procedure clearly differentiated among antibodies to Venezuelan, <b>western,</b> and eastern <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> viruses. Sensitivity of the RIA {{depended on the}} concentrations of labeled viruses employed. The dilution of serum that effected binding of 50 % of the 3 H-labeled virus (determined by probit analysis) was consistently higher than the neutralizing antibody titer determined by a conventional plaque reduction neutralization test using 80 % plaque reduction end points. In addition, sera from 73 individuals were screened for seroconversion following live attenuated Venezuelan <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus vaccine (strain TC- 83) inoculation, by RIA using a single serum dilution (1 : 80); results were identical with seroconversions identified by plaque reduction neutralization test.

40|$|SUMMARY: We have {{examined}} by a uniform technique {{the sensitivity of}} twenty-five viruses to ethyl ether. Evidence of the sensitivity of ten other viruses {{is available from the}} literature. Viruses seem to be either very sensitive or highly resistant. Of the viruses pathogenic to animals, most of the resistant ones are either in the pox group or amongst the very small viruses. The results may prove of use to workers who at times need to separate one virus from mixture with others or with bacteria. The findings may also be of value in any attempt at virus classification. Many records attest that some viruses, notably those of vaccinia and polio-myelitis? are highly resistant to inactivation by ethyl ether. A recent paper by Sulkin & Zarafonetis (1947) reports that three insect-borne encephalitis viruses (St Louis, <b>Western</b> and Eastern <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> viruses) are in contrast highly susceptible; that of rabies was found, like poliomyelitis, to be resistant.

Examination of the plasma patches for growth of the tissue was made 48 hours after the latter was planted in the plasma. When immune anti-W. E.

The method has proved reliable {{in the case of}} rabies, St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese B encephalitis, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, Eastern equine encephalomyelitis, <b>Western</b> <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> louping ill, and spontaneous encephalomyelitis of mice (Theiler's disease). The specificity of the reaction, regardless of the virus involved, requires different temperatures of inactivation of the sera according to animal species: 56 °C. for guinea pig, 60 °C. for mouse, and 65 °C. for rabbit and dog sera, all heated for 20 minutes.

Both strains reproduced in L cells, and both induced the production of an interferon distinct from virus particles. L-cell monolayers were protected from degeneration by prior addition of interferon. By use of the absence of cytopathic effects (CPE) as an end point, interferon content was assayed. Monolayers failing to show CPE consistently produced less than 2 % as much virus as control monolayers, indicating that virus synthesis was also inhibited. The use of this assay method was facilitated by the use of horse serum that appeared to contain antibodies against WEE and that permitted interferon to act selectively in the presence of active virus. It was found that interferon was produced during the time in which active virus was produced, and not significantly later. No interferon could be found in fluids from cells treated with inactive virus, although these are known to act as interfering agents. Interferon production was inhibited by pretreatment of L cells with sufficient amounts of interferon.

It {{would appear that the}} number of nerve fibers available for passage may play a rôle in the speed with which infection occurs with this virus. When pseudorabies virus was inoculated into an area of inflammation its effects were markedly lessened. Similar experiments with unmodified <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus which, unlike pseudorabies, does not ascend along local nerves, showed no impedance of infection. Brain trauma did not change the rate of infection with the viruses of St. Louis encephalitis, herpes, or pseudorabies. But intraperitoneal injection of glycerine, followed by intramuscular inoculation of St. Louis virus, resulted in marked facilitation of infection, as already remarked of fixed <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus. This phenomenon did not occur with pseudorabies or herpes. In contrast to certain other viruses, pseudorabies and herpes viruses were only slightly more effective in young mice than in adults. With St. Louis virus, as with fixed <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> viruses, inoculation into the eye or nose was far more effective than other peripheral routes.
