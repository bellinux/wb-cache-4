500|$|Verdi said of Puccini, {{early in}} the latter's career, that [...] "the symphonic element dominates in him", and Gianni Schicchi has been {{compared}} by later analysts {{to that of the}} final presto movement of a three-movement symphony. With the fast-moving pace of the work, the set pieces are given a simpler melodic structure than those in the other two parts of the triptych. On stage, with the commedia dell'arte references, a humorous atmosphere is established from the very beginning. However, the music itself is of the 20th century; Edward Greenfield refers to its [...] "dissonant modernity", with simultaneous clashing chords suggesting that [...] "Puccini <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> in bi-tonal terms". Alongside these dissonant passages are others which opera scholar Julian Budden calls [...] "bland, schoolroom diatonism".|$|E
2500|$|The McDaniels {{suggested}} {{their son}} {{take what they}} called a [...] "sabbatical", offering to support him financially while he and his dog, a chocolate Labrador he had rescued, lived in the family's beach home at Santa Rosa Beach on the Emerald Coast of the Florida Panhandle. He accepted the offer and moved into the house in April 2010, around his 30th birthday. His parents and girlfriend say the move was proving beneficial, as Ben <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and talk about moving on from his recent personal setbacks.|$|E

6000|$|... "No; {{you have}} been active. You have had your hands full of work. I <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that it <b>is</b> a great curse {{to have been born}} a woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{the call}} came from somewhere overhead,” {{answered}} our hero. “Captain, {{see if you can}} flash a light on those rocks to the left of our heads.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So you've come, have you, Amateur? I <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> you'd {{struck a}} {{business}} rush, and I shouldn't see you before to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Umph!" [...] {{said the}} Prince; [...] "I {{have heard a}} good deal about the English girl. I <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it exaggerated. Stand up." ...|$|E
6000|$|Toby was so {{completely}} bewildered {{as to be}} unable to say a word, and just as he <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it some joke, Ben said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If so, {{there is}} no reason why any day should ever be fixed. People <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that it must be off, because it has been talked of so long." ...|$|R
6000|$|By {{the next}} evening their {{preparations}} were completed. The ferment had now somewhat cooled down, and people <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the excitement roused by a mere vague report was absurd. The next morning at breakfast Mr. Blagrove said to his son: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, mother; {{you have}} said once or twice lately that you thought I ought to marry, and I <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> so too. You {{selected}} one clergyman's daughter for me, but that lady {{is going to do}} much better with herself--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is time {{something}} of the kind was discovered," [...] Jake said {{in a tone of}} relief. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> we should never meet one again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite well," [...] {{said the}} captain, briefly. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{you had all}} left Binchester," [...] he continued; [...] "gone for a sea voyage or something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now I must {{introduce}} you to Miss Forrester,--Kattie Forrester," [...] said Mr Blake, who <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that his own young lady was being {{left out in the}} cold.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the last}} day of July. The long hot summer was drawing to a close; and we, the weary pilgrims of the London pavement, <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the cloud-shadows on the corn-fields, and the autumn breezes on the sea-shore.|$|R
50|$|While {{the term}} 'revolution' implies radical and {{widespread}} change, {{this was not}} necessarily the case. Even in the 'liberal' sixties, conservative, traditionalist views were widely held, and many modern historians and social scientists <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that 'revolution' <b>is</b> {{too much of an}} overstatement.|$|R
60|$|Some {{time the}} boys watched for Toby's return, {{and just as}} they <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> they ought <b>to</b> go in search of him, and fearing lest he had been hurt by the vicious pony, they saw him coming from among the trees, alone and on foot.|$|R
60|$|Now {{and then}} a female form would pass one of the lighted windows, but nothing more, and he <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> he had struck the wrong trail, when Barker returned.|$|E
6000|$|They {{had breakfast}} in the garden beneath the trees; and as she poured out his tea, she laughed, and with the American accent which he <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> made English so harmonious, said,-- ...|$|E
60|$|On {{they went}} once more, over {{the rocks and}} through a tangle of brushwood. It was now almost dark, and Dick <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> they would lose their way when Peterson called a sudden halt.|$|E
6000|$|Why have I wasted {{the little}} {{time that is}} left {{with a sort of}} naked review article? I don't know, I'm sure. I suppose a mere {{ebullition}} of congested literary talk I <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> a visit from friends would be due. Wish you could come! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am often {{here alone}} in the dark, but I <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I shall never see a ghost now. I am losing all my romance, and getting {{to be an old}} woman. Do you know, Grace, I do so hate myself for being such an old maid." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{similarly}} the dwellers in the hut of {{the field}} and garret of the city <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that instead of paying half a crown for the loan of half a fire-place, they had better keep their half-crown in their pockets till they can buy for themselves a whole one.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, I <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I {{would better}} leave, though where I should go {{was more than}} I could say. With a quick intuition she caught my hand as I put foot in the stirrup.|$|E
60|$|On {{this special}} Sunday evening she was disinclined {{to speak of}} him at all. Not that she loved him more than usual, but that she <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that she could not}} ever really love him at all. She had taught herself to think that he might {{probably}} be her husband, and had hitherto felt no such repugnance to her destiny as caused her to shun the subject. But now she <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the matter seriously; and as she did so, she felt that life might have for her a lot more blessed than that of sharing the world with her cousin Harry.|$|E
6000|$|Little Tim <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that the}} Blackfoot chief was, as he {{expressed}} it, somewhat [...] "off his head," [...] when Moonlight {{ran into the}} room, and seized him with her wonted energy round the neck.|$|E
60|$|It {{was drawing}} towards {{the close of}} another fishing period, and {{the crew of the}} Evening Star <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the pleasures of their week on shore when, one afternoon, their vessel found herself {{becalmed}} near to the Dutch man-trap--the vessel laden with that greatest of the world's curses--strong drink.|$|R
5000|$|Fuse {{stated that}} [...] "The band {{has said that}} their albums and EPs look to express {{different}} points of youth, and Pt. 2 encompasses the moment that a young adult <b>is</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the world in more complex ways than [...] "I love you"/"I hate you"—something their fanbase will soon experience, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you will}} think, Mary, from my telling you all this, that I <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> {{change my mind}} about him, that I <b>am</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that there <b>is</b> {{something}} more in him than in others, {{and that it will}} all come out some day. But it would be a mistake; what I have always thought I think still." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Mrs. Barry's silence meant compliance. Resignation {{seemed to}} be a part of her {{marvelous}} character. And at last she unclasped her hands, pressing them before her eyes. But he heard her gently sobbing.|$|E
6000|$|Looking up {{from the}} quilt she pouted provokingly: [...] "If it hadn't been for that, perhaps I would {{have gone on to}} the Temperance Hotel, after all, as you proposed; for I <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I did belong to you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Felix <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that {{he might}} have told the truth with discretion. 'I don't quite know how it would be. I have always {{understood}} that I am the heir. It's not very likely that he will marry.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Atherstone," [...] she said, slowly, [...] "is {{quite the}} most {{eligible}} bachelor in England, and he is, as you know, a very nice, unaffected boy. There {{is only one}} possible inference for me, as Sybil's mother, to draw, {{and that is that}} she cares, or <b>is</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that she cares, for some one else." ...|$|R
60|$|Every {{little while}} Unc' Billy Possum {{would sit down}} to rest, for he wasn't used to so much real work. But finally he got his house clean and made as {{comfortable}} as possible, and about that time <b>be</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> how good an egg would taste. The more he thought about it, the more he wanted that egg.|$|R
6000|$|Peters made a deprecating gesture. [...] "Wyndhams' has {{now some}} {{standing}} on the exchange; the house's credit is pretty good, and people <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> your husband a clever business man. Wyndham is clever, but {{for a man to}} build up a business he must be known for something else. If he wants to command people's trust, he must keep certain rules." ...|$|R
