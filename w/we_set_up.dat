As she provided the singing voice for Esmerelda in the film, the French-Canadian soundtrack contains two separate renditions sung by Fabian; the film version and the single. Marketing coordinator for the Walt Disney Corporation (Canada) Todd Maki said [...] "That hasn't been done before. Originally, when <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> the deal with Lara, it was only to have her sing during the cathedral sequence of the film, but producer Havier Ponton heard her and asked us to do a single version as well". Fabian said [...] "I'm really happy doing this particular character with this song, because it's so touching...The sincerity that comes across [...] face and the intimacy was just amazing".|$|E

500|$|When {{the studio}} hired Kenneth Branagh and Joe Johnston to direct Thor and , respectively, it made sure both {{directors}} {{were open to}} the idea of a shared universe and including Avengers set-up scenes in their films. Joe Russo stated, [...] "That's the exciting component of [...] 'What can <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> for the future?' You're constantly pitching out ideas that not only affect your movie, but may have a ripple effect that affects other films ... It's a weird sort of tapestry of writers and directors working together to create this universe that's sort of organic." [...] Anthony added, [...] "The great thing about the Marvel , just like the publishing , it's a very vast, inter-connected universe, where characters will have their rise and fall, so to speak, and hand off to other characters. As the cinematic universe moves forward, you may start to see the cinematic universe adopt that same pattern, as the publishing has, where there's closure with some characters and new beginnings with other characters." [...] He added that, for directors to [...] "fit" [...] in at Marvel, they must understand how to [...] "take a larger story and wrangle it into a moment", yet keep it connected.|$|E

Rihanna likes to work late hours, so she would come into the studio at 9pm and work until 6am." [...] Continuing Harrell stated [...] "The show was the priority, and then the album. That's how the day was broken up." [...] Expanding on this Harrell stated that Rihanna would perform every night, finish her meet [...] and greet by 1 a.m. Then go to the studio for around two or three a.m. During these session Harrell stated [...] "I’d make the decision based off where I felt her voice was. Knowing she just did two hours of a show and meet-and-greets, I would suggest capturing the stuff that was easier to get like the lower-range stuff so we wouldn’t hurt or damage her voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some mathematicians have {{attempted}} to correct this misunderstanding of Cantor's work. In 1930, the set theorist Abraham Fraenkel stated that Cantor's method is [...] "… a method that incidentally, contrary to a widespread interpretation, is fundamentally constructive and not merely existential." [...] In 1972, Irving Kaplansky wrote: [...] "It is often said that Cantor's proof is not 'constructive,' and so does not yield a tangible transcendental number. This remark is not justified.

In an interview with Ronan Bennett for The Guardian newspaper, he described his role during this time as being [...] "to translate policies into concrete realities on the ground". He further discussed his performance by indicating, [...] "I was a fairly hard-nosed administrator.

2500|$|Following their {{breakthrough}} 1997 album King of Fools, Delirious? started recording Mezzamorphis in February 1998, {{and continued}} to record throughout that year, interspersed with summer tours throughout the US and UK. The band began recording with roughly half the songs already written, and continued writing as they recorded. Most of the recording took place in an old school in West Sussex. In the words of lead vocalist Martin Smith, [...] "We turned a classroom into a control room, {{and there were some}} wooden rooms where students used to dine, in which <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a drum kit with different mike positions. We did the bulk of it there {{for the first six months}} in between touring. In the end, we went to a smaller studio in Ford just to finish it off." [...] The band used movable drapes to experiment with different drum sounds and reverbs; most of the drums on the album are thus natural and unprocessed.|$|E
2500|$|Doherty escaped {{across the}} border into the Republic of Ireland, and then {{travelled}} to the United States on a false passport. He lived with an American girlfriend in Brooklyn and New Jersey, working on construction sites and as a bartender at Clancy's Bar in Manhattan, where he was arrested by the FBI on 28 June 1983. Doherty was imprisoned in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, and a legal battle ensued with the British government seeking to extradite him back to Northern Ireland. Doherty claimed he was immune from extradition as the killing of Westmacott was a political act, saying [...] "It was an operation that was typical of all operations where <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> an ambush of a British military convoy... It is a war, and this was a military action", and in 1985 federal judge John E. Sprizzo ruled Doherty could not be extradited as the killing was a [...] "political offense".

Hole's first official rehearsal took place at Fortress Studios in Hollywood with Love, Erlandson and Lisa Roberts on bass. According to Erlandson, [...] "these two girls show up dressed completely crazy, <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> and they said, [...] "okay, just start playing something." [...] I started playing and they started screaming {{at the top of their}} lungs for two or three hours. Crazy lyrics and screaming. I said to myself, [...] "most people would just run away from this really fast. But I heard something in Courtney's voice and lyrics." [...] Initially, the band had no percussion until Love met drummer Caroline Rue, and later recruited a third guitarist, Mike Geisbrecht. Hole's first show took place at Raji's, a small bar in Hollywood, in September 1989. By early 1990, Geisbrecht and Roberts had both left the band, which led to the recruitment of bassist Jill Emery.|$|E
2500|$|The Dardenne {{brothers}} have a regular stable of collaborators (for {{all of their}} films the brothers share writing and directing credits), including cinematographer Alain Marcoen and editor Marie-Hélène Dozo. Jérémie Renier played Igor in La Promesse, Bruno in L’Enfant, Claudy in Le Silence de Lorna (Lorna's Silence) and Guy in Le gamin au vélo (The Kid with a Bike), while Olivier Gourmet, the main character of Le fils, has a brief cameo as a detective in L’Enfant. Like Rosettas Emilie Dequenne, Déborah François, the seventeen-year-old lead in L’Enfant, was appearing in her first film. Luc Dardenne has described their process of working with actors as follows: [...] "What {{we do with the}} actors is also very physical. The day filming begins we do not feel obliged to do things exactly the way they were rehearsed; we pretend that we are starting over from zero so that we can rediscover things that we did before. The instructions we give the actors are above all physical. We start working without the cameraman—just the actors and my brother and me. We walk them through the blocking, first one then the other, trying several different versions. They say but do not act their lines. We do not tell them what the tone of their lines should be; we just say that we will see once the camera is rolling. At this point there is no cameraman, no sound engineer, no lighting. Then <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> all the camera movements exactly and the rhythm of the shot, which is usually a long take. Doing it this way allows us the ability to modify the actors’ movements or any small details." ...|$|E
2500|$|Neuro-linguistic {{programming}} (NLP) is {{an approach}} to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California, United States in the 1970s. NLP's creators claim {{there is a connection}} between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. Bandler and Grinder also claim that NLP methodology can [...] "model" [...] the skills of exceptional people, allowing anyone to acquire those skills. They claim as well that, often in a single session, NLP can treat problems such as phobias, depression, tic disorders, psychosomatic illnesses, near-sightedness, GINA: [...] I have seen you demonstrate a technique that some people refer to as Dr. Bandler's Beauty treatment? Please tell us about that. RICHARD : [...] Basically what happened is that I noticed that when I hypnotically regress people repeatedly they looked younger. So I started first thinking, well isn't there a way to maintain that. I noticed when I hypnotically regressed people to before the age of 5, who currently wore glasses, didn't need them to see. So I started leaving people's eyes young and growing the rest of them up to the present and it would change the prescription of their glasses radically {{to the point where they}} could see better. And done enough times, some of them could see without glasses. So I went a little step further, and did a DHE (Design Human Engineering™) treatment where <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a mechanism in the back of their mind that repeatedly age regresses them hypnotically; when they sleep, when they blink, all kinds of things and in a state of time distortion. And it can take years off the way people look, it also ups their energy level and in some cases the bi product [...] has been they recovered spontaneously from very serious diseases.
