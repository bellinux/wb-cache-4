Nevertheless, it took three more days of filming to get the shot of the girls up in the stairwell the way Frankel wanted it, a look she believes {{was inspired by a}} similar scene with twin girls in The Shining.|$|E

In fact, Steiner was not that interested in the Internet when he drew the cartoon, and although he did have an online account, he recalled attaching no [...] "profound" [...] meaning to the cartoon; it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> he drew in the manner of a [...] "make-up-a-caption" [...] cartoon.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{clarified}} {{that her}} age {{did not have}} anything to do with the sense of urgency reflected in the track; instead, it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> that she had in mind for a long time and with [...] "4 Minutes", the sense seeped into her music. Ingrid Sischy from Interview magazine said that the song felt like a ballad for the world, containing [...] "the sounds of a great big marching band. It's a giant dance song". Madonna agreed with Sischy and responded that the song was [...] "a funny paradox" [...] and was one of the inspirations behind her documentary I Am Because We Are (2008). The documentary dealt with the acute suffering and food shortage afflicting the African nation of Malawi.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the music}} on the record was written by Frusciante, save for the cover of {{hardcore}} punk band Bad Brains' song [...] "Big Takeover". The track was intentionally slowed down and recorded melodically because of a pastime in which Frusciante sang punk songs in different time signatures: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> I had been walking around thinking of in my head. Sometimes I'll walk around singing punk rock songs to myself, but {{as if they were}} regular songs instead of punk rock songs, you know, slow it down and make a melody instead of just yelling them out. And then the idea occurred me to record it like a Led Zeppelin ballad with mandolins and stuff." [...] River Phoenix, a friend of Frusciante's, had contributed guitar and backing vocals to two songs that were intended be included on the record, but they were ultimately left off due to protests from his family. These were later included under different names on the album Smile from the Streets You Hold in 1997.|$|E

500|$|As a teenager, Cruz became {{interested}} in acting after seeing the film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected multiple times because the agent {{felt that she was}} too young. Cruz commented on the experience, [...] "I was very extroverted as a kid.... I was studying when I was in high school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and she sent me away three times because I was a little girl but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years." [...] In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls. In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz's agent, commented, [...] "She was absolutely magic [...] It was obvious there was something very impressive about this kid.... She was very green, but there was a presence. There <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> coming from within." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} of Stankonia began in spring of 1999 and lasted {{for about a}} year. Owning a studio helped the band expand creatively, as the duo {{did not need to}} worry about time constraints that would occur with a rented studio. André 3000 observed, [...] "You can sit there and fuck with just a kick and a snare all day long if you want to... You're not working on the clock. [...] Really, you're just working on your mind." [...] Big Boi spent the majority of the recording time in the studio, while André 3000 worked at home, creating beats and experimenting with an acoustic guitar. [...] One song that came from a jam session on the guitar was [...] "Ms. Jackson", the album's second single. [...] André 3000 also created song lyrics by writing words on the walls of his home: [...] "I had planned to paint my house anyway; writing on the walls <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> I would do." [...] One stray lyric on his wall eventually developed into [...] "Gasoline Dreams".|$|E

She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves." [...] Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, [...] "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E

[...] When {{he was in the}} eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students. [...] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> neat about the machine." [...] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.|$|E

In May 2007, Esposito filed {{for a divorce}} that was {{finalized}} in November. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> that happened. The good thing is, we both realized it. Sometimes you just realize it", he has since explained. Before his marriage, he met Renée Zellweger while filming Case 39 in 2006. The media speculated {{about the nature of}} their relationship in 2009 when the film was released. Although they refused to speak about the romance, they made several appearances together, and in 2011, the media reported {{about the end of the}} relationship. In December 2011, he was involved in a romantic relationship with Zoe Saldana that ended in January 2013. In March 2013, he began dating English model Suki Waterhouse who is 17 years his junior. According to a report by E!, they broke up in March 2015 because of their age difference and Waterhouse's desire to focus on her career. Cooper began a relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk the following month. In November, he moved into her apartment in New York's West Village. In March 2017, Shayk gave birth to their daughter.|$|E

McDowell stated that he wanted a tremendous ego in Loomis, who is out {{to get a new}} book from the ordeal. On December 24, 2006, Zombie announced that Tyler Mane, who had previously worked with Zombie on The Devil's Rejects, would portray the adult Michael Myers. Mane stated that {{it was very difficult to}} act only with his eyes. Scout Taylor-Compton endured a long audition process, but as director Zombie explains, [...] "Scout was my first choice. There <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> about her; she had a genuine quality. She didn't seem actor-y." [...] She was one of the final people to be cast for a lead role after Faerch, Mane, McDowell, Forsythe, and Harris. A contest was held for a walk-on role in the film, at the time called Halloween 9; it was won by Heather Bowen. She played a news reporter who covered Michael's arrest, but her scene was cut from the film and does not appear in the deleted scenes.|$|E

[...] D. B. Weiss noted, [...] "The Night King, who's sort of the embodiment of absolute evil, what you're watching is the creation of that absolute evil, so the absolute evil isn't absolute after all." [...] Benioff also alluded to the many references and foreshadowing throughout the series that preceded the reveal of the Children creating the White Walkers, saying, [...] "There are certain symbols and patterns that recur throughout the show. The first time we saw {{that was one of the}} very first scenes in the pilot, when Will the ranger sees the Wildling body parts in an odd pattern displayed by the White Walkers. We see it again north of the Wall with the dead horses displayed in a spiral pattern, and then you see it again here and see where these patterns come from, that they're ancient symbols of the Children of the Forest used in their rituals, and the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers." ...|$|E
500|$|It also {{received}} praise by IGN's Jeremy Mullin, {{who gave it}} an overall 9 over 10, having had good opinion of the graphics used during the film and how the film expands Fullmetal Alchemists story. The film was compared to The End of Evangelion due to how both titles expand their anime's endings, resulting in a [...] "proper ending" [...] due to the characters' development featured in the film. Mullin also liked the audio from Conqueror of Shamballa, but added {{that some of the}} English voice actors lacked accents. DVD Talk writer Todd Douglass Jr. also liked the film as he was [...] "pleased to report that the story was handled nigh-flawlessly. The inclusion of real world events helps ground the fact that Edward is in our world, but there <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> surreal about that after seeing it." [...] He found the film's ending to be fitting for Fullmetal Alchemist and said it will be well received by fans from the series. While reviewing the special edition DVD, Douglass commented the extras featured in the DVD [...] "are worth the price." [...] However, he also added that [...] "some people just don't care about the extras" [...] and concluded that [...] "this is a strong reissue that could have possibly been better, but is fine just the same." ...|$|E

[...] "Buried Secrets" [...] revisits the first season storylines of sexual tension between Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) and the mutual detestation between Sun's husband Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) and Michael. [...] These conflicts {{were going to be}} further explored in the first season; however, positive fan reaction to Sun and Jin as a couple and good chemistry between the actors playing Michael and Jin led to the abandonment of the love triangle. [...] Reuters announced in November that the mobisodes would premiere that month. [...] This proved to be true, with [...] "The Watch" [...] appearing suddenly to Verizon customers as the first of the Lost: Missing Pieces. [...] A new mobisode would generally become available each Monday and would be released a week later as a free webisode on ABC's website.

After {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [...] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> I loved to do. And here we are five years later and it’s exploded." [...] By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012.

500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film and it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line {{and we got a}} good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E
