5|$|Although Kennan {{regarded}} the Soviet Union as {{too weak to}} risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into <b>Western</b> <b>Europe</b> through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties in <b>Western</b> <b>Europe,</b> which remained demoralized by the devastation of the Second World War. To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan's solution was to direct economic aid and covert political help to Japan and <b>Western</b> <b>Europe</b> to revive Western governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so the United States would help to rebuild the balance of power. In June 1948, Kennan proposed covert assistance to left-wing parties not oriented toward Moscow and to labor unions in <b>Western</b> <b>Europe</b> in order to engineer a rift between Moscow and working-class movements in <b>Western</b> <b>Europe.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the only}} stable {{long-term}} state in Europe during the Middle Ages, Byzantium isolated <b>Western</b> <b>Europe</b> from newly emerging {{forces to the}} East. Constantly under attack, it distanced <b>Western</b> <b>Europe</b> from Persians, Arabs, Seljuk Turks, and for a time, the Ottomans. From a different perspective, since the 7th century, the evolution and constant reshaping of the Byzantine state were {{directly related to the}} respective progress of Islam.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of the authoritarian {{government}} in Portugal in 1974, the Spanish government was the sole surviving dictatorship in <b>Western</b> <b>Europe,</b> where several countries in 1975 were ruled by socialist parties which had long loathed Franco for coming to power by overthrowing a socialist democracy. Hostility to the use of capital punishment was widespread in <b>Western</b> <b>Europe</b> at this time and most Western European countries had ceased using it.|$|E

5|$|During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union {{was growing}} {{economically}} {{at a pace}} that would eventually catch up with the United States and <b>Western</b> <b>Europe.</b> This was true despite the advantage the United States had — the USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of Western USSR in ruins. In 1973, the process of catching up {{with the rest of the}} West came to an abrupt end, and 1973 was seen by some scholars as the start of the Era of Stagnation. The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in <b>Western</b> <b>Europe</b> and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at faster rate than that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of <b>Western</b> <b>Europe.</b> Between 1964 and 1973, the Soviet economy stood at roughly half the output per head of <b>Western</b> <b>Europe</b> and a little more than one third that of the U.S.|$|E
