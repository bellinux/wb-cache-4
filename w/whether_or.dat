5|$|A deeper analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not {{the influence of}} gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not a surface is equivalent to a plane. In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation of gravity.|$|E
