5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>but</b> has a visible star count of only 1% of the Milky Way. The lack of {{luminosity}} is because there is a lack of star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the broad-billed parrot may have depended on dodos and Cylindraspis tortoises to eat palm fruits and excrete their seeds, which became food for the parrots. Anodorhynchus macaws depended on now-extinct South American megafauna in the same <b>way,</b> <b>but</b> now rely on domesticated cattle for this service.|$|E

5|$|The Sarah Jane Adventures {{merchandising}} {{revived the}} concept of the novelisation, which {{had been part of the}} Doctor Who franchise from the 1970s to the 1990s (principally under the editorship of author and former Who script editor Terrance Dicks). The first series and most of the second were adapted in this <b>way,</b> <b>but</b> later series saw only a few releases and a transition from print to e-books.|$|E
5|$|The body's {{first line}} of defence against viruses is the innate immune system. This {{comprises}} cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner. This means that {{the cells of the}} innate system recognise, and respond to, pathogens in a generic <b>way,</b> <b>but,</b> unlike the adaptive immune system, it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host.|$|E
5|$|The raskovnik is {{believed}} to have been sought after by treasure hunters, sorcerers and herbalists who desired its magic powers for personal benefit. In Serbia, it was believed that there exist certain treasures, such as the Treasure of Tsar Radovan, which could not be unlocked in any other <b>way</b> <b>but</b> employing a raskovnik.|$|E

5|$|Back in the warehouse, Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) unsuccessfully {{tries to}} {{strike up a}} {{relationship}} with a new warehouse worker, Val (Ameenah Kaplan). Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), observing Gabe's pitiful attempts, tries to imply that Val does not feel the same <b>way,</b> <b>but</b> to no avail. When Gabe does ask Val out, she politely declines and says she does not date co-workers. Darryl hears all of this and decides he will not pursue Val either.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same <b>way,</b> <b>but</b> {{not as much as}} does the Moon's varying distance from Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E

5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any <b>way,</b> <b>but</b> the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, it was {{anticipated}} that traffic {{through the tunnel}} would rise on {{the completion of the}} M25 in 1986. At the time, the expectation was that other routes in London would be improved instead, diverting 15% of traffic away from the tunnel. In 1985, the Transport Minister, Lynda Chalker, announced that the number of toll booths would be increased to 12 each <b>way,</b> <b>but</b> concern grew that two tunnels {{would not be able to}} cope with the full demands of a completed M25.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{during their}} girls night out, Ruby {{is trying to}} {{convince}} Ashley to find another guy since Sean is always working. Ashley tells Mary Margaret that all she wants is to be with Sean. Mary Margaret understands since her own romantic arrangement is not ideal. Sean shows up on a break from work and proposes to Ashley; she accepts and they {{go out for a}} drive. David shows up next to give Mary Margret her Valentine, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's. Mary Margaret says she thought if two people were meant to be together they would find a <b>way,</b> <b>but</b> maybe she and David need another way. She tells him he should probably go home.|$|E

5|$|Everyone I {{talked to}} {{seemed to have}} a {{relative}} or a friend who'd been through it. That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain <b>way,</b> <b>but</b> with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E
5|$|In his {{commentary}} on the ancient Confucian philosopher Mencius (372–289 BC), Shen wrote {{of the importance of}} choosing to follow what one knew to be a true path, yet the heart and mind could not attain full knowledge of truth through mere sensory experience. In his own unique <b>way</b> <b>but</b> using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority that formed the basis for one's inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen's life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance. Along with his {{commentary on}} the Chinese classic texts, Shen Kuo also wrote extensively on the topics of supernatural divination and Buddhist meditation.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool got {{the first}} half of extra time under <b>way,</b> <b>but</b> the start was slow as players {{suffered}} with cramp, Carragher in particular. In the 97th minute, Liverpool won a corner, which West Ham cleared to Liverpool defender John Arne Riise {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, but his shot went over the crossbar. Liverpool won another corner in the 99th minute, which was cleared by West Ham; the ball came back into the penalty area and Morientes headed down for Cissé, but he was unable to control the ball. Before the end of the half, Hyypiä had a chance to score after running past Scaloni and Harewood, but his shot went wide of the West Ham goal.|$|E

5|$|Shaw {{married the}} Reverend John Millar, the parish {{minister}} of Kilmaurs, Ayrshire, in 1719. He {{died two years}} later, after which Shaw {{went on to become}} a successful businesswoman. She was involved in the manufacture of thread, at first in a small <b>way,</b> <b>but</b> as the quality of her product began to be recognised, on an increasingly large scale. Her Bargarran trademark thread became a mark of quality, and others in the area began to emulate her techniques, starting an industry in which Paisley once dominated the world, and which shaped the town's history. The last known record of Shaw is her marriage in February 1737 to William Livingstone, a prosperous Edinburgh businessman.|$|E
5|$|Some Doppers {{preferred}} {{to embark on}} another trek, north-west across the Kalahari Desert towards Angola, rather than live under Burgers. This became the Dorsland Trek of 1874. The emigrants asked Kruger to lead the <b>way,</b> <b>but</b> he refused to take part. In September 1874, following a long delay calling the volksraad due to sickness, Burgers proposed a railway to Delagoa Bay {{and said he would}} go to Europe to raise the necessary funds. By the time he left in February 1875 opposition pressure had brought about an amendment to bring religious instruction back into school hours, and Kruger had been restored to the executive council.|$|E
