5000|$|Stitch-Bonding is {{a special}} form of warp {{knitting}} [...] and is commonly used {{for the production of}} composite materials and technical textiles. As a method of production, stitch-bonding is efficient, {{and is one of the}} most modern ways to create reinforced textiles and composite materials [...] for industrial use. The advantages of the stitch-bonding process includes its high productivity rate and the scope it offers for functional design of textiles, such as fiber-reinforced plastics. [...] Stitch-bonding involves layers of threads and fabric being joined together with a knitting thread, which creates a layered structure called a multi-ply. [...] This is created through a <b>warp-knitting</b> thread system, which is fixed on the reverse side of the fabric with a sinker loop, and a weft thread layer. [...] A needle with the warp thread passes through the material, which requires the warp and knitting threads to be moving both parallel and perpendicular to the vertical/warp direction of the stitch-bonding machine. [...] Stitch-bonded fabrics are currently being used in such fields as wind energy generation and aviation. [...] Research is currently being conducted into the usage and benefits of stitch-bonded fabrics as a way to reinforce concrete. Fabrics produced with this process offer the potential of using “sensitive fiber materials such as glass and carbon with only little damage, non-crimp fiber orientation and variable distance between threads”.|$|E

A series of <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics was produced on a double-needle bar Raschel warp knitting machine by varying their structural parameters, including spacer monofilament inclination and fineness, fabric thickness, and surface layer structure. A drop-weight impact tester was used to test these fabrics with predefined impact energy. The impact process of a typical spacer fabric was analyzed based on its impact contact force-displacement curve, energy absorbed-contact force curve and transmitted force-time curve. The effects of the structural parameters on the impact compressive behavior of the <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics were also discussed. The relationship between the peak transmitted force and peak contact force was established for these fabrics. The study shows that the <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics {{can be used as a}} type of effective material for human body protection due to their high energy absorption capacity and reduction of the contact peak force.

The first part, as presented in the current paper, focuses on {{the establishment of a}} constitutive model that can give accurate compressive stress–strain relationships of <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics. Based on the analysis of three existing models for polymeric or metallic foams, a constitutive model consisting of seven parameters was firstly proposed for spacer fabrics. The effect of each parameter on the regressive stress–strain curves was then parametrically studied. Experimental validation was finally conducted by using 12 <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics produced with different spacer monofilament diameters and inclination angles, fabric thicknesses, and outer layer structures to identify the physical sense of the parameters. The analysis has showed that an excellent agreement exists between the regressive and experimental results, and all seven parameters have a quantitative effect on a particular phase of the resultant compressive stress–strain curves of <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics.

40|$|This part {{presents}} a dynamic model for predicting the impact compressive responses of <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics under various loading conditions using quasi-static compressive stress–strain data. The model was established {{based on a}} nonlinear mass-spring-damper system by considering spacer yarns as nonlinear springs with damping effect and representation of their stiffness by the constitutive model developed in Part I. Based on the dynamic model, the impact compressive responses of a typical <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabric was parametrically studied in terms of damping ratio, initial velocity, striker mass and contact area. The study indicates that damping can reduce the peak acceleration and peak displacement regardless of loading conditions, and the increase of the initial velocity can enhance the damping effect. Increasing initial velocity or striker mass while keeping the counterpart constant can increase the peak acceleration and peak displacement. However, at a constant kinetic energy, either increasing striker mass or decreasing initial velocity can reduce the peak acceleration, but the peak displacement keeps constant. The study also shows that an optimal size of the spacer fabric exists for achieving minimal peak acceleration under impact at a certain kinetic energy. Experimental validation by drop-weight impact tests demonstrates that the predictions of the dynamic model are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results. Using the quasi-static compressive data from a simple test, this dynamic model can numerically simulate the full time-response of <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer fabrics under various impact conditions.
