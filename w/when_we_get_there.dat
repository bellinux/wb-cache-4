500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker {{called the}} episode [...] "at once cool-looking, heart-tugging, and pretty simple", {{especially}} {{when compared to}} previous episodes like [...] "White Tulip". Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded the episode with an A, explaining [...] "I can't really find anything to complain about here. The direction was effectively moody and snappy, the performances were sharp, and the case was cool." [...] Murray praised the subtle characteristics of the parallel universe, the action scenes, {{and the use of}} split-screens to visually show Milo's predictions. MTV's Josh Wigler believed that the episode [...] "demonstrated how the mystery-of-the-week format can still be compelling: by taking everything familiar and applying a stark new layer of paint." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "The third season of Fringe continues to get better with each episode. Most importantly, it has momentum. It's moving forward with a distinct destination, and even though I know Fringe is heading somewhere, I have no idea where that might be, or what's going to happen <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>there.</b> Boy, if you're not watching Fringe, you're missing out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Marshall Mathers LP was {{recorded}} in a two-month-long [...] "creative binge", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording {{in order to stay}} focused on working and figuring out how to [...] "map out" [...] each song. He described himself as a [...] "studio rat" [...] who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, [...] "We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio. ' We just wait and see what happens <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>there.</b> [...] " [...] Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from [...] "fucking around" [...] in the studio; [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while [...] "Criminal" [...] was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. [...] "Kill You" [...] was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.|$|E

Or let us have it here at once, and then we can give all our time to the flowers <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>there.</b> They are looking their best just now." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think now}} that it were well you should each take a man-at-arms with you--a knight should not ride unattended. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> across <b>there</b> I will hire two Flemings, who speak English, to ride with your men. You will need them to {{interpret}} for you, and they can aid your men to look after your horses and armour.

[...] He could see now that she had no idea of giving that plan up, and he was glad that he had not said anything. [...] "I think," [...] she continued, [...] "that I shall write to her once a week, and give her a full account of our life from day to day; it'll be more like a diary; and then, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> over <b>there,</b> I can keep it up without any effort, and she won't feel so much that you've gone." ...|$|R

The tour's name [...] "Wheels Up" [...] is played off from the title of the band's current album, 747, like a plane taking off. Band member Charles Kelley says about the tour, [...] "The magic of being with fans {{from all over the country}} is really why we're ultimately all here."

Lady Peveril would never have got through this work without her; and Dick Mitford sent me a {{thousand}} pieces, too, in excellent time, when there was scarce a cross to keep the devil from dancing in our pockets, much more for these law-doings. I used it without scruple, for there is wood ready to be cut at Martindale <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> down <b>there,</b> and Dick Mitford knows I would have done the like for him.

I could not earn {{anything}} to speak of here: the most I could expect to get would be ten shillings a week as an office-boy.

500|$|When {{asked about}} the new project, drummer Rob Bourdon said, [...] "We tend to be perfectionists and it's sort of how we work.

We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|R

Besides that, we've among us {{the father of the}} gal who was stole far away off from Lake Champlain, and a relative of hers whose parents you've killed down on the lake.

"Well, {{that is good}} news, Terence, though I {{see myself}} that our {{difficulties}} will really begin only <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> out. <b>There</b> {{is no doubt that}} the fight with the guerillas was a lucky thing for us. I would not have missed it for anything, for I must say there was much more excitement in it than in a battle, at least as far as my experience of a battle goes. At Talavera we had nothing to do but stick up on the top of a hill, watch the French columns climbing up, and then give them a volley or two and roll them down the hill again; and between times stand to be shelled by Victor's batteries on the opposite hill. I cannot see that there is any fun about that. This fight, too, has turned out a very good thing for us. I expect we should not have been so well treated if it had not been for it, and the fact that some of these French soldiers are ready to give us a helping hand is first rate.|$|R
40|$|The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of Canada was {{established}} to uncover and acknowledge the injustices {{that took place in}} Indian residential schools and, in doing so, to pave the way to reconciliation. However, the TRC does not define reconciliation or how we would know it <b>when</b> (and if) <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> thus stirring a debate about what it could mean. This article examines two theories that may potentially be relevant to the TRC’s work: Charles Taylor’s theory of recognition and Nancy Fraser’s tripartite theory of justice.

500|$|Rising {{standards}} of achievement at Dartington enabled Imogen to organise performances of more demanding works, such as Bach's Mass in B minor in July 1950 to honour the 200th anniversary of Bach's death. Three years in preparation, this endeavour brought a tribute {{from one of}} the audience: [...] "I don't know, and can't imagine what the music of heaven is like. But <b>when</b> <b>we</b> all <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> please God, if any conducting is still necessary I hope your services will be required and that I will be in the chorus". By the middle of 1950 Imogen's professional focus was changing. She had attended the first two Aldeburgh Festivals in 1948 and [...] 1949, and in 1950 accepted a commission [...] to provide a choral work for performance at the 1951 festival. Sensing {{that it was time to}} leave Dartington, she gave a year's notice, part of which was spent on sabbatical, studying Indian music at Rabindranath Tagore's university in West Bengal. A fruit of this visit was her Ten Indian Folk Tunes for recorder. On 21 July 1951 her one-act opera, Benedick and Beatrice, was performed at Dartington, to mark her departure.|$|R
