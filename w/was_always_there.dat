25|$|The Innate Knowledge {{thesis is}} similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim {{knowledge}} is gained a priori. The two theses go their separate ways when describing how that knowledge is gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate Knowledge thesis claims knowledge is simply part of our rational nature. Experiences can trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into our consciousness, but the experiences don't provide us with the knowledge itself. The knowledge has been with us since the beginning and the experience simply brought into focus, in the same way a photographer can bring the background of a picture into focus by changing the aperture of the lens. The background <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>there,</b> just not in focus.|$|E

[...] The video for [...] "Let's Go to Bed" [...] was their first collaboration with Tim Pope.

500|$|Kīlauea {{has a large}} summit caldera, {{measuring}} [...] with walls up to [...] high, breached by {{lava flows}} on the southwestern side. It is unknown if the caldera <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>there</b> {{or if it is}} a relatively recent feature, and it is possible that it has come and gone throughout Kīlauea's eruptive history; what is known is that it likely formed over several centuries, with its construction estimated to have begun about 500 years ago, and that its present form was finalized by a particularly powerful eruption in 1790. A major feature within the caldera is Halemaumau Crater, a large pit crater and one of Kīlauea's most historically active eruption centers. The crater is approximately [...] in diameter and [...] deep, but its form has varied widely through its eruptive history; the floor of the Halemaumau Crater is now mostly covered by flows from its most recent eruption, in 1974.|$|E
500|$|Bieber {{begins his}} verse {{approximately}} {{one minute and}} forty-five seconds in, singing the new lyrics [...] "It’s like every time you call me/ You know I can’t leave you lonely/ 'Cause I <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>there</b> when you need/ You said that you'd be there 'til the end/ What must I say/ I {{never thought it would}} happen this way oh/ But I can tell if you're gone again/ got my number… things til the end.” Followed by another chorus and a verse by T.I., the song ends with a fade. A reviewer for the Inquisitor praised the collaboration, however Idolator's Christina Lee was critical of the remix, writing [...] "Two of them don’t sound like grown men — and they get the longer verses. French’s loopy rapping and off-key warbling is incoherent. Justin’s attempts to sound pained just sounds whiny." [...] It is the second time that Carey and Bieber have collaborated, the first being when the two re-recorded Carey's 1994 song [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] for Bieber's 2011 Christmas album Under the Mistletoe.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{describes}} Lena Horne as {{a profound}} inspiration, for entertainers of several generations {{as well as}} herself. Upon Horne's death, she stated [...] " [...] brought much joy into everyone's lives—even the younger generations, younger than myself. She {{was such a great}} talent. She opened up such doors for artists like myself." [...] Similarly, she considers Dorothy Dandridge to be one of her idols. Jackson has declared herself [...] "a very big Joni Mitchell fan", explaining [...] "As a kid I was drawn to Joni Mitchell records [...] Joni's songs spoke to me in an intimate, personal way." [...] She holds reverence for Tina Turner, stating [...] "Tina has become a heroic figure for many people, especially women, because of her tremendous strength. Personally, Tina doesn't seem to have a beginning or an end in my life. I felt her music <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>there,</b> and I feel like it always will be." [...] She has also named other socially conscious acts, such as Tracy Chapman, Sly and the Family Stone, U2, and Bob Dylan as sources of inspiration. In her early career, Jackson credited her brothers Michael and Jermaine as musical influences. According to Rolling Stone and MTV, other artists attributed as influences are The Ronettes, Dionne Warwick, Tammi Terrell, Diana Ross, Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder, Teena Marie, Michael Jackson, Prince, and Tina Turner ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, at the Simpson family's home, Patty {{comes out}} of the closet as a lesbian, saying that she is in love with a pro golfer named Veronica and asking Homer to perform the ceremony. This makes Marge {{extremely}} uncomfortable, even though the evidence <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>there.</b> While Homer accepts Patty's sexuality, a furious Marge reveals that she doesn't want her with Veronica and still insists she marries a man. Patty gets angry and points out that Marge acts very [...] "liberal" [...] about the issue but cannot accept her sister's sexuality, and says she hopes to see Marge at her wedding. Before the wedding, Marge accidentally discovers Veronica is actually a man, ironically while Veronica is singing Aerosmith's [...] "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)" [...] while shaving, and because Veronica left the toilet seat up after leaving. Happily she decides to keep quiet about it knowing that Patty will be marrying a man. But Marge is so moved by Patty's heartfelt declaration of love for Veronica during the ceremony that she reveals Veronica's Adam's apple. [...] "Veronica" [...] explains that as the straight Leslie Robin Swisher, he posed as a woman to get onto the LPGA golf tour. He then asks Patty if she'll still marry him, but she declines. Afterwards, Marge reconciles with Patty after telling her that she's learned a lesson and has accepted the fact that Patty's a lesbian; they hug after reconciling. Patty and her other sister, Selma, then go to leave a bag at the airport unattended, as a way to meet security personnel they can date.|$|E
