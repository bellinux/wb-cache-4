5|$|The Ultimate <b>Warrior</b> {{gained the}} early {{advantage}} in his steel cage match with Rick Rude. After the <b>Warrior</b> missed a splash attempt, Rude attempted {{to win the}} match by escaping the cage. The <b>Warrior</b> stopped him, and both wrestlers unsuccessfully attempted to perform their finishing moves. Rude was then able to perform a Rude Awakening neckbreaker but chose to continue attacking the <b>Warrior</b> rather than escape the cage. Rude performed a shoulderblock and tried to leave through the cage door. The <b>Warrior</b> held him back while Bobby Heenan, Rude's manager, tried to pull Rude out. The <b>Warrior</b> pulled both Rude and Heenan into the cage. He punched Heenan and then threw {{him out of the}} cage with an atomic drop. <b>Warrior</b> then knocked Rude down three times with clotheslines and threw him onto the ring floor with a gorilla press drop. <b>Warrior</b> climbed over the cage and dropped to the arena floor to win the match and retain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} through Delphi, the <b>warrior</b> obtained the venomous blood of a cerberus. Eventually, both Circe and the <b>warrior</b> encountered the general, who was {{revealed to be}} the warrior's uncle. The general revealed that he killed the warrior's father because he refused to join the general. Circe was then revealed to be the general's lover who had only aided the <b>warrior</b> so he would reach the general, who planned to offer the <b>warrior</b> a chance to serve him in his warmongering conquests. The <b>warrior</b> refused, and Circe offered him with a choice; to serve the general and his men would be spared from Circe's wrath, or to kill the general and his men shall die. The Giver, who followed the two, reminded the <b>warrior</b> {{that if he were}} to kill the general, {{who was a member of}} his family, the oath he made to his father would be broken, yet if he killed Circe, his men would perish and the oath he made to protect his men would be broken. The <b>warrior</b> declared that he would not slay Circe and defended the lives of his men. He tricked the general into drinking from a cup he had secretly filled with the cerberus's blood, which killed the general. Circe was aghast at the warrior's vengeful act and retreated. Because the <b>warrior</b> killed his own uncle, the oath he made to his father was broken. The Giver revealed himself to be Orkos, the oath keeper of the Furies and the <b>warrior</b> was imprisoned by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned.|$|E

5|$|As WWF Intercontinental Champion, the Ultimate <b>Warrior</b> began {{receiving}} more on-air {{time and}} more prominent matches. His feud with the Honky Tonk Man continued for several months, until <b>Warrior</b> {{was placed in}} a new feud with Rick Rude in early 1989.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} above, it {{was through}} the writings of Dares the Phrygian that the portrayal of Troilus as an important <b>warrior</b> was transmitted to medieval times. However, some authors {{have argued that the}} tradition of Troilus as a <b>warrior</b> may be older. The passage from the Iliad described above is read by Boitani as implying that Priam put Troilus {{on a par with the}} very best of his <b>warrior</b> sons. The description of him in that passage as hippiocharmên is rendered by some authorities as meaning a <b>warrior</b> charioteer rather than merely someone who delights in horses. The many missing and partial literary sources might include such a hero. Yet only the one ancient vase shows Troilus as a <b>warrior</b> falling in a conventional battle.|$|E
5|$|As the {{tradition}} of Troilus the <b>warrior</b> advances through time, the weaponry and the form of combat change. Already in Dares he is a mounted <b>warrior,</b> not a charioteer or foot <b>warrior,</b> something anachronistic to epic narrative. In later versions he is a knight with armour appropriate {{to the time of}} writing who fights against other knights and dukes. His expected conduct, including his romance, conforms to courtly or other values contemporary to the writing.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate <b>Warrior.</b> Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the <b>Warrior</b> traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate <b>Warrior</b> countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the <b>Warrior</b> caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the <b>Warrior</b> missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down the aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate <b>Warrior</b> accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the <b>Warrior</b> after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate <b>Warrior,</b> only to attack him when he stood up. The <b>Warrior</b> recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the <b>Warrior</b> injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable {{to get back into the}} ring, so the Ultimate <b>Warrior</b> won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the <b>Warrior</b> chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate <b>Warrior</b> then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E
5|$|Redeemed <b>Warrior</b> - The Redeemed <b>Warrior,</b> also {{referred}} to as the champion, is the unnamed protagonist of the graphic novel Rise of the <b>Warrior</b> who becomes the player's multiplayer character in Ascension. In Rise of the <b>Warrior,</b> it is shown that he was a native of Kirra whose father was killed by a general. Before dying, the <b>warrior</b> swore to his father that he would bring no harm to his family. The <b>warrior</b> then gathered soldiers of the village and sought after the general, also recruiting the witch Circe. Finding the general, he discovered that the general was actually his uncle and Circe's lover. After negotiations, the <b>warrior</b> tricked his uncle into drinking poisonous Cerberus blood, killing his uncle. Circe was aghast and fled. Because he killed his uncle, it broke his oath to his father. The Giver appeared, revealing himself to be Orkos, and imprisoned the <b>warrior</b> in the Prison of the Damned. In Ascension during Kratos' pursuit of Megaera, Kratos encountered the <b>warrior,</b> who was rejoiced to see an opportunity for freedom from his prison. Before being attacked by an arm of the Hecatonchires, the <b>warrior</b> vanished in a beam of light upon praying to the gods. This transported him to the Rotunda of Olympus. There, he started his trials for redemption to become a champion of the gods and was given a choice to either swear an allegiance to Ares, Hades, Poseidon, or Zeus. Several people are credited for the character in Ascensions multiplayer: Dave Carter, Neil Kaplan, Kevin Killebrew, Alem Brhan Sapp, Isaac C. Singleton Jr., Anthony Skordi, and Jimmie Wood.|$|E

5|$|The {{other main}} event was a WWF Championship match between The Ultimate <b>Warrior</b> and Randy Savage. The rivalry between them {{began in the}} fall of 1990, when Sensational Sherri, who was {{managing}} Savage, tried to arrange a match between Savage and <b>Warrior.</b> The <b>Warrior</b> refused to defend his WWF Championship against Savage, and he ripped up a contract that Sherri had given him. While they faced each other at house shows over the next few months, where Savage was unable to win the title, they never had a televised match with each other. Savage then interfered in the title match at Royal Rumble 1991, enabling Sgt. Slaughter to win the title. To settle the rivalry, Savage and the <b>Warrior</b> agreed to face each other in a retirement match at WrestleMania VII. The <b>Warrior</b> won the match, forcing Savage into retirement. However, Savage would be reinstated as an active wrestler in November 1991. The following year, the rivalry was rekindled when the Ultimate <b>Warrior</b> was granted a shot at the WWF Championship, which Savage had won from Ric Flair at WrestleMania VIII on April 5, 1992. Flair and his executive consultant Mr. Perfect, were upset that Flair had not been granted a rematch. They decided to cause trouble between Savage and the <b>Warrior.</b> In August, Perfect claimed that he was in negotiations with Savage and <b>Warrior,</b> who both had sought his managerial services, but refused to clarify which wrestler he would support at SummerSlam. At the SummerSlam Spectacular, a show designed to promote the pay-per-view, Savage and the <b>Warrior</b> teamed up to face The Nasty Boys. Perfect and Ric Flair interfered in the match, resulting in a count-out victory for the Nasty Boys and more animosity between Savage and <b>Warrior.</b>|$|E
5|$|The story {{followed}} an unnamed <b>warrior</b> {{who became the}} player's character in the multiplayer mode. The <b>warrior</b> {{was a native of}} Kirra whose father was killed by a cruel general who poisoned the water supply of the village, killing many people. Before dying, the warrior's father beckoned him to honor the gods and swear to never let harm come to their family. The <b>warrior</b> swore his father's oath and was met by a cloaked figure, The Giver, who guided him and followed him throughout his journey. Soon after, the <b>warrior</b> called upon Ares to save his people from the poisonous water; the god destroyed the aqueduct and water wheel that supplied water to the village. The <b>warrior</b> then encountered the surviving soldiers who had been under his father's command. One soldier told the <b>warrior</b> that swords alone could not defeat the general. The <b>warrior</b> and his men traveled to the land of Aeaea and recruited the witch Circe, who seemingly also sought revenge against the general. Circe granted the soldiers magical weapons to aid them on their journey, and suggested that they see the Oracle of Delphi to discover whether the general had any weaknesses. During this time, the <b>warrior</b> vowed loyalty to Poseidon and to protect his men.|$|E
