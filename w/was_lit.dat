50|$|In {{almost all}} Hindu homes, lamps <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> daily, {{sometimes}} before an altar. In some houses, oil lamps or candles <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> at dawn, in some houses they <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> at both dawn and dusk, {{and in a}} few, lamps are maintained continuously.|$|R
5000|$|In Northern Ireland, bonfires <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> on Halloween, October 31. {{and each}} 11 July, bonfires <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> by many Protestant {{communities}} {{to celebrate the}} victory of Williamite forces at the Battle of the Boyne, which took place on 12 July 1690. This is often called the [...] "Eleventh night". Bonfires have also <b>been</b> <b>lit</b> by Catholic communities on 9 August since 1972 to protest and commemorate Internment.|$|R
25|$|Inexpensive small wax candles {{sold for}} Hanukkah burn for {{approximately}} {{half an hour}} so should <b>be</b> <b>lit</b> no earlier than nightfall. Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not <b>be</b> <b>lit</b> on Shabbat itself, the candles must <b>be</b> <b>lit</b> before sunset. However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat candles. Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> first with larger candles than usual, followed by the Shabbat candles. At {{the end of the}} Shabbat, there are those who light the Hanukkah lights before Havdalah and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.|$|R
5|$|On 8 December 1864, {{the bridge}} <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> by {{magnesium}} flares for its ceremonial opening parade, {{but they were}} blown out by the wind. The custom of lighting the bridge has continued with more recent events, although later thousands of electric light bulbs were attached to the bridge instead of flares.|$|E
5|$|While under construction, {{the tower}} was {{specially}} illuminated on several occasions. On {{the weekend of}} July 4, 2011, it <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> up with {{the colors of the}} American flag to commemorate Independence Day, and it <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> up with the same colors on September 11 to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. On October 27 of that same year, it was illuminated with pink in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. On December 11, the Port Authority illuminated the tower with multicolored lights to celebrate the holiday season. On February 24, 2012, the building <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> up with red in honor of Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan, who became a cardinal on February 18. On June 14, 2012, it was illuminated with red, white, and blue to honor Flag Day. In August, it was illuminated with red in honor of the Armed Forces. On September 8, 2012, it was once again illuminated with red, white, and blue to honor the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. On June 24, 2013, the building was again illuminated with red, white, and blue to celebrate the Fourth of July. On November 12, 2013, three hundred red, white, and blue lights were lit up.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the murder}} of Librescu, {{at the request of}} his family and with the {{assistance}} of Gov. Tim Kaine, his body was released on April 17 and he received a funeral service at an Orthodox Jewish funeral home in Borough Park, Brooklyn, New York. On April 20, he was interred in Israel. In his native Romania, his picture was placed on a table at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest, and a candle <b>was</b> <b>lit.</b> People laid flowers nearby.|$|E
25|$|The blessings {{are said}} {{before or after}} the candles <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> {{depending}} on tradition. On the first night of Hanukkah one light (candle or oil) <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> {{on the right side of}} the menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first but it <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> first, and so on, proceeding from placing candles right to left but lighting them from left to right over the eight nights.|$|R
50|$|If {{none of the}} forges <b>were</b> <b>lit</b> {{during the}} second section, the team must {{retrieve}} a key from the mine cart, full of rocks, to unlock a cage and ring a bell, which causes the smallest forge to <b>be</b> <b>lit.</b>|$|R
50|$|Inside the Palace, {{there are}} a number of challenges, and during the course of the show four will be played. There is also a room called the Forges Room, which holds forges {{containing}} molten gold. When a challenge is successfully completed, one of the forges <b>is</b> <b>lit.</b> As more challenges are won, larger forges <b>are</b> <b>lit,</b> and if all the challenges are completed successfully, the largest forge <b>is</b> <b>lit.</b> Each forge contains an increasing amount of gold.|$|R
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E
5|$|On November 14, 2015, {{the candle}} <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> {{nearly two weeks}} prior to the {{official}} ceremony date after local resident Joe Mercado posted to an Easton, Pennsylvania Facebook community page asking to light the candle to show support {{for the people of}} Paris, France after a terrorist attack the day before. Due to overwhelming response to the post, the city organized a candle light vigil that evening with several hundred residents attending. Prayers were offered in several languages, including French, and several faiths. Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr. and Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski spoke. The candle remained lit for three days before being shut off until the official lighting event.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{special effects}} are {{generally}} recognized {{to be among}} the best of all time, using the available (non-digital) technology to the fullest. In addition to matte paintings and models, the techniques employed included multipass exposures. In some scenes, the set <b>was</b> <b>lit,</b> shot, the film rewound, and then rerecorded over with different lighting. In some cases this was done 16 times in all. The cameras were frequently motion controlled using computers. Many effects used techniques which had been developed during the production of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.|$|E
50|$|The Shift Up lamp can {{be found}} on OBD II cars. The lamp helps the driver to drive economically. The lamp is {{supplied}} by ignition power (+15) and is grounded in the Trionic ECU, pin 55. The Shift Up Lamp <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> when the ignition is turned on for three seconds to test the circuit. During normal driving the lamp <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> when reaching a specific RPM while driving at light loads. At wide-open-throttle the Shift Up lamp <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> when the RPM is near 6000 RPM. The lamp does not light in fifth gear. The light <b>is</b> <b>lit</b> at a higher RPM when the engine is cold to promote a quicker warm up.|$|R
3000|$|... {{i belong}} to the same segment of the {{exposure}} interval. The time mismatch causes visual artifacts. Samples should <b>be</b> <b>lit</b> <b>are</b> shadowed or samples should <b>be</b> shadowed <b>are</b> <b>lit.</b> Additionally, rendered images have self-shadow artifacts at low sampling rates when geometries move toward the light. Later, this idea is implemented in the current GPUs by McGuire et al. [9].|$|R
50|$|Given {{the photo}} of the clock {{at the top of the}} article as an example, two fields <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> in the first row (five hours multiplied by two, i.e. ten hours), but no fields <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> in the second row; {{therefore}} the hour value is 10. Six fields <b>are</b> <b>lit</b> in the third row (five minutes multiplied by six, i.e. thirty minutes), while the bottom row has one field on (plus one minute). Hence, the lights of the clock altogether tell the time as 10:31.|$|R
5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground. A large fire <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E
5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background <b>was</b> <b>lit,</b> the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand ordered 400 men {{to enter}} the saps; these men would storm the castle once the mine had been detonated. The {{remainder}} of his cavalry and foot soldiers were {{to wait in the}} fields below. Some sources assert that the fuse <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> at around 1:00 pm, although the 19th-century local historian Heinrich Joseph Floß argued that these sources are mistaken, and that the explosion clearly occurred in the morning. All sources agree that the explosion, with a dreadful crack, propelled chunks of the towers and walls high into the air. Almost half the Godesburg collapsed instantly. According to a newspaper report dated 13 January 1584, debris raining on the valley below damaged several houses, and destroyed some of them completely.|$|E

5|$|On 10 January 1994 a press {{reception}} {{to announce}} The Division Bell and world tour {{was held at}} a former US Naval Air Station in North Carolina, in the US. A purpose-built Skyship 600 airship, manufactured in the UK, toured the US until it returned to Weeksville, and was destroyed by a thunderstorm on 27 June. Pieces of the aircraft were sold as souvenirs. The band held another reception, in the UK, on 21 March. This time they used an A60 airship, translucent, and painted {{to look like a}} fish, which took journalists on a tour of London. The airship, which <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> internally so it glowed in the night sky, was also flown in northern Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Presque Isle Light was {{constructed}} in 1872 {{on the north side}} of Presque Isle and <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> on July12, 1873. This light is , with a red brick house that was used as a lighthouse keeper residence, and later a park residence. Today the lighthouse is maintained by the United States Coast Guard and flashes a white light to warn ships of the sandy peninsula that juts into Lake Erie. The light station is open to public tours from Memorial Day through Labor Day on weekends, weather permitting (see presqueislelighthouse.org). A third, smaller lighthouse was built in 1906 by the Erie Waterworks on the Presque Isle Bay side of the peninsula. Today it stands in the ferry landing for the Presque Isle Water Taxi service, south of the former waterworks along the state park's multi-purpose trail on the southeast side of Presque Isle.|$|E
5|$|The Red Guards, led by Ali Aaltonen, {{refused to}} {{recognise}} the Whites Guard's power status, {{and decided to}} establish a military authority of their own. Aaltonen placed the Red power base in Helsinki. The Red Order of Revolution was issued on 26 January 1918, and a red lantern, a symbolic indicator of the Uprising, <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> in the tower of the Helsinki Workers' Hall. The large scale mobilization of the Reds {{began in the late}} evening of 27 January, with the Helsinki Guard and some of the Guards located along the Viipuri-Tampere railway having become active between 23–26 January, in order to safeguard vital positions and escort a heavy railroad shipment of Bolsheviks' weapons from Petrograd to Finland. White troops tried to capture the shipment; 20–30 Finns, Red and White, died in the Battle of Kämärä in the Karelian Isthmus on 27 January 1918.|$|E

5|$|The {{chairman}} of the Pageantry Committee was Walt Disney, {{who was responsible for}} producing both the opening and closing ceremonies. He organized an opening that included 5,000 entertainers, the release of 2,000 pigeons, and a military gun salute of eight shots, one for each of the previous Winter Olympic Games. The opening ceremonies were held on February 18, 1960, at Blyth Arena {{in the midst of a}} blizzard. The heavy snow fall caused traffic problems that delayed the ceremony by an hour. The festivities began with a sustained drum roll as the flags of each participating nation were raised on specially designed flag poles. Vice President Richard Nixon represented the United States government and declared the Games open. The Olympic cauldron <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> by Kenneth Henry, Olympic champion of the 500meter speed skating race at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. The Olympic oath was taken by Carol Heiss on behalf of all the athletes. As the national delegations left the stadium fireworks concluded the ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{plan called}} for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 121:28 mission elapsed time. On the {{original}} plan, {{this would have been}} at 7:44 UTC on September 4, 1983, before accounting for the last-minute launch delay; in the event, this was put back by one day to allow for further communications testing, and Challenger touched down at 07:40:33 UTC (00:40:33 PDT), September 5, 1983, on Runway 22 at Edwards AFB, {{on the morning of the}} seventh day of the mission. As with the launch, this was the first night landing of the program. The Shuttle orbiters had no on-board lights, due to the difficulty of designing landing lights to survive re-entry, and so the runway <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> by high-intensity xenon arc lamps to guide the orbiter in. There was no pressing operational requirement for a night landing, but there was a desire to prove it was possible. Footage of the landing was shown in the 1986 film SpaceCamp.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it <b>was</b> <b>lit</b> and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
