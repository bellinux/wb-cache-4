5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> next.|$|E
5|$|La Resistance {{infiltrate}} the USO show, but The Mole is discovered {{and killed by}} guard dogs. The remaining boys attempt to warn their mothers about <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> if Terrance and Phillip are killed, but they are laughed at, and Mr. Garrison activates the electric chair. A Canadian force attacks the base and a battle ensues between the two armies. In the confusion, the boys are able to free Terrance and Phillip, though Cartman's V-chip begins to malfunction. The mothers, seeing the destruction their movement has incited, decide {{to give up and}} look for their children.|$|E
5|$|Radu is {{interviewed in}} {{this portion of}} the film, as is Tournecuillert, who speaks about his {{experiences}} in Albania, where he heard about the sex trafficking of girls and how some of the girls would be shot or burned to death as a warning to the other girls. He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> to others who try to escape. Matei adds that, for the sake of amusement, some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. Eugenia Bonetti, a nun, speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.|$|E

6000|$|Behind the {{secretary}} came {{the chairman of}} the entertainment committee, a popular dairyman, who was pale as he demanded: [...] "You got to play ball, Mr. Ericson. I won't guarantee <b>what</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>happen</b> if you don't play ball, Mr. Ericson. You got to make him fly, Mr. George. The crowd 's breaking----" ...|$|R
50|$|The tale of Taliesin {{ends with}} him telling prophecies to the Maelgwn {{about the origin}} of the human race and <b>what</b> <b>will</b> now <b>happen</b> to the world.|$|R
5|$|The story's {{main part}} {{takes place in}} {{what seems to be}} a normal high school, but in fact all took place in the school term {{previous}} to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by the other members of the Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of them will survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by a ripple effect based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and get away from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing.|$|E

6000|$|... "You won't be. If this is {{the sheriff}} I am going to open that door and make a dash. <b>What</b> <b>happens</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> outside. You need not see it. I'm sorry you have to hear it. But I give you my word--if you must hear {{something}} I will {{see to it that}} you hear as little as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's {{too good}} of you,--much too good. Because you are consoling {{yourself}} with <b>what</b> <b>will</b> never <b>happen,</b> and I know that, and yet I {{want to keep}} you. Don't blame me later, please.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That, I mean, is <b>what</b> <b>will</b> happen--and <b>happen</b> {{as quickly}} as possible--in {{consequence}} of Chad's cable. They'll simply embark. Sarah will come to speak for her mother--with an effect different from MY muddle." ...|$|R
25|$|Sonnet 14 {{contains}} a speaker {{that may not}} know how to predict the future or <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen,</b> but they do know the value of procreating to retain one's beauty throughout the ages.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} free will: A similar problem was {{to explain how}} 'divine fore{{knowledge}}' - God's knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> in the future - is compatible with our belief in our own free will.|$|E
25|$|Various {{approaches}} in pedagogy derive from constructivist theory. They usually suggest that learning is accomplished best using a hands-on approach. Learners learn by experimentation, {{and not by}} being told <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen,</b> and are left {{to make their own}} inferences, discoveries and conclusions.|$|E
5000|$|Boiling frog - {{the notion}} that gradual change tends to go unnoticed until {{it is too late}} - often {{discussed}} by drawing an analogy to a false story about <b>what</b> <b>will</b> allegedly <b>happen</b> to a frog in gradually warmed water ...|$|R
60|$|Concerning <b>what</b> <b>will</b> then <b>happen</b> {{one feels}} curious. For the German nation is still young, and its {{maturity}} is {{of importance to}} the world. They are a good people, a lovable people, who should help much {{to make the world}} better.|$|R
50|$|Hotlist is a geo-social {{networking}} aggregator {{that enables}} users to coordinate plans {{with friends and}} discover <b>what</b> <b>will</b> be <b>happening</b> at millions of popular venues all over the world. Hotlist's web platform and iPhone app are the only Location-based services that emphasize plans.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen,</b> the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E
25|$|Steven Sugar died {{of cancer}} in January 2011, and it remains unclear <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> with the legal battle. There is the {{possibility}} of someone picking up the case on Mr. Sugar's behalf. The Supreme Court says it has listed the case provisionally for another hearing in Autumn 2011.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{appreciation}} of total adult control is also considered vital, and information, {{such as how}} long a child will be with therapeutic foster parents or <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> {{to him or her}} next, is deliberately withheld. Attachment parenting expert Nancy Thomas states that attachment-disordered children act worse when given information about what is going to occur because they will use the information to manipulate their environment and everyone in it.|$|E
5000|$|Katrina Stuat Santiago of The Manila Times {{praised the}} writers and added, [...] "Suffice {{it to say that}} one cannot wait for <b>what</b> else <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> in this Pangako Sa ‘Yo, and that says a lot for someone who {{actually}} followed the original version in 2000." ...|$|R

5000|$|We {{have to warn}} Matt and Trey {{that what}} they are doing is stupid and they will {{probably}} wind up like Theo Van Goghfor airing this show. This is not a threat, but a warning of the reality of <b>what</b> <b>will</b> likely <b>happen</b> to them. Zachary Adam Chesser ...|$|R
25|$|In November 2007, the Aflac {{insurance}} company released a commercial that featured Rudolph, {{who has a}} cold but {{does not want to}} miss work. All his friends say he will be unable to pay for his expenses. Santa then tells them about Aflac. Charlie wonders <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> if Rudolph is not better by Christmas, but Rudolph thinks the Aflac duck can do the work. Rudolph gets better in a week, but Blitzen is sick, so the Aflac duck fills in for him.|$|E
25|$|Some {{things about}} the future of the Central Waterfront are clear. The 2001 Nisqually {{earthquake}} revealed that the Alaskan Way Viaduct is unsound and the seawall is in very poor condition. Another earthquake could cause liquefaction of the soils, undermining the viaduct and placing massive pressure on the seawall. While there may be much question as to <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen,</b> there is no doubt that things cannot remain as they are. Elsewhere on the waterfront, the deteriorating Piers 62 and 63 also cannot remain as they are.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{a process}} of {{informed}} consent {{is often used to}} make sure that volunteers know <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> in the experiment and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time. A debriefing is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the procedures. Today, most research in social psychology involves no more risk of harm than can be expected from routine psychological testing or normal daily activities.|$|E
50|$|<b>What</b> we foresaw <b>will</b> <b>happen.</b> Our {{last moments}} are near, {{but they are}} the moments of our liberty. We have lived them and now I willingly forfeit my life.|$|R
2500|$|The axiom AX is now {{justified}} {{based on}} the principle that <b>what</b> <b>will</b> predictably <b>happen</b> every time this experiment is performed, should at the very least be possible. [...] Hence there should exist two real numbers x, y such that x is not in f(y) and y is not in f(x).|$|R
5000|$|... [...] Mashii'at - Will: i.e., that <b>what</b> Allah <b>wills</b> <b>happens</b> and <b>what</b> He {{does not}} <b>will</b> does not <b>happen.</b> There is no {{movement}} in the heavens or on earth but <b>happens</b> by His <b>will.</b> This {{does not mean that}} He forces things to happen the way they happen in the area of human beings' voluntary actions. It means that He knew <b>what</b> they <b>will</b> choose, wrote it and now lets it happen.|$|R
25|$|Therefore, {{the best}} batting {{strategy}} for Team 1 {{ahead of a}} coming interruption {{is not always the}} same, but varies with the facts of the match situation to date (runs scored, wickets lost, overs used, and whether there have been interruptions), and also with the opinions about <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> with each strategy (how many further runs will be scored, further wickets will be lost, and further overs will be used? How likely are the coming interruptions, when will they happen, and how long will they last – will Team 1's innings be re-started?).|$|E
25|$|Game theorists use the Nash {{equilibrium}} {{concept to}} analyze {{the outcome of the}} strategic interaction of several decision makers. In other words, it provides a way of predicting <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> if several people or several institutions are making decisions at the same time, and if the outcome depends on the decisions of the others. The simple insight underlying John Nash's idea is that one cannot predict the result of the choices of multiple decision makers if one analyzes those decisions in isolation. Instead, one must ask what each player would do, taking into account the decision-making of the others.|$|E
25|$|Jews {{observe a}} Day of Atonement Yom Kippur {{on the day}} before God makes {{decisions}} regarding <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> during the coming year. Just prior to Yom Kippur, Jews will ask forgiveness of those they have wronged during the prior year (if they have not already done so). During Yom Kippur itself, Jews fast and pray for God's forgiveness for the transgressions they have made against God in the prior year. Sincere repentance is required, and once again, God can only forgive one for the sins one has committed against God; this is why it is necessary for Jews also to seek the forgiveness of those people who they have wronged.|$|E

25|$|Each {{day three}} videos from the {{internet}} are shown, they are unusual and often not sports related. Often, the last video will be paused in the middle to pose a multiple-choice question to the hosts about <b>what</b> they think <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> next. Although rare, some videos are fake.|$|R
