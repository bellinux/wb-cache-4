5|$|On 7 January 1783, Concorde was {{in company}} with Nymphe. They sighted HMS Raven, which {{initially}} sailed towards them until {{she realized that}} they were not British frigates. An all-day chase ensued until about 9p.m. <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frigates got within pistol-shot and fired a broadside that took away Ravens main topgallant-mast. The chase continued until about 10:30p.m. <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frigates was again in range, with the other coming up rapidly. At this point, Raven, which was under the command of Commander John Wells, struck. The French Navy took Raven into service under the name Cérès, which she had born when under French colours between 1778 and 1782.|$|E
5|$|According to Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight Part 6: Batman Unbound, Chris O'Donnell {{revealed}} that despite {{hanging out with}} Arnold Schwarzenegger a lot off set and during promotion for the film, they never worked a single day together. This was achieved with stand ins <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actors wasn't available.|$|E
5|$|All {{daughter}} isotopes (decay products) of element 117 {{were previously}} unknown; therefore, their properties {{could not be}} used to confirm the claim of discovery. In 2011, <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decay products (289115) was synthesized directly, its properties matched those measured in the claimed indirect synthesis from the decay of element 117. The discoverers did not submit a claim for their findings in 2007–2011 when the Joint Working Party was reviewing claims of discoveries of new elements.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1957, family tragedy {{struck a}} third time <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nieces she had cared for in the 1940s {{died at the age}} of 31, leaving a five-year-old orphan son, Roger Christie. Carson took on that responsibility, {{adopting}} the boy, alongside caring for her aging mother. This took a considerable toll on Carson. She moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, to care for Roger, and much of 1957 was spent putting their new living situation in order and focusing on specific environmental threats.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{particularly}} steep descent the following day, half of Mawson's team of dogs—reattached to his sledges—were almost lost when they {{fell into a}} crevasse.

5|$|Individual {{school districts}} have responded to {{complaints}} by local Native American individuals and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades, or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition. For example, in 2016 <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teams in the National College Prospects Hockey League (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo it was immediate changed to the Lake Erie Eagles.|$|E
5|$|Jokes {{from earlier}} scripts were used. In one scene, Carla Tortelli orders a phone caller to do {{something}} about their unruly children. <b>When</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bartenders suggests hiring a babysitter, Carla replied that the caller was the babysitter. The cast did not know the ending of the pilot episode during production, since the final draft of the script was dated April 16, 1982.|$|E
5|$|Kneale's {{treatment}} for the film met {{with the approval of}} John Carpenter, the producer of the Halloween series, although Kneale was required to write the script in only six weeks. Kneale got on well with the director assigned to the film, Tommy Lee Wallace, but <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's backers, Dino De Laurentiis, insisted upon the inclusion of more graphic violence and a rewrite of the script from Wallace, Kneale became displeased with the results and had his name removed from the film.|$|E

One person was killed and four were seriously injured, leading to a safety inspection of the old teak cars used on the line; the HkB 600units were withdrawn from service, but were reintroduced after some refits.|$|E
5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. <b>When</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> males approaches the female, {{he uses his}} upper jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located {{on either side of}} her body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The post–main-sequence {{evolution}} of binary stars may be {{significantly different from}} the {{evolution of}} single stars of the same mass. If stars in a binary system are sufficiently close, <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars expands to become a red giant it may overflow its Roche lobe, the region around a star where material is gravitationally bound to that star, leading to transfer of material to the other. When the Roche lobe is violated, a variety of phenomena can result, including contact binaries, common-envelope binaries, cataclysmic variables, and type Ia supernovae.|$|E

5|$|When World War II began, Friedrich Ihn was {{initially}} {{deployed in the}} Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sister ships in laying defensive minefields. She also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in October. The ship was scheduled to conduct a minelaying operation off the British coast in early November, but it was cancelled <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other destroyers assigned to participate suffered machinery problems from contaminated fuel oil.|$|E
5|$|A 1947 fire {{destroyed}} the clubhouse of the Toronto Argonaut Rowing Club and damaged the Grey Cup. Many other trophies and artifacts {{in the clubhouse}} melted or were damaged beyond repair but the Grey Cup survived by catching onto a nail when the shelf upon which it sat collapsed. The trophy has been broken on six other occasions: in 1978, when it was dropped by celebrating Edmonton Eskimos players; in 1987, when an Eskimos' player sat on it; in 1993, when Edmonton's Blake Dermott head-butted it; in 2006, when the trophy broke away from its base as the BC Lions celebrated their victory; in 2012 <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> handles broke off as the Toronto Argonauts celebrated; and finally in 2014 when trophy broke from its base again by the Calgary Stampeders after their win. The CFL commissioned {{a replica of the}} trophy in 2008.|$|E
5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case {{was described by}} Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found {{at the entrance of}} a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her. <b>When</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young was moved a short distance from the chamber, she seemed to be agitated and faced the intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring retreated into the chamber, but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E
