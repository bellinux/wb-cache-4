40|$|Background& Objective: Due to the {{importance}} of water consumptions, this study aims to investigate the spatial trend of surface water quality along Kan and Karaj Rivers using three quality indices: NSFWQI, IRWQIsc and WQI. Materials and Methods: The information of water quality parameters of 20 monitoring stations was collected to investigate water quality parameters along two mentioned rivers during 2012 - 2013, and water quality of two rivers were calculated using mentioned three quality indices. The parameters of TDS, FC, EC, nitrate and turbidity were used to measure the NSFWQI and IRWQIsc indices, and TDS, nitrate, and sulfate were used to calculate the <b>WQI</b> <b>index.</b> The measured parameters were compared with standards of drinking. The monitoring stations were grouped by cluster analysis and finally, the pattern of changes in water quality parameters and relevant quality indices were analyzed spatially using ArcGIS software. Results: The water quality of Kan and Karaj Rivers based on NSFWQI index were in the range of bad and average quality, respectively. According to IRWQISC index, water quality were in the range of very bad and relatively good, respectively and according to the <b>WQI</b> <b>index</b> water quality was in the range of good quality. The quality of upstream was acceptable for drinking and irrigation, on the basis of medium and good conditions of NSFWQI and IRWQISC, respectively. However, the downstream of both rivers are heavily polluted. The results of the clustering analysis stated that moving towards upstream-downstream the quality of water decreases along both rivers. Conclusion: The spatial trend analysis of water quality parameters along the rivers plays a crucial role for identifying the spatial variation of water quality.

The evaluation of water suitability {{of the present study}} for drinking and other irrigated purposes was achieved by means of arithmetic method of WQI depending on guideline values of (WHO, 2004) and Iraqi Standard No. 417 for (2004). Values of WQI ranged from (97. 230 - 79. 100) at Hilla city which is not suitable for human consumption according to the classification of Iraqi Standard No. 417 for (2004) and WHO, 2004. These values belong to high water electrical conductivity and chloride of the studied wells comparable with other parameters. Also, correlation coefficient supports this interpretation where there are strong positively correlation between WQI values and both electrical conductivity and chloride values (0. 997, 0. 919 respectively). While in the assessment of ground water quality for irrigation, electrical conductivity, pH, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), chloride,slphate, sodium, calisum and magisumwere used to calculateWQI values which range from (98. 074 - 83. 187).

For this, physicochemical water quality parameters were measured each season from 14 stations during December 2009 to September 2010. The average value of NSFWQI was 53. 21 and it showed spatial and temporal variation. The maximum value or best water quality condition (74. 5) and minimum value of NSFWQI or the worst condition (50. 93) belonged to stations 1 and 2 respectively. Results of seasonal variations of NSFWQI showed that the maximum and minimum values were 59. 62 and 53. 82 in autumn and spring respectively.

Objectives The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate quality of Khorramrood River water using Indexes of water quality including water quality index (WQI) and Wilcox and zoning with geographical information systems (GIS). Patients and Methods In this cross-sectional study, the quality parameters required for the calculation of quality indicators, i. e. WQI and Wilcox index, were measured by using standard methods at six selected stations during six months in 2012. This Parameters consisted of pH, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand, turbidity, temperature, phosphate, nitrate, fecal coliform, calcium, magnesium, and sodium. River zonation was done using the software GIS. Results By using WQI, the best water quality was reported in station number one with the scalar quantity of 71. 11 (water with best quality) and the worst water quality was in station number six with scalar quality of 42. 77 (water with bad quality). By using a Wilcox index for agricultural consumption, the river water based on EC classified in C 2 and C 3, and based on SAR it classified in S 4.

The information in calculating the WQI of Moradbeik river allowed us to take our tests results and make a scientific conclusion about the quality of water. GIS can be a powerful tool for developing solutions for water resources problems for assessing water quality, determining water availability, preventing flooding, understanding the natural environment, and managing water resources on a local or regional scale. Methods: The WQI of Moradbeik river consists of nine tests: Fecal Coliform (FC), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD 5), Nitrates (NO 3), Total Phosphate (PO 4), pH, temperature, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), turbidity, and Total Solid (TS). Water quality of Moradbeik river was investigated for 12 months. Concentrations of these nine variables were normalized on a scale from 0 to 100 and translated into statements of water quality (excellent, good, regular, fair, and poor). Also this data were analyzed with <b>WQI</b> <b>index,</b> and then river basis on water quality was zoning by GIS. Results: The average of WQI was 61. 62, which corresponded to ‘‘medium’’ quality water at the sampling point 1 (best station) and decreased to around 26. 41 (bad quality) at sampling point 6. The association between sampling points and water quality indexes was statistically significant (P< 0. 05).

The spatial trend of water quality index (WQI) and its sub-indexes are important for determining the locations of major pollutant sources that contribute to water quality depletion in the Skudai and its tributaries. In this study, we have developed WQI for eight sections of the Skudai watershed. Ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N) was identified as a major pollutant downstream from the Skudai, with the lowest <b>WQI</b> <b>index</b> (i. e. 38). WQI for the Skudai (natural) was 94, i. e., Class I (very clean) category of river water quality. The Senai River has WQI value of 85 and Class II category (slightly polluted). However, the Kempas River, which was in suburban parts of the Skudai watershed, had WQI of 53 (Class III, polluted).

30|$|Assessment {{of surface}} water quality {{can be a}} complex process {{undertaking}} multiple parameters capable of causing various stresses on overall water quality. Water Quality Index (WQI) is a very useful and efficient method for assessing the suitability of water quality. It {{is also a very}} useful tool for communicating the information on overall quality of water to the concerned citizens and policy makers. The concept of WQI to represent gradation in water quality was first proposed by Horten. The use of WQIs simplifies the presentation of results of investigation related to a water body, as it summarizes in a single unitless value, the combined effect of a number of water quality parameters analyzed. Several water quality indexes are in use to assess quality of natural waters (Tyagi et al. 2013). Thus, the indices not only convey information concerning water quality but also facilitate spatial and temporal comparisons. WQI indicates water quality in terms of a single index number and is useful in monitoring water quality. To analyze water quality, different approaches such as statistical analyses of individual parameter, multi-stressors water quality indices, etc., have been considered (Venkatesharaju et al. 2010). WQI has been used for assessing quality of River Ganga in the past. WQI using C++ program found River Ganga water to be unsuitable in Uttarpradesh (Aenab and Singh 2013). <b>WQI</b> <b>index</b> based on computer program of River Ram Ganga in western UP classified river water into permissible, slight, moderate and severe {{on the basis of the}} pollution strength selected from upstream to downstream of the river for a period of 3  years (Alam and Pathak 2010). Bhargava (1982) in a survey of total length of the river Ganga found that quality index was far above the prescribed limit at Kanpur. He further found that the Ganga water was having unusually fast regenerating capacity by bringing down biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) owing to the presence of large amount of well-adopted microorganisms. Analysis of river Ganga water at Rishikesh using WQI at Rishikesh for drinking, recreation and other purpose using eight water quality parameters: turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), BOD, chemical oxygen demand (COD), free carbon dioxide (free CO 2), total solids (TS), total suspended solids (TSS) and total dissolved solids (TDS) revealed that the water is not suitable for drinking purpose (Chauhan and Singh 2010).|$|E

The results of WQI showed that the water quality of the reach of interest declined from excellent in the year of 1999 to unsuitable in 2007 then good in 2008 to unsuitable once again in the years of 2009 – 2015. The PI indicated that Cd, Cr, and Pb were the most affecting elements all over the years. The MI was found to be a threshold of warning during all years but with different levels. The impact of Al-Rustimiyah Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) on the water quality was evident {{due to the lack of}} heavy metal treatment units within the plants.
