25|$|From 1901 to 1937, Taiwanese cinema was {{influenced}} immensely by Japanese cinema.

For instance, {{the use of a}} benshi (narrator of silent films), which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> component of the film-going experience in Japan, was adopted and renamed piansu by the Taiwanese. This narrator was very different from its equivalent in the Western world. It rapidly evolved into a star system. In fact, people would go to see the very same film narrated by different benshi, to hear the other benshi's interpretation. A romance could become a comedy or a drama, depending on the narrator's style and skills.|$|E

25|$|The chest <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> {{piece of}} furniture, {{and is often}} to be met with covered with the most {{elaborate}} carving (Orleans Museum).

But {{it is to the}} 15th century that we look for the best work of this class; there is no finer example than that in the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin. The front is a very animated hunting scene most decoratively arranged in a scheme of foliage, and the top bears two coats of arms with helms, crests and mantling. But the more general custom in chest decoration was to employ tracery with or without figure work; Avignon Museum contains some typical examples of the latter class.|$|E
