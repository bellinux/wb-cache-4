5|$|After {{the trade}} Chamberlain {{found himself on}} a {{promising}} Sixers team that included guards Hal Greer, a future Hall-of-Famer, and talented role players Larry Costello, Chet Walker and Lucious Jackson. Cherry remarks that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> tension within the team: Greer was the formerly undisputed leader and {{was not willing to}} give up his authority, and Jackson, a talented center, was now forced to play power forward because Chamberlain blocked the center spot; however, as the season progressed, the three began to mesh better. Chamberlain did not care for the Sixers' coach, Dolph Schayes, because Schayes, according to him, had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players in the NBA.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{shortly before}} the U.N. Headquarters {{underwent}} major renovations, Del Toro and Soderbergh shot the scenes of Guevara speaking to the U.N. General Assembly in 1964. The director wanted to shoot {{the first part of}} The Argentine in Cuba, but was prevented from travelling there by the U.S. government's embargo. Doubling Santa Clara proved to be difficult because it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> size and had a certain look. Soderbergh spent four to five months scouting for a suitable replacement, looking at towns in Veracruz/Yucatán before settling on Campeche, which had the elements they needed.|$|E

5|$|On 29 August 1945, MacArthur {{was ordered}} to {{exercise}} authority through the Japanese government machinery, including the Emperor Hirohito. MacArthur's headquarters was located in the Dai Ichi Life Insurance Building in Tokyo. Unlike in Germany, where the Allies had in May 1945 abolished the German state, the Americans chose to allow the Japanese state to continue to exist, albeit under their ultimate control. Unlike Germany, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> partnership between the occupiers and occupied as MacArthur decided to rule Japan via the Emperor and {{the most of the}} rest of the Japanese elite. The Emperor was a living god to the Japanese people, and MacArthur found that ruling via the Emperor made his job in running Japan much easier than it otherwise would have been.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kopidnadon or Kopidnados {{took place}} in September 788 between the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire.

Among the Byzantine losses <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> Diogenes, who is identified by some scholars with the probable original source for the literary hero Digenes Akritas.|$|E

5|$|The year of Salih ibn Mirdas's {{birth is}} not known. Both of Salih's parents belonged to noble {{households}} of the Bedouin (nomadic Arab) tribe of Banu Kilab. His father <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> Mirdas ibn Idris who hailed from a princely clan of the Kilab, specifically from the Rabi'ah ibn Ka'b {{line of the}} 'Abd Allah ibn Abu Bakr branch. Nothing else is known about Mirdas. Salih's mother, Rabab al-Zawqaliyah, came from the princely Kilabi clan of Zawqal, which inhabited the environs of Aleppo. Salih had at least three brothers, only one of whom, Kamil, is named in sources and at least four sons, Nasr (d. 1038), Thimal (d. 1062), Atiyya (d. 1071/72) and the youngest whose name is not known (d. 1029).|$|E
5|$|John's first {{marriage}} probably dates to {{after his arrival}} in Serbia, though the identity of his first wife, if any, is unknown. If the next ruler of Valona, Alexander Komnenos Asen, was his son, {{then he would have}} been born circa 1346–1348, as he was already an adult in 1363–1366. This would place John's potential {{first marriage}} a few years before Alexander's estimated birth. Around 1350–1355, John married Anna Palaiologina, a granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and a widow of John II Orsini, the despot of Epirus. This marriage to an Epirote noblewoman consolidated and legitimised John's position in the region. Besides Alexander, another very likely child of John Komnenos Asen <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> Komnena, the wife of Balša II who had succeeded Alexander as ruler of Valona in early 1372.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{primarily}} found {{fault with}} the game's length, as {{the bulk of}} the game's content can be completed in only a few hours. Will Tuttle of GameSpy questioned whether Harmonix limited the number of songs on release knowing {{that there would be a}} market for the game's downloadable content in the near future. The low number of songs, along with the new themed instrument controllers, were found to make the game an expensive proposition for those new to rhythm games. Due to the limited selection of songs on the disc, some critics questioned the specific inclusion of certain songs or the exclusion of more popular songs. Furthermore, critics claimed that the game's complete dedication to the Beatles, without the option for cross-compatibility with Rock Band or vice versa, can potentially lead to tedious play sessions with minimal variety, hampering the social nature of the game. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com considered that in attaching the Rock Band name to the game's title, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> expectation on an expandable library of songs and interoperability with previous Rock Band titles, which The Beatles: Rock Band failed to meet. Some players coming from previous versions of Rock Band would consider the songs in The Beatles: Rock Band to lack technical challenge. However, the less difficult note tracks were seen to be a welcoming benefit for newcomers to the series as well as those attempting to sing along with the harmony portions of the game. For purist fans, some critics noted that the game purposely avoids certain aspects of the Beatles' history; former band members such as Pete Best or collaborators such as Billy Preston or Eric Clapton are never seen during gameplay. Concerning supplemental content, Hilary Goldstein of IGN felt the extra features could have been more substantial, especially in comparison to the additional material that accompanies the remastered CDs.|$|E

I propose several ways of analyzing {{what it is like to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there is something it is like to have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there is anything it is like to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that it is like to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> F <b>is</b> recommended...|$|R
