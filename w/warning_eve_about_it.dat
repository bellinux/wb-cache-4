50|$|Cinemasonic is a live album by All <b>About</b> <b>Eve.</b> <b>It</b> was {{released}} {{both as a}} CD and as a DVD and is a recording of the band's gig on 31 May 2002 at the Shepherd's Bush Empire.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music of}} the song is {{featured}} in the film All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> (1950). <b>It</b> is played on the piano at the party when Margo tells her friends to [...] "fasten their seat belts." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{music of}} the song appears in the films All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> (1950) (<b>it</b> is played on the piano at the party while the guests are {{gathered}} on the stairs [...] ) [...] and in Bachelor in Paradise (1961).|$|R
50|$|Scarlet and Other Stories is {{the second}} studio album by All <b>About</b> <b>Eve.</b> <b>It</b> was held to be {{considerably}} darker both in tone and lyrics than their first album, All <b>About</b> <b>Eve.</b> The relationship between lead singer Julianne Regan and guitarist Tim Bricheno broke down during the album's recording and production, and Regan later said that she hadn't wept as much in her life as she had during the making of this album.|$|R
50|$|Ultraviolet is {{the fourth}} and final studio album by All <b>About</b> <b>Eve.</b> <b>It</b> was the only album that the band {{released}} with MCA. Despite quite positive reviews at the time this album was not commercially successful, reaching only #36 on the UK charts. The two singles only reached, respectively, #38 and #57 in the UK singles charts. As a consequence of this, the band were dropped by MCA shortly afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|... "Martha's Harbour" [...] {{is a song}} by the English {{rock band}} All <b>About</b> <b>Eve.</b> <b>It</b> {{became known as the}} group's {{signature}} song, reaching #10 in the UK Singles Chart and helping the group's self-titled debut album reach #7 in the UK albums chart. The song was highly unusual for a 1980s pop hit, featuring only Julianne Regan's voice, acoustic guitars played by Tim Bricheno and background sound effects of the sea.|$|R
5000|$|Touched by Jesus is {{the third}} studio album by All <b>About</b> <b>Eve.</b> <b>It</b> was the first album to feature Church guitarist Marty Willson-Piper on guitars. Despite this, the album fell short of the {{commercial}} achievements of both the first album and Scarlet and Other Stories only reaching No. 17 in the UK charts. Of the three singles released only [...] "Farewell Mr Sorrow" [...] charted, reaching No. 36.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fifth}} season of Quantum Leap, {{the plot of}} the episode [...] "Goodbye Norma Jean" [...] mirrors that of All <b>About</b> <b>Eve.</b> In <b>it,</b> Sam Beckett leaps into Marilyn Monroe's chauffeur and finds himself pitted against an {{aspiring}} actress who is trying to steal Monroe's part for the film The Misfits. Sam succeeds in stopping Monroe's rival, and she rightfully takes her place as Clark Gable's leading lady.|$|R
50|$|Atom Eve {{was created}} by the {{government}} to be a weapon. At birth, she was switched with a stillborn, and sent home with its birth-parents so as to avoid the government's seizing of her. She was a prodigy in science and received a scholarship to a prestigious school. Her scientific ability {{turned out to be an}} early manifestation of her powers. A man approached her one day, <b>warning</b> <b>Eve</b> that her powers may be her downfall and encouraged her to never to use them again.|$|R
50|$|Demetriades {{is one of}} {{the main}} protagonists in the 2015 film Alex & <b>Eve</b> <b>about</b> dating between a Greek (Alex, played by Richard Brancatisano) and a Muslim Lebanese (Eve, played by Demetriades).|$|R
5000|$|After {{hearing that}} Invincible {{broke up with}} his girlfriend, Eve shows up at his dorm asking, [...] "So -- are we dating or what?", but leaves without a word when he tells <b>Eve</b> <b>about</b> his {{encounter}} with her future self.|$|R

50|$|Act I closes with <b>Eve</b> <b>about</b> to die. She {{delivers}} a monologue about Cain's {{departure from the}} family and the birth of another son, Seth, who has since had children of his own. She then prays that her children and her grandchildren will regain the garden that was lost ("Children of Eden").|$|R
60|$|Of course, one of {{the first}} things after each {{individual}} had ascertained his own losses, was to inquire into those of his neighbours, and the usual party in the ladies' cabin was seated around the sofa of <b>Eve,</b> <b>about</b> nine in the evening, conversing on this topic, after having held a short but serious discourse on their recent escape.|$|R
50|$|B All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> and Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte {{have since}} been {{replaced}} by new editions (All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> is two discs) in a Bette Davis boxed set, released April 8, 2008.|$|R
60|$|<b>Eve</b> gazed <b>about</b> her in wonder; {{and then}} she hesitated a moment, as if distrusting her ears.|$|R
5000|$|Zanuck was {{enthusiastic}} and provided numerous suggestions {{for improving the}} screenplay. In some sections, he felt Mankiewicz's writing lacked subtlety or provided excessive detail. He suggested diluting Birdie Coonan's jealousy of Eve so the audience would not recognize Eve as a villain until much later in the story. Zanuck reduced the screenplay by about 50 pages and chose the title All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> from the opening scenes in which Addison DeWitt says he will soon tell [...] "more of <b>Eve</b> ... All <b>about</b> <b>Eve,</b> in fact." ...|$|R
50|$|The baptismal font is a {{national}} monument. It {{is made out of}} 18th-century oak in the baroque style. The font has the shape of a globe, together with the figures of Adam and <b>Eve</b> <b>about</b> to be expelled from the Garden of Eden. Above them are depicted two angels, one with a flaming sword and the other an angel of peace. Above the globe is a painting of Jesus being crucified.|$|R
50|$|Mice {{were formed}} in 1995 by (then) ex-All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> lead singer Julianne Regan and ex-Powder bassist Tim McTighe. The band also {{featured}} former Levitiation guitarist Christian Hayes (aka Bic), {{as well as}} (ex-All <b>About</b> <b>Eve)</b> drummer Mark Price (at that point in time, Regan's brother-in-law). As well as these permanent members, Mice also featured many collaborations, including other former members of All <b>About</b> <b>Eve,</b> Marty Willson-Piper and Andy Cousin.|$|R
50|$|Praised {{by critics}} {{at the time}} of its release, All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> {{received}} 14 Academy Award nominations (a feat only matched by the 1997 film Titanic and the 2016 film La La Land) and won six, including Best Picture. All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> is the only film in Oscar history to receive four female acting nominations (Davis and Baxter as Best Actress, Holm and Ritter as Best Supporting Actress). All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> was selected in 1990 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry and was among the first 50 films to be registered. All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> appeared at #16 on AFI's 1998 list of the 100 best American films.|$|R
50|$|Price {{played the}} drums for the All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> reunion tour in 1999, but he stayed with Del Amitri, and so All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> carried on without him, {{initially}} touring acoustically and then recruiting {{a series of}} other drummers.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe smiled. It was {{a curious}} smile, which seemed somehow to lose itself in his face. Then the dinner gong sounded and {{he winked at}} me slowly. Again I was {{conscious}} of some slight uneasiness. It began to dawn upon {{me that there was}} a scheme somewhere hatching; that Mr. Bundercombe's activity in the camp of the enemy might perhaps have an unsuspected significance. I talked to <b>Eve</b> <b>about</b> this after dinner; but she reassured me.|$|R
50|$|Their {{conversation}} {{is interrupted by}} {{a phone call from}} Stanley, who mentions that Diane will be joining them for dinner. Worried that Diane will tell <b>Eve</b> <b>about</b> their tryst, Oscar finds Diane at a tea room with several of her friends. All act as though they know about the previous evening, and most of the women twice his age flirt with him. Oscar makes Diane promise to keep last night a secret from Stanley and especially Eve.|$|R
50|$|All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> is the self-titled {{first album}} of All <b>About</b> <b>Eve.</b> Commercially, {{this was their}} most successful, {{reaching}} No.7 in the UK charts and spawning four Top 40 singles (one of which went top 10). Most of the album was produced by Paul Samwell-Smith.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, {{following}} the reformation of All <b>About</b> <b>Eve,</b> {{renewed interest in}} the band saw a re-release of the album in a limited pressing of 500 copies. Nearly {{all of them were}} sold at All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> gigs during their Fairy Light Nights period.|$|R
50|$|Despite having {{previously}} been on public record expressing absolutely {{no wish to}} resurrect All <b>About</b> <b>Eve,</b> in late 1999 a Mission re-launch was underway and lead singer Hussey - in {{a repeat of the}} first time All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> had become successful - again asked Regan if she would like to support him on tour. Although she was already involved with Jules et Jim (who had put out an EP called Swimming earlier that year), Regan acquiesced, rounded up Price, Cousin and Wilson-Piper, and All <b>About</b> <b>Eve</b> were back (for full details see Recent times).|$|R
5000|$|Even before Eve's creation, God {{had warned}} Adam [...] "...but {{you must not}} eat from the tree of the {{knowledge}} of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die." [...] (...) Despite God's <b>warning,</b> first <b>Eve,</b> then Adam, eat the forbidden fruit after being persuaded by the devil {{in the form of}} a serpent. (...) Upon doing so, they immediately realize that they are naked, and sew fig leaves together as coverings.|$|R
