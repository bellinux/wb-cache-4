40|$|The joint Italian-Uzbek {{activity}} {{aimed at}} realising an Archaeological Map of the Middle Zeravshan Valley, started in 1999 identified and documented (1999 - 2008) the archaeological evidences {{in the area}} and a series of significant canalization works, originated by the river. Among these, the Dargom canal, already mentioned by Tolomeus in his Geografikà as the main <b>water</b> <b>restocking</b> of Μαρακάνδα (Afrasyab) was certainly the most important; in the list of the rivers in the middle-Persian sources, the Dargom is recorded as well 3. The Italian-Uzbek activity was aimed at protecting and valorising the archaeological-environmental patrimony of the area on one hand, and to analyze, in details, the ancient settlement scheme, from the early phases up to now on the other...|$|E

It is typically about 20  min at most HSR systems. In Japanese HSR system (Shinkansen), it is about 12  min [24].|$|R
50|$|The {{alkaloids}} in {{the press}} cake of Madhuca seeds is reportedly used in killing fishes in aquaculture ponds {{in some parts of}} India. The cake serves to fertilize the pond, which can be drained, sun dried, refilled with <b>water</b> and <b>restocked</b> with fish fingerlings.|$|R
50|$|The river became {{severely}} polluted by {{industrial waste}} in the Industrial Revolution, but {{in the second half}} of the 20th century a number of initiatives were implemented to improve <b>water</b> quality, <b>restock</b> it with fish and create a diverse environment for wildlife. Stretches of the river flowing through Manchester and Salford have attracted large-scale investment in business and residential developments, such as Salford Quays, and other parts have become important wildlife havens. The Irwell is used for recreational activities, such as pleasure cruising, rowing, racing and fishing.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2008, the area's natural bodies of water, {{including}} Catlin Creek and Ridgebury Lake, were infested with groups of Northern snakehead, a highly predatory fish that has recently been found unintentionally spreading around the United States. In Ridgebury, the snakeheads have been removed with poisoning by the DEC, and all <b>water</b> has been <b>restocked</b> with native species.|$|R
500|$|After being {{threatened}} {{to be killed}} by her, Toto calls the Munchkins, who set Dorothy free and hold up the witch. During the final battle, it cuts away to a scene where Quentin Tarantino is having a meeting with Kermit, discussing ideas for how Dorothy can defeat the Wicked Witch of the West. Tarantino's ideas are deemed too expensive and too violent for a Muppet movie, so they agree for Dorothy to do a powerful kick on the witch. Cutting back to the action, Dorothy kicks the witch into her own [...] "bottled water bath" [...] which contains tap water (to which she is severely allergic). Angel Marie admitted that he filled the water bottles with tap <b>water</b> to <b>restock</b> them. This action causes the Wicked Witch of the West to melt as Johnny averts Foo-Foo's eyes. With the Wicked Witch of the West dead, Dorothy finds the magic eye floating in the tub unharmed and grabs it.|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s, the European eels' {{stocks have}} {{dramatically}} decreased {{with no sign}} of recovery, resulting in their classification as Critically endangered on the IUCN red list of threatened species. The European Council Regulation 1100 / 2007 requires that 35 % of glass eels caught annually by fishing be released in European <b>waters</b> for <b>restocking.</b> However, the efficiency of this measure on population viability has never been evaluated. Here, we estimated demographic parameters of a stocked population of French eels using a multistate capture-recapture model. Using these estimates, we then estimated population size and predicted the number of future genitors obtained by stocking. We found that the stage in which eels were stocked did not influence their future survival and that the maximal number of silver eels was quickly reached, after 3 years following stocking. We concluded that stocking experiments in the Mediterranean region are efficient for fast production of genitors. We suggest that further studies should assess the quality of these genitors. 9 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|The written {{history of}} the Cape Colony {{in what is now}} South Africa began when Portuguese {{navigator}} Bartolomeu Dias became the first modern European to round the Cape of Good Hope in 1488. [...] In 1497, Vasco da Gama sailed along the whole coast of South Africa on his way to India, landed at St Helena Bay for 8 days, and made a detailed description [...] of the area. The Portuguese, attracted by the riches of Asia, made no permanent settlement at the Cape Colony. However, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) settled the area as a location where vessels could <b>restock</b> <b>water</b> and provisions.|$|R
25|$|Mining {{presents}} a different problem, as the mines have been abandoned, but the pollution continues. Near Penistone, ochre discharged {{into the river}} from old ganister mine workings, giving it an orange colour for about six miles, eventually remedied, while at Beeley Wood, the ochre comes from a pile of waste metal on the river bank. A nearby paper mill {{has also been a}} significant polluter of the river. Some of the problem has been mitigated by the construction of lagoons, into which mine discharges have been diverted. Water quality on the Dearne and the Rother has not improved as much as on the Don, and pollution of the lower reaches is {{compounded by the fact that}} the pollutants, which include dioxins, are locked up in the river bed sediments. Despite the steady improvement in <b>water</b> quality, <b>restocking</b> of the river with fish, attempted on several occasions between 1981 and 1994, was largely ineffective, caused by intermittent discharges of pollutants. In November 2011, the Environment Agency announced that they had recently re-stocked the Don with 1,000 barbel. A spokesman said that the fish in the river were now at a sustainable level with a breeding population and these would be the last fish added as part of a 10-year programme to help the Don recover from an industrial heritage that had depleted fish stocks.|$|R
2500|$|By the 16th century, the Dutch East India Company {{established}} a replenishing station at Table Bay for <b>restocking</b> <b>water</b> and purchasing {{meat from the}} Khoikhoi. The Khoikhoi received copper, iron, tobacco, and beads in exchange. In order to control the price of meat and stock and make service more consistent, the Dutch {{established a}} permanent settlement at Table Bay in 1652. They grew {{fresh fruit and vegetables}} and established a hospital for sick sailors. To increase produce, the Dutch decided {{to increase the number of}} farms at Table Bay by encouraging freeburgher boers (farmers) on lands worked initially by slaves from West Africa. The land was taken from Khoikhoi grazing land, triggering the first Khoikhoi-Dutch war in 1659. No victors emerged, but the Dutch assumed a [...] "right of conquest" [...] by which they claimed all of the cape. In a series of wars pitting the Khoikhoi against each other, the Boers assumed all Khoikhoi land and claimed all their cattle. The second Khoikoi-Dutch war (1673–1677) was a cattle raid. The Khoikhoi also died in thousands from European diseases.|$|R
50|$|The Gila trout {{has been}} {{threatened}} by competition and hybridization with introduced game fish {{such as the}} rainbow trout. However, {{the primary cause of}} reduced Gila trout populations is habitat loss caused by loss of water flow and shade-giving trees, caused in turn by fires, human destruction of riparian vegetation, livestock overgrazing, agricultural irrigation and water diversion, and channelization of streams in the Gila trout's native range. By the time the Gila trout was listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1967 its range had reduced from several hundred miles of stream to just 20 in the Gila Wilderness and Aldo Leopold Wilderness. After listing USFWS began an aggressive program of stream restoration, removing the introduced trout, restoring and repairing riparian vegetation (to maintain cooler <b>water</b> temperatures), and <b>restocking</b> restored streams with young Gila trout. The Mora National Fish Hatchery and Technology Center in northern New Mexico keeps brood stocks of the Gila trout and supplies the fish for restocking. The species is now more secure {{than it was in the}} 1970s, having been moved to 10 new streams, though populations and habitat are still far below those originally established. Conservationists hope to eventually delist the species and allow fishing, thus forming alliances with fishermen in order to help preserve the species. Major wildfires and drought will always play a major role in the status of any trout species.|$|R
40|$|Rotifers were reared on the {{artificial}} diet culture Selco® in batch and recirculation conditions at different water exchange rates. The different rearing conditions resulted in considerable changes in water quality, which in their turn affected rotifer growth and food consumption. At a daily water exchange rate of 100 %, no positive effect was obtained in rotifer growth {{compared to the}} batch rearing system, but the rotifer culture period could be prolonged by 1 week. By increasing the daily water exchange rate from 100 to 300 % the maximum rotifer density could be significantly (P - 1. At the highest recirculation rate (daily water exchange of 500 %) the highest rotifer production (2800 individuals per milliliter in 11 days) was obtained after adjustment of the feeding scheme. This adjustment was necessary to compensate for food losses in the recirculation system. The use of a modified culture Selco (CSH) could further improve {{the performance of the}} rotifers. Using this experimental diet, a rotifer density of 8000 individuals per milliliter could be obtained in 8 days without rinsing and restocking during the production period. When the rotifer populations were kept below their maximal density by daily harvests the culture period could be extended to more than 1 month. During this period the cultures were not subjected to any <b>water</b> exchange or <b>restocking</b> except the replacement of the water to compensate for the daily harvested rotifers (± 20 % of the standing population). In general terms it can be stated that the use of a recirculation system has proved to reduce labour and maintenance cost while ensuring stable physico-chemical rearing conditions resulting in more reliable and healthy rotifer cultures...|$|R
50|$|Maj. General Winfield Hancock's Army of the Rappahannock {{began to}} arrive near Chesterfield Bridge at 2 pm on May 6 {{accompanied}} by General Grant. However, Lee had outpaced all estimates and had arrived {{early enough to}} strike the Second Division of Hancock's II Corps in the flank before it had properly deployed. Hancock rushed orders to Maj. General Horatio Wright's VI Corps to double-time to assist the II Corps, and Grant's headquarters came under fire, but Grant calmly ordered artillery batteries to deploy to his position and the Confederate charge was halted. Simultaneously, Longstreet force marched 25,000 men out of the James Peninsula to Richmond Station to take trains to Hanover Junction, but {{by the actions of}} Union agent Elizabeth Van Lew and her contact, superintendent of the RF&P Railroad Samuel Ruth, trains were sent to distant locations and boxcars were left on sidings and not unloaded. At 7:15 pm, Longstreet became increasingly agitated as his men sat around Richmond Station while Lee battled for survival between two Union armies. Additionally, Union cavalry had smashed one of his brigades on the march, and he had been forced to detach another brigade to hold the road. When a train at last arrived in the station, Longstreet was aghast that no railroad crew came out to service it - it's cars lay full of tar, firewood, and scrap iron, and no one arrived to refill its <b>water</b> tanks or <b>restock</b> its firewood. Worse still, the engine itself was an older Confederate model, not one of the newer English engines that had been arriving. It took an hour for the cars to be unloaded and the Confederate 5th and 15th cavalry to board, and the train wheezed and died ten miles north of the station. Longstreet had his cavalry disembark and ride north while his infantry continued their march. While Lee had reasonably expected Longstreet by mid-afternoon on May 6, he was now only going to arrive by the following day. Van Lew sent a courier to Grant with said information, arriving at 10 pm that evening, and Grant delegated Sheridan's 5,000 cavalry to hold Longstreet away from Lee's army.|$|R
