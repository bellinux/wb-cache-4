His time was good enough to put him into the overall race lead. Aru rode strongly, and was only three seconds behind Dumoulin in the general classification after the stage.

5|$|Although entries of meteoroids into Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{are very}} common, recording a similar flight through the upper {{layers of the}} atmosphere is quite rare. Probably the first one reliably verified happened on 20 July 1860 above the American state of New York. The Czechoslovak–Polish fireball is sometimes compared to the 1972Great Daylight Fireball above Utah, the United States, and Alberta, Canada, {{which is the first}} scientifically observed and studied event of this type. The 1972 fireball <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> thousand times as massive and it got 40km closer to Earth's surface. Observational data from both of them helped to develop a method for computing the grazing trajectories of such bodies, which was later used when calculating the trajectory of another Earth-grazing meteoroid, observed on 29 March 2006 above Japan.|$|E
5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' {{purchases}} and trades eventually altered the American diet. Starting with the Molasses Act of 1733, followed by the Sugar Act of 1760, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred. This <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> protest against taxation of molasses, the main ingredient in rum production. Whiskey became the spirit of choice for many American colonists who wished to thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye {{was seen as a}} more civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of local Democrats in Bardstown, Kentucky, in 1859, Brown was {{nominated}} to oppose Joshua Jewett for Jewett's seat in the House of Representatives. Despite Brown's protests that he <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year younger than the legal age to serve, he was elected over Jewett by about two thousand votes. He did not take his seat until the second congressional session because of his age. He {{became a member of}} the Douglas National Committee in 1860 and engaged in a series of debates with supporters of John C. Breckinridge for president, including Breckinridge's cousin, William Campbell Preston Breckinridge.|$|E

5|$|By early July 1724 Bach <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> month {{into his}} second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. BWV10 is the fifth of 40 chorale cantatas he started that year. The outer {{movements}} of the cantata are set for mixed choir and an orchestra consisting of trumpet, two oboes, strings and continuo. Luther's translation of Luke1:46–48 is {{the text of the}} first movement. The canticle's doxology is the text of the last movement. The five middle movements are a succession of arias and recitatives, with, between the fourth and sixth movement, a duet for alto and tenor. Soprano and bass each have one aria, and the two recitatives are sung by the tenor. The text of the arias and recitatives is paraphrased and expanded from Luke1:49–53 and 55. The text of the duet is Luther's translation of Luke1:54. The melody associated with Luther's German Magnificat appears in movements 1, 5 and 7.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Klein's {{division}} {{was part of}} the newly created VIII. Corps, under command of Édouard Mortier; the role of the Corps was to patrol and secure the northern shore of the Danube river, limiting the Austro-Russian activity. Napoleon incorrectly assumed that the Russians and the Austrians would make a stand near St. Pölten, northwest of Vienna. Klein's entire regiment of dragoons patrolled the northern Danube shore, while the rest of his division, the last in the extended line of march, <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> day behind Maxime Gazan's lead division. Klein's division did not take part in the Battle of Dürenstein, although his dragoons were with Mortier and Gazan immediately prior to the engagement.|$|E
5|$|In Q3, Nico Rosberg ran wide at turn 15 on {{his first}} flying lap and lost the chance to seek areas of {{improvement}} for his second run. Lewis Hamilton, who was fastest in all three sessions, capitalized on his teammate's problem and took pole position by over half a second. It was his 39th pole position and his 4th at Albert Park. The {{rest of the field}} <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> second behind Hamilton's time, with Felipe Massa in the Williams best of the rest in third position.

5|$|The German-born British {{physicist}} Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes' experiments {{by placing}} metal plates {{parallel to the}} cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of current, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components. However, this produced a value that <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclogenesis}} in the 1992 Atlantic {{hurricane season}} {{began with the}} development of Subtropical Storm One on April 21. However, over the next three months, minimal activity occurred, with only two depressions developing, one in June and the other in July. Although wind shear was relatively weak in August, only one tropical cyclone occurred in that month. However, that one tropical cyclone, Hurricane Andrew, was the strongest and costliest of the season. Though September is the climatological peak of hurricane season, an increase in wind shear prevented tropical cyclogenesis {{in the first half of}} the month. After September 16, however, five tropical cyclones developed in a span of nine days, from September 17 to 26. Thereafter, activity abruptly halted, and only one tropical cyclone developed in October, Hurricane Frances. By October 27, Frances became extratropical, which <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> month before the official end of the season on November 30.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Smith {{registered}} a save {{in every}} appearance from April 28 to June 25. On June 11, he saved his 16th consecutive game {{to break the}} major league record set by Doug Jones in 1988. He ran his streak to 19 games before finally blowing a save on June 28. (John Wetteland broke the record the next year by saving 24 straight). After keeping his ERA at 0.00 through {{the first two months}} of the season, he was selected to his seventh and final All-Star Game, thereby becoming only the fourth player to be an All-Star for four different teams (after Walker Cooper, George Kell and Goose Gossage). Smith did not fare well for the next month, pushing his ERA {{all the way up to}} 5.40. Regardless, the Angels held a double-digit lead in the division and seemed set for the postseason. Instead, California suffered one of the worst collapses in major league history, blowing the entire double-digit lead in less than six weeks. While the rest of the team was reeling, Smith reverted to his early-season form and pitched fantastically for the last two months, only blowing one save attempt in that span. He finished the season with 37 saves and a 3.47 ERA, which <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> point higher than the league average.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} in Europe remained volatile into 1794. Off Northern France, the French Atlantic Fleet had mutinied due to errors in provisions and pay. In consequence, the French Navy officer corps suffered greatly {{from the effects}} of the Reign of Terror, with many experienced sailors being executed, imprisoned or dismissed from the service for perceived disloyalty. The shortage of provisions <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> navy problem though; France itself was starving because the social upheavals of the previous year had combined with a harsh winter to ruin the harvest. By this time at war with all her neighbours, France had nowhere to turn for overland imports of fresh provisions. Eventually a solution to the food crisis was agreed by the National Convention: food produced in France's overseas colonies would be concentrated on board a fleet of merchant ships gathered in Chesapeake Bay, and augmented with food and goods purchased from the United States. During April and May 1794, the merchantmen would convoy the supplies across the Atlantic to Brest, protected by elements of the French Atlantic Fleet.|$|E

25|$|When the Greek {{inscription}} {{was published}} in the third volume of the Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum in 1853, the cippi were described as discovered in the coastal village of Marsaxlokk.

25|$|In contrast, {{domestic}} and social agreements {{such as those}} between children and parents are typically unenforceable {{on the basis of}} public policy. For example, in the English case Balfour v. Balfour a husband agreed to give his wife £30 a month while he was away from home, but the court refused to enforce the agreement when the husband stopped paying. In contrast, in Merritt v Merritt the court enforced an agreement between an estranged couple because the circumstances suggested their agreement <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> domestic arrangement.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} era {{was marked}} by instability, as over 1.5 million propertyless Greek refugees from Turkey had to be integrated into Greek society. Cappadocian Greeks, Pontian Greeks, and non-Greek followers of Greek Orthodoxy were all subject to the exchange as well. Some of the refugees could not speak the language, and were from what had been unfamiliar environments to mainland Greeks, {{such as in the}} case of the Cappadocians and non-Greeks. The refugees also made a dramatic post-war population boost, as the number of refugees <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> quarter of Greece's prior population.|$|E
