5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{children}} raised under the Kibbutz system of equality are given by Yosef Criden. When an aunt {{from a nearby}} city comes to visit her niece or nephew and brings a box of chocolate as a present for them, the child will excitedly open it up and eat {{a few of the}} chocolates. Then the child will go over {{to the rest of the}} group and give the rest of the chocolates to their peers. This is the ideology instilled in the children, to value the self but also to always think about others. Another example Yosef gives is that when his son, who was born and raised on a kibbutz, went into the army, he and his fellow bunk mates asked their supervising officer for a box. They wanted to keep the box in the middle of the room and whenever they would get care packages, they would put the items into the box and share them communally. They did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> most of the units of officers from towns and cities, where each officer would hide their packages under their beds.|$|E

MacKaye later {{explained in the}} hardcore documentary Another State of Mind: [...] "When I became a punk, my main fight was against {{the people who were}} around me — friends". When MacKaye was 13, he moved to Palo Alto, California for nine months. On his return, his friends had begun taking drugs and drinking. He remarked, [...] "I said, 'God, I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> these people, man. I don't fit in at all with them.' So it was an alternative".|$|E

500|$|In January 2009 {{plans were}} {{released}} for Smith to perform with Plácido Domingo, an idea originally suggested by him. In {{an interview with}} the Metro, Smith talked about her future plans, insisting that she did not wish to be dubbed as the next Charlotte Church. She later said that [...] "In the papers, it sounded like I was snobby when I said 'I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Charlotte Church', but I didn't mean it like that." [...] She has also spoken of her desire to appear in films on top of her musical career. She said [...] "Films and movies are something I'd really like to do. I've always wanted to act so doing a film would be amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|Artificial intelligence, {{a unifying}} theme {{throughout}} Scott's {{career as a}} director, is particularly evident in Prometheus, primarily through the android David. David is like humans but does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> them, eschewing a common theme in [...] "robotic storytelling" [...] such as Blade Runner. David is created {{in the image of}} humanity, and while the human crew of the Prometheus ship searches for their creators expecting answers, David exists among his human creators yet is underwhelmed; he questions his creators about why they are seeking their own. Lindelof described the ship as a prison for David. At the conclusion of the film, David's creator (Weyland) is dead and his fundamental programming will end without someone to serve. Lindelof explained that David's programming becomes unclear and that he could be programmed by Shaw or his own sense of curiosity. Following Weyland's death, David is left with Shaw, and is sincere and interested in following her, partly out of survival and partly out of curiosity.|$|E
500|$|Jamie Waylett of The Advocate {{was more}} critical, saying [...] "Madonna {{delivers}} the worst performance {{in recent memory}} as the heroine of an attempt at screwball comedy. Watching her try to look like Marilyn Monroe and sound like Betty Boop, though, is {{a sure sign that}} this film was a disaster in the making. At the same time, it seems inconceivable that anyone would sit down and plan something so dreadful." [...] Carole Kass of the Richmond Times-Dispatch felt that since [...] "Madonna is the idol of teen-agers. If they imitate her hair and her makeup, these 'wanna-bes' who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Madonna and dress like Madonna may be cute. But, as a popular personality, Madonna has a responsibility to her fans. And shoplifting is something not to promote. Nor is smoking." [...] Dan Dinicola of The Schenectady Gazette felt that [...] "Who's That Girl is not simply an awful film, it is positively unbearable. It's a movie without a head or a brain, a picture of such crass stupidity that it can't even make you angry. Instead it numbs you to death with its moronic platitudes, its pretensions to comedy. [...] It's a vanity project which is so amateurly produced and conceived that it makes you want to cringe in shame. [...] Madonna {{is no more than a}} novelty item." [...] Johanna Steinmetz of the Chicago Tribune complimented Dunne's acting and said: [...] "Fortunately the film has Griffin Dunne. Dunne, working in a domain once ruled by Cary Grant, manages to be stuffy, naive and vulnerable but never undignified as Loudon Trott, the New York lawyer." [...] Jean Rosenbluth of Rolling Stone was harsh about the film, saying [...] "The question posed by the film's title was Who's that girl? The answer provided by the box-office receipts was, alas, 'The same one who appeared in Shanghai Surprise and bored us to death'." ...|$|E

The move was read of splitting the political and religious authority of the Tibetan leadership-in-exile. He called the rule of spiritual leaders [...] "outdated" [...] and added: [...] "I do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Mubarak." [...] An election took place on 20 March 2011 and the new prime minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile is Lobsang Sangay.|$|E

2500|$|Berryman {{would soon}} publish {{some of this}} early verse in his first book, also with New Directions Publishing, simply titled Poems, in 1942. However, his first mature {{collection}} of poems, The Dispossessed, appeared six years later, published by William Sloane Associates. The book received largely negative reviews from poets like Randall Jarrell who wrote, in The Nation, that Berryman was [...] "a complicated, nervous, and intelligent [...] " [...] whose poetry in The Dispossessed was too derivative of W. B. Yeats. Berryman would later concur with this assessment of his early work, stating, [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Yeats; I wanted to be Yeats." ...|$|E

Pew observed [...] " [...] stinks, quite honestly ... The engineer slept through the entire session for a start". In Melbourne, in December 1980 and January 1981, they joined engineer and producer, Tony Cohen, in Armstrong's Audio Visual Studios (A.A.V. Studio 2) and Richmond Recorders, to record their tracks. Music journalist, Toby Creswell, noted that the band [...] "struggled with creating their own identity some of them also began indulging an appetite for alcohol and heroin". Cave was embarrassed by [...] "Zoo Music Girl" [...] but noted [...] "we were digging for something and we kind of just found it with some songs" [...] and cited [...] "King Ink" [...] as an example of [...] "a certain kind of sound that we wanted to work with on records after that".|$|E

2500|$|Jefferson {{did what}} few {{had ever done}} before him – he became a {{successful}} solo guitarist and male vocalist in the commercial recording world. Unlike many artists who were [...] "discovered" [...] and recorded in their normal venues, Jefferson was taken to Chicago, Illinois, in December 1925 or January 1926 to record his first tracks. Uncharacteristically, his first two recordings from this session were gospel songs ("I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Like</b> Jesus in My Heart" [...] and [...] "All I Want Is That Pure Religion"), released under the name Deacon L. J. Bates. A second recording session was held in March 1926. His first releases under his own name, [...] "Booster Blues" [...] and [...] "Dry Southern Blues", were hits. Their popularity led {{to the release of}} the other two songs from that session, [...] "Got the Blues" [...] and [...] "Long Lonesome Blues", which became a runaway success, with sales in six figures. He recorded about 100 tracks between 1926 and 1929; 43 records were issued, all but one for Paramount Records. Paramount's studio techniques and quality were poor, and the recordings were released with poor sound quality. In May 1926, Paramount re-recorded Jefferson performing his hits [...] "Got the Blues" [...] and [...] "Long Lonesome Blues" [...] in the superior facilities at Marsh Laboratories, and subsequent releases used those versions. Both versions appear on compilation albums.|$|E
