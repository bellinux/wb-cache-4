40|$|The four {{components}} of the long-term annual mean net surface heating of the tropical Pacific Ocean between 30 °N and 40 °S are calculated and portrayed. These flux elements were derived by using the bulk formulas and about 5 million <b>marine</b> <b>weather</b> <b>reports</b> for the years 1957 – 76. In addition to illustrating the mean solar, latent heat, infrared radiation and sensible heat fluxes, annual mean values of the atmospheric variables which contribute to those fluxes also are illustrated. A simple error analysis is carried out from which it is concluded that the 95 % confidence bands for solar heating, latent heat loss and net oceanic heating are ± 29, ± 39 and ± 49 W m⁻², from the respective mean values. The validity of {{the results for the}} net heating is partially tested by comparing the horizontal heat transports required by the pattern of heating with independent estimates of those dynamical transports...|$|R

40|$|A new {{estimate}} of the heat budget for the North Pacific Ocean is presented in this paper. The seasonal net heat flux and heat storage rates were calculated for the North Pacific Ocean from 1950 to 1990 on a spatial resolution of 58 3 58. Temperature profiles from the National Ocean Data Center were {{used to calculate the}} heat storage rates. Satellite remotely sensed solar irradiance and ship <b>marine</b> <b>weather</b> <b>reports</b> from the Com-prehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Data Set were used to calculate the net surface heat flux. Heat storage rates were calculated as the time rate of change of the heat content integrated from the surface down to the isotherm that was 18 C less than the coldest locally observed wintertime sea surface temperature, which was defined as the locally observed wintertime ventilation isotherm. The monthly climatology of the 58 3 58 resolution net heat flux was balanced by the heat storage rate for most regions of the North Pacific. To achieve this balance the net heat flux was calculated using the Liu et al. formulations for latent and sensible heat exchange and {{a modified version of the}} Reed cloud correction for solar insolation. The root-mean-square error in the difference between the net heat flux and heat storage rate climatologies was calculated at 40 W m 22. When the individual temperature profiles from the northeastern portion of the basin were normalized to the local 300 -m mean temperature, thereby removing some of the potential local changes caused by barotropic variability of water motion, the root-mean...|$|R

40|$|Although the pre-glacial Proterozoic isotopic {{record is}} poorly constrained, it is {{apparent}} that the chemical and isotopic composition of the oceans began to change during the early to mid-Neoproterozoic and experienced considerable fluctuations alongside climatic instability during much of the subsequent Cryogenian and Ediacaran periods. The earliest known large negative δ 13 C excursion appears to post-date 811 Ma and fluctuations became progressively more extreme, culminating in the late-Ediacaran 'Shuram–Wonoka' anomaly. The negative excursions are commonly associated with pre-glacial and post-glacial times, while extremely high δ 13 C values are characteristic of strata between glaciations. The precise causal mechanism for these excursions is subject to debate. Seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr rose during the Neoproterozoic, with abrupt increases following deglaciation consistent with enhanced <b>weathering</b> rates. <b>Reported</b> <b>marine</b> sulphate and pyrite δ 34 S data exhibit marked variation through this interval, although the changes are not always consistent within or between sedimentary successions of equivalent age. Iron-speciation studies indicate that much of this variation was caused by fluctuating and low sulphate concentrations in seawater, which at times led to the build-up of ferruginous conditions in the ocean. The application of chemostratigraphy to understanding and correlating the Neoproterozoic glaciations evokes considerable controversy, and many questions persist regarding the reliability and calibration of the δ 13 C, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and δ 34 S record. Nevertheless, the individual glaciations appear to be characterized by distinct combined chemostratigraphic signatures, in large part due to the generally increasing strontium isotope composition of seawater through the Neoproterozoic Era...|$|R
