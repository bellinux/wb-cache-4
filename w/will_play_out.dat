For final determination, a test needs to be made with real fissile material. Consequently, starting in 1957, a year after Swan, both labs began one-point safety tests.|$|E
25|$|Political {{and popular}} debate {{concerning}} {{the existence and}} cause of climate change includes {{the reasons for the}} increase seen in the instrumental temperature record, whether the warming trend exceeds normal climatic variations, and whether human activities have contributed significantly to it. Scientists have resolved these questions decisively in favour of the view that the current warming trend exists and is ongoing, that human activity is the cause, and that it is without precedent in at least 2000 years. Public disputes that also reflect scientific debate include estimates of how responsive the climate system might be to any given level of greenhouse gases (climate sensitivity), how global climate change <b>will</b> <b>play</b> <b>out</b> at local and regional scales, and what the consequences of global warming will be.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{not sure}} how that <b>will</b> <b>play</b> <b>out.</b> The geneticists, if you read their papers, have long been using code words. They sort of dropped the term [...] "race" [...] about 1980 or earlier, and instead you see code words like [...] "population" [...] or [...] "population structure." [...] Now that they're able to define race in genetic terms they tend to use other words, like [...] "continental groups" [...] or [...] "continent of origin," [...] which does, indeed, {{correspond}} to the everyday conception of race. When I'm writing I prefer {{to use the word}} race because that's the word that everyone understands. It's a word with baggage, but it's not necessarily a malign word.|$|E

500|$|Riley, meanwhile, learns of Dr. Walsh's {{death and}} his comrades Forrest (Leonard Roberts) and Graham (Bailey Chase) suspect Buffy {{to be her}} murderer. Extremely {{agitated}} and showing signs of drug withdrawal, he follows Buffy and demands {{to know the truth}} in [...] "Goodbye Iowa". None of them are aware of Adam until he re-emerges in the underground laboratories of the Initiative, killing Dr. Walsh's assistant and another soldier. He tells Riley that he knows Dr. Walsh created them both, that she gave Riley chemicals to strengthen him, which makes them brothers. When Riley refuses to acknowledge their bond, Adam skewers Riley, and knocks Buffy across the room while Forrest and Graham are trying to enter the locked door. Adam leaves and the Initiative are tasked with hunting him down and killing him. When one of Sunnydale's residents, Jonathan Levinson (Danny Strong), casts a spell making him the center of everyone's attention in [...] "Superstar", Adam is the only character in town who realizes it is an illusion. He explains his insight by saying he is [...] "aware". His uniqueness has set him apart. Adam is interested in how the illusion <b>will</b> <b>play</b> <b>out,</b> however, and watches it unfold. During the illusion, Jonathan—temporarily a part of the Inititative—discovers Adam's only weakness: a uranium power core source which, effectively, will never allow him to die.|$|E
500|$|Furlan {{is said to}} {{have asked}} for her {{character}} to be written out of the series because {{she did not want to}} travel to Hawaii to film her scenes, although she later called this an untrue rumor. [...] The producers decided for Rousseau to be shot, with the possibility of her returning in season five. [...] Co-show runners and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Cuse originally intended for Rousseau to get her own flashback episode in season four, however as a result of the Writer's Strike, this did not come to pass. When asked whether Rousseau would have a flashback in season five, Lindelof said that Rousseau's story would [...] "definitively" [...] be revealed, but that [...] "to use the word flashback would be disingenuous". Cuse revealed that they were trying to steer away from the word flashback and were [...] "embracing a whole new word". He explained that [...] "there will still [...] be flashbacks and flash-forwards on the show, but we're going to do something different this year. We're going to mix it up." [...] Instead of using flashbacks and flashforwards like in previous seasons, stories of the fifth season <b>will</b> <b>play</b> <b>out</b> both on and off the island stories in different points in time. The writers were supposedly scheduling an appearance by Furlan for the fifth season, but Furlan did not end up making an appearance. [...] However, she returns in the form of Rousseau's [...] "sideways" [...] counterpart (who never crashed on the Island, lost Alex or went insane) in the sixth season.|$|E
2500|$|Counter claimants further {{argue that}} the [...] "Ain Breirah" [...] {{explanation}} is inapplicable since in this instance one of two scenarios <b>will</b> <b>play</b> <b>out</b> for certain; either the animal will be deemed as glatt kosher or not. [...] Being that most animals (70-90%) are indeed found to be Glatt Kosher the acquisition of the animal is likely (more than 50%). [...] Thus, to state [...] "Breirah" [...] is more fitting for this scenario. [...] Henceforth, the animal becomes retroactively Jew-owned {{at the time of}} slaughter.|$|E

50|$|A third {{technique}} to capture stones is the snapback. In a snapback, a player sacrifices a stone {{in order to}} immediately capture several opposing stones, in effect snapping back those stones. An example {{can be seen on}} the right. As with the ladder, an experienced player <b>will</b> not <b>play</b> <b>out</b> such a sequence, recognizing the futility of capturing only to be captured back immediately.|$|R
2500|$|The Husky moniker {{has been}} adopted for the 2005-06 season by the town's local Juvenile Minor Hockey Team in the WOAA. As of right now, there is no known effort to return the Huskies back {{to a higher level}} of hockey. It is {{doubtful}} that this is the last the town of Durham will see of the Husky franchise, but the team seems to be dead in the water for the time being. As of 2006-07, the OPJHL's Oshawa Legionnaires became the Durham Fury, which <b>will</b> <b>play</b> <b>out</b> of the Campus Ice Center in Oshawa, Ontario. Although it was unlikely that the Huskies would have ever re-entered the OPJHL, as their recent efforts were to join the Western Junior [...] "C" [...] League, the creation of the Fury would definitely be a rumour-killer for an OPJHL comeback.|$|E
