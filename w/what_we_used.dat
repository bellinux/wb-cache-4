5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The Fuck Is Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.|$|E
500|$|When {{those plans}} fell through, McLaren, Rhodes {{and the band}} began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties. As {{described}} by Matlock, [...] "Everyone had long hair then, even the milkman, so <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> to do was if someone had short hair we would stop them {{in the street and}} ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer." [...] Among those they approached was Midge Ure, who was involved with his own band, Slik. Kevin Rowland—who would co-found Dexys Midnight Runners three years later—auditioned, but apart from Matlock, no one was impressed. With the search going nowhere, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who turned down the invitation.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after {{finishing}} off their Alive 2006/2007 tour, Daft Punk {{began working on}} new material in 2008. Thomas Bangalter of the duo recalled, [...] "the two of us would go in {{with a lot of}} keyboards, guitars, drums, and stuff and started to do demos for six, seven months." [...] Daft Punk were pleased with the work in terms of composition, but were dissatisfied with the production aspect, as they relied on samples and loops of their own performances: [...] "We could play some riffs and stuff but not keep it [...] for four minutes straight." [...] Daft Punk put these demos aside and started work on the [...] film soundtrack later in 2008. As Bangalter mentioned after the film's release in 2010: [...] "Making music for a movie is very humbling. We’ve been working on some of our music concurrently." [...] Daft Punk then decided to work extensively with live musicians on what would become Random Access Memories: [...] "We wanted to do <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> to do with machines and samplers, but with people." [...] They avoided the use of samples on the album, {{with the exception of the}} closing track [...] "Contact".|$|E
500|$|Blackhill Enterprises {{provided}} a [...] high stage, with the speakers being {{housed in a}} thirty-foot-high tower so that people {{at the far end}} of the park would be able to hear the music. The stage was flanked by palm trees in pots and behind the performers there was a blowup of the cover of the Beggars Banquet album. Richards had started experimenting with open tunings by this point in the band's career, particularly after hearing Ry Cooder, and the Hyde Park gig was the first chance audiences got to hear them. He played a Gibson ES-330 tuned to open E tuning with a capo on the fourth fret, and a Gibson Flying V. Taylor, meanwhile, played a Gibson Les Paul for the opening number, followed by an SG for the majority of the set. The PA system was supplied by Watkins Electric Music, who already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows. Company founder Charlie Watkins recalls it was the largest PA he had assembled to that point and, unable to provide enough gear himself, he was forced to borrow extras from other groups, later saying, [...] "I didn't have many columns, but I wanted to put 1500W up. I borrowed some from T-Rex. They all chipped in — that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> to do." ...|$|E
500|$|In Britain, the {{reception}} was highly favourable. In their joint review for Record Mirror, Richard Green and Peter Jones found the album [...] "full of musical ingenuity" [...] yet [...] "controversial", and added: [...] "There are parts that will split the pop fraternity neatly down the middle." [...] Allen Evans of the NME highlighted the album's [...] "electronic effects", McCartney's [...] "penchant for the classics" [...] and Harrison's [...] "stunning {{use of the}} sitar" [...] as diverse elements that distinguished it as a group effort, such that the four band members' [...] "individual personalities are now showing through loud and clear". Evans concluded: [...] "this is a brilliant album which underlines {{once and for all}} that the Beatles have definitely broken the bounds of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> to call pop." [...] Having found Rubber Soul [...] "almost monotonous" [...] at times, Melody Maker lauded the new release as a work that would [...] "change the direction of pop music". Peter Clayton, a jazz critic for Gramophone magazine, described it as [...] "an astonishing collection" [...] that defied easy categorisation since much of the album had no precedent in the context of pop music. Clayton concluded: [...] "if there's anything wrong with the record at all it is that such a diet of newness might give the ordinary pop-picker indigestion." ...|$|E

500|$|Director Tom Shadyac {{felt the}} film {{reflected}} environmental themes of how humans are stewards of God's creation. In {{keeping with the}} themes, Evan Almighty became NBC Universal's first film to offset the production's carbon emissions. Producer Michael Bostick revealed how the emissions were offset: [...] "We worked closely with The Conservation Fund to calculate our carbon emissions from <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> on the movie—whether from vehicles used {{or any of the}} construction equipment. Once our carbon emissions were calculated, we planted trees that will effectively zero out our climate-changing footprint left behind from the movie." [...] Shadyac accomplished this by requiring crew members to plant 2,050 trees at the Rappahannock River Valley National Wildlife Refuge in Warsaw, Virginia and the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge near Modesto, California. He also bought over 400 bikes for all the cast and crew, to get to work instead of driving. In addition, rather than simply demolishing sets, Shadyac tried to donate houses built for the production and had the Ark set recycled, by donating materials to Habitat for Humanity. During the premiere of the film for cast and crew at Universal Citywalk, the attendees were encouraged to donate to a campaign to plant trees in forests around the world. The after party used recycled cups and plates to offset the use of resources. Shadyac also required that when Industrial Light & Magic developed the climactic scene, that the CGI flood did not appear to harm any of the trees in the scene.|$|E

2500|$|On October 6, 1990, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] was {{recorded}} in a studio in New York accompanied by a live orchestra because the songwriters preferred to have all performers and musicians record together opposed to separating the singers from the instrumentalists. On {{the day of her}} scheduled recording session, Lansbury's flight was delayed due to a bomb threat, which prompted an emergency landing in Las Vegas. Unaware of her whereabouts for several hours, the filmmakers had begun making plans to reschedule the session until Lansbury finally telephoned the studio once she arrived safely in New York. At the behest of one of the directors, Lansbury recorded a demo of the song for them to use in the event that no other actress was available to sing it on her behalf, or no character other than Mrs. Potts was deemed suitable. Ultimately, Lansbury recorded her version in one take, which wound up being used in the final film. Producer Don Hahn recalled that the actress simply [...] "sang 'Beauty and the Beast' from beginning to end and just nailed it. We picked up a couple of lines here and there, but essentially that one take is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> for the movie." [...] Lansbury's performance moved everyone who was present in the recording studio at the time to tears. Meanwhile, the actress credits recording the song with ultimately helping her gain further perspective on Mrs. Potts' role in the film.|$|E
