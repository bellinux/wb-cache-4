5|$|In the 1990s, Burney, who was {{studying}} recent extinctions in Madagascar, collected tales about a creature called the kilopilopitsofy {{that had been}} described by villagers {{in the town of}} Belo-sur-mer, a small fishing village on the west coast. Several villagers independently described an animal that, as recently as 1976, had entered their village, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cow, was dark pigmented, grunted a lot, and when threatened, fled underwater. No known animal on Madagascar fits the description but the animal seemed remarkably like a hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|Hambleton {{assigned}} {{himself as}} navigator on the older EB-66C, which was configured to gather signals intelligence. The newer EB-66E was tasked with jamming surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar guidance systems so their missiles could not accurately target the aircraft. The EB-66's {{mission was to}} troll for missiles, let them lock on to their aircraft, and then execute a SAM break, a violent turn and dive designed to throw off the pursuing missile. The SA-2 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> telephone pole and carried a proximity fused warhead that was lethal within about , but their guidance systems failed at about 2 Gs, while the EB-66 could achieve 5 Gs in its avoidance maneuver. The crew had successfully pulled a SAM break more than 100 times. The presence of North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles south of the DMZ had been tracked by Hambleton, but not everyone agreed they were present that far south.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the Varaha legend {{are found in the}} Taittiriya Aranyaka and the Shatapatha Brahmana. They narrate that the universe was filled with the primordial waters. The earth <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hand and was trapped in it. The god Prajapati (the creator-god Brahma) {{in the form of a}} boar (varaha) plunges into the waters and brings the earth out. He also marries the earth thereafter. The Shatapatha Brahmana calls the boar as Emusha. The epic Ramayana and the Vishnu Purana - considered sometimes as the oldest of the Puranic scriptures - are the first to associate Varaha with Vishnu. Various Puranic scriptures including the Agni Purana, the Bhagavata Purana, the Devi Bhagavata Purana, the Padma Purana, the Varaha Purana, the Vayu Purana and the Vishnu Purana narrate the legend of Varaha with some variations.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{primitive}} rhinoceroses, {{the front}} teeth of Paraceratherium {{were reduced to}} {{a single pair of}} incisors in either jaw, which were large and conical, and have been described as tusks. The upper incisors pointed downwards; the lower ones were shorter and pointed forwards. Among known rhinoceroses, this arrangement is unique to Paraceratherium and the related Urtinotherium. The incisors may have been larger in males. The canine teeth otherwise found behind the incisors were lost. The incisors were separated from the row of cheek teeth by a large diastema (gap). This feature is found in mammals where the incisors and cheek teeth have different specialisations. The upper molars, except for the third upper molar that was V-shaped, had a pi-shaped (π) pattern and a reduced metastyle. The premolars only partially formed the pi pattern. Each molar <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human fist; among mammals they were only exceeded in size by proboscideans, though they were small relative {{to the size of the}} skull. The lower cheek teeth were L-shaped, which is typical of rhinoceroses.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known camel, called Protylopus, {{lived in}} North America 40 to 50 {{million years ago}} (during the Eocene).

By 35 million years ago, the Poebrotherium <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> goat and had many more traits similar to camels and llamas. The hoofed Stenomylus, which walked on the tips of its toes, also existed around this time, and the long-necked Aepycamelus evolved in the Miocene.|$|E
25|$|Redwall {{appeared}} {{to take place}} in the real world. Cluny was referred to as a Portuguese water rat at one point.

Also there was a mention of cows that trampled through a village. However, Brian Jacques did not expect the book to be published, and excluded references to humans and many larger animals in later books.|$|E

25|$|Oviraptorosaurs ("egg thief lizards") are a {{group of}} {{feathered}} maniraptoran dinosaurs from the Cretaceous Period of what are now Asia and North America. They are distinct for their characteristically short, beaked, parrot-like skulls, with or without bony crests atop the head. They ranged in size from Caudipteryx, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> turkey, to the 8 metre long, 1.4 ton Gigantoraptor. The group (along with all maniraptoran dinosaurs) {{is close to the}} ancestry of birds. Analyses like those of Maryanska et al (2002) and Osmólska et al. (2004) suggest that they may represent primitive flightless birds. The most complete oviraptorosaur specimens have been found in Asia. The North American oviraptorosaur record is sparse.|$|E
25|$|Elasmotherium ("Thin Plate Beast"), {{also known}} as the Giant Rhinoceros of Siberia, is an extinct genus of {{rhinoceros}} endemic to Eurasia during the Late Pliocene through the Pleistocene, documented from 2.6 Ma to as late as 29,000years ago in the Late Pleistocene. Three species are recognised. The best known, E. sibiricum, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mammoth and is thought to have borne a large, thick horn on its forehead. Theories about the function of this horn include defence, attracting mates, driving away competitors, sweeping snow from the grass in winter and digging for water and plant roots. Like all rhinoceroses, elasmotheres were herbivorous. Unlike any others, its high-crowned molars were ever-growing. Its legs were longer than those of other rhinos and were adapted for galloping, giving it a horse-like gait.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 Apple {{began to}} {{organize}} the Apple Lisa project, aiming to build a next-generation machine similar to an advanced Apple III or the yet-to-be-introduced IBM PC. In 1979, Steve Jobs learned of the advanced work on graphical user interfaces (GUI) taking place at Xerox PARC. He arranged for Apple engineers {{to be allowed to}} visit PARC to see the systems in action. The Apple Lisa project was immediately redirected to utilize a GUI, which at that time was well beyond {{the state of the art}} for microprocessor capabilities; the Xerox Alto required a custom processor that spanned several circuit boards in a case which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small refrigerator. Things had changed dramatically with the introduction of the 32-bit Motorola 68000 in 1979, which offered at least an order of magnitude better performance than existing designs, and made a software GUI machine a practical possibility. The basic layout of the Lisa was largely complete by 1982, at which point Jobs' continual suggestions for improvements led to him being kicked off the project.|$|E

500|$|In 1944, it was {{determined}} that the Grumman XTB2F, then under development for the Navy, would be too large to practically and safely operate from aircraft carriers.

As a result, in late June 1944, Grumman submitted its G-66 design to the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer). After a review of the design by BuAer during the following month, a revised design was submitted, and on August 17 the existing contract for the XTB2F was modified to instead order two XTSF-1 aircraft, to be based on Grumman's F7F-2 Tigercat two-seat, twin-engined fighter-bomber, the first prototype intended to be a conversion of a F7F airframe.|$|E

500|$|The {{introduction}} of the Specialty Sandwich [...] line {{was one of the}} first attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing to spend more on a higher quality product. Included in the new line was the Original Chicken Sandwich, a ham and cheese sandwich, a roast beef sandwich, a new fish sandwich called the Long Fish Sandwich, and a new burger called the Sirloin Steak Sandwich. The ham and cheese sandwich replaced an earlier version ham and cheese sandwich called the Yumbo that was served hot and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hamburger. In 1981 the chain tested a veal parmigiana sandwich in limited areas of the United States and took it national in 1982.

500|$|Leech {{continued}} her {{involvement with the}} Olympic movement through volunteer work. In July 1999, Leech and Australia's then-oldest man and World War I veteran Jack Lockett were the guests of honour at a countdown celebration {{to the arrival of}} the Olympic Torch in Bendigo in July 2000. In 2001, she was diagnosed with a tumour in her neck, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 50c coin.

This experience prompted her to become a volunteer for the Cancer Council and help those who were diagnosed with the disease. In February 2003, Leech phoned quadruple Olympic champion Betty Cuthbert to comfort her during her recovery from a brain hemorrhage. In October 2006, Leech combined with 1956 teammate John Devitt to launch [...] "50 Years On—The Melbourne Olympics", a series of stamps from the Australia Post.|$|E
