30|$|The null {{hypotheses}} {{for each}} test were as follows: ‘the compatibility hypothesis of headway distribution with fitted model <b>was</b> <b>rejected</b> (P-value < α) or not rejected (P-value > α)’. The ‘p-value’ {{is defined as}} the probability of obtaining a result equal to or “more extreme” than what was actually observed, when the null hypothesis is true [13, 34]. A critical value is the point on the scale of the test statistic beyond which the null hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>rejected,</b> and <b>is</b> derived from the level of significance (α) of the test. If the test statistic exceeds the critical value for the predefined significance level then the null hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>rejected.</b> The null hypothesis cannot <b>be</b> <b>rejected</b> when the hypothesized distribution passes the K-S test [31]. However, if the hypothesized distribution <b>is</b> <b>rejected</b> by the K-S test, it signifies that the distribution is not good enough to model the empirical distribution.|$|R
