[...] "It was a possibility in the beginning so <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> dynamics tests using the logs as rigid bodies to hit cars with soft body deformers on them, but {{when they were done}} shooting they didn’t end up needing any CG cars," [...] Crosby avowed. Lifecasts of the actors were also used for all of the death scenes, including the highway setting. Landes experienced claustrophobia during the procedure. Fake blood was also used, but CG blood was also shown.|$|E

In an interview with MTV News, Rihanna spoke about the development of the shoot for the video, saying [...] "The water was so cold... but oh my gosh, we had so much fun... We were bumping each other off the Jet Skis and just had a ball". During the interview, the singer elaborated further upon the content of the video and the meaning behind it, saying [...] "This video is about having fun, giving off the vibe of the Caribbean... <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> mermaid-looking stuff down on the sand...and I'm just [...] to the camera as if it were my boyfriend.

According to Lombardo, they also recorded some songs for a potential future release: [...] "We recorded some of my songs in 2006 at The Blasting Room.

I'd like to think of these as songs that if the Descendents had stayed together, this is what we would have sounded like. Those are in Bill's hands.

On May 3, 2010, Primus announced a new tour with Gogol Bordello, Wolfmother, and the Dead Kenny G's. The press release for the tour revealed that the band were looking to [...] "refine their chops before heading into the studio to record their first album of brand new music since 1999's Antipop." [...] Correlating with this announcement, the Primus website was updated with an animation of an elevator with its twelfth floor featuring a stylized question mark, and a sign reading [...] "Primus {{will be with you}} shortly", alluding to future plans. In 2011, Claypool elaborated on the band's decision to record an album, stating that [...] "(Lane) coming back has just breathed life back into the project. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> touring, and we decided, [...] "Let's go make a record," [...] because we were creating things on the road." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{fell into}} two pretty clearly defined parts. We learnt reading and writing, {{we made a}} certain study of grammar, the method of language, perhaps we learnt the {{beginnings}} of some other language than our own; we learnt some arithmetic and perhaps a little geometry and algebra; <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> drawing. All these things were ways of expression, means of expressing ourselves, means of comprehending our thoughts in terms of other people's minds, and of understanding the expressions of others. That was the basis and substance of our schooling; a training in mental elucidation and in communication with other minds. But also as our schooling went on there was something more; we learnt a little history, some geography, the beginnings of science. This second part of education {{was not so much}} expression as wisdom. We learnt what was generally known of the world about us and of its past. We entered into the common knowledge and common ideas of the world.|$|E

Our Society met to-day at the Duke of Beaufort's: a prodigious fine dinner, which I hate; but <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> business. Our printer was to attend us, as usual; and the Chancellor of the Exchequer sent {{the author of the}} Examiner(20) twenty guineas. He is an ingenious fellow, but the most confounded vain coxcomb in the world, so that I dare not let him see me, nor am acquainted with him. I had much discourse with the Duke of Ormond this morning, and am driving some points to secure us all in case of accidents, etc.(21) I left the Society at seven. I can't drink now at all with any pleasure. I love white Portugal wine better than claret, champagne, or burgundy. I have a sad vulgar appetite. I remember Ppt used to maunder, when I came from a great dinner, and DD had but a bit of mutton. I cannot endure above one dish; nor ever could since I was a boy, and loved stuffing.

They halted there, {{and it was not}} long before they began crawling up from above and below, and for a bit we shot pretty brisk. The odds were too much against them, with us on the height, and they drew off. Then for an hour they were pretty quiet while they were holding council, except that <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> shooting with a party who had climbed up to that ledge opposite; then we saw both bands mount, and reckoned they were going to make a dash for us. We knew if they did it in earnest we must go down, for once among the rocks and bushes there would be no keeping them from mounting up. We made up our minds that the end was not far off, though I fancy we should have accounted for a good many of them before they rubbed us out. When your four rifles spoke from the ledge we thought it was a party who had gone back there, for we felt sure that we had driven them all away, but it wasn't more than a moment before we saw it wasn't that. There was no mistaking the yell of astonishment from the Indians, and as the horses swerved round we saw that three of them had fallen. You may guess we didn't stop to argue who it was, but set to work to do our share; but it seemed to us something like a miracle when the red-skins rode off.|$|E

We were at work there till evening, and I think <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>some</b> good. As we were coming back I saw something in a low bush, and going there found a Yankee officer and his horse both lying dead; they had been killed by a shell, I should think. Stooping over to see if he was quite dead I saw a revolver in his belt and another in the holster of his saddle, so I took them out and brought them home, thinking I might give them to some of our men, for we were then, as we have always been, very short of arms; but I have never had an opportunity of giving them away, and I am very glad now that I have not. Here they are, sir, and two packets of cartridges, for they are of the same size as those of the pistol my father gave me when he went away. You are heartily welcome to them." ...|$|E

Kruseman Aretz, {{on the occasion}} of his `afscheidscollege'. 1 Introduction Any formal language should enable formal analysis. As Kruseman Aretz already emphasised in [6], it is essential to do precise calculations, perform mathematics, with a formal language, and a well-designed language should facilitate such calculations. In this note, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> simple calculations in the formal language of relative discrete time process algebra. The process algebra ACP [3] describes the main features of imperative concurrent programming without explicit mention of time. Implicitly, time is present in the interpretation of sequential composition: in p · q the process p must be executed before q. A quantative view on the relation between process execution and progress of time is absent in ACP, however. In recent years, process algebras have been developed that pr [...] ...|$|R
