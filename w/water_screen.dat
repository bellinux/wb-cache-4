500|$|The {{video screens}} showed both live shoots and special footage {{directed}} by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video LED cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area. The gyrating wheel in which Spears opened {{the show was}} made by Branam Enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by Tait Towers. 171 white light [...] were provided by Spectra. The giant music box from which Spears emerged in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton. Confetti was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek. Pyrotechnics were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), there was a <b>water</b> <b>screen</b> {{in which it was}} poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. Cohen said, [...] "The <b>water</b> <b>screen</b> is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every system—electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, and I immediately looked at what they had in stock, which was a straight line. And I knew we didn't want a straight line. We wanted a circular <b>water</b> <b>screen</b> so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not get wet and then walk through when she wanted to. Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. But I kept saying that if you put them 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} divided into seven {{segments}} with the last one being the encore. Spears opened the show hanging from a gyrating wheel; it continued with Spears performing a medley of older hits, jumping in bungee cords from the flying device onto the stage and dancing in a jungle setting. Most of the performances were accompanied by extravagant special effects, including confetti, pyrotechnics, laser lights, and artificial fog and snow. In the encore, there was a <b>water</b> <b>screen</b> that pumped two tons of water into the stage; this {{was considered one of}} the signature performances of the tour. During the 2002 leg, some changes were made; several songs were remixed, and Spears premiered various unreleased songs which included [...] "Mystic Man". The show received mixed reviews by critics, who praised the show for being innovative but dismissed it for taking the attention away from the music.|$|E
500|$|After a brief interlude, she {{returned}} for a performance of [...] "Anticipating" [...] where she wore a patched denim skirt. The set was made of giant coloring book drawings of houses and cars. She took out the costume to reveal a green top and small brown skirt for [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] in a jungle setting while surrounded by artificial fog and laser lights. After the song ended, she bowed and thanked the audience before exiting the stage. The encore began with a giant projection of a hologram of Spears onto a <b>water</b> <b>screen.</b> The projection gradually shrunk until Spears rose from the stage while wearing a plastic cowboy hat, blue hip-huggers, and a matching bra top. She began performing [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] in a ballad version until reaching {{the end of the}} runway. Pyrotechnics surrounded the stage while the song changed to a more uptempo version with elements of techno. Her dancers took the main stage while {{she returned}} to it running through the runway. They jumped on the barge while it was lifted into the air and continued to dance. At the end, Spears jumped off the barge with the bungee cords and landed in the main stage and descended from it.|$|E
500|$|.....Baby One More Time" [...] {{has been}} {{performed}} {{in seven of}} Spears's concert tours since its release. On ...Baby One More Time Tour, the encore consisted of a performance of the song, in which Spears wore a black bra under pink halter, a pink sequined plaid mini-skirt, and black thigh-high stockings. On 2000s Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] was performed after a dance interlude in which the dancers showed their individual moves while their names appeared on the screens. Spears took the stage in a conservative schoolgirl outfit to perform the song. She ripped it off halfway through the song to reveal a cheerleader ensemble. The song was also the encore of 2001's Dream Within a Dream Tour. It began with a giant projection of a hologram of Spears onto a <b>water</b> <b>screen.</b> The projection gradually shrunk until Spears rose from the stage while wearing a plastic cowboy hat, blue hip-huggers, and a matching bra top.

5000|$|A salt film is also harmful, because salt absorbs water. However, water vapour, fog {{or light}} rain {{also makes the}} sensor almost blind, without the user knowing. The cause is similar to what a fire fighter does if he {{approaches}} a hot fire: he protects himself {{by means of a}} <b>water</b> vapour <b>screen</b> against the enormous infrared heat radiation. The presence of water vapor, fog, or light rain will then also [...] "protect" [...] the monitor causing it to not see the fire. Visible light will, however be transmitted through the <b>water</b> vapour <b>screen,</b> as can easily been seen by the fact that a human can still see the flames through the <b>water</b> vapour <b>screen.</b>|$|R
