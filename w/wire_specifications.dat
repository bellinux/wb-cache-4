50|$|In 1884, Brooks {{was hired}} by the American Bell Telephone Company to {{implement}} copper <b>wire</b> <b>specifications</b> and to test consumer-grade telephones. Two years later, Theodore Newton Vail convinced Brooks to join the Boston office of the Electrical Accumulator Company of Philadelphia. There, Brooks prepared specifications for storage battery installation. One project saw Brooks working on one of the first train car lighting experiments, on the Old Colony Railroad. In 1887, he was commissioned by the St. Paul Gas Light Company to introduce alternating current Westinghouse Electric lamps. Brooks founded the Electrical Engineering Company of St. Paul-Minneapolis as a contractor for power, light, and telephone plants. The company became the leading regional provider of these services. Brooks patented and implemented a sidetone-eliminating intercommunicating telephone system for Northfield, Minnesota, which had over one hundred subscribers.|$|E
40|$|We report failure {{analysis}} of sternal wires in two {{cases in which}} a perichronal fixation technique was used to close the sternotomy. Various characteristics of the retrieved wires were compared to those of unused wires of the same grade and same manufacturer and with surgical <b>wire</b> <b>specifications.</b> In both cases, wire fracture was un-branched and transgranular and proceeded by a high cycle fatigue process, apparently {{in the absence of}} corrosion. However, stress anlysis indicates that the effective stress produced during strong coughing is lower than the yield strength. Our findings suggest that {{in order to reduce the}} risk for sternal dehiscence, the diameter of the wire used should be increased. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the factors}} in {{assessing}} the applicability of wire or cable on the lunar surface is its flexibility under extreme cold conditions. Existing <b>wire</b> <b>specifications</b> did not address their mechanical behavior under cold, cryogenic temperature conditions. Therefore tests were performed to provide this information. To assess this characteristic 35 different insulated wire and cable pieces were cold soaked in liquid nitrogen. The segments were then subjected to bending and the force was recorded. Any failure of the insulation or jacketing was also documented for each sample tested. The bending force tests were performed at room temperature to provide a comparison to the change in force needed to bend the samples due to the low temperature conditions. The results from the bending tests were plotted and showed how various types of insulated wire and cable responded to bending under cold conditions. These results were then used to estimate the torque needed to unroll the wire under these low temperature conditions...|$|E

40|$|Managing cloud {{applications}} {{running on}} IaaS is complicated and error prone. This is why DevOps tools and application description languages have been emerging. While these tools and languages enable {{the user to}} define the application and communication structure based on application components, they lack the possibility to define sophisticated communication patterns including the wiring on instance level. This paper details these shortcomings and presents approaches to overcome them. In particular, they we propose (i) adding boundaries to <b>wiring</b> <b>specifications</b> and (ii) introducing a higher-level abstraction—called facet—on top of the application. The combination of both concepts allows specifying wiring on basis of logical units and their relations. Hence, the concepts overcome general wiring problems that currently exist in cloud orchestration tools. In addition to that, the introduction of facets improves the re-use of components across different applications...|$|R

40|$|The CFETR, "China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor," {{is a new}} tokamak device. Its magnet system {{includes}} the toroidal field (TF), central solenoid (CS), and poloidal field coils. The main goal {{of this study is}} to build a fusion engineering tokamak reactor with fusion power of 50 - 200 MW and self-sufficiency by blanket. The maximum field of CS and TF will get around 15 T, which is much higher than that of other reactors. New materials could be used to develop themagnet technology for the next generation of fusion reactors. Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 Ox is considered as a potential material for the superconducting magnets. AnR&Dactivity is running at ASIPP for the feasibility demonstration of cable-in-conduit conductor based on the Bi 2212 wire. One subsize conductor cabled with 42 wires was designed and manufactured. In this paper, the manufacturing procedures and first test results of Bi- 2212 conductor samples are described in details, including <b>wire</b> <b>specifications,</b> cabling and compaction process, conductor heat treatment, as well as test results on ac loss and critical current...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 18 - 21, 2004 / Town & Country Resort, San Diego, CaliforniaWith recent {{improvements}} in data acquisition technology, {{it is now}} possible to use an FTI data acquisition system to measure analog signals with a total error from all sources of less than 0. 05 % - over an extended temperature range - and at high sample rates. This accuracy is better than one count of an old 10 -bit system and includes non-linearities, initial errors (in gain, offset and excitation) and drift errors, simplifying the task of interpreting data acquisition system performance specifications. This paper looks at some practical steps taken to achieve this accuracy, from a hardware design and signal processing perspective. This leads to a discussion of implications for the FTI system designer, including: sensor and <b>wiring</b> <b>specifications,</b> sample rate, filtering specifications, and a discussion of implications for the data processing engineers...|$|R

40|$|Here are two {{extraordinary}} tales where {{ingenuity and}} knowledge of velvet technology served the military defense of England. Richard John Humphries of the Humphries Weaving Company is renown for his expertise on fine silk production for royal regalia and restorations. He told me how he acquired his lathe-turned, teak velvet bobbins. He had salvaged his velvetloom and velvet wire collection from {{the closure of the}} Warners mill in 1971. However, he had no velvet bobbins. One day a person from the War Department approached him with the theory that a cloth could shield the fuselages of aircraft and prevent heat-seeking missiles from locking onto them. The woven fabric would have polyester thread crossed with nickel-plated copper wire. First Richard tried warping with the polyester and inserting copper <b>wire.</b> However, the <b>specifications</b> were extremely exacting and the slight unevenness of the beat exceeded the tolerance level. In a stroke of genius, he switched, wound the wire on made-to-order bobbins, polyester for weft. Success, he wove these anti-radar shields for helicopters for years. Eugene Nicholson, former Keeper of Industrial Technology at the Bradford Industrial Museum, related that the Lister 2 ̆ 7 s Manningham Mills grew to prominence with the advent of its face-to-face velvet powerlooms. In WWII it developed a top-secret cloth crucial to Patton 2 ̆ 7 s decoy army. Listers, the King of Plush, modified its velvet technology, produced a double pile fabric that could be coated with rubber and inflated into 3 -D forms. From aerial surveillance these balloons would appear to be military trucks and tanks...|$|R
