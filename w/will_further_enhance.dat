An experiment has shown that, when two males are placed in the same fish tank, both fishes enhance their EOD in the first short period of time.

The study was a component of Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) utilization and validation programme funded by Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS). The feedback was collected during 2003 - 2005 by means of one-to-one interaction and awareness campaigns conducted in different villages and landing centers. The study confirms poor catch during bad weather conditions, turtle mass nesting, invasion of coastal area by Andhra trawlers, missile training and medical problems. These were the key factors responsible for economic condition of the fishermen. The liberalized policy of Government, especially in the banking sector, had favored fishermen to some extent. However, the socio-economic status of fisher folks can be improved if proper infrastructure such as fishing jetties, cold storage, modernized craft along with modern fishing gears are provided. Apart from these, organized marketing, finance and proper follow up of INCOIS disseminated PFZ advisories <b>will</b> <b>further</b> <b>enhanced</b> the Catch Per Unit Efforts (CPUE) ...|$|R
