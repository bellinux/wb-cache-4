5|$|The University of Houston and the University of Texas {{played their}} first {{football}} game {{against one another}} in 1953. Since this was their first meeting, members of Alpha Phi Omega—the service fraternity in charge {{of taking care of}} ShastaI, the university's mascot—brought her to the game. During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off. At the game, several Longhorn players saw what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent, suggesting the Cougars were invalids. Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH students had been using the victory sign as a hand signal up to that time, but began using the bent-finger sign as a reminder that they <b>would</b> <b>remember</b> the taunts.|$|E
5|$|The {{black and}} white {{sequences}} begin with Leonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller. Leonard has anterograde amnesia and is unable to store recent memories, {{the result of an}} attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name is John or James, with a last name starting with G. Leonard conducts his own investigation using a system of notes, Polaroids, and tattoos. From his occupation, Leonard recalls a fellow anterograde amnesiac: Sammy Jankis. Sammy's diabetic wife, who wasn't sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested insulin; she hoped that he <b>would</b> <b>remember</b> having given her an injection and stop himself from giving another before she died of an overdose. However, Sammy continues to administer the injections, and his wife falls into a fatal coma.|$|E

25|$|Though the 9-2 1966 {{season was}} one of the best in program {{football}} history up to that point (along with the 1928 Florida Gators football team), the Gators fell short of their elusive first conference title due to a 27-10 upset loss to arch-rival Georgia, a loss that Spurrier <b>would</b> <b>remember</b> when he returned as Florida's coach and made beating Georgia a priority.|$|E

25|$|In the Abhijñānaśākuntalam, {{written by}} Kalidasa, when the maiden Shakuntala ignored Durvasa's demands to be welcomed {{as a guest}} because she was daydreaming about her lover, Dushyanta, he cursed her that her lover would forget her. Horrified, Shakuntala's companions managed to mollify Durvasa, who {{softened}} the curse, saying that Dushyanta <b>would</b> <b>remember</b> Shakuntala {{when he saw the}} ring that he gave her as a token of their love. The sage's curse came true of course and was eventually lifted, just as he said it would be. By the end of the play, the two lovers are reconciled and are happy to be together again, along with their son, Bharata.|$|E
25|$|She {{was born}} Kathleen Rita McNulty in Feymore, {{part of the}} small village of Creeslough in the Gaeltacht area (Irish-speaking region) of County Donegal, Ireland, on February 12, 1921, during the Irish War of Independence. On the night of her birth, her father, James McNulty, who was an Irish Republican Army {{training}} officer, was arrested and imprisoned in Derry Gaol for two years. On his release, the family emigrated to the United States in October 1924 and settled in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where James found work as a stonemason. At the time, Kathleen was unable to speak any English, only Irish; she <b>would</b> <b>remember</b> prayers in Irish {{for the rest of}} her life.|$|E
25|$|William, the {{youngest}} of the surviving Hazlitt children, was born in Mitre Lane, Maidstone, in 1778. In 1780, when he was two, his family began a nomadic lifestyle that was to last several years. From Maidstone his father took them to Bandon, County Cork, Ireland; and from Bandon in 1783 to the United States, where the elder Hazlitt preached, lectured, and sought a ministerial call to a liberal congregation. His efforts to obtain a post did not meet with success, although he did exert a certain influence on the founding of the first Unitarian church in Boston. In 1786–87 the family returned to England and settled in Wem, in Shropshire. Hazlitt <b>would</b> <b>remember</b> little of his years in America, save the taste of barberries.|$|E

25|$|The Romans finally {{captured}} the Antonia Fortress {{and began a}} frontal assault on {{the gates of the}} Temple. Titus was apparently bent on ending Judaism as a religion. He sought to slaughter their animals, kill their men, rape their women, enslave their children, and kill their God. When he finally did breach the walls, his soldiers set upon everyone – man, woman, child, those who stayed loyal to Rome, and those who did not. The city went up in flames. The roar of the inferno mixed with screams of agony as the Romans swept through the upper and lower city, literally clambering over dead bodies in pursuit of the rebels, until they reached the Temple, set it aflame, and reduced it to dust. When the fires subsided, Titus gave the order to destroy the remainder of the city, seeking that no one <b>would</b> <b>remember</b> the name Jerusalem. The Temple was demolished, after which Titus' soldiers proclaimed him imperator in honor of the victory.|$|E
25|$|On September 13, the Athenians left camp {{leaving their}} wounded behind and their dead unburied. The survivors, {{including}} all the non-combatants, numbered 40,000, {{and some of the}} wounded crawled after them as far as they could go. As they marched they defeated a small Syracusan force guarding the river Anapus, but other Syracusan cavalry and light troops continually harassed them. Near the Erineus river, Demosthenes and Nicias became separated, and Demosthenes was attacked by the Syracusans and forced to surrender his 6,000 troops. The rest of the Syracusans followed Nicias to the Assinarus river, where Nicias's troops became disorganized in the rush to find drinking water. Many Athenians were trampled to death and others were killed while fighting with fellow Athenians. On {{the other side of the}} river a Syracusan force was waiting, and the Athenians were almost completely massacred, by far the worst defeat of the entire expedition in terms of lives lost. Nicias personally surrendered to Gylippus, hoping the Spartan <b>would</b> <b>remember</b> his role in the peace treaty of 421. The few who escaped found refuge in Catana.|$|E
25|$|The 2000–01 season {{featured}} {{a drop of}} two points for the Centennials, but an improvement in the standings to second in the Interior Division. The Cents {{wound up with a}} record of 30–21–9 and 69 points. However, it wouldn't be the regular season that fans in Merritt <b>would</b> <b>remember</b> the most about the year, rather an improbable run to the Fred Page Cup Final. The Cents faced off against Prince George in the Interior Division opening round and promptly swept the Spruce Kings in four straight. They then met up in the Interior Conference final with the Penticton Panthers, who had finished the season first in the division, 29 points ahead of the Centennials. The first place Panthers proved to be no match for Merritt, as the Cents outscored Penticton 16 to 7 in a four-game sweep. Next up, it was the franchise's first appearance in the Fred Page Cup final, and it would be against the Victoria Salsa. Despite a thrilling seven game series, the Salsa took the BCHL championship on home ice. Forward Mike Ouelette provided a bright spot individually as he won BCHL Rookie of the Year for the Interior Conference.|$|E

25|$|In the testy Game 3 of the 2003 ALCS, after {{allowing}} single {{runs in the}} 2nd, 3rd, and 4th innings, Martínez hit Yankees {{right fielder}} Karim García near the shoulders with a pitch, sparking a shouting match between Martínez and the New York bench. Directing his attention at Yankees catcher Jorge Posada, Martínez jabbed a finger {{into the side of}} his own head, which some, including an enraged Yankee bench coach Don Zimmer, interpreted as a threatened beanball. Emotions remained high {{in the bottom of the}} inning, which was led off by Boston slugger Manny Ramírez. Ramirez became irate over a high strike from Roger Clemens, and both benches cleared. During the ensuing commotion, the 72-year-old Zimmer ran towards Martínez in an attempt to knock him down; Martínez sidestepped Zimmer and threw him to the ground. Later, Martínez claimed that he was not indicating that he would hit Posada in the head, but that he <b>would</b> <b>remember</b> what Posada was saying to him. In 2009, Martínez claimed that he regretted the incident but denied being at fault. Zimmer did not give much credence to Pedro's statements. Martínez wrote in 2015 that the altercation with Zimmer was his only regret of his entire career.|$|E
25|$|Once {{a devoted}} and bright faerie, she {{questioned}} the King {{as to why}} a faerie like herself was not permitted to visit him as often and freely as Oran. The King responds by saying that she and Oran are different by birth, and faery as lowly as Seraphina can not possibly compare herself with Oran. This left Seraphina jealous and determine to best Oran, {{no matter what it}} took, and constantly strove towards what ever goal Oran was headed to. She tricks Oran into staying on Earth by ordering Goodfellow to lead Sindo to the bathing spring, then altering the barrier that was supposed to hide them from humans so that Oran's gown was exposed for stealing. Seraphina uses the opportunity to achieve her ambitions and become the Queen of Avalon. Unfortunately, she is rejected again and again by the King, who constantly reminds Seraphina that no matter how hard she works, even after she becomes a 1st class faerie, she will never compare to Oran because Seraphina simply tries too hard to be something Oran comes by naturally. When Pain and Fanta arrive in Avalon, Seraphina appears again to eliminate Pain only to find that he is powerful enough to detect her spells with ease. Oreadia eventually masterminds Seraphina's downfall by using Fanta, Pain, and Syndra; Seraphina is punished for her attempt to get rid of Oreadia and reborn as a human on earth who <b>would</b> <b>remember</b> her heavenly origins only when she turned fifteen.|$|E
