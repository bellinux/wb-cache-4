5|$|On 5 December 1914, Shackleton's {{expedition}} ship Endurance left South Georgia for the <b>Weddell</b> <b>Sea,</b> on {{the first}} stage of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. It was making for Vahsel Bay, the southernmost explored point of the <b>Weddell</b> <b>Sea</b> at 77° 49' S, where a shore party was to land and prepare for a transcontinental crossing of Antarctica. Before it could reach its destination the ship was trapped in pack ice, and by 14 February 1915 was held fast, despite prolonged efforts to free her. During the following eight months she drifted northward until, on 27 October, she was crushed by the pack's pressure, finally sinking on 21 November.|$|E
5|$|Endurance {{departed}} from South Georgia for the <b>Weddell</b> <b>Sea</b> on 5 December, heading for Vahsel Bay. As the ship moved southward navigating in ice, first year ice was encountered, which slowed progress. Deep in the <b>Weddell</b> <b>Sea,</b> conditions gradually grew worse until, on 19 January 1915, Endurance became frozen fast in an ice floe. On 24 February, realising {{that she would}} be trapped until the following spring, Shackleton ordered the abandonment of ship's routine and her conversion to a winter station. She drifted slowly northward with the ice through the following months. When spring arrived in September, the breaking of the ice and its later movements put extreme pressures on the ship's hull.|$|E
50|$|The Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) is a boldly marked {{dark brown}} and white petrel, found in Antarctica, most {{commonly}} in the Ross and <b>Weddell</b> <b>seas.</b> They eat Antarctic krill, fish, and small squid.

5|$|Several of the {{original}} crew left during the Buenos Aires interlude, some through illness and one discharged for misconduct, and replacements were recruited locally. Scotia left for Laurie Island on 21 January, arriving on 14 February.

5|$|Shackleton {{had given}} Mackintosh the {{impression}} that he would if possible attempt his crossing during the coming 1914–15 Antarctic season. Before departing for the <b>Weddell</b> <b>Sea,</b> he changed his mind about the feasibility of this timescale.

5|$|Henry McNish (11 September 187424 September 1930), often {{referred}} to as Harry McNeish or by the nickname Chippy, was the carpenter on Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917. He was responsible for much of the work that ensured the crew's survival after their ship, the Endurance, was destroyed when it became trapped in pack ice in the <b>Weddell</b> <b>Sea.</b> He modified the small boat, James Caird, that allowed Shackleton and five men (including McNish) to make a voyage of hundreds of miles to fetch help {{for the rest of the}} crew.|$|E

5|$|In October 1915 {{pack ice}} in the <b>Weddell</b> <b>Sea</b> had sunk Endurance, leaving Shackleton and his companions adrift on a {{precarious}} ice surface. Throughout the duration of their survival, the group drifted northward until April 1916, when the floe on which they had encamped broke up. They then made their way in the ship's lifeboats to Elephant Island, where Shackleton decided that {{the most effective means}} of obtaining rescue would be to sail one of the lifeboats to South Georgia.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 1904 Scotia {{reached its}} most southerly {{latitude}} of 74°01'S. At this point, {{the ship was}} held fast in the pack ice, and the prospect loomed of becoming trapped for the winter. It was {{during this period of}} inactivity that bagpiper Gilbert Kerr was photographed serenading a penguin. On 13 March the ship broke free and began to move slowly north-eastward under steam. Throughout this part of the voyage a regular programme of depth soundings, trawls, and sea-bottom samples provided a comprehensive record of the oceanography and marine life of the <b>Weddell</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{set sail}} from London on his ship Endurance, {{bound for the}} <b>Weddell</b> <b>Sea</b> in August 1914. Meanwhile, the Ross Sea party {{personnel}} gathered in Australia, prior to departure for the Ross Sea in the second expedition ship, SY Aurora. Organisational and financial problems delayed their start until December 1914, which shortened their first depot-laying season. After their arrival the inexperienced party struggled to master the art of Antarctic travel, in the process losing most of their sled dogs.|$|E
40|$|Distribution and {{composition}} of lipids and contents of alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs) in bottom sediments of the Scotia and <b>Weddell</b> <b>seas</b> are discussed. Comparatively low concentrations of organic carbon (average 0. 35 %) and lipids (average 0. 024 %) result from rapid decomposition of organic matter in upper layers of the water column. Composition of alkanes indicates that lipids are of autochthonous origin, and stable concentrations of PAHs (average 25. 8 ppb, sigma 15. 3 ppb) indicate that they represent the background level for bottom sediments. Higher concentrations of PAHs in sediments near the King George Island (252. 1 ppb) and different distributions of individual polyarenes are produced there by the heating systems of the Polish Antarctic Station...|$|R

A total of 37 Agassiz trawls were deployed at depth transects along the continental and trough slopes. A total of 5, 469 specimens, belonging to 32 higher taxonomic groups and more than 270 species, were collected. Species richness per station varied from 1 – 55.

40|$|Exceptional sea ice {{conditions}} {{occurred in}} the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region from September 2001 to February 2002, resulting from a strongly positive atmospheric pressure anomaly in the South Atlantic coupled with strong negative anomalies in the Bellingshausen–Amundsen and southwest <b>Weddell</b> <b>Seas.</b> This created a strong and persistent north-northwesterly flow of mild and moist air across the WAP. In situ, satellite, and NCEP–NCAR Reanalysis (NNR) data are {{used to examine the}} profound and complex impact on regional sea ice, oceanography, and biota. Extensive sea ice melt, leading to an ocean mixed layer freshening and widespread ice surface flooding, snow–ice formation, and phytoplankton growth, coincided with extreme ice deformation and dynamic thickening.

5|$|In 1948, {{the newly}} created Norwegian Polar Institute was {{assigned}} the administration of Norwegian territories in the Arctic and Antarctic, including Queen Maud Land. Norway sent two major expeditions to the territory in the 1940s and 1950s, but its efforts declined after that. On 21 June 1957, Queen Maud Land became subject to Norwegian sovereignty as a dependency (biland), and the Antarctic Treaty officially came into force on 23 June 1961. Norwegian activity during the 1960s was limited to some minor co-expeditions with the United States, until it gradually picked up again following a larger expedition to western Queen Maud Land and the eastern <b>Weddell</b> <b>Sea</b> by the Norwegian Polar Institute in 1976–77.|$|E
5|$|In November 1903 Scotia {{retreated to}} Buenos Aires for repair and reprovisioning. While in Argentina, Bruce {{negotiated}} {{an agreement with}} the government whereby Omond House became a permanent weather station, under Argentinian control. Renamed Orcadas Base, the site has been continuously in operation since then, and provides the longest historical meteorological series of Antarctica. In January 1904 Scotia sailed south again, to explore the <b>Weddell</b> <b>Sea.</b> On 6 March, new land was sighted, part of the sea's eastern boundary; Bruce named this Coats Land after the expedition's chief backers. On 14 March, at 74°01′S and in danger of becoming icebound, Scotia turned north. The long voyage back to Scotland, via Cape Town, was completed on 21 July 1904.|$|E

40|$|The West Antarctic {{ice sheet}} (WAIS) {{has long been}} {{considered}} vulnerable to rapid retreat and today parts are rapidly losing ice. Projection of future change in WAIS is, however, hampered by our poor understanding of past changes, especially during interglacial periods that could be analogs for the future, but which undoubtedly {{provide an opportunity for}} testing predictive models. We consider how ice-loss would open seaways across WAIS; these would likely alter Southern Ocean circulation and climate, and would broadly define the de-glacial state, but they may also have left evidence of their existence in the coastal seas they once connected. We show the most likely routes for such seaways, and that a direct seaway between <b>Weddell</b> and Ross <b>seas,</b> which did not pass through the Amundsen Sea sector, is unlikely. Continued ice-loss at present rates would open seaways between Amundsen and <b>Weddell</b> <b>seas</b> (A-W), and Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas (A-B), in around one thousand years. This timescale indicates potential future vulnerability, but also suggests seaways may have opened in recent interglacial periods. We attempt to test this hypothesis using contemporary bryozoan species assemblages around Antarctica, concluding that anomalously high similarity in assemblages in the <b>Weddell</b> and Amundsen <b>seas</b> supports recent migration through A-W. Other authors have suggested opening of seaways last occurred during Marine Isotope Stage 7 a (209 ka BP), but we conclude that opening could have occurred in MIS 5 e (100 ka BP) when Antarctica was warmer than present and likely contributed to global sea levels higher than today. ...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile {{and adult}} Euphausia superba were {{collected}} in the northwest of the Antarctic Peninsula, eastern Drake Passage, and the Scotia and <b>Weddell</b> <b>Seas</b> during the SIBEX II cruise of R.

The biomass was especially abundant along the Antarctic Peninsula, in the east of Elephant Island and west and southeast of South Sandwich Islands. E. superba wet weight represented 88 % of total wet weight from blind tows (99 %, if aimed tows were included). Copulated females and males with developed spermatophores were numerous along the Antarctic Peninsula and in the west of South Sandwich Islands.

40|$|The basin off the Bellingshausen Sea, in {{contrast}} to other better known {{areas such as the}} Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross and <b>Weddell</b> <b>Seas,</b> has been little investigated due to remoteness and the prevalence of ice for most of the year. The present study focuses on an analysis of polychaetes collected from soft bottoms of this sea and off the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula (Gerlache Strait) by means of a box-corer (25 × 25 cm) in two intensive surveys carried out during austral summers of 2002 – 2003 and 2005 – 2006 (BENTART- 03 and BENTART- 06). Three different polychaete assemblages were determined from the classification and ordination analyses of sampling stations based on the Bray-Curtis similarity index. One group of stations encompassed the deep stations from the shelf of the Bellingshausen Sea, the second one the shallower stations from the same area and the third one those stations located near the coast of Peter I Island and Gerlache Strait, off the Antarctic Peninsula. The environmental variables involved in segregating these groups were several sedimentary features (redox potential, gravel content) and depth.

At least seven of these species are new to science. Per location species richness varied from 5 to 15 species. Kelliella sirenkoi was the most common and abundant species, occurring at 17 locations (1121 - 6348 m), followed by Genaxius sp. 1 occurring at 12 locations. The epibenthic sledge hauls were characterised by low abundances, varying from 1 to 68 individuals 1000 m(- 2) in depths greater than 1000 in. In comparison with the shelf fauna of the Scotia Arc, the deep-water bivalve community showed similar species richness.

Joyce also organised journeys to recover geological samples left on the Barrier and to visit the grave of Spencer-Smith, where a large cross was erected. In {{the absence of the}} ship, the seven remaining survivors lived quietly, until on 10 January 1917, the refitted Aurora arrived with Shackleton aboard to take them home.

5|$|Shackleton {{intended}} {{to arrive in}} Antarctica in January 1908, which meant leaving England during the 1907 summer. He therefore had six months to secure the financing, acquire and fit out a ship, buy all the equipment and supplies, and recruit the personnel. In April, believing that he had got the backing of Scottish businessman Donald Steuart, Shackleton travelled to Norway intending to buy a 700-ton polar vessel, Bjorn, that would have served ideally as an expedition ship. When Steuart withdrew his support, however, Bjorn was beyond Shackleton's means. Bjorn was eventually acquired by German explorer Wilhelm Filchner and, renamed Deutschland, was used in his 1911–13 voyage to the <b>Weddell</b> <b>Sea.</b> Shackleton {{had to settle for}} the elderly, much smaller Nimrod, a 40-year-old wooden sealer of 334 gross register tons, which he was able to acquire for £5,000 (updated value £).|$|E
40|$|Arctic sea ice is {{regarded}} the “canary in the coalmine” of global warming. Scientists have been investigating {{the links between}} global temperature rise and changes in large-scale atmospheric pressure patterns, on the one hand, and the decrease in extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic observed in the last decades, on the other hand. While sea ice in the Antarctic does not reveal similar trends on a hemispherical scale, regional changes are significant. The western Antarctic Peninsula region has shown a decline in sea ice extent, particularly in the Bellingshausen Sea. In contrast, ice extent in the Ross and <b>Weddell</b> <b>Seas</b> is increasing. Considering the vast extension and remoteness of the Polar Regions, how can we acquire information {{about the state of}} the sea ice cover? Here, data acquisitions from different satellite and aircraft sensors play an important role, covering spatial scales from hemisphere to single locations. In this presentation, we will have a look at the results from recent investigations that have been based on the use of remote sensing data acquired over the Arctic and Antarctic. ...|$|R

One of the whales had been previously sighted off Ecuador, a breeding ground for the eastern South Pacific population. The other whale was subsequently resighted in Bransfield Strait, off the western Antarctic Peninsula, a well-documented feeding ground for the same population. These matches give support to a hypothesis that the area south of the South Orkney Islands is occupied by whales from the eastern South Pacific breeding stock. Consequently, we propose 40 &#x 00 B 0;W as a new longitudinal boundary between the feeding grounds associated with the eastern South Pacific and western South Atlantic breeding stocks...|$|R
40|$|Sea-ice {{variability}} in the Southern Ocean has a complex spatio–temporal structure. In a global warming context, the Antarctic sea-ice cover has slightly expanded over the recent decades. This increase in sea-ice extent results, however, from the sum {{of positive and negative}} regional trends and is influenced by a wide range of modes of climate variability. An additional view on sea-ice thickness and volume changes would improve our understanding. Still, no large-scale multi-decadal well-sampled record of Antarctic sea-ice thickness exists to date. To address this issue, we assimilate real sea-ice concentration data into the ocean–sea-ice model NEMO-LIM 2 using an ensemble Kalman filter, and demonstrate the positive impacts on the global sea-ice cover. We find that the global Antarctic sea-ice volume has risen at a significant pace over the period 1980 – 2008, with an increase in the Ross and <b>Weddell</b> <b>Seas</b> and a decrease in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas. Sea-ice volume anomalies co-vary well with extent anomalies, and exhibit yearly to decadal fluctuations.
