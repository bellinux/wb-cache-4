The PM synchronous machine was designed for an operating frequency up to 800 Hz. The main aim {{of this paper is}} to analyse the selected methods for magnet eddycurrent loss reduction.

However, due to their high switching frequency and high dv/dt, increased dielectric stresses and thermal stresses are applied to the insulation system of the motors, which {{may lead to the}} failure of the insulation. In order to test the performance of the motor insulation under the above complex stress conditions, an IGBT-based pulse voltage generator which can produce high voltage square wave and PWM waveforms has been successfully developed in this research. The generator consists of IGBT switches and other wave shaping components. The special cascade connection circuit design enables the generator to produce the stable high voltage square wave and PWM waveforms. A microcontroller-based trigger signal generator is used to trigger the power electronic switches in the generator. In order to avoid false triggering from electromagnetic interference (EMI), optical fibre cables are used to connect the trigger signal generator to the switches which are located in a high electric potential area. The generator can produce square wave and PWM waveforms with a peak voltage up to 15 kV and with a switching frequency of 600 Hz to 6 kHz. The fundamental frequency of the PWM waveform is 20 Hz to 1200 Hz, the rise time is less than 200 ns, and the pulse width can be varied up to several milliseconds.

A mechatronic data acquisition system is developed whereby signal conditioning is performed by the sensor and the signal passed to a Bluetooth transmitter module for wireless telemetry to a Bluetooth receiver located in very close proximity, connected to an external host PC.

The NASA/Army emphasis is on high-temperature applications for future gas turbine engines. Magnetic bearings could increase the reliability and reduce the weight of these engines by eliminating the lubrication system. They could also increase the DN (diameter of bearing times the rpm) limit on engine speed and allow active vibration cancellation systems to be used, resulting in a more efficient, "more electric" engine.

En route to this goal specialized test stands have been built and computer codes have been written {{to aid in the}} development of the component parts of these bearing systems. The Livermore passive magnetic bearing system involves three types of elements, as follows: (1) Axially symmetric levitation elements, energized by permanent magnets., (2) electrodynamic ''stabilizers'' employing axially symmetric arrays of permanent magnet bars (''Halbach arrays'') on the rotating system, interacting with specially <b>wound</b> electrically shorted <b>stator</b> circuits, and, (3) eddy-current-type vibration dampers, employing axially symmetric rotating pole assemblies interacting with stationary metallic discs. The theory of the Livermore passive magnetic bearing concept describes specific quantitative stability criteria. The satisfaction of these criteria will insure that, when rotating above a low critical speed, a bearing system made up of the three elements described above will be dynamically stable. That is, it will not only be stable for small displacements from equilibrium (''Earnshaw-stable''), but will also be stable against whirl-type instabilities of the types that can arise from displacement-dependent drag forces, or from mechanical-hysteritic losses that may occur in the rotor. Our design problem thus becomes one of calculating and/or measuring the relevant stiffnesses and drag coefficients of the various elements and comparing our results with the theory so as to assure that the cited stability criteria are satisfied...|$|R

Therefore, presenting these preliminary information that are necessary for the design of a free rod rotor synchronous motor to the researchers is the aim of this work. In this respect, this study presents the design and geometrical dimensions of the stator for a new synchronous motor which is an axial flux permanent magnet free rod machine with three, four, five and six phases. This type of motors are an innovative approach especially for the applications used in industrial stirrers. Each type of stator is designed such that it has an appropriate number of phases. The rotating magnetic field over the stator is established by a PIC based microcontroller feeding the interface circuit to the <b>stator</b> <b>wounds.</b> The maximum angular speeds of bar magnet rotors with four different lengths and masses are calculated theoretically and determined experimentally. In addition, the effects of the distance between the rotor and stator, the angular speed of the rotor within the limits of the operation, and the volume of the liquid to be stirred to the power applied are investigated. Furthermore, the effects of the lengths and angular speeds of the bar magnet rotors to the distance between the rotor and stator are determined. In the light of the information obtained and taking into account the power used, the most appropriate parameters and variables such as the stator geometry changing with the phase used, the length of rotor, the distance between the rotor and stator and the angular speeds of rotor are determined. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
