5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a <b>wrong</b> <b>line</b> of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E

500|$|However, his {{discontent with}} the British liberal {{movement}} grew following {{the election of}} the Liberal Party's William Ewart Gladstone to the Premiership in 1880. Morris was particularly angered that Gladstone's government did not reverse the Disraeli regime's occupation of the Transvaal, introduced the Coercion Bill, and oversaw the Bombardment of Alexandria. Morris later related that while he had once believed that [...] "one might further real Socialistic progress by doing what one could on the lines of ordinary middle-class Radicalism", following Gladstone's election he came to realise [...] "that Radicalism is on the <b>wrong</b> <b>line,</b> so to say, and will never develope [...] into anything more than Radicalism: in fact that it is made for and by the middle classes and will always be under the control of rich capitalists.|$|E

Both trams were severely damaged; 705 was scrapped, the only Balloon to meet this fate until 2009 when 722 was scrapped due to collision damage. 706 was rebuilt as an open-topped Balloon. A County Court judgement in 1982 found that Blackpool Corporation were 80% {{to blame for the}} collision.|$|E
2500|$|The {{name of the}} party's {{institute}} {{was later}} changed {{in the fall of}} 1930 to [...] "The New Workers School" [...] {{as part of an effort}} to contrast itself to the Workers School, the successful training program run by the regular Communist Party. At the time of the name change, the Communist Party (Majority Group) noted that [...] "every one of its teachers was formerly a leading teacher of the old Workers School," [...] an institution which [...] "thanks to the <b>wrong</b> <b>line</b> at present prevailing in the Party, is revising and falsifying Leninism and hence no longer serving the purposes for which it is founded." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was the Hatfield {{crash on}} 17 October 2000 {{that proved to}} be the {{defining}} moment in Railtrack's collapse. [...] The subsequent major repairs undertaken across the whole British rail network are estimated to have cost in the order of £580 million. According to Christian Wolmar, author of On the <b>Wrong</b> <b>Line,</b> the Railtrack board panicked in the wake of Hatfield. Because most of the engineering skill of British Rail had been sold off into the maintenance and renewal companies, Railtrack had no idea how many Hatfields were waiting to happen, nor did they have any way of assessing the consequence of the speed restrictions they were ordering – restrictions that brought the railway network to all but a standstill.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his qualities as a batsman, he {{was known}} to {{struggle}} against spin bowling. He has been dismissed (out) in the past by several spin bowlers, including the former Pakistan and Indian spinners, Mushtaq Ahmed and Anil Kumble. After achieving a successful first year in the international cricket, he encountered Mushtaq Ahmed when Pakistan visited Australia in the 1995–96 season. He was unable to pick which way Mushtaq's deliveries were turning and was continuously dismissed in the tournament by being declared Leg before wicket or being bowled, either playing down the <b>wrong</b> <b>line</b> or not offering shot to a googly that turned into his stumps. He was subsequently replaced by Ricky Ponting, but in 1996 he regained his batting position after Ponting himself had fallen upon hard times. Blewett then performed well with the bat, until the 1998 tour to India, where he struggled against Kumble and he was dropped in favour of Justin Langer. However, upon the retirement of [...] captain Mark Taylor in 1999, Blewett was selected to become an opening batsman, until he was dropped from the Australian team in favour of [...] Matthew Hayden in early 2000 after a period of poor performances, which ended his international career. He retired from professional cricket in 2006 when he played his last match in First-class cricket and One Day Domestic matches against Queensland and Tasmania.|$|E

The Allenwood homesteads were the best in the country, the settlement was fortunately located, and its inhabitants were people of intelligence.

5000|$|This sketch {{is not as}} surreal or Kafkaesque as {{most other}} Firesign Theatre material, though it is intermixed and loaded with {{references}} to the Beatles, the I Ching, and other counterculture topics.

It also parodies characteristics of old-time radio drama production, e.g. referring to a fireplace fire as [...] "the cellophane" [...] and [...] "coming in out of the cornstarch" [...] (used to create the sound effects); actors reading the <b>wrong</b> <b>lines,</b> or dropping their scripts; actors stepping out of character to read commercials; and referring to the use of voice fade-outs and organ cues to signal transitions between flashbacks.|$|R
