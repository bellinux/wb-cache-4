500|$|Mother and son sailed for Hong Kong, {{where for}} {{his first two years}} Wodehouse was raised by a Chinese amah (nurse), {{alongside}} his elder brothers Peveril (1877–1951) and Armine (1879–1936). When he was two, the brothers were brought to England, where they were placed under the care of an English nanny in a house adjoining that of Eleanor's father and mother. The boys' parents returned to Hong Kong and became virtual strangers to their sons. Such an arrangement was then normal for middle-class families based in the colonies. The lack of parental contact, and the harsh regime of some of those in loco parentis, left permanent emotional scars on many children from similar backgrounds, including the writers Thackeray, Saki, Kipling and Walpole. Wodehouse was more fortunate; his nanny, Emma Roper, was strict but not unkind, and both with her and later at his different schools Wodehouse had a generally happy childhood. His recollection was that [...] "it <b>went</b> <b>like</b> a breeze from start to finish, with everybody I met understanding me perfectly". The biographer Robert McCrum suggests that nonetheless Wodehouse's isolation from his parents left a psychological mark, causing him to avoid emotional engagement both in life and in his works. Another biographer, Frances Donaldson, writes, [...] "Deprived so early, not merely of maternal love, but of home life and even a stable background, Wodehouse consoled himself from the youngest age in an imaginary world of his own." ...|$|E
500|$|Promoted acting wing {{commander}} in June 1943, Arthur became wing leader of No.71 Wing, which controlled No.75 Squadron {{and three other}} combat units. On 5November, {{he was involved in}} a collision at Kiriwina Airfield with a Spitfire of No.79 Squadron. The Spitfire pilot was killed, and Arthur received serious burns. He later recalled, [...] "...I felt my hands disappear, felt my face go but the rest of my body was...was just flames...And {{then all of a sudden}} the flames dropped down a bit and I got out and <b>went</b> <b>like</b> mad and I was running away from the aircraft and trying to guess how far I could go before I'd try to put the flames out..." [...] Although his family was informed that his injuries were [...] "of a very slight nature" [...] and that he had been [...] "burnt but not badly", Arthur was close to death for weeks while he was treated in Kiriwina. [...] He was finally repatriated to Sydney where he underwent plastic surgery at Yaralla Military Hospital (now Concord Hospital). After his recovery in April 1944, he attended a staff course before taking over command of No.2 Operational Training Unit at Mildura, Victoria. In August, at the age of 24, he was promoted to temporary group captain, the youngest in the RAAF. That December he took command of No.81 Wing of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), based at Noemfoor and Labuan in the Dutch East Indies.|$|E

2500|$|In 1940, {{the team}} {{launched}} a similar stunt when Allen announced {{she was running}} for President of the United States on the Surprise Party ticket. Burns and Allen did a cross-country whistlestop campaign tour on a private train, performing their live radio show in different cities. In one of her campaign speeches, Gracie said, [...] "I don't {{know much about the}} Lend-Lease Bill, but if we owe it we should pay it." [...] Another typical Gracie-ism on the campaign trail <b>went</b> <b>like</b> this: [...] "Everybody knows a woman is better than a man when it comes to introducing bills into the house." [...] The Surprise Party mascot was the kangaroo; the motto was [...] "It's in the bag." [...] As part of the gag, Allen (in reality, the Burns and Allen writers) published a book, Gracie Allen for President, which included photographs from their nationwide campaign tour and the Surprise Party convention. Allen received an endorsement from Harvard University.|$|E

When you're young, you don't really appreciate the full importance of this Derby, so it means {{a great deal to}} win it for a second time. I've had a colourful life, but I'm not finished". Before the race Dettori had requested some [...] "lucky white tape" [...] for his stirrup: the tape had previously been used to repair Willie Carson's saddle before his win on Nashwan and had been applied to Dettori's stirrup when he won on Authorized in 2007. Gosden, who was winning the race for the second time, after Benny the Dip's success in 1997, commented [...] "The last thing I said to Frankie was ride a cool race and he rode a cool race—he waited and waited. He's a proper horse." [...] On the following day Gosden indicated that the Eclipse Stakes would be the colt's most likely next target.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1942 Maclean {{was ordered}} to Baghdad, where General Wilson, {{the new head of}} Persia and Iraq Command, wanted his advice about {{starting}} something like the SAS in Persia, should that country fall to the Germans. [...] He proceeded there to recruit volunteers, passing through many of the places he had seen in peacetime four years earlier: Kermanshah, Hamadan, Kazvin, Teheran. [...] He was soon diverted to a more urgent task. General Joseph Baillon, the Chief of Staff, and Reader Bullard, the minister (i.e., ambassador, as above), summoned him to Teheran. They were concerned about the influence of Fazlollah Zahedi, the general in charge of the Persian forces in the Isfahan area, who, their intelligence told them, was stockpiling grain, liaising with German agents, and preparing an uprising. Baillon and Bullard asked Maclean to remove Zahidi alive and without creating a fuss. He devised a Trojan horse plan: he and a senior officer would call on Zahidi to pay their respects, and then arrest him [...] "at the point of a pistol" [...] within his walled and guarded residence. [...] He would be whisked out in the British staff car, driven a waiting plane, and flown into internment and exile. [...] Maclean obtained and trained a platoon of Seaforth Highlanders to cover his retreat, and the plan <b>went</b> <b>like</b> clockwork. (Zahidi {{spent the rest of the}} war in British Palestine; five years later he was back in charge of the military of southern Persia, by 1953 he was prime minister.) ...|$|E
