On that occasion, I learnt about this faith and desired to become a Christian, but I still haven't {{accomplished}} this desire due to some small issues. However, {{in order to encourage}} my subjects to become Christians, I wish that you send missionaries of the Franciscan church. I guarantee that {{you will be able to}} build a church and that your missionaries will be protected. I also wish that you select and send a bishop as well. Because of that, I have sent one of my samurai, Hasekura Rokuemon, as my representative to accompany Luis Sotelo across the seas to Rome, to give you a stamp of obedience and to kiss your feet. Further, as our country and Nueva España are neighbouring countries, could you intervene so that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>discuss</b> with the King of Spain, for the benefit of dispatching missionaries across the seas."

Detection is necessary for discover the disease at initial stage and giving a proper Treatment for that.

So detection is very necessary to stop or to slow the disease progress and according to the detection proper treatments are given to the patient. In this paper <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>discussed</b> about the different methodology of data mining that can be use for diagnosis and prognosis of brain tumor. The important role in medical treatment for the brain tumor is to identify the area of the tumor.
