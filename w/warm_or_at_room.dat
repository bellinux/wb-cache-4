The serving method and containers are similar to those used for sake and soju, though baijiu differs significantly. Baijiu is generally sold in glass or ceramic bottles and consumed in shot glasses, much like vodka. It is traditional to drink baijiu with food rather than on its own, though the latter is not uncommon.|$|E
50|$|The {{artichokes}} are cleaned {{with a sharp}} knife, eliminating all {{the hard}} leaves and the thorns with an upward spiral movement. Only a couple of cm of the stem are left: the rest is cleaned, cut in pieces and cooked with the artichokes. The artichokes are plunged for some minutes in water with lemon juice, so that they won't turn brown. Then they are opened {{in the center and}} the choke (present only towards season's end) is removed. In the resulting cavity of each artichoke, is stuffed a mixture of parsley, lesser calamint (in Rome named mentuccia), garlic, salt and pepper. At the end, all the artichokes are put in a deep pan, standing on the stem, enough in number so that they support each other and don't fall. Water and white wine are added, and oil, pepper and salt are sprinkled on them. Then are braised in the covered pan until the liquid has evaporated. One can eat them <b>warm</b> <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>room</b> temperature.|$|E

In some regions, instead of bánh chưng, people make bánh tét which is a cylindrical cake with almost the same ingredients as bánh chưng. A similar cake as bánh tét is made in some regions in the North but with the name bánh tày or bánh chưng dài (long bánh chưng). Bánh tày is often made with small quantity of mung bean and little or no pork {{so that it can}} be preserved for a longer period, bánh tày can be cut in slices and fried like bánh chưng rán. San Diu people has another variation of the long bánh chưng with a hump in the middle of the cake, hence it is called bánh chưng [...] "gù" [...] ("humped" [...] bánh chưng), besides lá dong, bánh chưng [...] "gù" [...] is wrapped by an additional type of leaf named lá chít.|$|E

For the first time, the {{microbiological}} and nutritional quality of “sarapatel” samples (n = 48) sold under different conditions (in street markets, butcher shops, and supermarkets under refrigeration, frozen <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>room</b> temperature) was evaluated. Goat “sarapatel” is a nutritive food, with each 100 g providing, on average, 72 g of moisture, 2 g of ash, 18 g of protein, 9 g of lipids, 2 g of carbohydrates, 282 mg of cholesterol, and high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids and essential amino acids. The analysis of the “sarapatel” samples shows {{that none of them}} contain Salmonella spp. or L. monocytogenes. High counts (> 104) of total coliforms, thermotolerant coliforms, and sulfite-reducing Clostridium were detected, and coagulase-positive Staphylococcus was found in 31. 25 % of samples. The storage conditions evaluated (refrigeration, frozen <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>room</b> temperature) did not affect the physicochemical quality of the “sarapatel”; however, the unsatisfactory microbiological quality indicates {{that it is necessary to}} improve the health-sanitary aspects of the processing and sale of this product...|$|R
