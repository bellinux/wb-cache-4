2500|$|In 1988, Ross {{chose to}} not renew her RCA contract. Around this same time, Ross {{had been in}} talks with her former mentor Berry Gordy to return to Motown. When she learned of Gordy's plans to sell Motown, Ross tried advising him against the {{decision}} though he sold it to MCA Records in 1988. (The first and only single, [...] "If <b>We</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>on</b> Together", theme song from the Steven Spielberg animated film, The Land Before Time, became a huge number-one international single in Japan and currently ranks as the #24th Best Selling International Single of All Time in Japan). [...] Following this decision, Gordy offered Ross a new contract to return to Motown with the condition that she have shares in the company as a part-owner. Ross accepted the offer.|$|E
2500|$|Ross {{had success}} with movie-themed songs. The soundtrack for Lady Sings the Blues peaked at #1 on Billboard's Pop chart, selling over 300,000 copies {{in its first}} eight days of release. While her version of Holiday's [...] "Good Morning Heartache" [...] only {{performed}} modestly well in early 1973, her recording of [...] "Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)" [...] gave Ross her third number-one hit, in late 1975. Three years later, Ross and Michael Jackson had a modest dance hit with their recording of [...] "Ease on Down the Road". Their second duet, actually {{as part of the}} ensemble of The Wiz, [...] "Brand New Day", found some success overseas. Ross scored a Top 10 hit in late 1980 with the theme song to the 1980 film It's My Turn. The following year, she collaborated with former Commodores singer-songwriter Lionel Richie on the theme song for the film Endless Love. The Academy Award-nominated title single became her final hit on Motown Records and the number-one record of the year. Several years later, in 1988, Ross recorded the theme song to The Land Before Time. [...] "If <b>We</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>on</b> Together" [...] became an international hit, reaching number one in Japan.|$|E

He must pay for the coal as it arrives and his money is {{probably}} getting short; the traction engine and trailer cost a good sum, and he has spent something on the lime-kilns.

I dare say fellows who {{understood}} a boat well could manage it but, if <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> like this, we shall end by drowning ourselves. I think the best plan will be to lower the sail and mast, and row straight to shore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{about at}} once, Hawkins. You see {{we can see}} her topsails from the deck; and of course she can see ours. I don't suppose she has paid any {{attention}} to us yet, and if we stand away on the other tack we shall soon drop her altogether; while if <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> she will, when we reach that shore, be three or four miles behind us. Of course, she will have a full view of us." ...|$|E
60|$|That, at least, {{with its}} {{feathery}} oat tassels and stately heads of wheat, {{is a picture}} well worth looking upon, for there are few {{places in the world}} where one may see furrows of equal length. It was won hardly, by much privation, and in the sweat of the brow, {{as well as by the}} favor of Providence, as Grace would say, and she is right in most things, except when she attempts to instruct me in stock feeding, for <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> the prairie that it is not fair to place all the burden on Providence. Therefore the settlers who succeed cut down rations and work double tides to help themselves in time of adversity.|$|E

6000|$|... "All day we held our position, killing great numbers, but losing {{many men}} ourselves. By night, our water was exhausted. Then the {{soldiers}} offered {{to attack the}} enemy, but they were twenty to one against us, and I said to them, 'No, fight one day longer, if <b>we</b> can <b>hold</b> <b>on.</b> The Dervishes may retire, or they may offer us terms.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{need not}} be anxious about food now, Peter; if we can catch these in five minutes, we can get enough each day to satisfy us. They quench the thirst too. We must limit {{ourselves}} to half a pint of water a day, and <b>we</b> can <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> for a fortnight. We are safe {{to be picked up}} before that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Missis," [...] said Tom, after a while, [...] "I can see that, some how, you're quite 'bove me in everything; but there's {{one thing}} Missis might learn even from poor Tom. Ye said the Lord took sides against us, because he lets us be 'bused and knocked round; but ye see what come {{on his own}} Son,--the blessed Lord of Glory,--wan't he allays poor? and have we, any on us, yet come so low as he come? The Lord han't forgot us,--I'm sartin' o' that ar'. If we suffer with him, we shall also reign, Scripture says; but, if we deny Him, he also will deny us. Didn't they all suffer?--the Lord and all his? It tells how they was stoned and sawn asunder, and wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, and was destitute, afflicted, tormented. Sufferin' an't no reason to make us think the Lord's turned agin us; but jest the contrary, if only <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> to him, and doesn't give up to sin." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{it often}} is with us, we take a course, and we keep to it, {{as if we were}} infallible, and we allow nothing to alter our convictions. We persuade {{ourselves}} that we are right, and <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> our course unmoved. Death steps in: and now, when the past is irrevocable, the scales that have so long darkened our eyes, fall at once to the ground, and we see that we were wrong after all. How much cruel conduct, how many harsh words, how many little unkindnesses do we wish unspoken and undone when we look upon a dead face we have loved, or stand by the side of a new-made grave! how we wish--how we wish that we could but have the time over again! Perhaps in past times we were quite content with our own conduct; we had no doubts in our mind but that we always did what was right and kind, and that we were in every way doing our duty. But now in what a different light do right and duty appear! how we regret that we ever caused tears to flow from those dear eyes, now never to open again! why could we not have made those small concessions which would have cost us so little, why were we so hard upon that trifling fault, why so impatient with that little failing? Ah me! ah me! if we could but live our lives over again, how different, oh, how different it should be! And yet while we say this, we do not think that there are others yet alive upon whose faults we are just as hard, with whose failings we bear just as little, and that these, too, may some day go down into the quiet grave, and that we may again have to stand beside and cry [...] "peccavi." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{every man}} at heart wishes {{the best and}} not {{inferior}} society, wishes to be convicted of his error and to come to himself,--so he wishes that the same healing should not stop in his thought, but should penetrate his will or active power. The selfish man suffers more from his selfishness than he from whom that selfishness withholds some important benefit. What he most wishes is to be lifted to some higher platform, that he may see beyond his present fear the transalpine good, so that his fear, his coldness, his custom may be broken up like fragments of ice, melted and carried away in the great stream of good will. Do you ask my aid? I also wish to be a benefactor. I wish more to be a benefactor and servant than you wish to be served by me; and surely the greatest good fortune that could befall me is precisely to be so moved by you that I should say, 'Take me and all mine, and use me and mine freely to your ends'! for I could not say it otherwise than because a great enlargement had come to my heart and mind, which made me superior to my fortunes. Here we are paralyzed with fear; <b>we</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> to our little properties, house and land, office and money, for the bread which they have in our experience yielded us, although we confess that our being does not flow through them. We desire to be made great; we desire to be touched with that fire which shall command this ice to stream, and make our existence a benefit. If therefore we start objections to your project, O friend of the slave, or friend of the poor, or of the race, understand well that it is because we wish to drive you to drive us into your measures. We wish to hear ourselves confuted. We are haunted with a belief {{that you have a}} secret which it would highliest advantage us to learn, and we would force you to impart it to us, though it should bring us to prison, or to worse extremity.|$|E
