5|$|A minor {{class of}} sheep are the dairy breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may {{primarily}} be meat or <b>wool</b> <b>sheep</b> {{are often used}} secondarily as milking animals, {{but there are a}} few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves. In the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.|$|E
5|$|Coarse or carpet <b>wool</b> <b>sheep</b> {{are those}} with a medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.|$|E

5|$|Exportation of merinos without royal {{permission}} {{was also}} a punishable offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until the mid-18th century. After {{the breaking of the}} export ban, fine <b>wool</b> <b>sheep</b> began to be distributed worldwide. The export to Rambouillet by Louis XVI in 1786 formed the basis for the modern Rambouillet (or French Merino) breed. After the Napoleonic Wars and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the Churra, and was no longer of international economic significance.|$|E
5|$|Breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} by {{the type of}} their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long <b>wool</b> <b>sheep</b> are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E

5000|$|The Pelibuey (also {{known as}} Cubano Rojo) is a breed of {{domestic}} sheep {{raised in the}} Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. The Pelibuey is a breed of hair sheep, meaning they do not generally grow wool.

25|$|The Peppin {{brothers}} took {{a different}} approach to producing a hardier, longer-stapled, broader <b>wool</b> <b>sheep.</b> After purchasing Wanganella Station in the Riverina, they selected 200 station-bred ewes that thrived under local conditions and purchased 100 South Australian ewes bred at Cannally that were sired by an imported Rambouillet ram. The Peppin brothers mainly used Saxon and Rambouillet rams, importing four Rambouillet rams in 1860. One of these, Emperor, cut an 11.4lb (5.1kg clean) wool clip. They ran some Lincoln ewes, but their introduction into the flock is undocumented. In 1865, George Merriman founded the fine wool Merino Ravensworth Stud, part of which is the Merryville Stud at Yass, New South Wales.|$|E

Five PCR-SSCP banding patterns, representing five different nucleotide sequences, were detected, including four previously identified (named A, B, C, and F) variants and one newly identified (named G) variant. A new non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and a 45 -bp deletion were detected in variant G. Of the three common genotypes (AA, AB, and AG) identified in these <b>sheep,</b> <b>wool</b> from <b>sheep</b> that were AG, on average, had a lower mean fibre diameter (MFD), fibre diameter standard deviation (FDSD), and prickle factor (PF) than <b>wool</b> from AA <b>sheep,</b> whereas <b>wool</b> from AB <b>sheep,</b> on average, had a higher MFD, FDSD, and PF than <b>wool</b> from AA <b>sheep.</b> This suggests that variation in ovine KRTAP 6 - 3 affect MFD, FDSD, and PF, and that this gene may have potential for use as a gene-maker for improving fibre diameter-associated wool traits...|$|R
