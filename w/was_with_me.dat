Gunn {{played a}} match for Norwich against Queens Park Rangers at Carrow Road just days after his {{daughter}} died; he said of it, [...] "When I ran out, I thought, wow, I could feel the whole stadium <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I never thought about packing it in."

500|$|By 1970, Northrup and Hollister {{had moved}} to Maui, Hawaii. Northrup's {{daughter}} Alexis, who was by now twenty-one years old, attempted to contact her father but was rebuffed in a handwritten statement in which Hubbard denied that he was her father: [...] "Your mother <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> as a secretary in Savannah in late 1948 [...] [...] [...] In July 1949 I was in Elizabeth, New Jersey, writing a movie. She turned up destitute and pregnant." [...] He said that Northrup had been a Nazi spy {{during the war and}} accused her and Hollister of using the divorce case to seize control of Dianetics: [...] "They obtained considerable newspaper publicity, none of it true, and employed the highest priced divorce attorney in the US to sue me for divorce and get the foundation in Los Angeles in settlement. This proved a puzzle since where there is no legal marriage, there can't be any divorce." [...] Despite clearly being written by Hubbard, who spoke in the first person in the letter, it was signed [...] "Your good friend, J. Edgar Hoover". Even his own staff were shocked by the contents of Hubbard's letter; he ended his instructions to them with the statement, [...] "Decency is not a subject well understood".|$|E
500|$|Aubrey {{eliminated}} {{hundreds of}} jobs when he relocated corporate headquarters from New York City to Culver City {{to be closer}} to production facilities, a move which was announced on April 29, 1970. Aubrey ordered the sale of MGM's historic collection of costumes and props such as the Ruby Slippers worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz, Vivien Leigh's dresses from Gone with the Wind and the suit Spencer Tracy wore in Inherit the Wind. (It was bought by one of the defense attorneys defending Charles Manson, who regularly wore it to court.) The studio's camera department was auctioned. Most of the studio's Culver City backlot and its 2,000 acre (8km²) ranch in the Conejo Valley were sold to developers, moves already planned under Polk. Aubrey literally threw the company's valuable archives into the trash and brought production to a standstill. Composer and conductor André Previn, in his memoir, No Minor Chords. My Days in Hollywood, describes how Aubrey had MGM's collection of film music manuscripts discarded into the trash. [...] Aubrey was criticized for these actions. In 1986, he recalled, [...] "the buck had to stop somewhere, and it <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Nostalgia runs strong out here, so we were criticized for selling Judy Garland's red shoes. To us they had no value, and they had no intrinsic value." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} Beyoncé as the female protagonist singing about {{her love for}} the [...] "huge ego" [...] of her lover. Jay Lustig of New Jersey On-Line further noted that the song may be an insight into Beyoncé's marriage to Jay-Z. In an interview with Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, Beyoncé clarified that [...] "Ego" [...] is on the Sasha Fierce disc because it is [...] "fun" [...] and very [...] "Sasha Fierce". She further explained that [...] "Ego" [...] reveals the story about someone being [...] "very confident and having [...] swagger when they walk and when they talk, and that {{being one of the}} reasons why [...] attracted to them." [...] The song explores the restrained vocals of Beyoncé singing [...] "I talk like this, cos I can back it up" [...] and consists of a piano breakdown. As Beyoncé sings, she lets out a slinky snarl in her voice. She describes the ego of her love interest as: [...] "It’s too big, it’s too wide, it’s too strong, it won’t fit, it’s too much." [...] The remix of the song features Kanye West rapping on it. He sings the lines, [...] "Now I’m standing next to Jay, who's standing next to B / Could have been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me / That's good for my ego... My ego is my imaginary friend / He <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> when I was only imagining." ...|$|E

His father had him educated at home by private governesses and tutors. Under the influence of a tutor, Ferdinand T. Brooks, he became interested in science and theosophy. He was subsequently initiated into the Theosophical Society at age thirteen by family friend Annie Besant. However, his interest in theosophy did not prove to be enduring and he left the society shortly after Brooks departed as his tutor.

[...] The same year, the PSDMR itself disappeared from the scene: Ioan Nădejde and his [...] "generous ones" [...] faction denounced socialist politics as too feeble for the Romanian context, and joined the PNL, leaving a minority, under C. Z. Buzdugan, I. C. Frimu and Christian Rakovsky, to establish a more radical workers' party (embryo of the post-1910 Social Democratic Party).|$|E
2500|$|On Kristallnacht, an anti-Semitic pogrom {{that took}} place on the night of November 9, 1938 and {{resulted}} in the destruction of hundreds of synagogues and the deaths of 91 Jews, Trepp was arrested and placed in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he was held as one of as many as 30,000 Jews who were arrested and held in prison camps by the Nazis. In the wake of Jews being detained and dying, Trepp saw his role as being part of [...] "a very rewarding rabbinate because the Jews needed me". [...] He recalled the inmates being called out in Sachsenhausen at 4:00 in the morning, seeing the guard towers manned with soldiers holding machine guns and being told [...] "You are the dregs of humanity. I don't see why you should live". [...] He told God that he was prepared to die, but was overcome with the feeling that [...] "God <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I know God was there.

[...] His technical abilities weren't as good as the other kids, but he had an understanding of the game. It was something spectacular. [...] He knew when to come to the net, when to stay back. [...] This is something you are born with. [...] Either you have it or you don't. [...] You can teach it, but only up to a certain point, and Andy was born with it." ...|$|E

5000|$|One of Jesus' {{statements}} {{before he}} died were the words to a man hanging alongside him, [...] "you will <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in Paradise." [...] The New World Translation places a comma after the word 'today', dividing it into two separate phrases, [...] "I tell you today" [...] and [...] "you will <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in Paradise". This differs from standard translations of this verse as [...] "I tell you today you will <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in Paradise". Based on scriptures such as Matthew 12:40, 27:63, Mark 8:31 and 9:31, Witnesses believe Jesus' expectation {{that he would be}} bodily resurrected after three days precluded his being in paradise {{on the same day that}} he died.|$|R
