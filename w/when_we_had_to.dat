500|$|I [...] with {{a single}} mother who {{worked very hard to}} put food on our table. We did not have money. There were many nights <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go to sleep without eating. It was a very {{difficult}} upbringing. Things weren’t easy for me growing up.|$|E
2500|$|... "I don’t {{remember}} {{a huge amount}} of the bad side of Zimbabwe," [...] said Cartwright. [...] "I remember living on a farm. Our cousins were down the road. It was only {{in the last year or}} so <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> move out of our farm home and live with my mum’s side of the family in Harare was when my perspective started to change." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “The {{deliberate}} ferocity, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> endure it, {{was above}} all displayed among the ruling class, the officers, the administrators, and most particularly {{it came to}} us through ministerial orders drawn up in Berlin." [...] The guards seem {{not to have been}} judged {{in the same manner as}} the officers, hated for their zeal. Most often, they were part of the territorial army, the Landsturm, and tended to be family fathers who were there only under obligation. Numerous accounts are found regarding their occasional benevolence.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2013, Russian {{president}} Vladimir Putin said in {{a television}} interview that Russia attacked Georgia because the Georgian government was smuggling terrorists across Abkhazia to the Russian border near Sochi. [...] "About {{six or seven years}} ago <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> attack Georgian territories, those were not just strikes on Georgia. We targeted militant groups that came very close to Sochi. … Georgian police vehicles were transporting the militants to the Russian border. So we had to take some pre-emptive measures. And I informed the president [...] about this," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|England {{therefore}} won the two Test series 2–0, taking both matches by {{more than}} an innings. This was their fifth successive Test series win, {{and the first time}} that the English had won five successive Test series since 1971. With their first three innings all being over before the Bangladeshis made 200, the series was clearly England's, who consolidated their position at second in the ICC Test Championship table. Bangladesh remain bottom in tenth place. Afterwards England captain Michael Vaughan said, [...] "It's difficult to judge how much we've got out of these games because we've won so easily. We've not had those real tough-in sessions and fight-through sessions where we've lost a batch of wickets. We have had stages <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> knuckle down but it has been easier than I expected. To win two Test matches in almost two days each is obviously quite an easy series victory." ...|$|E
2500|$|We didn't {{actually}} have the idea. It was the record company. The record company guys were like, [...] "Even {{if we have}} to go to jail, there's no question that we'll release that." [...] On the song [...] "Virgin Killer", time is the virgin killer. But then, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do the interviews about it, we said [...] "Look, listen to the lyrics and then you'll know what we're talking about. We're using this only to get attention. That's what we do." [...] Even the girl, when we met her fifteen years later, had no problem with the cover. Growing up in Europe, sexuality, of course not with children, was very normal. The lyrics really say it all. Time is the virgin killer. A kid comes into the world very naive, they lose that naiveness and then go into this life losing all of this getting into trouble. That was the basic idea about all of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now when you're {{willing to}} walk I'll take that out," [...] he said. [...] "Once in every few minutes, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stop to rest I'll {{look at your}} eyes. If you wink, it means you're ready to do as I say." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "It {{just makes}} me feel {{separated}} from society, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep talking about it. It’s like — am I even human?...I mean, I know I’m not normal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, ma'am, {{there has}} been such goodness! I did vex at being a poor {{helpless}} thing, nothing but a burden on father; and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go from home, and Mr. and Mrs. Hazlewood and all, I can't tell you how bad it was, ma'am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed; I {{should think}} she would be proud to help with one of your pictures, sir. My sister thinks they are very lovely; and we kept one of them <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sell all the rest," [...] said Jessie, in her eager, frank way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it is beautiful!" [...] {{she gasped}} at last. [...] "Poor papa! What {{a time he}} will have! But it's all for his own good, {{as he used to}} say <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be punished when we were little. Oh, Clara, I do hope your heart won't fail you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I was a venturing to explain, these fits of fainting come {{often in}} our way. Thieves, mum,--that is, the regulars,--don't mind us a bit, {{and the women}} is more hardeneder than the men; but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> speak to a lady, it is so often that she goes off like that! I've known 'em do it just at being looked at." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{certainly}} work tolerably hard out there, {{but it is}} {{no great}} credit <b>to</b> us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> choose between that and starvation; and the West is the land of disappointment as well as promise," [...] I answered dryly.|$|R

60|$|Still {{he walked}} on unharmed, past the ashes and the ruins. Not as a conqueror was he come, {{to march in}} triumph. Not to destroy, but to heal. Though there were many times <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fight for {{a path through the}} crowds, he did not seem to feel the danger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{you don't}} know Sarah's temper {{or you would}} wonder no more. I tried it when I came to Croydon, and we kept on until about two months ago, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> part. I don't want {{to say a word}} against my own sister, but she was always meddlesome and hard to please, was Sarah." ...|$|E
60|$|We were {{a little}} like undertakers, in the Commons, as {{regarded}} Probate transactions; generally making it a rule to look more or less cut up, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> deal with clients in mourning. In a similar feeling of delicacy, we were always blithe and light-hearted with the licence clients. Therefore I hinted to Peggotty that she would find Mr. Spenlow much recovered from the shock of Mr. Barkis's decease; and indeed he came in like a bridegroom.|$|E
30|$|Exactly the {{opposite}} in fact: {{it is an}} arduous task and one with no secure reference points. This is even more the case today, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wage a daily battle with the Internet and thus with an infinite array of uncontrolled possibilities.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's enough, Sam; don't {{give me any}} of it now. Time {{enough for}} that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get at it. There goes the supper bell. Now, downstairs with you! and let us get through as soon as {{possible}} and be on our way." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Sunday school," [...] she murmured. [...] "I went {{regularly}} {{from the}} time I was eight till I was thirteen. We lodged {{in the north of}} London, off Kingsland Road. It wasn't a bad time. Father was earning good money then. The woman of the house used to pack me off in the afternoon with her own girls. She was a good woman. Her husband was in the post office. Sorter or something. Such a quiet man. He used to go off after supper for night-duty, sometimes. Then one day they had a row, and broke up the home. I remember I cried <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pack up all of a sudden and go into other lodgings. I never knew what it was, though--" ...|$|E
60|$|When I had {{a moment}} to look about me, I took in the felucca on which I was. I am free to confess that I marveled at the {{excellent}} construction and stanch yet speedy lines of the little craft. That Perry had chosen this type of vessel seemed rather remarkable, for though I had warned him against turreted battle-ships, armor, and like useless show, I had fully expected that when I beheld his navy I should find considerable attempt at grim and terrible magnificence, for it was always Perry's idea to overawe these ignorant cave men <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> contend with them in battle. But I had soon learned that while one might easily astonish them with some new engine of war, it was an utter impossibility to frighten them into surrender.|$|E
6000|$|If {{we could}} have stayed in the tent the whole time {{it would not have}} been quite so bad. But we had to go out twice to take the ponies to the nearest pond and water them; moreover, we had to collect pea vines for them, which was not an {{agreeable}} occupation in a pouring rain. The day was very cold too, but fortunately there was plenty of dead poplar right by our camp. We kept a good fire on in the camp stove and were quite dry and comfortable as long as we stayed inside. Even <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go out we did not get very wet, as we were well protected. But it was a long dreary day. Finally when the dark came down and supper was over Kate grew quite desperate. [...] "Let's have a game of checkers," [...] she suggested.|$|E
30|$|Now, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> data <b>to</b> {{be searched}} on, let us {{consider}} search.|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{represent}}, on {{the same}} Diagram, Propositions, of which some begin with [...] "Some" [...] and others with [...] "No", we represent the negative ones first.

6000|$|By-and-by {{we came to}} a part <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> ask him questions; and he was so {{interested}} in Teuta's work--he is really bound up body and soul in his beautiful wife, and no wonder--that we had to take him into full confidence. He promised he would help us all he could by giving us the use of his later journals, and such letters and papers as he had kept privately. He said he would make one condition--I use his own words: [...] "As you two dear women are to be my editors, you must promise to put in everything exactly as I wrote it. It will not do to have any fake about this. I do not wish anything foolish or egotistical toned down out of affection for me. It was all written in sincerity, and if I had faults, they must not be hidden. If it is to be history, it must be true history, even if it gives you and me or any of us away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] said Sara, laying Aunt Josephina's letter down on {{the kitchen}} table with such energy that in anybody but Sara it must have been said she threw it down, [...] "this is {{positively}} the last straw! I have endured all the rest. I have given up my chance of a musical education, when Aunt Nan offered it, that I might stay home and help Willard pay the mortgage off--if it doesn't pay us off first--and I have, which was much harder, accepted the fact that we can't possibly afford to send Ray to the Valley Academy, even if I wore the same hat and coat for four winters. I did not grumble when Uncle Joel came here to live because he wanted to be 'near his dear nephew's children.' I felt it my Christian duty to look pleasant <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give Cousin Caroline a home to save her from the poorhouse. But my endurance and philosophy, and worst of all, my furniture, has reached a limit. I cannot have Aunt Josephina come here to spend the winter, because I have no room to put her in." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alas! {{the forest}} of Mormal is only {{a little bit of}} a wood, and it was but for a little way that we skirted by its boundaries. And the rest of the time the rain kept coming in squirts and the wind in squalls, until one's heart grew weary of such fitful, scolding weather. It was odd how the showers began <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> carry the boats over a lock, and must expose our legs. They always did. This is a sort of thing that readily begets a {{personal}} feeling against nature. There seems no reason why the shower should not come five minutes before or five minutes after, unless you suppose an intention to affront you. The Cigarette had a mackintosh which put him more or less above these contrarieties. But I had to bear the brunt uncovered. I began to remember that nature was a woman. My companion, in a rosier temper, listened with great satisfaction to my Jeremiads, and ironically concurred. He instanced, as a cognate matter, the action of the tides, [...] "which," [...] said he, [...] "was altogether designed for the confusion of canoeists, except in so far as it was calculated to minister to a barren vanity on the part of the moon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And by {{so doing}} have gained just so much experience. I want the whole work done by you and I, except <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> call for assistance, as in the present case. It's {{professional}} pride, my boy, and I look to you to take my place, until I can crawl around once more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was quite}} good--the matter of it," [...] Joan told her. [...] "All Roads lead to Calvary. The {{idea is that}} {{there comes a time}} to all of us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> choose. Whether, like your friend Carlyle, we will 'give up things' for our faith's sake.
