25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away as I entered, and they handed me my camera. Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around <b>where</b> <b>my</b> mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and I found myself looking at easily {{one of the most}} extraordinary scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E

25|$|After {{a weekend}} break, filming resumed on the Desilu Gower Street sets, <b>where</b> <b>My</b> Three Sons was {{normally}} shot. These {{were used to}} represent {{the interior of the}} mission where Keeler nurses McCoy back to health. DeForest Kelley felt that McCoy should also fall for Keeler; so Pevney shot the scenes with that element included but never included it in the final cut. The following two days were spent on the same sets, while on day 5 the action moved to the bridge set for the Enterprise. This day's shoot was meant to include scenes in the transporter room and in the Enterprise corridors, but by now the production was a full day behind and these were pushed to the following day. Part way through day 6, the filming moved to a neighboring set for the exterior ruin shots and the Guardian of Forever, which was used for the next two and a half days. The montage of historical footage was all taken from the Paramount film library, as was the footage of the Brooklyn Bridge.|$|E

500|$|My [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] {{video was}} {{completely}} inspired {{by all the}} female surrealist painters like Leonora Carrington and Remedios Varo. There's that one shot <b>where</b> <b>my</b> hands are {{up in the air}} and stars are spinning around me. And me flying through the hallway with my hair trailing behind me, the birds flying out of my open robe– all of those images were an homage to female surrealist painters; there's a little bit of Frida Kahlo in there, too.|$|E
