The centrifuge was a cylindrical structure that rotated the frogs' heads at scheduled intervals. The FOEP also contained a life support system which could maintain a regulated environment for the frogs. This system consisted of two closed loops, one containing liquid and the other containing gas. The interface between the two loops was a selectively permeable silicone rubber that acted as an artificial lung. Oxygen passed through the membrane from the gas to the liquid side, and carbon dioxide from the liquid to the gas side. The frogs were immersed in the liquid loop. A pump circulated oxygen through the gas-containing loop. Carbon dioxide entering the gas loop was removed by an absorbent and the purified oxygen returned to the pump for recirculation. A <b>water</b> <b>evaporator</b> and an electric heater maintained the water temperature at about 60 °F (15 °C).

The most common defrosting technique is to reverse the cycle. Unfortunately it provokes {{a break in the}} heat production and the defrosting energy is drawn from the heat stock previously constituted. This article presents the design of a heat pump prototype for simultaneous heating and cooling (named HPS). Its refrigeration circuit involves a piece of refrigeration circuit that could be modified and implemented to standard air-source heat pumps during retrofit or maintenance in order to carry out defrosting with better performance. It uses a water tank that recovers the subcooling energy of the refrigerant at first and is subsequently used as a cold source for evaporation. The second part of the sequence liberates the air evaporator for defrosting. Between two evaporators (air-to-refrigerant and water-to-refrigerant) at different temperatures, a thermosiphon forms. A supplementary amount of vapour flows out of the <b>water</b> <b>evaporator</b> and migrates towards the colder inside surface of the air evaporator tubes in thermal contact with the frost layer. The vapour, while condensing, brings the defrosting energy. The liquid returns back to the <b>water</b> <b>evaporator</b> by gravity. This defrosting system was observed by means of infrared thermography and tested experimentally on a heat pump prototype. It proved very efficient as defrosting time was short. Using this defrosting technique ensures: - a continuous heat production with even better performance while defrosting thanks to the higher evaporating temperature, - more frequent defrosting sequences because more easily activated, impacting on lower frost thickness and higher mean heat transfer coefficients. A numerical study was carried out to assess the performance improvement achieved on a heating sequence.

However, these greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming and are likely to be banned by European directives. Some interest is now turned towards fluids with low global warming potential (GWP) like carbon dioxide. The performances of CO 2 can be interesting in transcritical cycles, particularly for domestic hot water (DHW) production. However, this cycle requires the use of devices operating under high pressures. The Heating and Cooling Plant (HCP) is intended to produce domestic hot water and to heat and cool residential and small office buildings. The HCP presents an innovative design of the refrigeration circuit and an innovative defrosting system. It is equipped with three heat exchangers: a water condenser (or gas cooler for transcritical CO 2) and a <b>water</b> <b>evaporator</b> linked to three tanks and an air heat exchanger that can be either condenser or evaporator in order to balance productions and needs. When operating with the air evaporator under frosting conditions, some heat is gained by subcooling the refrigerant and stored in the cooling tank.

It is discussed that HT-PEMFC systems can exceed the electrical efficiency of LT-PEMFC systems up to five percentage points because of the integration of high quality heat from the fuel cell cooling cycle.

40|$|Grant Bue and Matthew Vogel {{presented}} {{the two types}} of Spacesuit <b>Water</b> Membrane <b>Evaporators</b> (SWME) that were developed based on hydrophobic microporous membranes. One type, the Sheet Membrane (SaM) SWME, is composed of six concentric Teflon sheet membranes fixed on cylindrical-supporting screens to form three concentric annular water channels. Those water channels are surrounded by vacuum passages to draw off the water vapor that passes through the membrane. The other type, the Hollow Fiber (HoFi) SWME, is composed of more than 14, 000 tubes. Water flows through the tubes and water vapor passes through the tube wall to the shell side that vents to the vacuum of space. Both SWME types have undergone testing to baseline the performance at predicted operating temperatures and flow rates; the units also have been subjected to contamination testing and other conditions to test resiliency...|$|R
40|$|New type of capillary-pumped heat-transfer loop primes {{itself at}} startup. Removes {{substantial}} quantities of heat like that generated by people and equipment in rooms and vehicles. Creates continuous path for its working fluid; both vapor and liquid move in same direction. Key element in operation of loop is formation of slugs of liquid, condensed from vapor and moved along loop by vapor bubbles {{before and after}} it. Both evaporator and condenser contain axial arteries carrying <b>water.</b> Heat entering <b>evaporator</b> from heat source provides energy for transport of fluid and heat.

40|$|Development of the Advanced Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AEMU) {{portable}} {{life support}} subsystem (PLSS) is currently {{under way at}} NASA Johnson Space Center. The AEMU PLSS features a new evaporative cooling system, the reduced volume prototype (RVP) spacesuit <b>water</b> membrane <b>evaporator</b> (SWME). The RVP SWME is the third generation of hollow fiber SWME hardware. Like its predecessors, RVP SWME provides nominal crew member and electronics cooling by flowing water through porous hollow fibers. Water vapor escapes through the hollow fiber pores, thereby cooling the liquid water that remains inside of the fibers. This cooled water is then recirculated to remove heat from the crew member and PLSS electronics. Major design improvements, including a 36 % reduction in volume, reduced weight, and a more flight-like backpressure valve, facilitate the packaging of RVP SWME in the AEMU PLSS envelope. The development of these evaporative cooling systems will contribute to a more robust and comprehensive AEMU PLSS...|$|R
