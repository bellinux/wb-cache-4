50|$|On 13 November 2011, 8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana {{hosted the}} Hong Kong bidders {{for the annual}} World <b>White</b> <b>Truffle</b> <b>of</b> Alba Auction, linking by {{satellite}} to the Italian auction grounds.|$|R
50|$|Umberto Bombana trained under Ezio Santin. He {{worked at}} Toscana at the Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong from 1993. He was a prime mover in {{introducing}} the <b>white</b> <b>truffle</b> to Hong Kong's restaurant scene and he introduced the World <b>White</b> <b>Truffle</b> <b>of</b> Alba Auction to Hong Kong. In 2006, Bombana {{was appointed by}} Piedmontese Regional Enoteca Cavour as their International <b>White</b> <b>Truffle</b> Ambassador.|$|R
50|$|It {{is famous}} for its wines, cheeses, and truffles—particularly the <b>white</b> <b>truffles</b> <b>of</b> Alba. The {{countryside}} {{as it was in the}} first half of the 20th century features prominently in the writings of Beppe Fenoglio and Cesare Pavese, who was born there, in Santo Stefano Belbo.|$|R
50|$|With a {{price of}} about 1,000 to 2,000 euros per kilogram, black {{truffles}} are the second most expensive <b>truffles</b> after <b>white</b> <b>truffles,</b> and one <b>of</b> the most sought after edible mushrooms in the world.|$|R
50|$|In cooking, black {{truffles}} {{are used}} to refine the taste of meat, fish, soups and risotto. Unlike <b>white</b> <b>truffles,</b> the aroma <b>of</b> black <b>truffles</b> does not diminish when they are heated, but becomes more intense.|$|R
60|$|But our {{author is}} not local merely. He {{has been in}} many lands; he has eaten back-hendl at Vienna and kulibatsch at St. Petersburg; he has {{had the courage to}} face the buffalo veal of Roumania and to dine with a German family at one o'clock; he has serious views on the right method of cooking those famous <b>white</b> <b>truffles</b> <b>of</b> Turin of which Alexandre Dumas was so fond; and, {{in the face of the}} Oriental Club, {{declares}} that Bombay curry is better than the curry of Bengal. In fact he seems to have had experience of almost every kind of meal except the 'square meal' of the Americans. This he should study at once; there is a great field for the philosophic epicure in the United States. Boston beans may be dismissed at once as delusions, but soft-shell crabs, terrapin, canvas-back ducks, blue fish and the pompono of New Orleans are all wonderful delicacies, particularly when one gets them at Delmonico's. Indeed, the two most remarkable bits of scenery in the States are undoubtedly Delmonico's and the Yosemite Valley; and the former place has done more to promote a good feeling between England and America than anything else has in this century.|$|R
50|$|Alba (Alba Pompeia) is a {{town and}} comune <b>of</b> <b>Piedmont,</b> Italy, in the {{province}} of Cuneo. It is considered the capital of the UNESCO Human Heritage hilly area of Langhe, and is famous for its <b>white</b> <b>truffle,</b> peach and wine production. The confectionery group Ferrero is based there.|$|R
50|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>truffle</b> {{species and}} {{varieties}} are differentiated {{based on their}} relative contents or absence of sulfides, ethers or alcohols, respectively. The sweaty-musky aroma <b>of</b> <b>truffles</b> {{is similar to that}} of the pheromone androstenol that also occurs in humans., the volatile profiles of seven black and six <b>white</b> <b>truffle</b> species have been studied.|$|R
40|$|The aroma profile <b>of</b> raw <b>truffles,</b> <b>of</b> <b>truffle</b> sauces, and <b>of</b> {{natural and}} {{artificial}} truffle flavored oils made from or made to imitate Tuber magnatum, Tuber melanosporum, and Tuber aestivum {{was characterized by}} solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS). Both naturally and artificiallymade oils were not only mainly dominated by bis(methylthio) methane (BMTM), a marker compound typical <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>truffle,</b> but also found {{in most of the}} oil samples flavored with black truffle. BMTM was not detected or detected in low amounts in black truffles but was very high in sauces (59. 74 – 77. 691...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} that were obtained on the geographic traceability <b>of</b> the <b>white</b> <b>truffle</b> Tuber magnatum Pico. Solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS) {{was employed to}} characterize the volatile profile <b>of</b> T. magnatum <b>white</b> <b>truffle</b> produced in seven geographical areas of Italy. The main components of the volatile fraction were identified using SPME-GC/MS. Significant differences {{in the proportion of}} volatile constituents from <b>truffles</b> <b>of</b> different geographical areas were detected. The results suggest that, besides genetic factors, environmental conditions influence the formation of volatile organic compounds. The mass spectra of the volatile fraction of the samples were used as fingerprints to characterize the geographical origin. Next, stepwise factorial discriminant analysis afforded a limited number of characteristic fragment ions that allowed a geographical classification <b>of</b> the <b>truffles</b> studied...|$|R

(2008); the protein <b>of</b> pale yellow <b>truffle</b> T. subglobosum (10.96 %) was higher than that <b>of</b> black <b>truffles</b> T. melanosporum (7.5 – 8.7 %). Saltarelli et al. (2008) evidenced <b>white</b> <b>truffle</b> T. magnatum from Italy are rich source of proteins (20.5 – 24 %). With regard to desert truffle, Sawaya et al. (1985) compared the compositional difference amongst three Saudi Arabian truffles including two black desert truffles Gibaah and Kholeissi (both are Terfezia claveryi according to Hussain and Al-Ruqaie 1999) and one <b>white</b> <b>truffle</b> Tirmania nivea (Zubaidi). They found these truffles’ protein contents ranged from 19.59 to 27.18 %, and the <b>white</b> <b>truffle</b> T. nivea had the highest protein content. These remind us that <b>white</b> <b>truffles</b> probably contain more protein.|$|R

40|$|Tuber magnatum, an ascomycetous fungus and obligate ectomycorrhizal symbiont, forms hypogeous fruit bodies, {{commonly}} called Italian <b>white</b> <b>truffles.</b> The diversity <b>of</b> bacterial communities associated with T. magnatum truffles was investigated using culture-independent and -dependent 16 S rRNA genebased approaches. Eighteen truffles were classified in three groups, representing {{different degrees of}} ascocarp maturation, based on the percentage of asci containing mature spores. The culturable bacterial fraction was 4. 17 (+/- 1. 61) x 10. 000. 000, 2. 60 (+/- 1. 22) x 10. 000. 000 and 1. 86 (+/- 1. 32) x 1. 000. 000 cfu g- 1 for immature, intermediate and mature ascocarps respectively. The total of bacteria count was two orders of magnitude higher than the cfu g- 1 count. Sequencing results from the clone library showed a significant presence of alpha-Proteobacteria (634 of the 771 total clones screened, c. 82 %) affiliated with Sinorhizobium, Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium spp. The bacterial culturable fraction was generally represented by gamma-Proteobacteria (210 of the 384 total strains isolated, c. 55 %), which were mostly fluorescent pseudomonads. Fluorescent in situ hybridization confirmed that alpha-Proteobacteria (85. 8 %) were the predominant components <b>of</b> <b>truffle</b> bacterial communities with beta-Proteobacteria (1. 5 %), gamma-Proteobacteria (1. 9 %), Bacteroidetes (2. 1 %), Firmicutes (2. 4 %) and Actinobacteria (3 %) only poorly represented.
