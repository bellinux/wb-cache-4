40|$|Commonly SMEs {{are owned}} and managed by a <b>working</b> <b>owner</b> who makes most of {{management}} decisions. Most of these SMEs {{do not have}} access to specialist staff with management expertise nor are they a part of large businesses or group of companies with managerial expertise. Most of SME owners commonly rely on building their management expertise through experience (Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment, 2012). An organisation’s culture and management practice usually ascend from beliefs, values and assumptions of the founder’s learning experience of group members as an organisation evolves. An organisation’s culture evolves from the founder’s own cultural identity, personality, self-confidence and determination (Schein, 1992). Conflict is inevitable in organisations Jehn, Rispens, Jonsen, and Greer (2013). The researcher perceives that cultural values, beliefs and attitudes influence SME owner’s conflict management style. Apart from cultural influence, the researcher intends to explore the impact of the process of acculturation (the cultural adaptation of foreigners) on conflict management in Chinese and Indian immigrant-owned SMEs in Auckland metropolitan. The approach would be to select Chinese and Indian immigrant SME owners residing in Auckland metropolitan region for over five years. The researcher will interview them to identify if acculturation (cultural adaptation) has influenced their conflict management style...|$|E
30|$|Based on the NSS {{survey of}} unorganized manufacturing, we {{construct}} three measures of informal sector employment: total state-industry employment, {{the total number}} of hired workers, and the total real wage bill. Total employment includes <b>working</b> <b>owners,</b> unpaid family workers, and hired workers, both full- and part-time. Hired workers exclude owners and contributing family workers, and the wage bill recorded in the data refers to the value of total compensation paid to hired workers only (deflated using state- and industry-specific wholesale price indices). We analyze hired workers and the wage bill in order {{to see whether or not}} expansion, if any, occurs chiefly through more family members and <b>working</b> <b>owners</b> being drawn into the informal sector, versus actual job creation in informal enterprises.|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{the last}} three columns in Table  6 show the {{distribution}} of the wage bill across modernity quartiles. Since family helpers and <b>working</b> <b>owners</b> typically do not receive a wage or salary, this distribution is similar to the distribution of hired workers. An even larger share is accounted for by the top quartiles, indicating that hired workers in more modern activities earn higher wages, which is not surprising given the higher capital-intensity of these activities. As is the case for hired workers, {{there is no sign of}} modernization when one considers the total wage bill.|$|R

30|$|However, {{some people}} feel {{that there are more}} urgent issues, our society is still facing a serious {{challenge}} resulting from e-waste. It may be true that governments have deferred plans to deal with this problem. When the computer stops <b>working,</b> <b>owners</b> either throws them out as wastes or keeps them at home. In both cases, there are serious dangers to public health. SEs are under pressures from customers, competitors, regulators, and society to implement GIT practices (Coffey et al. 2013). Hence, as a result, managers start thinking to evaluate the conditions for successful adoption and continued usage of GIT. GIT is an efficient resource consumption that utilizes IT infrastructure as well as deployment managerial, human practices, and organizational policies towards reducing the negative effect of IT (Molla et al. 2014). Numerous organizations have been recommended to have GIT on their agenda (Ardito and Morisio 2014), and fastened to their strategies (Hernandez and Ona 2016) to reach the full benefits of GIT.|$|R
