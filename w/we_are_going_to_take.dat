So we went forward with that Plan A in October, with the Plan B being, if [...] were to happen with Sony, how it would all shift. We've been thinking about [...] as long as we've been thinking about Phase Three." [...] It was said that Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, producers for the Amazing Spider-Man series, would serve as executive producers, and neither director Marc Webb nor actor Andrew Garfield would return for the new film. Sony was reportedly looking for an actor younger than Garfield to play Spider-Man, with Logan Lerman and Dylan O'Brien considered front-runners. In March 2015, Drew Goddard was being considered to write and direct the film, while O'Brien {{said he had not}} been approached for the role. Goddard, who was previously attached to Sony film based on the Sinister Six, later said he declined to work on the new film as he thought he [...] "didn't really have an idea" [...] for it, adding [...] "it's very hard to say, 'Ok, now write a new movie,'" [...] after spending a year working on the Sinister Six film and being in that mindset. The next month, while promoting , Feige said the character of Peter Parker would be around 15 to 16 years old in the film, which would not be an origin story, since [...] "there have been two retellings of that origin in the last [...] <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it for granted that people know that, and the specifics." [...] Parker's Uncle Ben is referenced in the film, but not by name. Later in April, Nat Wolff, Asa Butterfield, Tom Holland, Timothée Chalamet, and Liam James were under consideration by Sony and Marvel to play Spider-Man, with Holland and Butterfield the front-runners.|$|E
