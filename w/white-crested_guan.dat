50|$|The <b>white-crested</b> <b>guan</b> is {{endemic to}} Brazil. Its range {{is limited to}} the south-central and southeastern parts of the Amazon basin, {{although}} it just extends across the Rio Araguaia into the Cerrado ecoregion. Its habitat is tropical forest, mostly dense, solid-ground forest, but it sometimes also occurs in seasonally-flooded areas.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>white-crested</b> <b>guan</b> {{is a large}} {{bird and}} grows to a length of about 80 cm. It has a long crest of white {{feathers}} which gives it its name, bluish cheeks, black upper parts glossed with green, dark reddish-brown underparts and a long black tail. The voice is a raucous cackle, [...] "eh-uh" [...] or [...] "u u u u u".|$|E
5000|$|... 517 {{species of}} birds have been recorded, {{including}} two species of heron that are uncommon {{in other parts of}} the Amazon region, tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor) and yellow-crowned night heron (Nyctanassa violacea).Other birds include toucans (Ramphastos genus), red-throated piping guan (Pipile cujubi), <b>white-crested</b> <b>guan</b> (Penelope pileata), parrots, parakeets and many migrant birds from the Nearctic realm.Endangered birds include green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster), red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus) and yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis).|$|E
50|$|The {{greatest}} threat {{faced by the}} <b>white-crested</b> <b>guan</b> is destruction of its rainforest habitat. As increasing amounts of forest are cleared and converted into agricultural land and cattle ranches, suitable habitat is reduced. The bird is intolerant of this and populations are fragmenting and declining. It is also hunted for food and captured for the aviary trade, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has raised its conservation status to vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|Migratory {{birds that}} {{pass through the}} {{ecological}} station include osprey (Pandion haliaetus), spotted sandpiper (Actitis macularius), purple martin (Progne subis), sand martin (Riparia riparia) and barn swallow (Hirundo rustica).Endemic birds include <b>white-crested</b> <b>guan</b> (Penelope pileata), red-throated piping guan (Pipile cujubi), dark-winged trumpeter (Psophia viridis), blue-necked jacamar (Galbula cyanicollis), rufous-necked puffbird (Malacoptila rufa), red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus), Gould's toucanet (Selenidera gouldii), Sclater's antwren (Myrmotherula sclateri), band-tailed antbird (Hypocnemoides maculicauda), Amazonian antpitta (Hylopezus berlepschi) and Amazonian barred woodcreeper (Dendrocolaptes certhia).|$|E
50|$|Its closest living {{relatives}} are the Band-tailed Guan (Penelope argyrotis), Cauca Guan (Penelope perspicax), Dusky-legged Guan (Penelope obscura), <b>White-crested</b> <b>Guan</b> (Penelope pileata) and the White-browed Guan (Penelope jacucaca). All {{of these species}} {{can also be found}} in South America, ranging between Columbia and Brazil.It was previously considered a subspecies of the Andean Guan, but discovery of overlapping populations in western Colombia and southwest Ecuador wih no evidence for introgression has led to specific treatment more recently.The scientific name commemorates the United States naturalist James Orton.|$|E
5000|$|Temperatures {{range from}} 20 to 40 C.The park {{is in the}} Amazon biome and {{contains}} open submontane rainforest, dense submontane forest and cerrado fields.It has great scenic beauty with mountains, rivers and different types of vegetation.The park is in the interfluvial region between the Xingu and Tapajós rivers, so may well have endemic species.Birds include the threatened <b>white-crested</b> <b>guan</b> (Penelope pileata), hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) and chestnut-throated spinetail (Synallaxis cherriei) [...]Protected species in the park include the jaguar (Panthera onca) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis).|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-crested</b> <b>guan</b> (Penelope pileata) is {{a species}} of bird in the Cracidae family, the chachalacas, guans, and curassows. It is found only in regions of the eastern Amazon basin of Brazil. The species is {{restricted}} to the southern riverbank of the Amazon River; also eastwards, the south bank of the Pará River south of Marajó Island at the Amazon River's outlet. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is threatened by habitat destruction and in 2012, the species was recategorised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, its conservation status being raised to vulnerable.|$|E
