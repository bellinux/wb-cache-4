5|$|In June 1912, {{during one}} of his Friday prayer sermons, he called for volunteers to engage in a jihad against the Italians. Accepting only volunteers <b>with</b> <b>prior</b> Ottoman {{military}} training, al-Qassam enlisted dozens of volunteers and set up a fund for the expedition to Libya as well as a small pension for the families of volunteers while they were abroad. Although accounts vary, al-Qassam was accompanied by 60 to 250 volunteers known as mujahideen (those who engage in jihad) when he arrived in Alexandretta {{in the latter part of}} that year. Intending to gain sea transportation from the Ottomans, al-Qassam's request was rejected by the authorities who ordered him and his men back to Jableh. A new Ottoman government in Istanbul had gained power and shifted the state's focus to the Balkan front in October, abandoning the Libyan resistance. Part of the money that was raised was then used to establish a madrasa in Jableh while the remainder was saved for future efforts.|$|E

The Federation was inaugurated in 2439 following a coup deposing the last Terran Emperor Dramon Salaria in 2437 and was established to encourage commercial competition rather than full-scale wars between its constituent parties. The authority of the Federation is constantly challenged — in part by those who helped to create it, and the further away from the Federal center a person is, the less the Federation can influence their day-to-day lives. The seventh alien culture — the Mauna are not members of the Federation and it is revealed in the game that they are an untrustworthy and cruel species.

40|$|Abstract—We {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between a Minimum Description Length (MDL) estimator (posterior mode) and a Bayes estimator for exponential families. We show the following results concerning these estimators: a) Both the Bayes estimator <b>with</b> Jeffreys <b>prior</b> and the MDL estimator <b>with</b> the uniform <b>prior</b> <b>with</b> respect to the expectation parameter are nearly equivalent to a bias-corrected maximum-likelihood estimator with respect to the canonical parameter. b) Both the Bayes estimator <b>with</b> the uniform <b>prior</b> <b>with</b> respect to the canonical parameter and the MDL estimator <b>with</b> Jeffreys <b>prior</b> are nearly equivalent to the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), which is unbiased with respect to the expectation parameter. These results together suggest a striking symmetry between the two estimators, since the canonical and the expectation parameters of an exponential family form a dual pair {{from the point of view}} of information geometry. Moreover, a) implies that we can approximate a Bayes estimator <b>with</b> Jeffreys <b>prior</b> simply by deriving an appropriate MDL estimator or an appropriate bias-corrected MLE. This is important because a Bayes mixture density <b>with</b> Jeffreys <b>prior</b> is known to be maximin in universal coding [7].

5|$|The {{script for}} the {{production}} was written by Lloyd F. Lonergan, who employed the deus ex machina dramatic technique in {{the conclusion of the}} plot. In film, this is the sudden inheritance and parents finding their children in the theater. The two children, Orilla Smith and Yale Boss, were child actors <b>with</b> <b>prior</b> film experience and did not have any further known connection to the Thanhouser Company after the production. The cameraman, Blair Smith, used a camera rented by the Columbia Phonograph Company and had its inventor, Joseph Bianchi, assist in the camera's operation and use. The director of has both been credited to Barry O'Neil and Lloyd B. Carleton in numerous trade sources. Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser Company, but this film was not the Thanhouser Company's first subject. Instead, it was The Mad Hermit produced in autumn 1909 and shelved until August 9, 1910. The exact order of the productions is not known, but a work titled Aunt Nancy Telegraphs was filmed in December 1909 and never released. Certain parts of The Actor's Children were produced in the last week of February 1910.|$|E
5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only <b>with</b> <b>prior</b> anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Code {{design for}} the {{noncoherent}} MIMO Rayleigh fading channel is considered for constellations <b>with</b> unequal <b>prior</b> probabilities. The motivation for such constellations <b>with</b> unequal <b>priors</b> arises from recent information theoretic results at low Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Different distance measures like the Bhattacharya distance and J-divergence {{are related to the}} average pairwise error probability (APEP) and are employed to design single antenna codes of general dimension both for equal and unequal priors. For equal priors, such codes are observed to perform at least as well, and often better than codes designed based on the Kullback-Liebler (KL) distance in the low SNR regime. Substantial performance gains are observed for codes designed <b>with</b> unequal <b>prior</b> probabilities in the low SNR regime as compared to codes designed <b>with</b> equal <b>priors.</b> I...|$|R
