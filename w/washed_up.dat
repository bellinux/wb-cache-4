5|$|In his Natural History 9.4.9-11, Pliny the Elder {{describes}} numerous {{sightings of}} mermaids {{off the coast}} of Gaul, noting that their bodies were covered all over in scales and that their corpses frequently <b>washed</b> <b>up</b> on shore. He comments that the governor of Gaul even wrote a letter to Emperor Augustus to inform him.|$|E
5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, <b>washed</b> <b>up</b> on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also <b>washed</b> <b>up</b> on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, the low produced gale-force winds and dangerous surf near the coast from North Carolina through Georgia, and later {{along the coast of}} Florida. Significant swells were also reported in the Bahamas. The waves caused beach erosion and <b>washed</b> <b>up</b> against coastal houses along the southeast coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, {{guests at}} the new hotel watched the wreck and rescue efforts of the United States Life-Saving Service for the Norwegian bark Dictator. The ship's figurehead, which <b>washed</b> <b>up</b> on the beach several days later, was erected as a {{monument}} to the victims and rescuers. It stood along the oceanfront for more than 50 years. In the 21st century, it inspired the pair of matching Norwegian Lady Monuments, sculpted by Ørnulf Bast and installed in Virginia Beach and Moss, Norway.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species can}} roll {{themselves}} into a ball, a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members of the families Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land.

5|$|The fleet did {{not leave}} Spithead until 16 November, the {{departure}} having been delayed {{until late in the}} season. The delay proved disastrous: two days after departing, a westerly gale blew up, dispersing the fleet and driving the ships back to port. Several of the merchantmen were wrecked with heavy loss of life; over 200 bodies <b>washed</b> <b>up</b> on the coastline between Portland and Bridport.|$|E
5|$|Blue whale strandings are {{extremely}} uncommon, and, {{because of the}} species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of. When strandings do occur, they can {{become the focus of}} public interest. In 1920, a blue whale <b>washed</b> <b>up</b> near Bragar on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|By 1977, Greene was {{the captain}} of the Steelers defense, {{although}} his reduced effectiveness over the previous two seasons due to injuries led to rumors that he was <b>washed</b> <b>up.</b> He was never again able to attain the same success as a pass rusher after his pinched nerve in 1975. Spurred by the rumors, he returned in 1978 to lead all Pittsburgh linemen in tackles, and he had four sacks and a career-high five fumble recoveries. The Steelers defense allowed a league-low 195 points during the season, en route to a 35–31 victory over the Cowboys in Super Bowl XIII. In that contest, Greene had one of Pittsburgh's five sacks of Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach.|$|E

5|$|In about 1853 {{a further}} three {{settlers}} {{arrived on the}} American whaling barque Belle, captained by Ichabod Handy. As well as George Campbell (who died in 1856) and Jack Brian (who left the island in 1854), the third, Nathan Thompson, brought three women (called Botanga, Bogoroo, and a girl named Bogue) from the Gilbert Islands. When his first wife Botanga died he then married Bogue. Thompson was the first resident to build a substantial house in the 1860s from mainland cedar <b>washed</b> <b>up</b> on the beach. Most of the residents with island ancestors have blood relations or are connected by marriage to Thompson and his second wife Bogue.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{arrived on}} Surtsey soon after its formation, and were first {{detected}} in 1964. The original arrivals were flying insects, {{carried to the}} island by winds and their own power. Some were {{believed to have been}} blown across {{from as far away as}} mainland Europe. Later insect life arrived on floating driftwood, and both live animals and carcasses <b>washed</b> <b>up</b> on the island. When a large, grass-covered tussock was washed ashore in 1974, scientists took half of it for analysis and discovered 663 land invertebrates, mostly mites and springtails, the great majority of which had survived the crossing.|$|E

Rosa Lee, whose husband was killed in the Vietnam War, is raising her young son, Sonny (Allan Hubbard), on her own.

5|$|The abbey {{was founded}} by William de Roumare, Earl of Lincoln. On 25 June 1198 a colony of 12 monks led by Abbot Ralph arrived at the site from Revesby Abbey in Lincolnshire. The {{official}} name of the abbey was Vallis Florida, (Latin: 'Flowering Valley') but throughout its history it was generally known as Cleeve after the nearby village. The initial funding for the foundation was increased by land and money from the family of William de Mohun of Dunster, 1st Earl of Somerset and the Beckerolles family. In addition to various landholdings with produced rent for the abbey they held the Right of Wreck, which meant they could claim shipwrecks <b>washed</b> <b>up</b> {{on the shore of}} their lands.|$|E

5|$|Already {{considered}} <b>washed</b> <b>up,</b> the Giants {{intended to}} have Tittle share quarterback duties with 40-year-old Charlie Conerly, {{who had been}} with the team since 1948. The players at first remained loyal to Conerly, and treated Tittle with the cold shoulder. Tittle missed the season opener due to a back injury sustained before the season. His first game with New York came in week two, against the Steelers, in which he and Conerly each threw a touchdown pass in the Giants' 17–14 win. He became the team's primary starter {{for the remainder of the}} season and led the revitalized Giants to first place in the Eastern Conference. The Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) awarded Tittle its Jim Thorpe Trophy as the NFL's players' choice of MVP. In the 1961 NFL Championship Game, the Giants were soundly defeated by Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers, as they were shut-out 0–37. Tittle completed six of twenty passes in the game and threw four interceptions.|$|E
5|$|Blue whales may be wounded, {{sometimes}} fatally, after {{colliding with}} ocean vessels, {{as well as}} becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear. Ship strikes in particular have killed many blue whales in California. In September 2007, three dead blue whales <b>washed</b> <b>up</b> in southern California after being killed by ship strikes. Ship strikes are also a serious problem in Sri Lanka, and scientists believe this problem could be nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which {{makes it harder for}} them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Research on blue whales in the Southern California Bight has shown that mid-frequency sonar use interferes with foraging behavior, sometimes causing the whales to abandon their feeding. Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.|$|E
