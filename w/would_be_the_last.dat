5|$|Before the {{broadcasting}} for {{the season}} began, Duchovny sued Fox and eventually announced his decision to leave the show. As a result, the season <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> to feature Duchovny in a full-time capacity until Season 10, although he would return in seasons 8 and 9 as an intermittent main character. Due to this eventual character change, this season <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> to feature the original opening sequence for the series, as the two later years updated the intro {{in an attempt to}} renew and revive the series.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{announced}} that Windows Server 2008 R2 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> version of Windows Server {{to support the}} Itanium (support started with XP), {{and that it would}} also discontinue development of the Itanium versions of Visual Studio and SQL Server.|$|E
5|$|That <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> race on {{the upper}} Fraser River, because that August would bring the onset of World War I and the halting of {{construction}} of the Pacific Great Eastern.|$|E
50|$|Again, it was {{announced}} that this season <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> show's <b>last.</b>|$|R
50|$|NBA Jam <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> Jam game {{released}} until Electronic Arts {{revived the}} franchise with its 2010 NBA Jam game.|$|R
2500|$|On November 20, 2009, Winfrey {{announced}} that <b>the</b> 25th season <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> show's <b>last.</b> She {{said during the}} live Friday episode: ...|$|R
5|$|These <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> Winter Games {{for twelve}} years, as the planned 1940 Games and 1944 Games were {{cancelled}} due to World War II.|$|E
5|$|This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{time that}} Anthony {{worked with the}} RMM label. After {{disputes}} with Ralph Mercado over business practices, he left the record label and later signed on with Columbia Records to record his first self titled English album.|$|E
5|$|At the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway, {{the gold}} medal was won by Canada's team for the second {{consecutive}} Games.

A team from Finland competed for the first time.|$|E
50|$|Akvaario and Shine <b>would</b> {{ultimately}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> albums by <b>the</b> band {{to feature}} guitarist Jenny Julia, {{who left the}} band in late October 2014.|$|R
25|$|This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> final {{playoff game}} that Cowboys' coach Tom Landry would ever win in his career. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Cowboys <b>last</b> playoff victory until 1991.|$|R
50|$|Album <b>was</b> {{influenced}} by <b>the</b> contemporary R&B sound of new jack swing and hip-hop styles. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> group's <b>last</b> album {{for over a}} decade.|$|R
5|$|Athletes from 30 nations competed at the 1960 Games. South Africa competed at the Winter Games for {{the first}} time; it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> for many years, as {{apartheid}} policies prevented South African participation until 1994. Athletes from West Germany (FRG) and East Germany (GDR) competed together as the United Team of Germany from 1956 to 1964. The number {{at the end of}} each country denotes the number of athletes each country sent.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company took {{delivery}} of two more new ships – the President Warfield and the Yorktown. The President Warfield, built by Pusey and Jones Corp. in Wilmington, Delaware, {{was named for}} the Old Bay Line's president of the time, S. Davies Warfield. She <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> new ship built for the Old Bay Line.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 2013, Miliband {{reshuffle}}d his Shadow Cabinet for {{the third}} time, saying that this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> reshuffle before the general election. In a move similar to his 2011 reshuffle, several MPs from the 2010 intake were promoted, while more long-serving MPs were moved. Tristram Hunt and Rachel Reeves received promotions, while Liam Byrne and Stephen Twigg were among those demoted.|$|E
50|$|If Emperor Keitai began a new dynasty as {{some historians}} believe, then Emperor Buretsu <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> monarch of <b>the</b> first {{recorded}} dynasty of Japan.|$|R
50|$|The Celtics {{defeated}} the Rockets four games to two {{to win their}} 16th NBA championship. <b>The</b> championship <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Celtics' <b>last</b> until 2008. Larry Bird <b>was</b> named <b>the</b> Finals MVP.|$|R
50|$|The Flames {{captured}} {{their second}} consecutive Pacific Division title, earning the second {{seed in the}} playoffs. <b>The</b> division championship <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Flames <b>last</b> until they won the Northwest Division in 2005-06.|$|R
5|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that Labyrinth had {{a budget of}} $25 million. The film was a box office disappointment, grossing $12.9 million during its U.S. theatrical run. The commercial failure demoralized Henson {{to the extent that}} his son Brian remembered the time of the film's release {{as one of the most}} difficult periods of his father's career. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> feature film directed by Henson before his death in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} day, Booth was in {{the crowd}} outside the White House when Lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window. Lincoln stated {{that he was in}} favor of granting suffrage to the former slaves, and Booth declared that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> speech that Lincoln would ever make.|$|E
5|$|A second tournament, the Cromwell Cup {{was played}} a year later. This {{time it was}} only open to teams under two years old. Out of the four teams that competed The Wednesday emerged victorious. The final was a goalless draw after 90minutes so the teams played on until a goal was scored. This was the first {{instance}} where a match involved extra time. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> tournament to be played in Sheffield for nine years until {{the formation of the}} Sheffield Football Association Challenge Cup in 1876.|$|E
50|$|The Explosion {{earned an}} 8-2 record during the 2014 {{regular season and}} won their second {{consecutive}} CIFL championship. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> league's <b>last</b> championship; <b>the</b> CIFL dissolved after the 2014 season. The Explosion will continue.|$|R
25|$|The Federation of <b>the</b> West Indies <b>was</b> not <b>the</b> {{first attempt}} at a British Caribbean {{federation}} (nor <b>would</b> it <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last).</b> <b>The</b> history of the previous attempts at federations and unions, in part, explains {{the failure of the}} 1958 Federation.|$|R
25|$|On May 18, 2011, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus {{announced}} that <b>the</b> Navy <b>would</b> <b>be</b> naming <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of 14 Lewis and Clark-class cargo ships after Cesar Chavez. The USNS Cesar Chavez was launched on May 5, 2012.|$|R
5|$|Although Saxo Bank had {{previously}} announced that 2010 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year they would sponsor the team along with SunGard as secondary sponsor. The 2011 {{name for the}} team was announced in August 2010 as Team Saxo Bank-SunGard, and the signing of 2 time Tour de France champion Alberto Contador on a two-year contract was also revealed. On 29 July 2010, Andy Schleck and his brother Fränk announced their departure from the team effective {{from the start of}} the 2011 season.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the {{referendum}} on 29 April was categorically rejected with 802,512 votes (42.4%) for abolition and 1,089,193 votes (57.5%) against. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> attempt {{to abolish the}} council and, as {{the first time the}} NSW Labor party had lost a state poll in many years, was widely seen as {{the beginning of the end}} for the Labor government, which had been in power since 1941. Heffron's supporter Dougherty resigned from the council a month later in protest of the result.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{second year}} as coach {{was the best}} in Stanford rugby history: the team was undefeated {{entering}} the Big Game at California, who was also undefeated. A record crowd of 26,000 turned out to see Stanford defeat the Bears, 26–8. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> Big Game for several years as California returned to football for the 1915 season. Despite Stanford's success in rugby, the previous year's humiliating defeats to the All Blacks and the switch by rivals USC and California to football intensified the sentiment for Stanford to switch back as well.|$|E
50|$|David Pearson {{managed to}} defeat Richard Petty {{by at least}} one lap; {{clinching}} his first NASCAR championship in the process. This <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> race until <b>the</b> 1981 Riverside opener that Richard Petty ran a number other than 43.|$|R
25|$|Graham {{finished}} {{the game with}} four receptions for 108 yards and a touchdown, along with a 3-yard run. Lee caught 11 passes for 159 yards and a score. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Bears <b>last</b> playoff win until the 2006 season.|$|R
50|$|Berger's <b>last</b> win <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> for Benetton, just as Berger's {{first win}} had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> team's first. It was also Benetton's only win as an Italian constructor. As of 2016, this <b>is</b> also <b>the</b> <b>last</b> race won by an Austrian driver.|$|R
5|$|During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones {{and center}} Elden Campbell were {{traded to the}} Charlotte Hornets. The team also {{acquired}} J. R. Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice. Head coach Del Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis. The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference. The Lakers defeated Houston {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> game ever played at the Great Western Forum.|$|E
5|$|For {{its fifth}} album, Pearl Jam again worked with {{producer}} Brendan O'Brien, whom the band {{had worked with}} on its previous three records. Yield was recorded throughout 1997 in Seattle, Washington at Studio X and Studio Litho, the latter of {{which is owned by}} guitarist Stone Gossard. The album was then mixed by O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. The album <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> collaboration with O'Brien for several years. They would not work with the producer again until he was brought on board in 2008 to remix their debut album Ten and to produce 2009's Backspacer.|$|E
5|$|For the Papuan Campaign, MacArthur awarded Blamey the American Distinguished Service Cross, and Blamey {{was created}} a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire on 28 May 1943. This was unusual {{as it was}} the Australian Labor Party's policy not to award knighthoods, but was done as a {{response}} to the British government's awards to British and American officers for the North African campaign. Blamey's and Herring's knighthoods <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> that the Labor government would award to Australian soldiers.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 it <b>was</b> {{announced}} that <b>the</b> base <b>would</b> <b>be</b> closed. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> aircraft departed in July 2011 {{and the air}} base definitivetely closed in June 2012. In 2014, the air-base hosted the annual May teknival, but it is otherwise derelict.|$|R
2500|$|Administrators {{confirmed}} on 28 August 2013 that [...] "they {{had received}} no offers {{for the business}} on a going concern basis", and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> closing <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 18 stores by mid-September 2013, {{with the loss of}} the remaining 126 jobs.|$|R
50|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on July 20, 2016. It was {{announced}} on July 23, 2016, that season 8 of <b>The</b> Vampire Diaries <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> series' <b>last.</b> <b>The</b> season would contain 16 episodes. Filming {{for the season}} ended on February 8, 2017.|$|R
