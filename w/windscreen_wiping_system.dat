40|$|A {{computer}} visualisation application {{has been}} presented for fuzzy evaluation of windscreen wiper systems which must satisfy several requirements. Some requirements are modelled by fuzzy sets and a compensating arithmetic mean is utilised for computing an overall performance. A computer animation of wiper mechanism motion and rainfall is shown, which enables to experts, drivers and passengers to evaluate the degree of satisfaction and correctness of judgements. This fuzzy evaluation approach is illustrated by considering five “subjective” requirements (driver and passenger visibility, wiped surface, visibility and trouble sensations), and for three design alternatives (traditional single and double <b>wiped</b> <b>systems</b> and variable course system) the results are show...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{environmental}} concerns and competition {{within the industry}} there is an imminent need by paper manufacturers to asses the paper consumption depending {{on the quality of}} the tissue paper. For this purpose, the consumption of tissue paper from a tissue vending machine needs to be monitored and calculated. A Hall Effect Sensor coupled with a Passive Infrared Sensor was used to monitor the flow of paper per Person. MATLAB is used as the programming language to read the signals from the sensors. The consumption obtained would be used to obtain better, less bulky design models. As well deduce an optimum paper dimensions to get reduce the paper consumption.

40|$|BackgroundDocumenting {{effective}} {{approaches to}} eliminate environmental reservoirs {{and reduce the}} spread of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) has been difficult. This was a prospective study to determine if hospital-wide implementation of a disinfectant cleaner in a disposable <b>wipe</b> <b>system</b> to replace a cleaner alone could reduce HAIs over 1  year when housekeeping compliance was ≥ 80 %. MethodsIn this interrupted time series study, a ready-to-use accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant cleaner in a disposable <b>wipe</b> container <b>system</b> (DCW) was used once per day for all high-touch surfaces in patient care rooms (including isolation rooms) to replace a cleaner only. The HAI rates for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and Clostridium difficile were stratified by housekeeping cleaning compliance (assessed using ultraviolet-visible marker monitoring). ResultsWhen cleaning compliance was ≥ 80 %, {{there was a significant}} reduction in cases/ 10, 000 patient days for MRSA (P = . 0071), VRE (P < . 0001), and C difficile (P = . 0005). For any cleaning compliance level there was still a significant reduction in the cases/ 10, 000 patient days for VRE (P = . 0358). ConclusionOur study data showed that daily use of the DCW applied to patient care high-touch environmental surfaces with a minimum of 80 % cleaning compliance was superior to a cleaner alone because it resulted in significantly reduced rates of HAIs caused by C difficile, MRSA, and VRE...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contains}} the theoretical development and predicted results for both analytical and computational models of a combined liquid and gas jet <b>wiping</b> <b>system</b> designed to remove cooling liquid {{from the surface}} of a continuous moving strip. An analytical approach was used to determine the average cooling liquid height on the moving strip upstream of the jetting assembly. A momentum balance was applied to determine if the combined liquid and gas jet momentum were sufficient to prevent the cooling liquid from traveling downstream with the strip. CFD modelling of the jetting system was successfully developed based on the VOF technique. It was found that when no gas jet was applied a thin film of liquid remained, where the thickness of the film was most strongly influenced by the liquid jet incident angle. When the gas jet was applied the liquid film was removed in all cases...|$|R

25|$|This period saw Land Rover {{market the}} utility Land Rover {{as a private}} {{recreational}} vehicle. While the basic pick-up, 4x4 and van versions were still working vehicles, the County 4x4s were sold as multi-purpose family vehicles, featuring improved interior trim and more comfortable seats. This change was reflected in Land Rover starting what had long been common practice in the car industry— detail changes and improvements to the County model {{from year to year}} in order to attract new buyers and to encourage existing owners to trade in for a new vehicle. These changes included different exterior styling graphics and colour options, and the introduction of new options, such as radio-cassette players, Rostyle wheels, headlamp wash and <b>wipe</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as accessories such as surfboard carriers and bike racks. The switch from leaf spring to coil spring suspension was {{a key part of the}} new model's success. It offered improved off-road ability, load capacity, handling, and ride comfort.|$|R

40|$|The Rapid Manufacturing process 'Laser Sintering' is {{a powder}} {{metallurgical}} process. The process principle {{is based on}} a local consolidation, e. g. melting or sintering, of powdered materials {{as a result of the}} absorption of laser radiation. For this purpose a powder layer is applied onto a build up plate through a <b>wiping</b> <b>system.</b> A laser beam consolidates defined areas, being directed over the material by a scanner device. Through the cyclic repetition of material application, consolidation and the lowering of the build up plate, a three dimensional geometry develops. The authors present investigations on the manufacture of hybrid tools made of tool steel and tungsten carbide-cobalt. The aim of the research activities is to manufacture a base body of a tool using a tool steel powder. Tool's components with internal geometries, cavities or undercuts can be manufactured with a high build up rate by a Rapid Manufacturing process using a tool steel powder. After changing the powder the process can be continued to manufacture defined tool's geometrical elements using a WC-Co powder. The resulting hybrid tools feature a high complexity level and a high resistance against wear in defined areas...|$|R

5000|$|Another wiper design (Fig. 6) is pantograph-based, used on many {{commercial}} vehicles, especially buses {{with large}} windscreens. Pantograph wipers feature two arms for each blade, with the blade assembly itself supported on a horizontal bar connecting the two arms. One {{of the arms}} {{is attached to the}} motor, while the other is on an idle pivot. The pantograph mechanism, while being more complex, allows the blade to cover more of the <b>windscreen</b> on each <b>wipe.</b> However, it also usually requires the wiper to be [...] "parked" [...] {{in the middle of the}} windscreen, where it may partially obstruct the driver's view when not in use. A few models of automobile sometimes employ a pantograph arm on the driver's side and a normal arm for the passenger. Triumph cars, Lexus and several US makes employ this method to cover more glass area where the windscreen is quite wide but also very shallow. The reduced height of the windscreen would need the use of short wiper arms which would not have the reach to the edge of the windscreen.|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method to}} restore a compromised <b>system</b> is to <b>wipe</b> the <b>system</b> clean, install from known good media, and patch with the latest updates: a costly, restrictive, and inefficient method. An alternative method is to monitor the host and restore trust if a compromise occurs. When this method is automated, the system {{is said to be}} self-healing. One critical requirement of a self-healing system is that the self-healing mechanism itself must not be compromised. Our solution to this requirement is a Trusted Immutable Kernel Extension (TIKE) by way of a virtual machine. Using a host operating system as a trusted platform, we discuss a self-healing system that uses existing intrusion detection systems and corresponding self-healing mechanisms to automatically heal the guest operating system once a compromise has occurred...|$|R

40|$|A no-risk {{approach}} for developing an Improved Waste Collection Subsystem (WCS) for the shuttle orbiter is described. The GE Improved WCS Concept {{builds on the}} experience of 14 Shuttle missions with over 400 man-days of service. This concept employs the methods of the existing flight-proven mature design, augmenting them to eliminate foreseen difficulties and to fully comply with the design requirements. The GE Improved WCS Concept includes separate storage for used wipes. Compaction of the wipes provides a solution to the capacity problem, fully satisfying the 210 man-day storage requirement. The added feature of in-flight serviceable storage space for the wipes creates a variable capacity feature which affords redundancy in the event of <b>wipes</b> compaction <b>system</b> failure. Addition of features permitting in-flight servicing of the feces storage tank creates a variable capacity WCS with easier post-flight servicing to support rapid turnaround of the Shuttle orbiter. When these features are combined with a vacuum pump to evacuate wipes and fecal storage tanks through replaceable odor/bacteria filters to the cabin, the GE Improved WCS satisfies the known requirements for Space Station use, including no venting to space...|$|R
