5|$|When asked <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not {{immediately}} inform the police of Lucan's presence, Susan Maxwell-Scott {{said she had}} not seen any newspapers or television news, or listened to any radio broadcasts that might have warned her of the importance of his visit. Meanwhile, Lucan's children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, where they would remain for several weeks. On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed that the children could return to live with her.

5|$|Eventually, an {{accounting}} teacher arrives, believing demonstrations {{are being held}} to determine which class will be cut, much to the anger of Ron. He gives a very boring accounting lecture, which puts Justin to sleep. The next day, Leslie is before the Pawnee Disciplinary Committee on charges of abuse of power. Leslie calls Justin as a witness and questions him {{as to whether he}} enjoyed the party, to which he answers an emphatic yes. Afterward, the committee rules no further action will be taken, mainly because Leslie turned herself in and paid $1,000 restitution to the recreation center so no classes would be cut. When Ann asks <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> it, Leslie said it was to get an honest answer from Justin about the date, under penalty of perjury. The episode ends with Justin encouraging Tom to ask Wendy out.|$|E

5|$|Later at the Warsaw Tavern, Drew {{is hanging}} out with his friends when Mimi walks in and confronts him. Drew talks to her {{honestly}} about <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not get the job, telling her that her attitude is the problem {{and she has to}} {{deal with the fact that}} her looks might stop her from getting some jobs. Mimi does not like Drew's advice and leaves the bar.

5|$|When Susan {{suspects}} that Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan) {{might have an}} eating disorder, she raises the issue with Imogen's mother, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), who dismisses her suspicions. Susan reopens the PirateNet radio station for the students, after Jack Lassiter (Alan Hopgood) donates money to the school.

25|$|When {{questioned}} over <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not {{step up to}} do Renaissance's pitches, Claire {{answered that}} she would have been happy to have done so at the start, but felt she was set up as a scapegoat after Kevin was initially dead set on doing so, but asked her later on in the task to take over. Sir Alan doubted any pitch of hers could have been worse than Kevin's, after noting that the theme had doomed the team, but advised her to step up if a similar situation arose again.|$|E
25|$|In 693, after Wu Zetian's trusted lady-in-waiting Wei Tuan'er (韋團兒), {{who hated}} Li Dan (the reason <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> so is lost to history), falsely accused Li Dan's wife Crown Princess Liu and Consort Dou of using witchcraft, Wu Zetian had Crown Princess Liu and Consort Dou killed. Li Dan, fearful {{that he was}} to be next, did not dare to speak of them. When Wei further planned to falsely accuse Li Dan, however, someone else {{informed}} on her, and she was executed. Wu Zetian nevertheless had Li Dan's sons demoted in their princely titles, and when the officials Pei Feigong (裴匪躬) and Fan Yunxian (范雲仙) were accused of secretly meeting Li Dan, she executed Pei and Fan and further, barred officials from meeting Li Dan. There were then accusations that Li Dan was plotting treason, and under Wu Zetian's direction, Lai launched an investigation. Lai arrested Li Dan's servants and tortured them—and the torture was such that many of them were ready to falsely implicate themselves and Li Dan. One of Li Dan's servants, An Jincang, however, proclaimed Li Dan's innocence and cut his own belly open to swear to that fact. When Wu Zetian heard of what An did, she had doctors attend to An and barely save his life, and then ordered Lai to end the investigation, thus saving Li Dan.|$|E
25|$|Assembling the {{suspects}} together along with Carla, Poirot makes his denouement about the murder. Although Phillip's hostility to Caroline {{was due to}} her rejection of his love for her, and Meredith's sympathy was due to his weariness for his long affection for her, leading him to form an attachment to Elsa that was unreciprocated, both brothers' emotions were merely red herrings. In putting together the case, he reveals that Caroline had been innocent, but did not defend herself in court, because she believed that Angela had committed the murder; the evidence Poirot had uncovered showed that her younger sister had been angry with Amyas and had put salt in his glass as a prank. She {{had the opportunity to}} steal the poison from Meredith {{on the morning of the}} crime, and was seen fiddling with the bottle of beer that Caroline would take down to him. However, Caroline did not wish her sister to be charged for the crime, having felt a deep guilt for injuring her sister in a fit of jealous rage many years ago, which had left Angela blinded in one eye and with a permanent scar on the left side of her face. Therefore, she took steps to take the blame for her crime in order to earn redemption, which explained <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not claim she was innocent in the letter she sent Angela but believed Angela knew Caroline was. However, Poirot reveals that Caroline's actions had actually proved her innocence, as she had wiped the fingerprints off the bottle because she believed that the poison had been put in it rather than in the glass, and that she would have no need to remove her own--thus, she was removing those of a third party. Furthermore, he reveals that Angela was not the killer, as she had been at Meredith's lab in order to steal valerian from him in preparation for playing another prank on Amyas, but never carried out the act because of the murder, deducing this from the way that she spoke of the theft in the future tense to Poirot.|$|E

500|$|One {{morning in}} 1914, Hogg {{was awakened by}} a burglar in her bedroom. She confronted the man, who was {{attempting}} to steal her jewelry, and not only convinced him to return the jewelry, but [...] "wrote down a name and address, {{handed it to him}} and told him to go there that very day to get a job". When asked <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> that, Hogg responded, [...] "He didn't look like a bad man." [...] Later that year, she sailed to Germany, alone. While she was en route, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated, and the day before she arrived, Britain declared war on Germany. The United States was still neutral, however, so Hogg continued her tour of Europe, not leaving until several months later.|$|E
500|$|Amos Barshad from New York {{declared}} that the song reminded him of being drunk and dancing in a remote discothèque in Berlin. NMEs Dan Martin was {{of the opinion that}} [...] "Judas" [...] was the song that Gaga should have come back with. But he understood <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not choose it as the lead single from Born This Way, {{given the fact that the}} song was characteristic of Gaga's music. Pointing the same thing, Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone wrote that the song played to Gaga's established musical sensibilities. He added that although [...] "Judas" [...] certainly had its own charms and [...] "at least three insanely catchy hooks it leans hard on Gaga's signature moves." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice summarized the song as a twin of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] describing its [...] "instantly memorable wordless vocalizing, a pummeling beat, lyrics about a romance that is, well, bad." [...] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey gave the song five out of five stars, commending the [...] "blasphemously camp" [...] chorus and comparing it to be worthy of Eurovision – [...] "a Scooch-meets-Lordi affair that, unsurprisingly, takes a few listens to get your head around." [...] Mark Lepage from The Gazette praised the song and understood that as Gaga's music has progressed, so has her themes and inspirations, indicated by the conflicted relationship she has with the character Judas in the song. Rick Fulton, while writing in the Daily Record, compared it to [...] "'Like a Prayer' on steroids" [...] and gave it three out of five points. NME called the song [...] "Gaga's worst single so far".|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with Billboard, Carey {{revealed}} that she wrote [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] while her husband, Nick Cannon, was hospitalized receiving medical treatment for mild kidney failure, saying [...] "There's a lot of things you can take from there that can keep you going in a tough situation." [...] Carey also added that the song was written around the time her friend, singer Whitney Houston, had died. [...] "'We were actually in the hospital together when we saw it on TV.' It was important for me to write something that would...help me get through the moment. That’s where ‘Stay triumphant, keep on living’ came from." [...] Carey also expressed why she chosen Ross and Mill, or any hip-hop artist in general on the track, claiming that they are [...] "different" [...] and how she is always experimenting on collaborations with varying and new artists. When asked why she chose not to release a lead single which was dance influenced, Carey explained how she felt regarding the current music scene; [...] "I think it would be incredible if we could bring back the days when R records didn't have to cross over but be massive hits on their own," [...] and that was the reason <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not want to conform to what is currently on trend. Additionally, she felt that [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)", potentially, would be able to generate cross-appeal, and not only cater Mainstream Top 40. With specific emphasis on the dance music scene and its popularity, Carey stated that while she was pregnant, the vast majority of music that was being released was dance and electronic music, saying [...] "I was pregnant forever, and I was being tortured day and night by techno music. I was complaining to everyone who was listening. One time I made dinner for L.A. Reid, and we were both sitting there like 'What happened?

2500|$|In another interview, Fisher {{revealed}} {{that she used}} cocaine during the filming of The Empire Strikes Back.

2500|$|In the mid-1980s, Summer was {{embroiled in}} a controversy. She {{allegedly}} had made anti-gay remarks regarding the then-relatively new disease, AIDS. Summer, by this time a born-again Christian, was alleged to have said that AIDS was a punishment from God for the immoral lifestyles of homosexuals. Because of this alleged statement, thousands of her records were returned to her record company and she became {{the target of a}} boycott which hurt her career. Some years later, Summer publicly denied that she had ever made any such comment, and {{in a letter to the}} AIDS campaign group ACT UP in 1989 said it was [...] "a terrible misunderstanding." [...] In explaining <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not respond to ACT UP sooner, Summer stated [...] "I was unknowingly protected by those around me from the bad press and hate letters.

In the house, investigators found a trail of blood with scattered teeth. On the dining room table was Mrs. Starks' work for making a dress. Gonzaullas, after seeing the [...] "virtual river of blood", stated that [...] "It is beyond me <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not bleed to death."
