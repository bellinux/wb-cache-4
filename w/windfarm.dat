5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 11.5 GW of onshore wind potential exists, enough to provide 45 TWh of energy. More than double this amount exists on offshore sites where mean wind speeds are greater than on land. The total offshore potential {{is estimated}} at 25 GW, which although more expensive to install, could be enough to provide almost half the total energy used in Scotland. Plans to harness up to 4.8 GW of the potential in the inner Moray Firth and Firth of Forth were announced in January 2010. Moray Offshore Renewables and SeaGreen Wind Energy were awarded development contracts by the Crown Estate {{as part of a}} UK-wide initiative. Also in 2010, discussions were held between the Scottish Government and Statoil of Norway with a view to developing a 5-turbine floating <b>windfarm,</b> possibly to be located off Fraserburgh. In July 2016, RSPB challenged development in the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. There is a wealth of literature exploring attitudes towards <b>windfarms</b> and the various debates surrounding them. However, for the most part, this literature has focused on responses to proposed sites, rather than exploring the long-term impacts of <b>windfarms</b> on local residents. This paper presents the findings from qualitative research in three English villages, which investigated how existing local <b>windfarms</b> are perceived and experienced by local residents, and how such new structures are incorporated into conceptualisations of rural place over time. The results show that, whilst concerns remain in some instances, the <b>windfarms</b> have (perhaps surprisingly) become a familiar and unremarkable – or even valued - {{part of the landscape}} for many people. Here, the varied interpretations of existing <b>windfarms,</b> and the place-based processes underlying them, are discussed with particular reference to rural identities and local contexts. The potential implications of the findings for managing future rural change are also considered...|$|R
25|$|RES {{initially}} {{put forward}} proposals for a <b>windfarm</b> at Den Brook in 2004, {{and in response}} the Den Brook Valley Action Group was established to oppose the plan. A key concern was {{the potential impact of}} noise on local residents. In 2006, West Devon Borough Council refused planning permission for the scheme, but RES appealed, and consent was granted in early 2007 following a public inquiry. Still concerned about noise issues, local residents the formed Den Brook Judicial Review Group which pursued a judicial appeal. This resulted in the inquiry decision being overturned, and a second public inquiry was held in October 2009, following which permission was once more granted, subject to a number of planning conditions. A second legal challenge was rejected in August 2010. In 2011, the <b>windfarm</b> {{was the subject of a}} television documentary series, <b>Windfarm</b> Wars, broadcast by BBC Two, which followed the history of the project.|$|E

50|$|By 1985, the Altamont Pass {{was crowded}} with over 26 {{different}} <b>windfarms.</b> The increased visibility from the nearby I-580 freeway, which had once sparked the media and community's interest, was now widely regarded as a growing eyesore. Successful <b>windfarms</b> at the Altamont Pass encouraged the development of further industrial wind areas in southern California. These <b>windfarms,</b> in the Tehachapi Pass, led to wider recognition, after windmills played a role as a prominent backdrop in several feature films of the mid- and late 1980s including a 1985 film based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel Less Than Zero, featuring Andrew McCarthy and Robert Downey, Jr.|$|R
50|$|Among Ulrichstein's {{claims to}} fame are its many <b>windfarms.</b> Ulrichstein {{was the first}} {{municipality}} in Middle Hesse {{to recognize that there}} was money to be earned from wind generators, and so the council invested heavily in this technology. Owing to the town's location in the High Vogelsberg with its ridges exposed to the wind, there are, of course, ideal conditions for <b>windfarms.</b>|$|R

Wind energy has reduced the yearly CO2 output by about 7 000 t. The community, however, does not wish for any further <b>windfarms.</b>|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from two}} small 1920s hydro {{electric}} schemes, Te Uku was without electricity until 27 September 1935, after {{which there was}} a formal switching on ceremony.

25|$|Most {{turbines}} in the European Union produce electricity at {{an average}} of 25% of their rated maximum power due to the variability of wind resources, but Scotland's wind regime provides average capacity factor of 31% or higher on the west and northern coasts. The load factor recorded for the onshore North Rhins <b>windfarm</b> near Stranraer was 40%, which is typical for well-sited mainland windfarms. A small wind farm on Shetland with five Vestas V47 660kW turbines recently achieved a world record of 58% capacity {{over the course of a}} year. This record is claimed by Burradale <b>windfarm,</b> located just outside Lerwick and operated by Shetland Aerogenerators Ltd. Since opening in 2000, the turbines at this wind farm have had an average capacity factor of 52% and, according to this report, in 2005 averaged a world record 57.9%. However, a Scottish opposition group found 124 separate occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell to less than 2% of installed capacity. On the west and northern coasts Scotland's wind regime can provide an average of 40% or higher.|$|E
25|$|However, {{concerns}} over inappropriate siting of turbines has been voiced by groups in Fife, in particular, where {{the number of}} planning applications for turbines has risen sharply.

In 2011/2 the company developed a prototype 6MW permanent magnet gearless generator for offshore applications, in association with LM Wind Power and Converteam.|$|E
25|$|In March 2007, the Den Brook Judicial Review Group (DBJRG) {{was formed}} by local residents. Headed by Mike Hulme, whose {{property}} {{was one of the}} closest dwellings to the proposed site, the group came together over concerns regarding the potential for noise pollution from the turbines. A key concern was the potential for sleep disturbance due to a phenomenon known as amplitude modulation. This form of noise, which has been reported at a small number of <b>windfarm</b> sites, is poorly understood.|$|E
25|$|The BBC {{commissioned}} {{a documentary on}} the development of Den Brook Wind Farm shortly after the inception of the project. Including face-to-face interviews with a number individuals concerned with the <b>windfarm,</b> it focused primarily on Rachel Ruffle, project manager for RES, and Mike Hulme, local resident and member of DBJRG. Initially conceived as a single film, it developed into a series as the planning process became more and more protracted. The timescale also consumed most of the programme budget, with producer Jeremy Gibson eventually completing the films as a solo project. The series was first broadcast in May and June 2011.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish Government set {{a target}} of 40% of Scotland's {{electricity}} generation be derived from renewable sources by 2020.

The Blackstairs Mountains, whose main peak, Mount Leinster, is distinguished by the television mast on its summit, begin to dominate the horizon. The trail meanders along forestry tracks around Moylisha and Urelands Hills. Urelands Hill is littered with hornblende-rich schist, a legacy of a chain of long-extinct volcanic islands that existed 450–500 million years ago when this part of Ireland lay under the primeval Iapetus Ocean. Joining the road for the final stretch into Clonegal, the Way leaves County Wicklow and enters County Carlow at Wicklow Bridge, about [...] from the end.
