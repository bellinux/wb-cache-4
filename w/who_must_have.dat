5|$|The NRO is a {{non-profit}} organization supported by private and corporate sponsorships as well as grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. Each year the orchestra's 88 members, who all attend on fellowships, are chosen from auditions by approximately 900 young musicians {{between the ages of}} 18 and 29 <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> completed at least one year of college, university, or conservatory. The program lasts eight weeks during which the members learn and perform an entire season's orchestral repertoire. The orchestra gives two full orchestral concerts a week at the Riverwalk Center in Breckenridge and performs at events and concerts in various other towns in Colorado. The NRO musicians also attend masterclasses with visiting musicians, participate in the orchestra's education and community outreach programs, and take career development classes which include mock auditions, contract negotiations, finance for musicians, and training in music therapy.|$|E

25|$|It {{would appear}} that Gregory Cromwell, and John More, the son of Thomas More, have been wrongly assumed to have been unintelligent, simply because they {{happened}} to be overshadowed by their extraordinary fathers. It is evident that Cromwell's son was a capable scholar, who besides mastering Latin, French and accounting, had learned to play the lute and virginals and excelled in the outdoor pursuits of riding, hunting with the longbow and hawking. He was athletic and therefore had {{much in common with}} his older cousin, the courtier Richard Cromwell. It is apparent that Gregory Cromwell was an intelligent, well-educated and accomplished young man <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been a source of pride to his father.|$|E

Giles ate a vegetarian diet. This retreat was finally discovered by the king's hunters, who had pursued the hind to its place of refuge. An arrow shot at the deer wounded the saint instead, who afterwards became a patron of cripples. The king, who by legend was Wamba, an anachronistic Visigoth, but <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been (at least in the original story) a Frank due to the historical setting. He held the hermit in high esteem for his humility rejected all honors save some disciples. Wamba built him a monastery in his valley, Saint-Gilles-du-Gard, which Giles placed under the Benedictine rule.

500|$|Like an {{athletic}} decathlon, the Academic Decathlon has ten events: art, economics, essay, interview, language and literature, math, music, science, social science, and speech. Prior to 2013, the Super Quiz replaced {{one of the}} seven objective events each year; from 2003-2012, it alternated between replacing science and social science. USAD releases the topics and theme of the following year's competition in early March, giving students time to prepare for a competition season that runs from November to April. The curriculum is developed by a ten-member panel of former USAD coaches known as the USAD Curriculum Advisory Group. The group contracts with [...] "curriculum developers", <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> at least a bachelor's degree in their respective subject, to create the subject area outlines, Resource Guides, and Notebook Dividers. The Super Quiz Resource Guide was formed mostly from articles from peer reviewed journals, but also includes non-peer reviewed articles, which are looked over by a panel of five reviewers and then checked for accuracy by another reviewer. Use of this format was continued for the Science packet in the 2012-2013 season.|$|E
500|$|Davidson places {{emphasis}} {{on the fact that}} valkyrie literally means [...] "chooser of the slain". She compares Wulfstan's mention of a [...] "chooser of the slain" [...] in his Sermo Lupi ad Anglos sermon, which appears among [...] "a blacklist of sinners, witches and evildoers", to [...] "all the other classes whom he [...] mentions", and concludes as those [...] "are human ones, it seems unlikely that he has introduced mythological figures as well." [...] Davidson points out that Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan's detailed account of a 10th-century Rus ship funeral on the Volga River features an [...] "old Hunnish woman, massive and grim to look upon" [...] (who Fadlan refers to as the [...] "Angel of Death") who organises the killing of the slave girl, and has two other women with her that Fadlan refers to as her daughters. Davidson says that [...] "it would hardly be surprising if strange legends grew up about such women, <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been kept apart from their kind due to their gruesome duties. Since it was often decided by lot which prisoners should be killed, the idea that the god [...] "chose" [...] his victims, through the instrument of the priestesses, must have been a familiar one, apart from the obvious assumption that some were chosen to fall in war." [...] Davidson says that it appears that from [...] "early times" [...] the Germanic peoples [...] "believed in fierce female spirits doing the command of the war god, stirring up disorder, taking part in battle, seizing and perhaps devouring the slain." ...|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
