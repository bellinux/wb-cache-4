5|$|Thompson {{begins by}} showing that an animal's surface and volume (or <b>weight)</b> <b>increase</b> with the square and cube of its length, respectively, and deducing simple rules for how bodies will change with size. He shows {{in a few short}} {{equations}} that the speed of a fish or ship rises with the square root of its length. He then derives the slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight. He shows that an organism thousands of times smaller than a bacterium is essentially impossible.|$|E
5|$|Typical {{adult male}} ruffs start to moult {{into the main}} display plumage before their return to the {{breeding}} areas, {{and the proportion of}} birds with head and neck decorations gradually increases through the spring. Second-year birds lag behind full adults in developing breeding plumage. They have a lower body mass and a slower <b>weight</b> <b>increase</b> than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.|$|E

40|$|We {{used the}} {{immature}} rat uterotrophic assay {{to determine the}} estrogenicity of bisphenol A (BPA). We administered BPA (in sesame oil) to rats subcutaneously (sc; 0, 8, 40, and 160 mg/kg/day) or orally (0, 40, 160, and 800 mg/kg/day) for 3 days beginning on postnatal day (PND) 18; rats were sacrificed 24 hr after the last administration. Uterine wet, blotted, and relative <b>weights</b> <b>increased</b> in all groups given BPA sc. After oral administration, uterine relative <b>weight</b> <b>increased</b> in 160 and 800 mg/kg BPA groups, and wet and blotted <b>weights</b> <b>increased</b> in the 800 mg/kg BPA group. Plasma concentrations of BPA at 1 hr after the last administration were detected in all groups given BPA sc and in groups given 160 and 800 mg/kg BPA orally, with a dose-response effect. The study was then reproduced under the same conditions. After sc injections, uterine wet and blotted <b>weights</b> <b>increased</b> in the 40 and 160 mg/kg BPA groups, and relative <b>weight</b> <b>increased</b> in all groups given BPA sc. By contrast, uterine wet, blotted, and relative <b>weights</b> <b>increased</b> only in the 160 and 800 mg/kg oral BPA groups. Also, to examine time-course changes in uterine weight, we administered BPA (in sesame oil) sc from PND 18 to PND 20 for 3 days at doses of 0, 8, 40, and 160 mg/kg/day; uterine weights were then measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hr after the last administration. Uterine wet, blotted, and relative <b>weights</b> <b>increased</b> in all BPA groups at 6 and 24 hr and in 40 and 160 mg/kg BPA groups at 12 hr. By contrast, at 18 hr, uterine wet, blotted, and relative blotted <b>weights</b> <b>increased</b> in all BPA groups and relative wet <b>weight</b> <b>increased</b> in 40 and 160 mg/kg BPA groups. The percentage increases in uterine wet and relative weights of 40 and 160 mg/kg BPA groups at 6 hr were higher than those at 24 hr relative to the controls, but the coefficient of variation in these weights in the group given 8 mg/kg BPA at 24 hr was smaller than that at 6 hr. These findings demonstrate BPA-induced uterotrophy in the immature uterotrophic assay in rats administered 8 mg/kg/day sc and in rats given 160 mg/kg/day orally, and suggest that the autopsy at 24 hr after the last administration is suitable...|$|R

The Porsche 997 Turbo Cabriolet {{became one of the}} fastest convertible sports cars in production. It is capable of similar top speeds and acceleration to the standard Porsche 997 turbo coupé, a notable feat due to the typical problems associated with convertible variants of hardtop coupés, such as the poor aerodynamics of a soft top, a lack of torsional rigidity, and the consequential <b>weight</b> <b>increase</b> from structural members.|$|E
25|$|Although {{these figures}} provide an {{indication}} of the relative performance of each variant, and showed that the Orione, especially the N2, suffered {{as a result of the}} <b>weight</b> <b>increase</b> (particularly in climbs), they are not truly representative as they were obtained under different test conditions. As opposed to the two N versions, the Veltro was tested under ideal conditions, i.e. at light weight (3,250kg/7,170lb) and with full emergency power (2,750rpm). In a climb to 6,000m (19,700ft), a Veltro III series, fully equipped and using combat (not emergency) power at 2,600rpm needed 7 minutes.|$|E

Corby requested that her other luggage be weighed in order to establish if there was an addition of approximately 4.2kg from the weight checked in and recorded at Brisbane Airport.

25|$|The Federal Clean Air Act caused Ford {{to install}} {{catalytic}} converters for 1975 to help meet new emission standards. The converter significantly reduced the power {{output of the}} engines due to increased exhaust back pressure. In response, Ford changed the base engine on all Torinos to the 351-2V engine; along with this change, the Cruise-O-Matic transmission became standard. No manual transmissions were available. Power for all engines, except the 460, was significantly reduced compared to 1974, and with the <b>weight</b> <b>increase,</b> fuel economy and performance continued to decrease. The 400-2V and the 460-4V were the only engine options, as the 351-4V was no longer available.|$|E
25|$|Over {{more than}} six months of {{sertraline}} therapy for depression, patients showed a nonsignificant <b>weight</b> <b>increase</b> of 0.1%. Similarly, a 30-month-long treatment with sertraline for OCD resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.5% (1kg). Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, the weight gain was lower for fluoxetine (Prozac) (1%) but higher for citalopram (Celexa), fluvoxamine (Luvox) and paroxetine (Paxil) (2.5%). Of the sertraline group, 4.5% gained a large amount of weight (defined as more than 7% gain). This result compares favorably with placebo, where, according to the literature, 3–6% of patients gained more than 7% of their initial weight. The large weight gain was observed only among female members of the sertraline group; the significance of this finding is unclear because of the small size of the group.|$|E
25|$|The RAN {{commenced}} {{plans to}} improve their frigates' combat capability in 1996, with the Warfighting Improvement Program (WIP). Upgrades proposed under the WIP included installation of a phased-array radar, a second Mark 41 vertical launch system. The WIP was scrapped {{near the end of}} 1999, and plans for a less ambitious anti-ship missile defence (ASMD) upgrade were made. In 2004, Tenix, Saab, and the Department of Defence formed a Private Public Partnership to upgrade the anti-ship missile defence (ASMD) capability of the Anzac class, through the installation of CEA Technologies' CEAFAR and CEAMOUNT phased array radars, a Vampir NG Infrared Search and Track system, and Sharpeye Navigational Radar Systems. On 18 January 2010, Perth docked at the Australian Marine Complex in Henderson, Western Australia for the ASMD upgrade. Both of the frigate's masts were replaced, and the operations room layout was improved. Additional ballast was required to maintain stability, and the combined <b>weight</b> <b>increase</b> brought the ship's full load displacement to 3,810 tons. After completion in October 2010, Perth was used to test the modifications, with trials completed in July 2011. Approval to upgrade the other seven RAN Anzacs was granted in November 2011, with work on the A$650 million refits to begin in 2012. As of March 2017, all eight ships of the RAN had completed the upgrade.|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 2000s, the 777 was facing {{increased}} potential competition from Airbus' planned A350 XWB and internally from proposed 787 variants, both airliners that promise fuel efficiency improvements. As a consequence, the 777-300ER received an engine and aerodynamics improvement package for reduced drag and weight. In 2010, the variant further received a [...] maximum zero-fuel <b>weight</b> <b>increase,</b> {{equivalent to a}} higher payload of 20–25 passengers; its GE90-115B1 engines received a 1–2.5 percent thrust enhancement for increased takeoff weights at higher-altitude airports. More changes were targeted for late 2012, including possible extension of the wingspan, along with other major changes, including a composite wing, new powerplant, and different fuselage lengths. Emirates was reportedly working closely with Boeing on the project, possibly being the launch customer for new 777 versions. China Airlines ordered ten 777-300ER aircraft to replace 747-400s on routes between Taipei and Los Angeles and New York City, telling Aviation Week and Space Technology that the 777-300ER's per seat cost is about 20% lower than the 747's costs (varying due to fuel prices).
