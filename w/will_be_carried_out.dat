25|$|PERT and CPM {{are very}} similar in their {{approach}} but still present some differences. CPM is used for projects that assume deterministic activity times; the times at which each activity <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> are known. PERT, on the other hand, allows for stochastic activity times; the times at which each activity <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> are uncertain or varied. Because of this core difference, CPM and PERT are used in different contexts. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.|$|E
