In conjunction with CBC Television, the network provided audio descriptions and simulcasts of coverage of {{events such as the}} wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the 2011 federal election, the 2011 Gemini Awards, Canada Day festivities in Ottawa in 2012, and the 32nd Genie Awards. In conjunction with coverage of the games carried by CTV and Rogers properties, AMI-tv also offered coverage of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, including simulcasts of daily highlight shows with described video, and a daily program featuring interviews <b>with</b> <b>athletes.</b> The latter was hosted by AMI reporters Carrie Anton (who was a member of Canada's gold medal-winning goalball team at the 2000 Summer Paralympics) and Gary Steeves, both of whom are blind. AMI-tv's involvement in the Paralympics continued for the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, this time in conjunction with CBC Sports and the Canadian Paralympic Committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} {{itself is}} composed of two rounds. In round one, all 40 qualified athletes complete a single jump in the aforementioned World Cup order. After points for distance and style are achieved, only the top 30 scorers from the first round proceed to the second, while the rest are eliminated from the event. In round two, the starting order is instead {{based solely on the}} points gained in the first round: the lowest scoring athlete jumps first, while the leader has the very last jump of the competition. The athlete with the most points from both rounds wins that competition. For the second competition, the starting order for round one uses the results from the first competition – no longer based on World Cup ranking – <b>with</b> <b>athletes</b> again jumping in ascending order of points. After the second (and final) round, the athlete with the most points accumulated from both competitions is declared the Ski Flying World Champion.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates perfectionistic concerns and perfectionistic strivings share divergent associations <b>with</b> <b>athlete</b> burnout and athlete engagement. Guided by self-determination theory, {{the present study}} examined whether these associations are explained by basic psychological needs. Youth athletes (n = 222, M age = 16. 01, SD = 2. 68) completed measures of multidimensional perfectionism, athlete burnout, athlete engagement, basic psychological need satisfaction and thwarting. Structural equation modelling revealed that basic psychological need satisfaction and thwarting mediated the perfectionism-engagement and perfectionism-burnout relationships. Perfectionistic concerns shared a negative relationship (via need satisfaction) <b>with</b> <b>athlete</b> engagement and a positive relationship (via need satisfaction and thwarting) <b>with</b> <b>athlete</b> burnout. In contrast, perfectionistic strivings shared a positive relationship (via need satisfaction) <b>with</b> <b>athlete</b> engagement and a negative relationship (via need satisfaction and thwarting) <b>with</b> <b>athlete</b> burnout. The findings highlight the role of basic psychological needs in explaining the differential associations that perfectionistic concerns and strivings share <b>with</b> <b>athlete</b> burnout and engagement...|$|R

The initial wrong measurements led to angry shouting between coaches, athletes and organisers. During the boxing competition there have been claims made by various teams including England and Botswana that jabs were not being scored by judges. This was attributed to the removal of a white scoring zone placed on the boxers gloves which is usually present in amateur boxing events.

However, Gay now faced a new, emerging challenger in Usain Bolt; at the latter event Bolt had beaten Gay with a world-record-setting 9.72s. Taking this into consideration, he realized that a world record time {{would be needed to}} beat both Bolt and Powell at the Olympics; Gay aimed to run below 9.70s. <b>With</b> <b>athletes</b> running such quick times, the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) sought to counter claims of performance-enhancing drugs use through [...] "Project Believe", a regular, extensive drugs testing program.
