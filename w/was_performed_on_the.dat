5|$|The single was {{certified}} three-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in October 2013, representing {{sales of}} two million copies, since the certifications for digital singles include on-demand audio and/or video song streams {{in addition to}} downloads. An accompanying music video for the song premiered on June 14, 2013. It was shot by Cameron Duddy and Bruno Mars in Las Vegas, Hollywood. The video presents Mars' band, The Hooligans, in a live performance.

This is Jackson's lowest charting song on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 91, though charted in the top 10 in numerous countries worldwide, including Australia, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The song <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> HIStory World Tour in 1996–1997. It was covered a few times by other artists.|$|E

It was also successful in Japan, peaking at number two both on the Oricon Singles Chart and Billboards Japan Hot 100 chart. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for physical shipments of 100,000 units.

5|$|A study <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{storm in}} eight {{counties}} in North Carolina {{to determine the}} cost of evacuation for hurricanes, and included 1,029 households. Another study was performed regarding the actions taken during Hurricane Bonnie evacuations in the state. Tourists were interviewed, and {{it was found that}} 90% of vacationers who were threatened by the hurricane evacuated, of which 56% went home, 3% stayed in public shelters, 22% stayed with friends or relatives, 3% stayed in hotels and motels, and 16% stayed elsewhere. In total, 58% stayed within North Carolina, 12% went to Virginia, 6% relocated to South Carolina, and 24% stayed in other regions. Most of the evacuees left on August 25; 80% left with their own vehicles, and 18% used rental transportation. Officials in the state opened an estimated 100 shelters to accommodate the evacuating tourists and residents.|$|E
5|$|The first {{announcement}} {{of the discovery of}} element 102 was announced by physicists at the Nobel Institute in Sweden in 1957. The team reported that they had bombarded a curium target with carbon-13 ions for twenty-five hours in half-hour intervals. Between bombardments, ion-exchange chemistry <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> target. Twelve out of the fifty bombardments contained samples emitting (8.5±0.1)MeV alpha particles, which were in drops which eluted earlier than fermium (atomic number Z=100) and californium (Z=98). The half-life reported was 10minutes and was assigned to either 251102 or 253102, although the possibility that the alpha particles observed were from a presumably short-lived mendelevium (Z=101) isotope created from the electron capture of element 102 was not excluded. The team proposed the name nobelium (No) for the new element, which was immediately approved by IUPAC, a decision which the Dubna group characterized in 1968 as being hasty. The following year, scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory repeated the experiment but were unable to find any 8.5MeV events which were not background effects.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} by Thomas Telford in 1788. The east window was enlarged in 1858 by S.Pountney Smith, who also reconstructed some of the roofs between 1864 and 1870. In 1884 Paley and Austin added a vestry {{to the north of the}} chancel. Work <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chancel in 1889–92 by A. E. Lloyd Oswell. The top fell from the spire in 1894, causing much damage to the clerestory, and this was repaired by John Oldrid Scott.|$|E
25|$|Preservation {{and repair}} work <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge's {{sidewalks}} in January 2011, {{which led to}} the closure of two lanes in each direction during daytime non-rush hours. The center lanes were closed for a few days in March 2012 for additional rehabilitation work. In June 2012, Cianbro Corp. oversaw an eight-week, $788,000 project to repair the bridge's deck, restore granite curbs, and replace sidewalks at both approaches. At least one lane (and sometimes two) in each direction was closed in September, October, and November.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Cypress Street Viaduct {{double-deck}} segment of the Nimitz Freeway collapsed, killing 42 people. The old freeway segment had passed through the middle of West Oakland, forming a barrier between West Oakland neighborhoods. Following the earthquake, this section was rerouted around the perimeter of West Oakland and rebuilt in 1999. The east span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also suffered damage from the quake when a 50-foot (15-m) section of the upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck; the damaged section was repaired within a month of the earthquake. As a result of Loma Prieta, a significant seismic retrofit <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western span of the Bay Bridge. The eastern span has now been replaced with a dramatic single-tower self-anchoring suspension span.|$|E
25|$|The {{working group}} 'Structure', led by Chieti University and coordinated by Chieti and Rome-III University, {{constructed}} a structural {{map of the}} Majella mountain. This structural framework is accompanied by five structural cross-sections of the anticline, which together {{provide an overview of}} the internal structure of the Majella mountain. The Working Group furthermore performed a systematic analysis of kinematic data collected on fault surfaces (indications for type of movement and timing of the fault network). This resulted in a detailed framework for the deformation history of the Majella anticline, which shows the style of movement on various sets of faults and their relationships in time. In order to obtain a constraint on the type of stress field responsible for the deformations observed, a paleostress analysis using numerical inversion techniques <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same kinematic data, and a palaeo-stress map was constructed.|$|E
25|$|The {{house had}} a major roof leak that forced {{an end to the}} house tours in 1998. An {{architectural}} assessment <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> house and the cost to reconstruct the house was estimated between $116,020 and $126,220. Before the roof was repaired, there was a broken pipe in the dining room. The break happened in January 1999. It dumped 500,000 gallons of water through the first floor and into the basement. The rising basement waters extinguished the furnace, causing the water in the pipes and the radiators to freeze, then burst. City water meters knew there was a problem somewhere in the city, but no one could find the source of the leak. A volunteer at the house discovered the leak. The volunteer arranged for a heating repairman to stop the flooding. When the repairman left, he slammed the door closed. The door frame was so swollen that the volunteer was stuck inside. She had to go upstairs and call for help through a front window.|$|E
