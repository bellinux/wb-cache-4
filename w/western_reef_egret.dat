50|$|The western {{reef heron}} (Egretta gularis) also called the <b>western</b> <b>reef</b> <b>egret,</b> is a {{medium-sized}} heron found in southern Europe, Africa and parts of Asia. It has a mainly coastal distribution and occurs in several plumage forms: a slaty-grey plumage in which {{it can only be}} confused with the rather uncommon dark morph of the little egret (Egretta garzetta); a white form which can look very similar to the little egret although the bill tends to be paler and larger and the black form with white throat E. g. gularis of West Africa. There are also differences in size, structure and foraging behaviour. There have been suggestions that the species hybridizes with the little egret, and based on this, some authors treat schistacea and gularis as subspecies of Egretta garzetta. Works that consider the {{western reef heron}} as a valid species include the nominate gularis and schistacea as subspecies.|$|E
40|$|Little Egret-like {{birds that}} occur in Africa {{have been the subject}} of debate for decades, and remain taxonomically highly controversial. Three forms in Kenya (garzetta, schistacea and dimorpha) largely behave as {{separate}} species and are generally easy to identify, but confusion remains as to whether Egretta garzetta in Africa is monotypic or whether it represents a polytypic species embracing some or all of the forms dimorpha, schistacea and gularis. In Europe the <b>Western</b> <b>Reef</b> <b>Egret</b> (E. gularis) and the Little Egret (E. garzetta) are usually recognized as separate species (Cramp & Simmons 1977, Hancock & Elliot...|$|E

50|$|Eastern <b>reef</b> <b>egrets</b> {{have very}} short, yellow legs, and the grey variety's throats and chins {{are marked by}} a narrow, white stripe. They have brown beaks, gold-yellow {{coloured}} eyes and the surrounding areas of their faces are normally of a greenish to yellow cast.|$|R
50|$|Other birds {{breeding}} on {{the islands}} include masked boobies, Australian pelicans, lesser frigatebirds, eastern <b>reef</b> <b>egrets,</b> silver gulls, crested, bridled and lesser crested terns, common noddies, and pied and sooty oystercatchers.

50|$|The Pacific {{reef heron}} (Egretta sacra), {{also known as}} the eastern reef heron or eastern <b>reef</b> <b>egret,</b> is a kind of heron.

50|$|The {{island is}} densely covered with {{woodland}} and tall scrub. A total of 150 plant species {{and a large}} variety of butterfly species have been found. One ant species not previously found elsewhere in Hong Kong was recorded on Green Island. The locally rare <b>reef</b> <b>egret</b> and white-bellied sea eagle have been seen on the island.|$|R
50|$|Though {{numerous}} seabirds nest on Teeraina, {{for many}} such species the limited habitat {{makes it a}} less important rookery than other, similar-sized raised atolls. About 10 species of seabirds breed here, most significantly tree-nesters like the little white tern (Gygis microrhyncha) and the red-footed booby (Sula sula). The eastern <b>reef</b> <b>egret</b> (Egretta sacra), widespread throughout the region, {{can also be found}} on Teraina.|$|R
5000|$|The islands {{have been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they support over 1% of the world populations of brown boobies (up to 12,000 breeding pairs) and lesser frigatebirds (up to 7700 breeding pairs). [...] Large numbers of Australian pelicans and smaller numbers of eastern <b>reef</b> <b>egrets,</b> ospreys and white-bellied sea-eagles also breed on the islands.|$|R
25|$|More than 35 {{bird species}} have been {{recorded}} from Kiritimati. As noted above, only the bokikokiko (Acrocephalus aequinoctialis), perhaps a few Rimitara lorikeets (Vini kuhlii) – if any remain at all – and the occasional eastern <b>reef</b> <b>egret</b> (Egretta sacra) make up the entire landbird fauna. About 1,000 adult bokikokikos {{are to be found}} at any date, but mainly in mixed grass/shrubland away from the settlements.|$|R
50|$|The {{main cause}} of the total loss of nestlings from a nest is faulty nest {{construction}} leading to tilting. Early dry season nests can suffer damage {{from the loss of}} supporting leaves in the tree canopy, while late season nests are at risk from heavy rain and strong winds. Young fledglings are vulnerable to predation by eastern <b>reef</b> <b>egrets</b> in the trees, and by silver gulls and buff-banded rails on the ground.|$|R

50|$|The {{flora and}} fauna are both {{characteristic}} of Australia and New Guinea. The biggest mammal is the endangered dugong, a seacow which occurs in the waters near Rob Roy and Taro Island. The largest reptile is the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) known from Australia.
