500|$|For {{the song}} [...] "Slaughter", Ndegéocello tried to weave {{together}} sonic influences from the producers Trevor Horn and RZA, {{as well as}} the bands Yes, Sade, and The Human League: [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> achieve in this particular recording: some sonic tapestries that people, even if they're not listening to the lyrics, could just feel or hear, or just have a deep, inner dialogue with." [...] She covered Ready for the World's 1986 song [...] "Love You Down", deconstructing it into what Village Voice critic Eugene Holley Jr. described as [...] "a stripper's classic". Songs such as [...] "Mass Transit" [...] and [...] "White Girl" [...] featured Ndegéocello's characteristic ska and reggae influenced basslines; Holley argued that Caribbean riddims and country-rock guitar grooves underpinned the music, serving as a backdrop for Ndegéocello's contralto singing throughout Devil's Halo. In the opinion of Ed Potton from The Times, her voice [...] "resided somewhere between Sade and PJ Harvey".|$|E
500|$|Carey and her {{management}} {{then decided}} to release [...] "It's Like That" [...] as the album's lead single, calling it [...] "the right fire-starter". The singer has praised Dupri for being [...] "focused", and felt that together they had composed some of her favorite songs on the album. She has told MTV, [...] "The album is not about making the older executives happy by making a bring-down-the-house, tearjerker ballad, or [...] steeped in the media dramas of my life. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do was keep the sessions very sparse, underproduced, like in '70s soul music ... According to Reid, Carey intended for the album to feature a more unpolished sound than her previous releases. The singer had been frustrated with the overproduction on many of her previous records, due to the inclusion of what she considered unnecessary [...] "bells and whistles". She opted to record the majority of The Emancipation of Mimi live, alongside the band. Reid agreed with this decision and felt that the live vocals made the album sound more authentic.|$|E

60|$|But Malachias' tale {{began to}} freeze them with horror. He conjured up the scene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back {{and in the}} recess appeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a {{portfolio}} full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked Poison. Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer of Samuel Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me. This is the appearance is on me. Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?

The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. An instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station at ten past eleven. He was gone. Tears gushed from {{the eyes of the}} dissipated host. The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: Lex talionis. The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased. The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the third brother. His real name was Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks. The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there. The spider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from his hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer's ground.|$|E

"So, when {{it seems}} hard that I should have taken his child from him," [...] the woman continued, as if still arguing her case, and she {{probably}} was arguing it with herself, [...] "and did what I could to make her forget him, I think it had better be considered whose sake I was doing it for, and whether I had any right to do different.

It was the same as a legal adoption, and he freely consented to it, or as freely as he could, considering where he was. But he knew it was for her good as well as we did. There was nobody for her to look to but us, and he knew that; his own family had no means, and, in fact, he had no family but his father and mother, and when they died, that same first year, there was no one left to suffer from him but his child. The question was how much she ought to be allowed to suffer, and whether she should be allowed to suffer at all, if it could be helped. If it was to be prevented, it was to be by deadening her to him, by killing out her affection for him, and much as I hated Mr. Tedham, I could not bring myself to do that, though I used to think I would do it. He was very fond of her, I don't deny that; I don't think it was any merit in him to love such a child, but {{it was the best thing}} about him, and I was willing it should count. But then there was another thing that I couldn't bring myself to, and that was to tell the child, up and down, all about it; and I presume that there I was weak. Well, you may say I was weak!
