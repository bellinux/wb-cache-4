25|$|Key {{selection}} criteria of a DSO (apart from input bandwidth) are the sample memory depth and sample rate.

This is adequate for basic <b>waveform</b> <b>display,</b> but does not allow detailed examination of the waveform or inspection of long data packets for example.

Often this sample memory is shared between channels, and can sometimes only be fully available at lower sample rates. At the highest sample rates, the memory may be limited to a few tens of KB.|$|E

5000|$|As {{software}} systems, DAWs {{are designed}} with many user interfaces, but generally {{they are based on}} a multitrack tape recorder metaphor, making it easier for recording engineers and musicians already familiar with using tape recorders to become familiar with the new systems. Therefore, computer-based DAWs tend to have a standard layout that includes transport controls (play, rewind, record, etc.), track controls and a mixer, and a <b>waveform</b> <b>display.</b> Single-track DAWs display only one (mono or stereo form) track at a time.

50|$|The {{software}} used {{to process}} the resulting digital files ranges in price from {{thousands of dollars to}} freeware. Some of these applications are simple, and some are very complex. Many are general purpose waveform editors that also happen to include record restoration features or plugins, and others are dedicated to the sole purpose of record restoration. Moreover, some applications are designed for easy fast processing with the push of a few buttons, and others require a time-consuming but perhaps more exact manual approach to editing out damage. Most applications present a <b>waveform</b> <b>display,</b> but a few are basically noise and click-pop filters that provide no visual display at all. All record restoration applications for Windows work directly upon WAV files, but a few will also directly open files in other formats, such as MP3.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study's broad {{objective}} {{was to examine the}} effectiveness of surface electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback for motor learning in the voice production domain. The specific {{objective was}} to examine whether concurrent or terminal biofeedback would facilitate learning for a relaxed laryngeal musculature task during spoken reading. Method: Twenty-two healthy adult speakers were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. One group received real-time EMG <b>waveform</b> <b>displays</b> of muscle activation from bilateral thyrohyoid sites during reading trials (concurrent feedback group). The other group received static terminal EMG <b>waveform</b> <b>displays</b> about activation levels for the same sites on completion of successive trials (terminal feedback group). All participants were instructed to minimize EMG amplitudes from the thyrohyoid sites during phonation in an oral reading task. Signals were also collected from control, orofacial sites, but participants received neither instructions nor feedback for those sites. Results: The pooled data (2 feedback groups × 2 electrode sites) showed that, overall, muscle activation levels did decrease across baseline, training, and no-feedback test phases. However, no clear evidence was seen of reliable changes in the targeted laryngeal muscle activation levels across the phases, for either the concurrent or the terminal feedback groups. Paradoxically, and entirely unanticipated, reliable decreases were seen in muscle activation for the orofacial, no-feedback control sites. Those decreases were equivalent across concurrent and terminal feedback groups. Conclusions: The unanticipated findings indicate that the provision of biofeedback for a target muscle group facilitated incidental learning in another, untargeted muscle group. Discussion focuses on the possible role of locus of attention in motor learning. Building on literature from other domains, the hypothesis is advanced that attention to muscular contractile force during training trials may suppress intentional learning for attended target sites but may benefit incidental learning for nearby, unattended sites. ©American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Seismic {{monitoring}} of a CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) will require analysts to review tens of events per hour recorded by networks {{of more than}} a hundred stations. Use of the traditional <b>waveform</b> <b>display</b> as the primary data display tool is incompatible with this requirement; traditional waveform displays are inefficient in their presentation of relevant data and place high demands on computer resources. Drawing on resident data visualization expertise and on our hands-on experience with the design and implementation of the ADSN (AFRAC Distributed Subsurface Network) system at AFTAC, we have designed a new system consisting of a hierarchical series of displays which present Televant information to the analyst in a more efficient manner. The displays are designed to be used in a top-down manner with the analyst starting with the most general display and proceeding to the most specific (the <b>waveform</b> <b>display)</b> only when it is needed.

The shape, height, steepness, and potential of the voltammetric waves are functions of mass transport, interfacial electron-transfer rates, and the intrinsic kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the enzyme. A model is constructed first for the most simple realistic case, an enzyme containing a single two-electron active site, and then this is extended to include additional electron-transfer centers that serve as intramolecular relays. Equations are derived that predict the steady-state behavior expected for different conditions, and the models are used to assess recent experimental results. An alternative perspective on enzyme catalytic electron-transport is thus presented, in which kinetics and energetics are viewed and analyzed in the potential domain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Phased arrays were transitioned {{from the}} medical field to {{industry}} in the early 1980 ’s. Initial industrial phased array technology was reserved for highly complex inspections in critical power generation applications. Equipment was extremely bulky and required highly skilled operators. This paper will describe the evolution and implementation of industrial phased array systems that now allow use by a single operator for everyday applications. Factors discussed include miniaturization of electronics, advances in setup protocol, standardization of ultrasonic phased array probes and wider spread acceptance of the technology by governing agencies, such as ASME, AWS and ASNT. Origins of Phased Array Technology: Ultrasonic technology has been applied in both medical and industrial fields since the mid-twentieth century.
