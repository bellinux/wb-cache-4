5|$|Two other taxa that Czerkas and his co-authors named {{were later}} treated as junior {{synonyms}} by other authors. Czerkas' Cryptovolans <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> Microraptor, and his Scansoriopteryx <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> Epidendrosaurus. Czerkas described Omnivoropteryx, noting {{that it was}} similar to Sapeornis. Later specimens of Sapeornis with skulls demonstrated that the two were probably synonymous.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the battle}} <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> {{a great victory}} and {{afterward}} no fewer than eight men were awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. The German dead were gathered together and buried in the SS Heroes Cemetery near Arnhem, but after the war they were reburied in Ysselsteyn.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of August 3, 1924, Nicol died in his sleep {{at the age of}} 53. His death <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> suspicious, as a {{post-mortem}} examination found him to have four broken ribs that led to his death. He was interred at the Union Cemetery in Milwaukee.|$|E

5|$|Alexander fled Macedon {{with his}} mother, {{dropping}} her {{off with her}} brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due {{to the efforts of}} a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.|$|E
5|$|Around 1785BC, as {{the power}} of the Middle Kingdom pharaohs weakened, a Western Asian people called the Hyksos had already settled in the Eastern Delta town of Avaris, seized control of Egypt, and forced the central {{government}} to retreat to Thebes. The pharaoh <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a vassal and expected to pay tribute. The Hyksos ("foreign rulers") retained Egyptian models of government and identified as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt, most notably the composite bow and the horse-drawn chariot.|$|E
5|$|At each venue, {{the concert}} <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> {{a major event}} by the local press and {{attended}} by between ten and twenty thousand fans, whose enthusiastic response to the Beatles produced sound levels that left the music only semi-audible. The tour earned the Beatles {{over a million dollars}} in ticket sales. It also stimulated a further increase in record sales, and resulted in the sale of a considerable quantity of Beatle-related merchandise.|$|E

5|$|At the Bandung Conference in Indonesia in late April 1955, Nasser <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> {{the leading}} {{representative}} of the Arab countries {{and was one of}} the most popular figures at the summit. He had paid earlier visits to Pakistan (April 9), India (April 14), Burma, and Afghanistan on the way to Bandung, and previously cemented a treaty of friendship with India in Cairo on 6 April, strengthening Egyptian–Indian relations on the international policy and economic development fronts.|$|E
5|$|He was {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.|$|E
5|$|In 1671 Morgan {{attacked}} Panama City, {{landing on}} the Caribbean coast and traversing the isthmus before he attacked the city, which was on the Pacific coast. The battle was a rout, although the privateers profited less than in other raids. To appease the Spanish, with whom the English had signed a peace treaty, Morgan was arrested and summoned to London in 1672, but <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a hero by the general populace and the leading figures of government and royalty including Charles II.|$|E

5|$|Sexuality {{played an}} {{important}} role in Crowley's ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, homosexual, and heterosexual—and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician's will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success. For Crowley, sex <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a sacrament, with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eucharist. This was often manifested as the Cakes of Light, a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.|$|E
5|$|The facades of English cathedrals show a {{considerable}} diversity, {{rather than a}} consistent progression, {{as is the case}} in Northern France and other cathedrals influenced by the French Gothic style. In many cases, regardless of the architectural form, the English façade <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a decorative screen with many niches occupied by statues. A great number of these were toppled or defaced during the 17th century, however a “Gallery of Kings” remains high on the façade of Lincoln, and many of the original weather-worn figures remain at Exeter.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year New Zealand reciprocated and toured Australia. Windon played twice for the New South Wales Waratahs against the touring All Blacks, {{and in one}} of the two test matches. The tour <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a trial for Australia's 1947–48 tour of Europe and North America that commenced later that year. Windon played 27 matches on the 36-match tour, and in all five test matches: against Scotland, Ireland, Wales, England and France. The Wallabies did not concede a try in any of their four Home Nations matches.|$|E

5|$|The {{treasure}} {{weighed in}} at over 34 tons, or £205,536. Almost a quarter went to Albemarle. Phips, after paying out £8,000 in crew shares, received £11,000. Phips <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> {{a hero in}} London, and the find was {{the talk of the}} town. Some economic historians argue that Phips' find significantly affected history because it led to a major increase in the formation of joint-stock companies, and even {{played a role in the}} eventual formation in the Bank of England.|$|E
5|$|A {{cluster of}} {{thunderstorms}} developed over Florida in late May. A shortwave trough {{brought it to}} the northeast, enhancing convection around a developing center of circulation. The low pressure area, which formed on May31, developed into a subtropical depression on June1. Operationally, it <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a frontal low, but post-analysis suggested it remained separate throughout its lifetime, and was classified as an unnamed subtropical storm. It reached subtropical storm strength six hours later as it moved rapidly parallel to the East Coast of the United States. The convection continued to wrap around the center, and despite unfavorable conditions from an approaching cold front it continued to intensify. Late on June1, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h) while off the coast of North Carolina. The storm turned to the east, and transitioned extratropical late on June2 southeast of Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of the storm merged with a cold front.|$|E
5|$|An {{accomplice}} {{could be}} sued {{if he had}} provided help ope consilio – a physical act relating to the method of execution, rather than mere encouragement. It appears that Labeo {{was the first to}} require help or advice, and earlier sources suggest that both help and advice was required. Labeo's version was certainly entrenched by the early second century AD. An accomplice <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> if he himself had committed the crime. Only one person needed to have handled the thing for all wrongdoers to be liable. Republican jurists were harder on accomplices than later jurists under the empire. Indeed, Ulpian considers the unwitting accomplice, who accidentally knocks out of the victim's hand some coins which are then stolen, an accomplice to the theft. Some commentators have gone as far to say that the veteres ("ancients") may not have even required a third party to remove the coins, {{as long as they were}} otherwise lost to the owner.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he was treated with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited {{him to come to}} Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's Church, Reculver, {{was founded}} in the 7th century as either a minster or a monastery {{on the site of}} a Roman fort at Reculver, which was then at the {{north-eastern}} extremity of Kent in south-eastern England. In 669, the site of the fort was given for this purpose by King Ecgberht of Kent to a priest named Bassa, beginning a connection with Kentish kings that led to King Eadberht II of Kent being buried there in the 760s, and the church becoming very wealthy {{by the beginning of the}} 9th century. From the early 9th century to the 10th the church <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> essentially a piece of property, with ownership passing between kings of Mercia and Wessex and the archbishops of Canterbury. Viking attacks may have extinguished the church's religious community in the 9th century, although an early 11th-century record indicates that the church was then in the hands of a dean accompanied by monks. By the time of Domesday Book, completed in 1086, St Mary's was serving as a parish church.|$|E
5|$|The Song court {{returned}} to Hangzhou in 1133, {{and the city}} was renamed Lin'an. The imperial ancestral temple was built in Hangzhou later that same year, {{a sign that the}} court had in practice established Hangzhou as the Song capital without a formal declaration. It <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a temporary capital. Between 1130 and 1137, the court would sporadically move to Jiankang, and back to Hangzhou. There were proposals to make Jiankang the new capital, but Hangzhou won out because the court considered it a more secure city. The natural barriers that surrounded Hangzhou, including lakes and rice paddies, made it more difficult for the Jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications. Access to the sea made it easier to retreat from the city. In 1138, Gaozong officially declared Hangzhou the capital of the dynasty, but the label of temporary capital would still be in place. Hangzhou would remain the capital of the Southern Song for the next 150 years, growing into a major commercial and cultural center.|$|E
