Bustles May Sofi ranked the nine outfits the singer wore during the video and listed her pink tulle frock at number one. The publication's consensus on their decision reads: [...] "This adorable pink frock is not only super wearable, it's also pretty on-trend.

The move meant that Julian would be playing under the {{management}} of Graham Westley once more, who first brought Julian to Stevenage in 2005 – Westley said [...] "Alan sees the opportunity {{in the long term}} and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much quality he will bring into the squad.

On signing for Stevenage, Julian said [...] "I had a great time at Stevenage before and coming back now and we are in League One, it is a dream come true". As a result of Chris Day dislocating his finger, Julian started in the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, keeping a clean sheet in Stevenage's 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. He played the first three games of the season, before first choice goalkeeper Chris Day returned from injury. Julian made just two further appearances during the campaign; in a 2–2 draw with AFC Wimbledon in the Football League Trophy, and an appearance as a second-half substitute in Stevenage's 2–2 home draw against Huddersfield Town. He was released by Stevenage when his contract expired in May 2012.|$|E

[...] She continued: [...] "Perhaps that is the creators' intent, but most successful science fiction contains an element of, if not outright humor, then the absurd. That the human race will be enslaved not through brainwashing or firepower but adequate healthcare is pretty hilarious in a dark and almost possible way.

[...] Linda Stasi for The New York Post conversely compared the Visitors to extremist Muslims. Though in the original series the aliens were a metaphor for Nazis, Stasi commented: [...] "TV shows no longer have to rely on Nazis, because now we have the hated extremist Muslims to make all bad-guy metaphors with", adding on the Visitors' appearance: [...] "Once you peel back the outer, good-looking shell, you've got your standard outer-space Nazi/Taliban lizard person lurking beneath." ...|$|E

(Cheers.) To have sent a fleet in midwinter to the Baltic every sailor would tell you was an impossibility, but if it could have gone it would have been attended by no effectual result. Ships sailing on the sea cannot stop armies on land, and to have attempted to stop the progress of an army by sending a fleet to the Baltic would have been attempting to do that which {{it was not possible to}} accomplish.

If England could have sent an army, and although <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> admirable that army is on the peace establishment, we must acknowledge that we have no means of sending out a force at all equal to cope with the 300,000 or 400,000 men whom the 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 of Germany could have pitted against us, and that such an attempt would only have insured a disgraceful discomfiture—not to the army, indeed, but to the Government which sent out an inferior force and expected it to cope successfully with a force so vastly superior.

And yet, how strange-if you let your thoughts dwell on those distinguished people whose memory the generations have preserved, you will find that the way each individual distinguished himself is different, and you will find in turn that several are distinguished by the same thing. But in that select group you still seem to lack one place, and yet the lack is indeed a contradiction; how would the one whose task it was to be reconciled-to being forgotten-find a place in recollection? But for this very reason it is important to consider it by itself, and it is especially beautiful to do this-because no earthly reward is beckoning.

And when one night we picked him up out of the Union Ditch, a begrimed and weather-worn drunkard, a hopeless debtor, a self-confessed spendthrift, and a half-conscious, maudlin imbecile, we knew that the end had come.
