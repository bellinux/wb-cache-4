According to a pastor at the Centreville Korean Presbyterian Church, Cho <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> student who {{understood}} the Bible, but {{he was concerned about}} Cho's difficulty in speaking to people. The pastor added that, until he saw the video that Cho sent to NBC News, he never heard him say a complete sentence. The pastor also recalled that he told Cho's mother that he speculated Cho was autistic and he asked her to take him to a hospital, but she declined.|$|E
5|$|Maeda {{not only}} taught {{the art of}} judo to Carlos Gracie, but also taught a {{particular}} philosophy {{about the nature of}} combat based on his travels competing and training alongside catch-wrestlers, boxers, savate fighters, and various other martial artists. The book details Maeda's theory that physical combat could be broken down into distinct phases, such as the striking phase, the grappling phase, the ground phase, and so on. Thus, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> fighter's task to keep the fight located in the phase of combat that best suited his own strengths. The book further states that this theory was a fundamental influence on the Gracie approach to combat. The approach included armed versus armed, armed versus unarmed, unarmed, standing (tachiwaza, 立ち技), kneeling (suwariwaza, 座技), and ground work (newaza, 寝技), close quarters (hakuheijugi, 白兵主義), and other forms of combat. It was employed by other proponents of judo ('Kano jiu-jutsu') who, like Maeda, engaged in challenge match fighting overseas as judo spread internationally (e.g., Yukio Tani in the United Kingdom from 1905, Mikonosuke Kawaishi in France, and others).|$|E

500|$|McAleer's {{contributions}} to the game failed to win him {{a place in the}} Baseball Hall of Fame, however. In 1936, during the first elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame, he received just one vote in the balloting for 19th-century figures. Nevertheless, McAleer received an unofficial endorsement from Hall of Fame second baseman Nap Lajoie, who described McAleer as [...] "one of the best ever". McAleer's obituary in The New York Times suggested that he was [...] "one of the fastest outfielders the major leagues ever produced". In 2003, Bill James described McAleer as [...] "the best defensive outfielder of the 1890s". More recently, baseball historian David Fleitz observed, [...] "this brilliant defensive outfielder <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart,</b> clever, and ambitious man who helped to create two of the original eight franchises of the American League".|$|E
500|$|Chris Cabin at Collider {{called the}} short film [...] "dark, funny, {{and just a}} bit punkish", and {{compared}} it to a Saturday Night Live skit. He thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> move from Fox to release [...] "a taste of what [...] love" [...] about the first film to abate fears and rumors following the replacement of Miller with Leitch. Cabin also said it was impressive and clever that the studio managed to keep the short a surprise for general audiences to discover at the theater. Matt Rooney at JoBlo.com called the teaser great, and [...] "a great {{way to keep the}} buzz going for" [...] Deadpool 2 despite not actually revealing anything about that film. Matthew Monagle of Screen Crush said the short proves that the first Deadpool was [...] "not a one-hit wonder for Reynolds and company", and praised its jokes. He also noted its release with Logan as another connection being made by Fox between its X-Men films and Deadpool, pointing toward future crossovers between the two. The Verge's Andrew Liptak said the short was [...] "a fun one", noting the visual gags in the background and the Stan Lee cameo, and saying, [...] "At the very least, [...] we can expect the same irreverent humor in" [...] Deadpool 2 as was in the first film.|$|E
500|$|Stone {{met with}} Tom Cruise about playing Bud Fox, but the {{director}} had already committed to Charlie Sheen for the role. Stone liked the [...] "stiffness" [...] of Sheen's acting style {{and used it}} to convey Bud's naivete. Michael Douglas had just come off heroic roles like the one in Romancing the Stone and was looking for something dark and edgy. The studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested. Stone initially wanted Richard Gere but the actor passed, so Stone went with Douglas despite having been advised by others in Hollywood not to cast him. Stone remembers, [...] "I was warned by everyone in Hollywood that Michael couldn't act, that he was a producer more than an actor and would spend all his time in his trailer on the phone". Nevertheless, Stone found out that [...] "when he's acting he gives it his all". Stone said that he saw [...] "that villain quality" [...] in Douglas and always thought he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> businessman. Douglas remembers that when he first read the screenplay, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} part. It was a long script, and there were some incredibly long and intense monologues to open with. I’d never seen a screenplay where there were two or three pages of single-spaced type for a monologue. I thought, whoa! I mean, it was unbelievable". For research, he read profiles of corporate raiders T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn.|$|E

500|$|The {{first time}} Karofsky {{received}} significant notice from critics {{was for the}} second season's sixth episode, [...] "Never Been Kissed". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times commented that it was testament to the writers and cast that Karofsky's kiss startled the audience {{as much as it}} did Kurt, and commended the transitioning of Karofsky from a faceless jock into [...] "a nuanced character with a back story and hidden motives of his own." [...] MTV's Aly Semigran wrote that, should the episode inspire a single teenager to have courage in the face of discrimination, or re-consider bullying, it would be an impressive accomplishment. Linda Holmes of National Public Radio dismissed [...] "Never Been Kissed" [...] as [...] "one of the most facile and emotionally inauthentic episodes the show has ever produced", and felt that Karofsky's swift transition from bullying to kissing Kurt was absurd and [...] "emotionally unsound". His appearances over the next few episodes drew only oblique commentary, such as The Atlantic Kevin Fallon's characterization in his review on [...] "Furt" [...] of the bullying storyline as a [...] "very important arc that's been well-acted by all parties involved". In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "I thought giving Kurt's bully, Karofsky (...), a miniature story arc that resolved itself only partially <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> move. Up until now, he's been kind of a walking cliché, and now he gets to be someone who's not all repressed sexuality and monstrous tendencies." [...] Reiter commented, [...] "And best of all, we got to watch Karofsky's character develop a bit more. It was nice to see him let loose a little and dance, but all his back-and-forthing about glee was a little confusing." ...|$|E
500|$|Authors Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens {{commented that}} [...] "the video portrayed the deconstructive gender-bending {{approach}} associated with free play and self-reflexivity of images in postmodernism." [...] They had initially thought the video as a feminist approach to sexuality, {{leading them to}} say that [...] "the video might also relate to several core political questions raised by feminism." [...] However, they deduced that the scenes showing Madonna in a seductive manner and chained to her bed do not portray women in an empowering position, but emphasizes {{the fact that women}} can be in control because of their sexual prowess. Jarman-Ivens added that the epigraph establishes the status-quo, with a clear distinction of the body (workers, hand, labors) and the mind (elite, intellect capital). Unlike Metropolis, where the line denoted the binary oppositions of the labor class against the elitist, in the video Madonna did not distinguish between the two. Jarman-Ivens noted that the video portrayed both men and women being looked at, actively or passively. The body and the hand are not separate there, instead the heart, hand and head are portrayed as a balance in everybody, male or female. Scholar Theodore Gracyk also noted of the initial portrayal of female sexuality in the video, in his book, I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity, and criticized the video for its portrayal of male domination. However, on close inspection, Gracyk {{came to the conclusion that}} [...] "Express Yourself" [...] <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> move for Madonna, as it actually portrayed women in a much stronger position. Author John Evan Seery wrote in his book Political Theory for Mortals, that [...] "Madonna with her 'Express Yourself' video splicing together images of machines with images of sex,... represents the ultimate cyborg of late twentieth-century America." [...] Allen Metz felt that the scenes of Madonna grabbing her crotch and dancing were reminiscent of [...] "Michael Jackson's androgynous imitation of phallic masculinity." [...] He went on to compliment the video for its gender-bending depiction.|$|E

During the interview, Swift revealed that the video shoot encountered some problems since tornadoes were hitting Nashville during the video shoot. She explained, [...] "We had to hide. All of us, we had to hide in a room where there were no windows, so that was a little bit crazy. [...] other than that, it was incredibly fun."

The band {{performed the}} song on August 13, 2003 in Chicago during their Nintendo Fusion Tour. During the performance, former Evanescence guitarist John LeCompt replaced McCoy during the song. According to Blair R. Fischer: [...] "The guitarist did an adequate job imitating McCoy while he laid down the song's fiery, Iron Maiden-esque riff." [...] The band performed [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] in Wantagh, New York on July 23, 2004. According to Joe D'Angelo from MTV News: [...] "the massive popularity of the song <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> set-list assembly that helped the crowd respond in kind." [...] A live performance from the tour filmed at Le Zénith in Paris is included on the band's live album Anywhere but Home. The live recording contains a piano and vocal solo before the song's intro and features John LeCompt performing guest vocals. The song was performed on November 21, 2007 at WaMu Theater.|$|E

Whip's frustration with Taylor's feelings for Ridge leads to the demise of their relationship the following year, and they end the marriage.|$|E

2500|$|In The Dashing Little Duke (1909; with C. Hayden Coffin, Courtice Pounds and Louie Pounds), {{produced}} by Hicks at the Hicks Theatre, which was less successful, Hicks' wife played {{the title role}} (a woman playing a man). When she missed several performances due to illness, Hicks played the role – possibly the only case {{in the history of}} a musical where a husband succeeded to his wife's role. [...] The piece was based on A Court Scandal, in which Hicks had played in 1899. [...] Hicks then wrote and starred in Captain Kidd (1910), an adaptation with music and lyrics by Leslie Stuart and Adrian Ross, of the American farce The Dictator (1904 by Richard Harding Davis). This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> flop that brought an end to the era of supremacy in London's musical theatre by Hicks and Terriss. Hicks appeared in his first Shakespeare play that year, Richard III. [...] The same year, he penned the first of several autobiographies. [...] The following year, he took a company on a tour of South Africa. After the outbreak of World War I, Hicks was the first British actor to bring a tour to France (with Terriss), giving concerts to British troops at the front. [...] Because of this, he was awarded the French Croix de Guerre. [...] Hicks was briefly declared bankrupt in 1915.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{negative}} review, AllMusic's Tim Sendra said the track felt [...] "forced and overdone", adding, [...] "She aims for {{several kinds of}} maturity here, {{but in the process}} the music suffers". A Rap-Up editor wrote that Gomez [...] "is all grown up and not afraid to show it". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the track's hip hop elements recalled Miley Cyrus' [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] (2013), and said: [...] "No one needs reminding of how well that worked to rebrand the former Hannah Montana. Bring on the wrecking ball". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson noticed that [...] "'Good for You' allows Selena to delve deeper than she has been allowed to before, but we wouldn't want her to ditch the polished pop gems altogether". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine said that the song's approach to more serious subject matter embodied [...] "a newfound sophistication". Rob Markman of MTV News commended Gomez for [...] "thinking outside of the box" [...] for the song and specifically her collaboration with Rocky: [...] "There are plenty of rappers Selena could've chosen from, we're just happy she picked one who can actually spit", while Emmanuel C.M. of XXL, who praised Rocky's [...] "solid" [...] verse, said that him collaborating with Gomez <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>smart</b> decision, noting the track's [...] "lush" [...] production as [...] "right up [...] alley". VH1's Alexa Tietjen said the track's hook lacked the catchiness of Gomez's previous singles [...] "Come & Get It" [...] (2013) and [...] "The Heart Wants What It Wants" [...] (2014), but described the song as [...] "well-crafted" [...] and its melody equally as [...] "surprising" [...] as Gomez's collaboration with Rocky. Harley Brown of Spin wrote, [...] "Slowness and simplicity work well for Gomez here, leaving room for Rocky's verse to feel like a natural inclusion". Wass found Rocky's rap [...] "a little forced", but [...] "tasteful (by his standards)", while New York Dee Lockett considered it [...] "lazy".|$|E
