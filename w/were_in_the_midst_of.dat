5|$|In January 1942, Terboven {{announced}} the German administration would be wound down. Soon afterwards he told Quisling that Hitler had approved {{the transfer of}} power, scheduled for 30 January. Quisling remained doubtful it would happen since Germany and Norway <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> complex peace negotiations {{that could not be}} completed until peace had been reached on the Eastern Front, while Terboven insisted that the Reichskommissariat would remain in power until such peace came about. Quisling could nevertheless be reasonably confident that his position within the party and with Berlin was unassailable, even if he was unpopular within Norway, something of which he was well aware.|$|E

Philadelphia secured its berth in the final by defeating the Harrisburg City Islanders, the New York Cosmos, the New England Revolution, and FC Dallas. Seattle's road to the final included victories over PSA Elite, the San Jose Earthquakes, the Portland Timbers, and the Chicago Fire.|$|E

5|$|Six {{weeks after}} D-Day, the Allied {{invasion}} of Normandy on 6 June 1944, the German Army was in turmoil. While the Allied Army experienced great difficulty in {{breaking through the}} German lines (the city of Caen {{was supposed to have}} been captured on the first day of the invasion and was not taken until late in July) the German Army's defence of this area of Normandy was expending irreplaceable resources. The Allied air forces controlled the skies (up to 100km behind enemy lines), bombing and strafing Axis troops, reinforcements, and necessary army supplies, such as fuel and ammunition. On the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union's Operation Bagration and the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> destroying the German Army Group Centre. In France, the German Army had used its available reserves (especially its armour reserves) to buttress the front lines around Caen, and there were few additional troops available to create successive lines of defence. To make matters worse, the 20 July plot—in which officers of the German Army, including some stationed in France, tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler and seize power—had failed, and in its aftermath there was very little trust between Hitler and his generals.|$|E

25|$|The 1980s saw a large wave of {{refugees}} {{coming into the}} state from Central America {{as a number of}} these countries, especially Guatemala, <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> violent political turmoil. The Chiapas/Guatemala border had been relatively porous with people traveling back and forth easily in the 19th and 20thcenturies, much like the Mexico/U.S. border around the same time. This is in spite of tensions caused by Mexico's annexation of the Soconusco region in the 19thcentury. The border between Mexico and Guatemala had been traditionally poorly guarded, due to diplomatic considerations, lack of resources and pressure from landowners who need cheap labor sources.|$|E

Evidence suggests that the two <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> negotiations at the time, and Narváez was not expecting an attack.

25|$|Doggedly {{pursued by}} the French under Soult, the British made a retreat across {{northern}} Spain while their rearguard fought off repeated French attacks. Both armies suffered extremely from the harsh winter conditions. Much of the British army, excluding the elite Light Brigade under Robert Craufurd, suffered from a loss of order and discipline during the retreat. When the British eventually reached the port of Corunna on the northern coast of Galicia in Spain, a few days ahead of the French, they found their transport ships had not arrived.

25|$|Neither Kent nor Somerset {{had won the}} Gillette Cup {{during its}} {{four-year}} history. Somerset had been losing semi-finalists during the 1966 competition, while Kent had never before made it beyond {{the second round of}} the tournament. If Kent won, it would their first competition win since the 1928 County Championship, while Somerset had never before won a county tournament. In his preview of the match for The Times, John Woodcock opined that Kent were the favourites, as long as they could cope with Bill Alley, the Somerset all-rounder. Kent <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> a successful 1967 season, and started the day with the prospect of winning not only the Gillette Cup, but also the County Championship. They sat atop the Championship table with 176 points, though Yorkshire could secure the trophy with points from their final match of the season.|$|E

25|$|Paget's {{migration}} from England {{took him into}} a war zone, as the Dutch <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> the Eighty Years' War to secure their independence from Spain. It also took him into Dutch employment, although initially under English direction. For two years Paget was chaplain to the English troops fighting under Sir John Ogle and Sir Horace Vere. Ogle commanded one of four units and was second-in-command of the whole force, while Vere commanded another and had overall leadership of the English contingents, which since 1598 had been paid by the Dutch and formed part of the Dutch army. 1605 saw the English troops fighting well outside the Netherlands, alongside a Scottish force as well as Dutch troops, at Mülheim an der Ruhr, where they saved the day and suffered heavy casualties. Paget {{must have had a}} strenuous period of pastoral work and preaching in such difficult circumstances.|$|E
25|$|From 1927 to 1928, Cherniss {{studied with}} some of the leading classicists in Germany: in Göttingen with Hermann Fränkel and in Berlin with Werner Jaeger and Wilamowitz-Moellendorff.

These were relatively uneventful years between the hyperinflation of 1921-24 and the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. The 1920s saw a remarkable cultural renaissance in Germany. Influenced by the brief cultural explosion in the Soviet Union, German literature, cinema, theater, jazz, art, and architecture <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> a phase of great creativity. This was also a revolutionary time in classical studies and philosophy. Jaeger had published his famous work Aristotle: Fundamentals of the History of His Development in 1923.

25|$|In 1890, the {{election}} of {{several members of the}} labor-friendly Tennessee Farmers' Alliance among them Governor John P. Buchanan to the state government emboldened miners in the Coal Creek Valley to make several demands. One of the key demands was payment in cash rather than company scrip, which could either be used only at company-owned stores with marked up prices or redeemed for cash at a percentage of its value. Miners also demanded they be allowed to use their own checkweighmen the specialists who weighed the coal and determined how much a particular miner had earned instead of checkweighmen hired by the company. Since state laws already barred scrip payment and company-hired checkweighmen, most mine owners accepted the demands, though they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> an economic downturn. However, the Tennessee Coal Mining Company (TCMC), which operated a mine near Briceville, rejected the demands, and on April 1, 1891, shut down operations. Two months later, the company demanded its miners sign an iron-clad contract before returning to work. The miners refused.|$|E
