25|$|An {{equivalent}} way {{of describing}} the cograph formed from a cotree is that two vertices are connected by an edge if {{and only if}} the lowest common ancestor of the corresponding leaves is labeled by 1.

30|$|The {{empirical}} {{analysis is}} done with individual-level data. However, the analysis requires the estimation of percentiles of the wage or predicted wage distribution for MSAs/CMSAs, by month or year.

25|$|Another {{generalization}} is the finitely additive measure, {{which are}} sometimes called contents. This {{is the same}} as a measure except that instead of requiring countable additivity <b>we</b> <b>require</b> only finite additivity. Historically, this definition was used first. It turns out that in general, finitely additive measures are connected with notions such as Banach limits, the dual of L∞ and the Stone–Čech compactification. All these are linked {{in one way or another}} to the axiom of choice.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{definition}} of a PostBQP circuit family is one with two outbit qubits P (postselection) and Q (output) with a single measurement of P and Q at the end such that the probability of measuring P=1 has nonzero probability, the conditional probability Pr≥2/3 if the inputx is in the language, and Pr≥2/3 if the input x {{is not in the}} language. For technical reasons we tweak the {{definition of}} PostBQP as follows: <b>we</b> <b>require</b> that Pr≥2n'c for some constant c depending on the circuit family. Note this choice does not affect the basic properties of PostBQP, and also it can be shown that any computation consisting of typical gates (e.g. Hadamard, Toffoli) has this property whenever Pr>0.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have studied}} demand in rats {{in a manner}} {{distinct}} from studying labor supply in pigeons. Specifically, in an operant conditioning chamber containing rats as experimental subjects, <b>we</b> <b>require</b> them to press a bar, instead of pecking a small disk, to receive a reward. The reward can be food (reward pellets), water, or a commodity drink such as cherry cola. Unlike in previous pigeon studies, where the work analog was pecking and the monetary analog was reward, the work analog in this experiment is bar-pressing. Under these circumstances, the researchers claim that changing the number of bar presses required to obtain a commodity item is analogous to changing {{the price of a}} commodity item in human economics.|$|E

We determined the sample size based on a power analysis with the R package powerbydesign (Papenmeier, 2018).

The power analysis revealed that <b>we</b> <b>required</b> a sample size of at least 38 {{in order to achieve}} a power of [...]. 8 for our predicted interaction.

25|$|An {{analytic}} proposition is true {{by nature}} {{of the meaning of}} the words in the sentence — <b>we</b> <b>require</b> no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition. On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells us something about the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary predicate of the body; until we are told the heaviness of the body we do not know that it has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. Hume) and rationalists (cf. Leibniz) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.|$|E
25|$|Martin and Sugarman {{describe}} {{memory and}} imagination as two ontic (real) characteristics {{of human nature}} which are vital to humans' capacity for dialogue. According to Martin and Sugarman, it is through both that {{people are able to}} remember the conversations that “we furnished with the symbolic and relational tools <b>we</b> <b>require</b> to consider past experiences and previous learning, and to entertain future possibilities” because memory allows humans to reconstruct their past while imagination allows them “to project selves into the future”. In other words, when humans converse with others, they recall memories and imagine future possibilities to help themselves mentally construct potential ways for understanding themselves (self-interpretation) and their world, and their place in it, so they know how to relate to others.|$|E
25|$|In short, total {{least squares}} {{does not have}} the {{property}} of units-invariancei.e. it is not scale invariant. For a meaningful model <b>we</b> <b>require</b> this property to hold. A way forward is to realise that residuals (distances) measured in different units can be combined if multiplication is used instead of addition. Consider fitting a line: for each data point the product of the vertical and horizontal residuals equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the residual lines and the fitted line. We choose the line which minimizes the sum of these areas. Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson proved in 1942 that, in two dimensions, it is the only line expressible solely in terms of the ratios of standard deviations and the correlation coefficient which (1) fits the correct equation when the observations fall on a straight line; (2) exhibits scale invariance, and (3) exhibits invariance under interchange of variables. This line has been rediscovered in different disciplines and is variously known as standardised major axis (Ricker 1975, Warton et al., 2006), the reduced major axis, the geometric mean functional relationship (Draper and Smith, 1998), least products regression, diagonal regression, line of organic correlation, and the least areas line. Tofallis (2002) has extended this approach to deal with multiple variables.|$|E
