5|$|The {{work done}} on the film to date was nearly lost in 1998 {{when one of the}} animators, while {{routinely}} clearing some files, accidentally started a deletion of the root folder of the Toy Story 2 assets on Pixar's internal servers. Associate technical director Oren Jacobs {{was one of the first}} to notice as character models disappeared from their works in progress. They shut down the file servers but had lost 90% of the last two years of work, and the backups were found to have failed some time previously. The film was saved when technical director Galyn Susman, who had been <b>working</b> <b>from</b> <b>home</b> to take care of her newborn child, revealed she had backups of the assets on her home computer. The Pixar team was able to recover nearly all of the lost assets save for a few recent days of work, allowing the film to proceed.|$|E

40|$|Using multiwave {{survey data}} {{collected}} among 251 financial sales professionals, we tested whether involuntarily <b>working</b> more <b>from</b> <b>home</b> (teleworking) {{was related to}} higher time-based and strain-based work-to-family conflict (WFC). Employees' boundary management strategy (integration vs. segmentation) and work-family balance self-efficacy were considered as moderators of these relationships. Data were collected one month before, three months after, and 12 [*]months after {{the implementation of a}} new cost-saving policy that eliminated employees' access to office space in a centralized work location. The policy resulted in employees being forced to work more <b>from</b> <b>home.</b> A voluntary telework program had been in effect before the new policy, implying that <b>working</b> more <b>from</b> <b>home</b> {{as a result of the}} new policy was involuntary in nature. Results revealed that involuntarily <b>working</b> more <b>from</b> <b>home</b> was associated with higher strain-based WFC but not higher time-based WFC. However, moderator analyses revealed that the positive association between involuntarily <b>working</b> more <b>from</b> <b>home</b> and both types of WFC was significantly stronger among employees with weaker self-efficacy in balancing work and family. Boundary management strategy had no detectable moderating effect...|$|R
40|$|On-call work is {{becoming}} an increasingly common work pattern, yet the human impacts {{of this type of}} work are not well established. Given the likelihood of calls to occur outside regular work hours, {{it is important to consider}} the potential impact of working on-call on stress physiology and sleep. The aims of this review were to collate and evaluate evidence on the effects of <b>working</b> on-call <b>from</b> <b>home</b> on stress physiology and sleep. A systematic search of Ebsco Host, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and ScienceDirect was conducted. Search terms included: on-call, on call, standby, sleep, cortisol, heart rate, adrenaline, noradrenaline, nor-adrenaline, epinephrine, norepinephrine, nor-epinephrine, salivary alpha amylase and alpha amylase. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, with only one study investigating the effect of <b>working</b> on-call <b>from</b> <b>home</b> on stress physiology. All eight studies investigated the effect of <b>working</b> on-call <b>from</b> <b>home</b> on sleep. Working on-call <b>from</b> <b>home</b> appears to adversely affect sleep quantity, and in most cases, sleep quality. However, studies did not differentiate between night 2 ̆ 7 s on-call <b>from</b> <b>home</b> with and without calls. Data examining the effect of <b>working</b> on-call <b>from</b> <b>home</b> on stress physiology were not sufficient to draw meaningful conclusions...|$|R

25|$|The Internet allows {{computer}} users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with computer security, i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, {{depending on the}} requirements. This is encouraging new ways of <b>working</b> <b>from</b> <b>home,</b> collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before {{the widespread use of}} the Internet, but the cost of private leased lines would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps {{on the other side of}} the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using cloud computing, or open a remote desktop session into their office PC using a secure virtual private network (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among system administrators as the Virtual Private Nightmare, because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.|$|E
