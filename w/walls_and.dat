Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the sixteenth century, the premises were leased to the town council in 1541, who desired to use the stone to make repairs to the town <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> the harbour facilities. In succeeding centuries many different uses have {{been made of the}} site, which is currently occupied by an office block and part of Bristol Dental School.|$|E

5|$|Most of Norwich's city <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> {{all of the}} gatehouses, were {{demolished}} in {{the late}} 18th and 19th century as the city industrialised, but the Cow Tower avoided destruction. The tower was now owned by the Trustees of the Great Hospital, who carried out repairs to the structure in the late 19th century, and in 1904, the British Army considered repairing the tower for use as an ammunition depot. The repairs in the 19th century had used modern concrete when patching the <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> this, combined with erosion from the river, soon caused extensive damage: wide splits formed {{up and down the}} tower along its northern side.|$|E

Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.|$|E
