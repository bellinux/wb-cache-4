5|$|Clark is {{best known}} as a <b>war</b> <b>hero</b> of the Revolutionary War in the West, {{especially}} {{as the leader of the}} secret expeditionary forces that captured Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes in 1778–79. Some historians have suggested that the campaign supported American claims to the Northwest Territory during negotiations that resulted in the Treaty of Paris (1783).|$|E

5000|$|In 1967, Franz began freelancing for the Derby, Connecticut-based Charlton Comics, {{where he}} wrote (and {{occasionally}} helped draw) war-comics stories for such titles as Army <b>War</b> <b>Heroes,</b> D-Day, Fightin' Army, Marine <b>War</b> <b>Heroes,</b> and <b>War</b> <b>Heroes.</b> With artist Sam Glanzman, Franz co-created the feature [...] "The Iron Corporal", starring a World War II American corporal {{fighting with the}} Australian army in the Southwest Pacific, in a 10-page story in Army <b>War</b> <b>Heroes</b> #22 (Nov. 1967). It appeared in most subsequent issues through #37 (April 1970), with the script credited mostly to Willi Franz.|$|R

5|$|Ender, now {{ten years}} old, is {{promoted}} to Command School on Eros {{after a brief}} respite on Earth. After some preliminary battles in the simulator, he is introduced to a former <b>war</b> <b>hero,</b> Mazer Rackham. From now on, Ender participates in simulations created and controlled by Mazer. As the skirmishes become harder, he is joined by {{some of his friends}} from the Battle School as sub-commanders. Despite this, Ender becomes depressed by the battles, his isolation, and by the way Mazer treats him.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{faith in}} Johnson {{to balance the}} ticket proved misplaced. In the general election, Johnson cost the Democrats votes in the South, where his {{relationship}} with Chinn was particularly unpopular. He also failed to garner much support from the West, where {{he was supposed to}} be strong due to his reputation as an Indian fighter and <b>war</b> <b>hero.</b> He even failed to deliver his home state of Kentucky for the Democrats. Regardless, the Democrats still won the popular vote.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{was split}} into two parts. The first group, composed of around eight hundred colonial troops and led by Commandant Louis-Napoléon Chaltin, {{was to take the}} main road towards Rejaf and engage the rebels openly. The second, under Belgian <b>war</b> <b>hero</b> Baron Dhanis, was a much larger force of over three-thousand men, mostly natives from the Tetela ethnic group, and was to take a treacherous path through the jungle to the north. Both expeditions left for the Lado Enclave in December 1896.|$|E

5|$|As the {{convention}} opened, some delegates favored Bayard, a conservative senator, while others supported Hancock, a career soldier and Civil <b>War</b> <b>hero.</b> Still others flocked to men {{they saw as}} surrogates for Tilden, including Henry B. Payne from Ohio, an attorney and former congressman, and Samuel J. Randall from Pennsylvania, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. The first round of balloting was inconclusive, with Hancock and Bayard leading the count. Before the second round, Tilden's withdrawal from the campaign became known for certain; delegates then shifted to Hancock, who was nominated. William Hayden English, a conservative politician and businessman from the swing state of Indiana, was nominated for vice president.|$|E
5|$|At the 1933 World Scout Jamboree, a 14-year-old Scout named Bela Bánáthy was {{kneeling}} by his campfire when three uniformed men rode up on horseback: Count Paul Teleki, the Chief Scout of Hungary and the Chief of Staff for the jamboree; General Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, a general staff {{officer of the}} Royal Hungarian Army; and Baden-Powell, the British hero of the Boer War and Chief Scout of the World. The men introduced themselves to the Scout and inspected his camp. They complimented him on {{a job well done}} and rode on. Meeting the Chief Scout of Hungary and Boer <b>War</b> <b>hero</b> Robert Baden-Powell left a deep impression on Bánáthy. He decided he would become a military officer instead of a minister.|$|E
5|$|Back at the front, Potemkin {{won more}} {{military}} acclaim, but then fell ill; rejecting medicine, he recovered only slowly. After {{a lull in}} hostilities in 1772 his movements are unclear, {{but it seems that}} he returned to St. Petersburg where he is recorded, perhaps apocryphally, to have been one of Catherine's closest advisers. Though Orlov was replaced as her favourite, it was not Potemkin who benefited. Alexander Vasilchikov, another Horse-Guardsman, replaced Orlov as the queen's lover. Potemkin returned to war in 1773 as Lieutenant-General to fight in Silistria. It appears that Catherine missed him, and that Potemkin took a December letter from her as a summons. In any case Potemkin returned to St. Petersburg as a <b>war</b> <b>hero.</b>|$|E

5|$|Kent Hughes was Chairman of the Organising Committee for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. His {{chairmanship}} {{was widely}} judged a success, {{and he left}} a lasting legacy by engineering the sale of television rights, an Olympic first. Despite his high profile, Menzies removed Kent Hughes from his ministry in early 1956. He {{spent the rest of}} his career as a backbencher, dying in office in 1970. Kent Hughes was famous for his stubbornness and abrasive personality, particularly the insults he directed at opponents. He was sympathetic towards fascism early in his career (generally overlooked due to his later status as a <b>war</b> <b>hero),</b> and later became an ardent anti-communist.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the presidential}} {{election}} of 1868, Wilson toured the South giving political speeches. Many in the press believed Wilson was promoting himself to be the Republican presidential candidate. Wilson, however, supported the Civil <b>War</b> <b>hero</b> General Ulysses S. Grant. During Reconstruction Grant supported Republican Congressional initiatives rather than President Johnson's, and during the dispute over the Tenure of Office Act which led to Johnson's impeachment, Grant served as temporary Secretary of War, but then returned the Department to Radical ally Edwin M. Stanton's control over Johnson's strong objection, making Grant a favorite to many Radicals.|$|E
5|$|The Keynesian Revolution was {{associated}} with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post-war period. Keynesian ideas became so popular that some scholars point to Keynes as representing the ideals of modern liberalism, as Adam Smith represented the ideals of classical liberalism. After the war, Winston Churchill attempted to check the rise of Keynesian policy-making in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the mixed economy in his 1945 election campaign. Despite his popularity as a <b>war</b> <b>hero,</b> Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee whose government's economic policy continued to be influenced by Keynes's ideas.|$|E

5|$|The main Whig contenders in 1848 were Clay again, and two <b>war</b> <b>hero</b> generals {{with little}} {{political}} experience, Winfield Scott and Zachary Taylor. Seward supported the nominee, General Taylor. The former governor was less {{enthusiastic about the}} vice-presidential candidate, New York Comptroller Millard Fillmore, a rival of his from Buffalo. Nevertheless, he campaigned widely for the Whigs against the Democratic presidential candidate, former Michigan senator Lewis Cass. The two major parties did not make slavery {{an issue in the}} campaign. The Free Soil Party, mostly Liberty Party members and some Northern Democrats, nominated former president Van Buren. The Taylor/Fillmore ticket was elected, and the split in the New York Democratic Party allowed the Whigs to capture the legislature.|$|E
5|$|The second movie Cagney's company {{produced}} was Blood on the Sun. Insisting {{on doing}} his own stunts, Cagney required judo training from expert Ken Kuniyuki and Jack Halloran, a former policeman. The Cagneys {{had hoped that}} an action film would appeal more to audiences, but it fared worse {{at the box office}} than Johnny Come Lately. At this time, Cagney heard of young <b>war</b> <b>hero</b> Audie Murphy, who had appeared on the cover of Life magazine. Cagney thought that Murphy had the looks to be a movie star, and suggested that he come to Hollywood. Cagney felt, however, that Murphy could not act, and his contract was loaned out and then sold.|$|E
5|$|Van Buren {{soon became}} a major target of {{criticism}} from the Whigs following the Panic of 1837. Seeking to run a non-controversial and less ideological <b>war</b> <b>hero</b> who could defeat Van Buren based on popularity, a unified Whig Party nominated Harrison over party founder Henry Clay and fellow general Winfield Scott. John Tyler of Virginia was selected as his running mate, and Harrison and Tyler defeated Van Buren in the 1840 election. At the time, he was the oldest president ever elected. However, Harrison died of pneumonia in April 1841, a month after taking office. Tyler then assumed the presidency, setting a major precedent.|$|E
