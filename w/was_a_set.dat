5|$|In the English towns the {{burgage tenure}} for urban {{properties}} was established {{early on in}} the medieval period, and was based primarily on tenants paying cash rents rather than providing labour services. Further development of a set of taxes that could be raised by the towns included murage for walls, pavage for streets, and pontage, a temporary tax for the repair of bridges. Combined with the lex mercatoria, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of codes and customary practices governing trading, these provided a reasonable basis for the economic governance of the towns.|$|E

In 2007, on Hergé's centenary, Belgium issued its €20 (silver) Hergé/Tintin coin.|$|E

5|$|After his {{graduation}} as {{an architect}} in 1878, Gaudí's first work <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of lampposts for the Plaça Reial, the project for the Girossi newsstands and the Mataró cooperative, which was his first important work. He received the request from the city council of Barcelona in February 1878, when he had graduated but not yet received his degree, which was sent from Madrid on 15 March of the same year. For this commission he designed two types of lampposts: one with six arms, of which two were installed in the Plaça Reial, and another with three, of which two were installed in the Pla del Palau, opposite the Civil Government. The lampposts were inaugurated during the Mercè festivities in 1879. Made of cast iron with a marble base, they have a decoration in which the caduceus of Mercury is prominent, symbol of commerce and emblem of Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Carol would be filmed in Cincinnati, Ohio, and production offices would open in early January 2014, with filming expected from mid-March through May. In February 2014, the Greater Cincinnati & Northern Kentucky Film Commission released the solicitation from producers for extras and vintage vehicles. Principal photography began on March 12, 2014, at Eden Park in Cincinnati. Various locations around Cincinnati, Ohio were used during production, including Downtown Cincinnati, Hyde Park, Over-the-Rhine, Wyoming, Cheviot, and Hamilton, as well as Alexandria, Kentucky. Except for the Waterloo, Iowa, motel room, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> built for privacy during filming of the love scene, actual locations were used for interior and exterior settings. The second floor of a now-defunct department store served as the location for the toy department of the fictional Frankenberg's. Filming was completed on May 2, 2014. The film was shot in 34 days. Edward Lachman shot Carol on Super 16 mm film using 35 mm format lenses.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{took place}} almost entirely in London. The {{directors}} somewhat followed the filming style of Bharat Nalluri, {{the director of}} the first two episodes of series one and two, who used London and the River Thames as characters in themselves. The exterior and interior of Freemasons' Hall continued to be a stand-in for Thames House, the headquarters of MI5. However, the Grid, the base of operations of Section D, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> constructed at the fifth floor in another building. Danny's apartment was also filmed in the same building. Another constructed set was the back of mobile surveillance vans, which was housed near the Grid set.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{scholarship}} {{was extended to}} permit Sullivan to spend one year in Leipzig, he stayed for three years. There, he became friendly with the impresario Carl Rosa and the violinist Joseph Joachim. For his last year at Leipzig, his father scraped together the money for living expenses, and the conservatoire assisted by waiving its fees. Sullivan credited his Leipzig period with tremendous musical growth. His graduation piece, completed in 1861, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of incidental music to Shakespeare's The Tempest. Revised and expanded, it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862, a year after his return to London, and was an immediate sensation. He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer.|$|E
5|$|To save money, many sets, {{particularly}} interiors, were redresses {{of existing}} sets. The Enterprise bridge was reconfigured {{to stand in}} for the Grissom, with the chairs reupholstered and the central computer consoles moved to modify the floor plan. An Earth bar and the Klingon medical bay were redresses of the Enterprise sickbay. The Klingon bridge <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> that Nimoy appropriated from another production. Many blinking consoles were rented from a props company rather than being fabricated. The Enterprise bridge itself remained largely unchanged from its appearance in the previous films, though the floor was repainted from black to grey to make it photograph better. The most drastic change was made to Spock's quarters. Nimoy had felt the previous grey color scheme did not express a Vulcan style, and had it brightened with yellows and oranges.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

5|$|The trip to Lorraine in 1564 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> {{back for}} his health {{but he soon}} {{recovered}} and embarked on his greatest project yet, a project which would extend far beyond his cartographic interests. The first element was the Chronologia, {{a list of all}} significant events {{since the beginning of the}} world compiled from his literal reading of the bible and no less than 123 other authors of genealogies and histories of every empire that had ever existed. Mercator was the first to link historical dates of solar and lunar eclipses to Julian dates calculated mathematically from his knowledge of the motions of the sun, moon and Earth. He then fixed the dates of other events in Babylonian, Greek, Hebrew and Roman calendars relative to the eclipses that they recorded. The time origin was fixed from the genealogies of the Bible as 3965 years before the birth of Christ. This huge volume (400 pages) was greeted with acclaim by scholars throughout Europe and Mercator himself considered it to be his greatest achievement up to that time. On the other hand, the Catholic Church placed the work on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (List of Prohibited Books) because Mercator included the deeds of Martin Luther. Had he published such a work in Louvain he would again be laying himself open to charges of heresy.|$|E
