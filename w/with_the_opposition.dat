5|$|As the {{political}} conflict escalated into full-scale rebellion in 1321–22, Edmund {{played an important}} role in its suppression. The opposition stemmed from resentment against the king's new favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger and Hugh Despenser the Elder. When Bartholomew Badlesmere, steward of the royal household, defected to the opposition, Edward made his youngest brother Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in place of Badlesmere on 16 June. In the parliament of July 1321, Edmund briefly sided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> when he agreed to exile the Despensers, but later claimed this had been done under duress, and in November sat on the council that annulled the exile.|$|E

5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the March 1960 {{parliamentary}} election {{which resulted in}} a hung parliament. The new Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake tried to get ITAK's support for his minority government but refused to give into ITAK's demands to end state-sponsored colonisation of Tamil-majority areas by Sinhalese, regional autonomy and the rights of Indian Tamils. As a result, ITAK started negotiations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> SLFP who agreed to introduce the provisions of the B-C pact as bills in parliament. During the negotiations on forming an alternate stable government Chelvanayakam informed the Governor-General that ITAK would support a SLFP government for a full term and as result the Governor-General dissolved parliament.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{exclusive}} {{access to the}} King provoked {{several members of the}} nobility, and in 1307 the King was again forced to send him into exile. During this absence he served as the King's Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Edward managed to negotiate a deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition,</b> however, and Gaveston returned the next year. Upon his return his behaviour became even more offensive, and by the Ordinances of 1311 it was decided that Gaveston should be exiled for a third time, to suffer outlawry if he returned. When he did return in 1312, he was hunted down and executed by a group of magnates led by Thomas of Lancaster and Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the reign}} of Edward II was {{initially}} harmonious, he soon met with opposition from several of his earls and prelates. At {{the source of the}} discontent was the king's relationship with the young Gascon knight Piers Gaveston, who had been exiled by Edward I, but was recalled immediately upon Edward II's accession. Edward's favouritism towards the upstart Gaveston was an offence to the established nobility, and his elevation to the earldom of Cornwall was particularly offensive to the established nobility. A group of magnates led by Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, forced Gaveston into exile in 1308. By 1309, however, Edward had reconciled himself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition,</b> and Gaveston was allowed to return.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a secret}} {{agreement}} originally stated that Odlum would take power after six months, {{his support for}} Cuba and similar left-wing nations led to American pressure to keep him out. After months of negotiations, Odlum was dismissed as Deputy Prime Minister, and the ensuing government weakness and infighting led to its defeat in the 1982 election. In opposition, Odlum was made Ambassador to the United Nations, resigning in 1996. When the Labour Party came to power again a year later, he became Foreign Minister, overseeing the establishment of stronger relations with both Cuba and China. Amidst controversy over his alleged alliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition,</b> Odlum resigned in 2001.

5|$|During the Bahraini {{uprising}} of 2011, the Khawalid brothers {{objected to}} compromise <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> and instead preferred crackdown. After a failed {{round of negotiations}} led by the CP, the Khawalid brothers led the crackdown, described as the widest in Bahrain's modern history. The Commander in Chief of the army, Khalifa bin Ahmed, was given wide authority with the announcement of martial law; he led a main crackdown operation, presided over military courts and made several interviews with regional and local media. Another Al Khawalid involved in the crackdown was the then-director of the National Security Agency, which {{was found to be}} responsible for arbitrary arrests and systematic torture. The crackdown empowered the Khawalid brothers faction further and marginalized the CP, who found himself and allies stripped from their powers.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{problems}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> did not {{end with}} the Falkirk campaign. Over the following years he would be held up to the promises he had made, in particular that of upholding the Charter of the Forest. In the parliament of 1301, the King was forced to order {{an assessment of the}} royal forests, but in 1305 he obtained a papal bull that freed him from this concession. Ultimately, it was a failure in personnel that spelt the end of the opposition against EdwardI. Bohun died late in 1298, after returning from the Falkirk campaign. As for Bigod, in 1302 he arrived at an agreement with the King that was beneficial for both: Bigod, who had no children, made Edward his heir, in return for a generous annual grant. Edward finally got his revenge on Winchelsey in 1305, when Clement V was elected pope. Clement was a Gascon sympathetic to the King, and on Edward's instigation had Winchelsey suspended from office.|$|E

5|$|Kerry {{bounced back}} in the 200m {{backstroke}} and won his heat to qualify third-fastest, before claiming bronze {{in a time of}} 2m 3.14s behind the Hungarian duo of Sándor Wladár and Zoltán Verrasztó. He edged out the Soviet Union's Vladimir Shemetov by 0.34s, becoming the first Australian to win a medal in an individual backstroke event since David Theile in 1960. In the 4200m freestyle relay, he combined with Tonelli, Graeme Brewer and Ron McKeon as Australia came seventh after qualifying fourth. The Australians were sixth at the halfway point when Kerry jumped in for the third leg. Kerry moved Australia into fifth {{by the end of his}} leg, just 0.78s from the bronze medal position, after posting a split time of 1m 52.64s, the 18th fastest split in the race. However, McKeon could not keep pace <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> anchor swimmers, and Australia finished seventh, 1.52s outside the medals.|$|E
5|$|Nationwide strikes {{broke out}} {{in the spring and summer}} of 1988. They were much weaker than the strikes of 1980 and were {{discontinued}} after the intervention by Wałęsa, who secured the regime's commitment to begin negotiations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition.</b> The strikes were the last act of active political involvement of the working class in the history of People's Poland and were led by young workers, not connected to Solidarity veterans and opposed to socially harmful consequences of the economic restructuring in progress at that time. According to the researcher Maciej Gdula, the political activity that followed was conducted exclusively by the elites. It was neither inspired by nor consulted with any mass social organization or movement, as the opposition leading circles freed themselves from their strong in the past commitment to the welfare of working people. No longer secure as undisputed leaders, Polish dissidents of the KOR-Solidarity generations were eager to bargain with the weakened regime whose economic goals they now shared.|$|E
5|$|Whitlam's Labor {{government}} {{had been elected}} in 1972 with a small majority in the House of Representatives, but <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Opposition</b> controlling the Senate. Another election in 1974 resulted in little change. While the Whitlam Government introduced many new policies and programs, it was also rocked by scandals and political miscalculations. In October 1975, the Opposition used its control of the Senate to defer passage of appropriation bills, which finance governmental operations and which had been passed by the House of Representatives. The Opposition stated that they would {{continue to do so}} unless Whitlam called an election for the House of Representatives and urged Kerr to dismiss Whitlam unless he agreed to their demand. Whitlam believed that Kerr would not dismiss him, and Kerr did nothing to disabuse Whitlam of this notion.|$|E

5|$|A dyarchy {{was created}} in Madras Presidency in 1920 as per the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms with {{provisions}} made for elections in the presidency. Democratically elected governments would henceforth share power with the Governor's autocratic establishment. Following the first elections held in November 1920, the Justice Party, an organisation established in 1916 to campaign for increased representation of non-Brahmins in the administration, came to power. A. Subbarayalu Reddiar became the first Chief Minister of the Madras Presidency but resigned soon after due to declining health {{and was replaced by}} P. Ramarayaningar, Minister of Local Self-Government and Public Health, popularly known as the Raja of Panagal. The party split in late 1923 when C. R. Reddy resigned from primary membership and formed a splinter group allied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> Swarajists. A motion of no-confidence was proposed against Ramarayaningar's government on 27 November 1923, but was defeated 65–44. Ramarayaningar remained in power until November 1926. The enactment in August 1921 of the first communal Government Order (G.O. No. 613), which introduced caste-based communal reservations in government jobs, remains one of the high points of his rule. In the following elections of 1926 the Justice Party lost. However, as no party was able to obtain a clear majority, the Governor, Lord Goschen, set up a cross-party government under the leadership of P. Subbarayan and nominated its supporting members. In the election of 1930, the Justice Party was victorious, and P. Munuswamy Naidu became Chief Minister. The exclusion of Zamindars from the Ministry split the Justice Party once again. Fearing a no-confidence motion against him, Munuswamy Naidu resigned in November 1932 and the Raja of Bobbili was appointed Chief Minister in his place. The Justice Party eventually lost the 1937 elections to the Indian National Congress, and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari became Chief Minister of Madras Presidency.|$|E
