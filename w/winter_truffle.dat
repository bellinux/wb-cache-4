50|$|Tuber brumale, {{also known}} as the brumale truffle or <b>winter</b> <b>truffle,</b> is a species of truffle native to Southern Europe. It is {{naturally}} present in the soils of many truffle orchards.|$|E
50|$|The {{black truffle}} is morphologically {{very similar to}} the commercially less {{valuable}} Chinese truffle (Tuber indicum). To avoid fraud or misidentifications in commerce, a RFLP genetic test has been developed to distinguish the two species. Externally, they can be distinguished by their skin, which is smoother and dark red or dark brown in the Chinese truffle. Two other similar truffle species are the summer truffle (Tuber aestivum) and the <b>winter</b> <b>truffle</b> (Tuber brumale), whose flesh is of a lighter color.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: The species {{diversity}} within the genus Tuber {{is a highly}} mysterious. The aims {{of this study are}} to give detailed taxonomical, morphological and ecological characteristics of the new species Tuber decipiens. Material and Method: Based on fungarium studies, field observations and historical review, morphological studies have been conducted on the species. The recording morphological details were carried out using a microscope. Results and Conclusions: Tuber decipiens is a black colored truffle and a new species belonging to order Pezizales and family Tuberaceae. It was found in autumn (Novmber-December 2010) near the Adriatic Sea (Rovinj, Croatia) and grows in pure pine forest (Pinus halepensis) in the calcareous-gravel soil (pH 7. 5 – 7. 8). Tuber decipiens is different in the morphological and other characteristics from all the other known black. The new species is most similar to the <b>winter</b> <b>truffle</b> Tuber brumale var. moscatum which grows in autumn andwinter in symbiosis with deciduous trees. Unlike the <b>winter</b> <b>truffle,</b> a new species (Tuber decipiens) grows in symbiosis with Pinus halepensis and permanently has a basal depression with one or more cavities, clearly visible in the cross section of fruitbodies. Very important characteristics are the color of gleba, which is never blackish or black and in mature fruitbodies remains gray-brownish, the asci are spherical or very rarely ovoid-ellipsoid, containing 1 – 6 spores. The odor of the new species is not pleasant and reminiscent of the soil or mouldwhile the odor of Tuber brumale var. moscatum is delicate and persistent, and reminiscent of the musk. Tuber decipiens, a new species from Croatia is described...|$|E
50|$|Boars and {{the larvae}} of the truffle fly (Suillia tuberiperda), which eat the fruiting bodies, {{aid in the}} {{distribution}} of the species by excreting the indigestible spores. Their excrement likely also serves to fertilize the spores. Black truffles are sometimes found together with <b>winter</b> <b>truffles,</b> which aid the growth of black truffles in wet soils.|$|R
40|$|Tuber donnagotto {{is a new}} <b>winter</b> black <b>truffle</b> {{belonging}} to the order Pezizales and the family Tuberaceae. It grows in winter in the calcareous gravel soil (pH 7. 6 – 7. 8) near the Adriatic Sea (Rovinj, Istria, Croatia) in predominantly pine forests (Pinus halepensis). Although similar to other black truffles, it has very irregular and hard fruit bodies, lobate and knotted in form, with deep irregular cavities reaching {{the middle of the}} fruit bodies. These cavities are clearly evident in the cross-section of the fruit bodies. A distinctive characteristic of this truffle is the fact that when it is hermetically closed it can be kept in a refrigerator (2 – 4 °C) for more than 60 days. Tuber donnagotto has a slight but pleasant odor, reminiscent of boletus (Boletus reticulates, B. edulis). Furthermore, T. donnagotto has yellow-brownish and reticulate-alveolate spores, measuring 20 – 30 × 20 – 25 mm...|$|R
