5|$|Blackburn {{was killed}} when a {{pyroclastic}} flow enveloped the area where he was camped out. His car was found four days later, surrounded up to the <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> ash with his body inside. The windows had been broken and ash filled {{the interior of the}} vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Current {{advice is}} that opening <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> advance of a tornado wastes time {{that could be}} spent seeking shelter. Also, being near windows is very {{dangerous}} during a severe weather event, possibly exposing people to flying glass.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, the {{location}} of the window versus the whole of the image must be adjusted so that most of the image is seen beyond the <b>window.</b> <b>In</b> the case of viewing on a 3D TV set, it is easier to place the <b>window</b> <b>in</b> front of the image, and to let the <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the plane of the screen.|$|R

50|$|The {{windows are}} three- and four-light, in the Perpendicular style, mostly {{dating from the}} 15th century. The <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the north aisle is {{reticulated}} and the east <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the chapel to the south is curvilinear. The chancel has two-light casement windows.|$|R

5|$|The Operative: No One Lives Forever is a first-person shooter {{video game}} with stealth {{gameplay}} elements, developed by Monolith Productions {{and published by}} Fox Interactive, released for Microsoft <b>Windows</b> <b>in</b> 2000. The game was ported later to the PlayStation 2 and Mac OS X.|$|E
5|$|The first {{automatic}} power {{windows were}} developed by Packard in 1940. Each of the major American brands experimented with the technology, which was initially for luxury vehicles {{as a replacement for}} manually operated roll up <b>windows.</b> <b>In</b> the 1950s, these became widespread in American passenger cars.|$|E
5|$|The <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the 19th-century part are {{topped with}} trefoils (a {{stonework}} pattern of three overlapping circles) and set into square frames. The north wall has three windows, {{one with a}} single light (or section) and two with pairs of lights; there are two windows on the south wall (one with three lights, another with two) {{as well as a}} blocked window at the east end of the wall. The church's east window is a pointed arch with a lower section of three trefoil-headed lights and two smaller lights on top. The <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the extension are set into pointed arches.|$|E
5000|$|The great west window, {{depicting}} the Tree of Jesse, was {{the gift of}} Dean George Waddington in 1867. It {{is the work of}} Clayton and Bell, who were also responsible for the Te Deum <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the South Transept(1869), the Four Doctors <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the North Transept(1875), and the Rose <b>Window</b> of Christ <b>in</b> Majesty (c.1876).|$|R
40|$|The {{flexibility}} <b>window</b> <b>in</b> zeolites {{was originally}} identified using geometric simulation as a hypothetical property of SiO 2 systems. The {{existence of the}} flexibility <b>window</b> <b>in</b> hypothetical structures may help us to identify those {{we might be able}} to synthesize in the future. We have previously found that the flexibility <b>window</b> <b>in</b> silicates is connected to phase transitions under pressure, structure amorphization and other physical behaviours and phenomena. We here extend the concept to ordered aluminosilicate systems using softer ‘bar’ constraints that permit additional flexibility around aluminium centres. Our experimental investigation of pressure-induced Q 1 amorphization in sodalites is consistent with the results of our modelling. The softer constraints allow us to identify a flexibility <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the anomalous case of goosecreekite...|$|R

5|$|Above {{the small}} family/chaplain's {{room on the}} third floor, was the servant's room with a corner {{fireplace}} and two windows on the mezzanine floor, accessed via the main staircase. Above, on the roof level, was the Warder's Chamber containing a stone-hooded fireplace, beamed ceiling, two small <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the east wall and a garderobe. There were also four closet-chambers in the turrets on the roof, used by staff.|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E
30|$|When {{the basic}} {{windows and the}} lengths of the basic windows are all the same, we get self-multiplication <b>window</b> <b>in</b> section  2.1. When the basic windows are {{different}} but the lengths of the basic window are all the same, we get mutual-multiplication <b>window</b> <b>in</b> section  2.2.|$|R

50|$|The <b>windows</b> are {{predominantly}} <b>in</b> shades of grey (Grisaille), with some coloured windows, especially the large <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the west facade.|$|R
5|$|At 5:30 am on April 19, {{dynamite}} {{was thrown}} through a front window of Z. Alexander Looby's home in north Nashville, apparently {{in retaliation for}} his support of the demonstrators. Although the explosion almost destroyed the house, Looby and his wife, who were asleep in a back bedroom, were not injured. More than 140 <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> a nearby dormitory were broken by the blast.|$|E
5|$|Baldur's Gate II was {{developed}} by BioWare and published by Black Isle Studios, and released for <b>Windows</b> <b>in</b> September 2000. The game uses the same Infinity Engine as Baldur's Gate, but with many improvements. BioWare dedicated the game to Daniel Walker, the company's second employee, who died in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Braid is a {{platform}} and puzzle video game developed by Number None. The game was originally released in August 2008 for the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade service.

5|$|During the Second French Empire (1852–70) further {{changes were}} made, {{mainly to the}} interior. Hippolyte de La Rochefoucauld (1804–63), who had been {{minister}} plenipotentiary in Germany and Florence, brought a fine collection of furniture and 18th century Venetian glass chandeliers when he retired. He restored the great stone staircase. Influenced by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc he decided to transform the large East tower into a library. He blocked up the old openings and pierced large new <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the old walls.|$|E

50|$|In the 1860s Charles Edmund Clutterbuck, {{a master}} stained glass artist, made two windows for the parish church. They are the south <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the vestry {{and the east}} <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the north aisle. Between the years 1880-1887 Oakley church was re-dedicated from Saint Matthew to Saint Mary.|$|R
