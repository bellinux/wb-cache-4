5|$|Like other rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} {{is regarded}} as having a low degree of toxicity, but its compounds should be handled <b>with</b> <b>care</b> nonetheless: for example, lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin. Lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated. Lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium and {{tellurium}} compounds {{are considered}} to be mildly toxic and need to be handled <b>with</b> <b>care,</b> although acute poisoning is rare. Tellurium poisoning is particularly difficult to treat as many chelation agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the toxicity of tellurium. Tellurium is not reported to be carcinogenic.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{projects}} such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct. Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and <b>with</b> <b>care.</b> He renewed the Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis, under which adultery was punishable by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.|$|E

5|$|Elemental iodine {{is also a}} skin irritant, {{and direct}} contact with skin can cause damage and solid iodine {{crystals}} should be handled <b>with</b> <b>care.</b> Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, dragonflies and damselflies are {{sought out}} as a hobby similar to birding and butterflying, known as oding, from the Latin name of the {{dragonfly}} order, Odonata. Oding is especially popular in Texas, where 225 different species of odonates have been observed. <b>With</b> <b>care,</b> and with dry fingers, dragonflies can be handled and released by oders, as {{can be done with}} butterflies, though it is not encouraged.|$|E
5|$|Niobium-containing {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, {{but some are}} toxic and should be treated <b>with</b> <b>care.</b> The short- and long-term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water-soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a median lethal dose (LD50) between 10 and 100mg/kg. For oral administration the toxicity is lower; a study with rats yielded a LD50 after seven days of 940mg/kg.|$|E

This paper reports a qualitative study informed by phenomenological philosophy, which developed a theory of how newly qualified nurses cope <b>with</b> <b>caring</b> for dying people in acute hospital medical wards. On the basis of the theory, interventions are proposed that could help support nurses in their work with dying people...|$|R

Halls are divided into flats accommodating several students. Each flat has a number of single rooms with shared kitchen and dining facilities, and a central lounge.|$|E
5|$|Thallium and its {{compounds}} {{are extremely}} toxic, and should be handled <b>with</b> <b>care.</b> There are numerous recorded cases of fatal thallium poisoning. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for thallium exposure in the workplace as 0.1mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) also set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 15mg/m3, thallium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} usually {{straightforward}} to identify. The white-rumped swift {{is similar to}} Pacific swift, but its slender body and long, deeply forked tail make it appear quite different from its more powerfully built relative. A possible pitfall is a partially leucistic common swift with a white rump. The Pacific swift can be distinguished <b>with</b> <b>care</b> by its deeper tail fork, longer wings, bigger head, larger white throat patch and patterned underparts. In parts of Southeast Asia, migrating Pacific swifts pass through the resident ranges of former subspecies, and good views are then necessary {{to be sure of}} correct identification.|$|E

5|$|Various {{substances}} {{have been}} used as shoe polish for hundreds of years, starting with natural substances such as wax and tallow. Modern polish formulas were introduced early in the 20th century and many of those original formulations are still in use today. Today, shoe polish is usually made from a mix of natural and synthetic materials, including naphtha, turpentine, dyes, and gum arabic, using straightforward chemical engineering processes. Shoe polish is usually flammable, can be toxic, and, if misused, can stain skin. It should be used in a well-ventilated area <b>with</b> <b>care</b> taken to protect clothes, carpet and furniture.|$|E
5|$|Customs, {{traditions and}} moral {{principles}} based on Buddhism {{were used as}} the bases of law. Specific laws were eventually developed and adopted. Samantapasadika, a 5th-century commentary, gives details of complex regulations on the theft of fish. The chief judicial officer was known as viniccayamacca and there were several judicial officers under him, known as vinicchayaka. Apart from them, village headmen and provincial governors were also given the power to issue judgments. The king was the final judge in legal disputes, and all cases against {{members of the royal}} family and high dignitaries of the state were judged by him. However, the king had to exercise this power <b>with</b> <b>care</b> and after consulting with his advisers. Udaya I recorded judgments that were regarded as important precedents in the royal library in order to maintain uniformity in judicial decisions.|$|E

5|$|In certain regions, {{presence}} or absence of certain scales may be a quick way to distinguish non-venomous and venomous snakes, but used <b>with</b> <b>care</b> and knowledge of exceptions. For example, in Myanmar, the {{presence or}} absence of loreal scales can be used to distinguish between relatively harmless Colubrids and lethally venomous Elapids. The rule of hand for this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the nasal scale and pre-ocular scale indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal. This rule-of-thumb cannot be used without care as it cannot be applied to vipers, which have a large number of small scales on the head. A careful check would also be needed to exclude known poisonous members of the Colubrid family such as Rhabdophis.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{has a low}} to {{moderate}} level of toxicity and should be handled <b>with</b> <b>care.</b> The injection of lanthanum solutions produces hyperglycemia, low blood pressure, degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations. The application in carbon arc light led to the exposure of people to rare earth element oxides and fluorides, which sometimes led to pneumoconiosis. As the La3+ ion is similar in size to the Ca2+ ion, it is sometimes used as an easily traced substitute for the latter in medical studies. Lanthanum, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. When injected into the brain, it acts as a painkiller, similarly to morphine and other opiates, though the mechanism behind this is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where {{ulceration}} is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to birth control pills, progestogen or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use of nicotine replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth <b>with</b> <b>care.</b> If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.|$|E
