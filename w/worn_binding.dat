Until recently women accomplished this by <b>wearing</b> <b>binding</b> and restrictive clothing. But in the 20 th century, the focus shifted from the shape of one's clothing, {{to the shape of}} the body itself. Diet, exercise, and plastic surgery have become normal for modern women.; This obsession has taken its toll on individuals and on society as a whole. As women become more focused on how they look, they become less able to focus on their education and careers. In addition, girls are becoming sexualized at younger and younger ages, and are increasingly susceptible to potentially fatal eating disorders...|$|R

This paper presents a summary of a comprehensive series of experiments designed to quantify landing biomechanics and the influence of external factors on the measures taken. Data were collected on-snow from participants performing straight aerials over table top snow jumps. Ground reaction force as well as joint kinematics and kinetics were found to be sensitive to boot <b>wear,</b> <b>binding</b> angle and jump dimension changes.

For each component chosen, there exist some failure modes that can be determined by reviewing past failures, inspection records and non-destructive testing (NDT) measurements. The major failure modes in rolling stock components include disconnection, fracture, fatigue, cracked, degraded, deformed, stripped, <b>worn,</b> corroded, <b>binding,</b> leaking, buckled, sag, loose, misalignment and obstruct. Any of these failure modes or their combination can cause rolling stock to fail. For some rolling stock components, more than one failure mode may be present.|$|R

40|$|Footwear can be {{categorized}} as one of labour intensive and very superior export commodities, consequently the product quality must be maintained and be continually improved. The quality parameter of footwear {{is determined by the}} bonding strength between the uppers and the soles, it means that it depends on the adhesive applied. Soling system is widely applied in small and medium industries are cemented system used synthetic adhesive. Now, the adhesive was applied in the manufacturing of foot <b>wear</b> supported by <b>binding</b> of the soles and the uppers is easy to peel off because of the poor bonding strength. The aim of the research was to investigate a suitable synthetic adhesive formula to used in footwear manufacturing. In preparing of the adhesive formula, the effect of phenolic resin addition as tackifier were varies i. e 35, 45 and 55 phr using chloroprene rubber as raw material were observed. Synthetic adhesive compound was produce by two roll mill after that compound were dissolved in toluene with ratio 1 : 3. The prepared adhesive then was applied to manufacture footwear using cool press system. The soles used in the experiment were made of rubber and plastic material whereas the uppers made of either leather or artificial leather. The test result and data analysis showed that adhesive performed for the highest bonding strength as much as 1000 g/cm and decrease to lowest bonding strength after soaking in to water for 500 seconds one percent was obtained by the following formula that were : chloroprene rubber 100 phr, butylated hydroxyl toluene 2 phr, magnesium oxide 4 phr, zinc oxide 5 phr and phenolic resin 45 phr. The prepared formula performed a better bonding strength when it was compared with chloroperene rubber adhesive in market. The application of this prepared formula in making ladies shoes performed good bonding strength and accordance with the requierments of SNI 12 - 2942 - 1992 about Leather Pantopel Style Cemented System Ladies Shoes. ...|$|R
40|$|The Scarves of the Našice Region (Summary) While {{collecting}} {{items for}} the Country Museum of Našice and examining and gathering data about textile handwork of the Našice region, I have found that scarves and headcoverings {{which used to be}} worn in that territory were homemade on the weawing-loom. There are about fifty of them in the Country Museum of Našice. While I was doing the research I had the opportunity to observe the weaving and the forms of wearing the scarves in the course of eighty years. My field work is based on the aboriginal Croatian villages. There were two kinds of woven scarves: "zamotače" (binding scarves) i "široke marame" (wide scarves). The binding scarves are the oldest. They used to be worn until World War I, and soon afterwards women gradually ceased wearing them. During the thirties we find them worn only by the oldest women. They were woven out of cotton. Their form is square (about 80 x 82 cm). In order to achieve the desired form two halves are connected. Their decoration is a modest hem made on a waving-loom by several techniques: "usnivanje" (weaving narrow and wide threads in the walp), "pretkivanje" (reweaving) or "usnivanje" together with "boranje" (wrinkling) by the means of a board. The motive is geometrical. The decoration is made out of a single-coloured cotton and it may be white, red, black or blue. The binding scarves used to be the most universal. They were worn by women of all ages and also by girls at particular occasions. Those scarves were suitable for all occasions. The ones with the red hem were worn by younger women, while those with blue, black or white hem were worn by older women or by those which were crying for the dead and were in mourning. Such scarves are usually only hemmed and rarely with a lace. They were worn folded in a form of a triangle and tied in a single knot under the chin. They were put over "počelica" (a kind of a hood) or over "šamija" (a kind of a scarf) and never directly on hair, except if they were worn by girls. These scarves were also used to wrap the infants and also to cover a baby in a carved out crib. Around 1920 a new kind of woven scarves became fashionable. Those are "wide scarves". They were woven in one single piece (80 x 82 cm or slightly smaller). They were woven out of cotton in various colours and woven in two weaving threads. They were also decorated by "usnivanje" and "pretkivanje" forming a geometrical ornament with criss-crossed narrow and wide strips. They can be worn on any occasion and by women of all ages and they also mark village membership. According to the dominating colour they are divided into: "blue, black, red and mixed wide scarves". They are also <b>worn</b> as <b>binding</b> scarves. These scarves in most cases are also only hemmed, but if the hem is decorated then it is either in a form of modest "ekla" or braided wool and cotton or fringed. Red and mixed coloured wide scarves were worn by younger women, and black and blue by the oldest ones or those who were in mourning. Their usage was short-lived in the region of Našice. After World War II the wearing of the costume was abandoned, and also the scarves as its integral part. After the war they remained in usage as head-covers only by the oldest women. The last one who wore wide blue scarf died last year. Today they are not woven and can be found only in the wardrobes where they are kept as mementos of the past. The oldest women guard them jealously in order to take to their graves as it was customary...|$|R
