We derive the exact weight enumerator of nonbinary accumulators and subsequently give the weight enumerators for WNRMA code ensembles. We formally prove that the symbol-wise minimum distance of WNRMA code ensembles asymptotically grows linearly with the block length when L >= 3 and n >= 2, and L= 2 and n >= 3, for all powers of primes q >= 3 considered, where q is the field size. Thus, WNRMA code ensembles are asymptotically good for these parameters. We also give iterative decoding thresholds, computed by an extrinsic information transfer chart analysis, on the q-ary symmetric channel to show the convergence properties. Finally, {{we consider}} the binary image of WNRMA code ensembles and compare the asymptotic minimum distance growth rates with those of binary repeat multiple-accumulate code ensembles.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Drilling, {{the act of}} {{creating}} a hole by removing material with a drill gloss tool is also {{carried out in the}} petroleum industry, but this is done {{with the aid of a}} drilling rig for the creation of a wellbore (hole) with the sole aim of the recovery of petroleum resources(oil and gas in this case). The drilling rig which is used to carry out this drilling operation is divided into 5 (five) systems they include: •	Hoisting system: This is the part of the drilling rig the helps increment in the wellbore depth they includes the hoisting tower structure i. e. the mast and derrick, the substructure, the draw works(hoist), the derrick line and its accessories and finally the travelling and crown block. •	Circulating system: This is the path in which mud and cuttings pass through during the drilling process so as to enhance a better rate of penetration (ROP) by suspension of cuttings ensuring that bit cuts a fresh surface while rotating, they include the stand pipe, Kelly hose, the drill stem, the annulus, the mud return line, the shale shaker, the mud pit. •	Rotary system: This system aids in the rotary action which aids drilling, ensuring a better rate of penetration (ROP), they include the swivel, Kelly, rotary drive and rotary table •	Power system: This system provides all the necessary power to carry out the drilling work; this is basically the Gen set and any other power generating equipment. •	Well control and monitoring system: this system basically helps to monitor the drilling operation, drilling a well is very dangerous, because the pressure in the reservoir could be significant high, which normally about couple thousands psi. The main part of this system is the blowout preventer(BOP) Drilling operation on the rig is carried out with the aid of drilling mud, the need for drilling mud in drilling operation cannot be over emphasized, and some of the uses of drilling mud include: •	Suspension/removal of cuttings from well, •	Control formation pressure, •	Seal permeable formations, •	Maintain wellbore stability, •	Minimize formation damage, •	Cool, lubricate, and support the bit and drilling assembly, •	Transmit hydraulic energy to tools and bit, •	Ensure adequate formation evaluation, •	Prevent inflow of formation fluid thereby preventing a kick, etc But the properties of drilling mud is dependent on the formation parameters, a drilling mud with a density of 8. 5 ppg despite being the API standard can’t be used to drill a formation of 10 ppg else caving in of the wellbore would occur thereby causing destruction of equipments, waste of time, and the need for a remedial operation such as sidetracking to be done which would require more funds for the operation, therefore the drilling mud used at any depth should be dependent of formation conditions at that depth. The properties of the drilling mud can be altered via the use of drilling mud additives, depending on the property needed to be increased. The mud weight/density can be increased to meet the well depth condition with the addition of <b>weighter,</b> example of a weighters include Haematite, Barite, etc these additives would help increase the mud weight to the needed weight, likewise, if the PH of our drilling mud needs to be increased in a case where by we are drilling through an acidic formation, additives which increase the ph of mud (PH Enhancers) can be used, examples of PH enhancers are potassium hydroxide(KOH), Sodium Hydroxide(NAOH), etc, there are also other parameters of drilling mud that can be altered such as viscosity, filtration, Gel strength etc...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Backgorund: Adipositas {{is one of}} the {{worldwide}} important problems, which is understood as a chronic healthwith high mobidity and mortality risk. In 1987 the WHO defined the adipositas as an independent İllness, which concerns a global epidemic. More than half of the german population is overweight and 20 % are obese. During the last 20 years the part of overweight has risen, also the childrens and yungsters portion has even risen too. Adipositas is based on a polygenetic disposition and shows a high to become Dm Typ 2, blood pressure, kardiovascular complication, dyslipoproteinamie, which shortens the life expectancy. Aim: To investigate {{whether or not there is}} a difference between atkins and standard diet regarding moderate weight reduction on parametres of the metabolic syndrome. Methods: There were 22 overweight patients (19 womens, 3 mens, middle age 52, 4, middle BMİ 36, 12 kg/m 2) which took part in a weight decrease programme more than 12 months. The intervention of my work was to take part in Atkins diet or Standard diet and physical aktivity weekly more than 60 minutes. Before beginning, after 6 and 12 months we take a physical invastigation, a basal metabolismtest, a BİA and a regulation of the routine parameters. Also we take an OGTT and an euglycamic-hyperinsulin clamp at the beginning and after 6 months by 13 patients. Results: At the beginning of the study it shows, that the Atkins diet patients in comparison to the Standard diet patients were <b>weighter</b> 104, 8 kg to 95, 5 kg. Also it shows, that the Atkins diat patientshave a bigger BMİ and a bigger waist extent 121 cm to 114, 1 cm. Also a higher basal metabolism 1713, 8 kcal to 1495, 6 kcal. Moreover some metabolic parametres at the Atkins diat were worsefor example the sober glucose 105 mg/dl to 98, 4 mg/dl, the nomal glucose 6, 31 mmol/l to 5, 52 mmol/l, the HbA 1 c 5, 9 % to 5, 2 % and the freesour with fat 0, 9 mmol/l to 0, 71 mmol/l. Some metabolic parametres were same, for example the cholesterol value, the HDL value, LDL value, triglycerid value. There was a significant decrease of the weight 104, 8 to 94, 6, the BMİ 39, 7 kg/m 2 to 35, 8 kg/m 2 and wais extent after 6 monthsin the Atkins diat group. After 12 months it came to a very strong rebound phanomen there was an increas of the weight to 93, 4 kg, BMİ 38, 9 kg/m 2,the waist extent has remainded in the course of steady. İn the atkins diet group was the basal metabolism initial higher, but it decreases after 12 months. Also in the Standard diat group it came to a significantdecrease of the weight 98, 5 kg to 92 kg after 6 months and 88, 7 kg after 12 months. The BMİ decrease from 35, 1 kg/m 2 to 32, 8 kg/m 2 after 6 months and 31, 5 kg/m 2 after 12 months. There was also a significant reduction of the waaist extent from 114 cm to 105, 9 cm after 6 months and 105, 3 after 12 months. At the beginning of the study the basal metabolismof the Standard diat was lower than in theAtkins diat, but nevertheless during the 12 months there was a staedy state. To all fears resist, that it will come to a movement of the blood gas values at the Atkins diat,there was no one. During the 12 months, the pH value was 7, 42. Moreover in my work we looked and analysed some effectsof some parametres of the metabolic syndrome, by moderate weight reduction. There was a significant weight reductiom from 99 +/- 2, 8 to 92 +/- 2, 7 after 6 months and 90, 6 +/- after 12 months. Also the BMİ from 6, 1 +/- 1, 3 to 33, 4 +/- 1, 2 after 6 months and 32, 8 +/- 1, 3 after 12 months. Also there was a significant decrease of the belly extent from 115 +/- 2, 6 to 106, 5 +/- 2, 6 after 6 months and 106, 2 +/- 2, 7 after 12 months. Furtheremore there was a significant decreaseof the sober blood glucose from 98, 0 +/- 2, 7 to 91, 2 +/- 3, 5 after 6 months and 92, 5 +/- 4, 1 after 12 months. Moreover the HDL value decrease significant from 4, 1 +/- 2, 7 to 49, 5 +/- 2, 7 after 6 months and after 12 months to 64, 6 +/- 5, 0. Several other parametres of the metabolic syndrom ımproved in direction of the weight reduction, but not significantly. There was an improvement of the blood pressure, the free sour with fat, the LDL value, also of the insulinresistance and the adiponectinvalue. Coclusion: Atkins diet leads to an early significant reduction of body weight and body-mass-index as well to an increased initial basal metabolism when compared to the standard diet. However, atfer 12 month patients in the atkins group displayed a massive rebound effect, whereas the patients in the standard diet group displayed no rebound effect...|$|E
