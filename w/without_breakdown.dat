60|$|About midsummer of this year, 1885, he was {{distressed by}} {{the sudden death of}} his old and kind friend Professor Fleeming Jenkin, and after a while {{undertook}} the task of writing a memoir of him to be prefixed to his collected papers. Towards the close of the same year he was busy with what proved to be the most popular of all his writings, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and with the Christmas story of Olalla. Jekyll and Hyde was published in January 1886, and after threatening for the first week or two to fall flat, in no long time caught the attention of all classes of readers, was quoted from a hundred pulpits, and made the writer's name familiar to multitudes both in England and America whom it had never reached before. A success scarcely inferior, though of another kind, was made a few months afterwards by Kidnapped, which Stevenson had taken up again in the early spring, and which was published about midsummer. After completing this task in March, he was able to do little work during the remainder of the year, except in preparing materials for the Life of Fleeming Jenkin, and in writing occasional verses which helped to make up the collection published in the following year under the title Underwoods. In the early autumn of the same year, 1886, he took a longer and more successful excursion from home than usual, staying <b>without</b> <b>breakdown</b> for two or three weeks at the Monument, as he always called my house at the British Museum, and seeing something of kindred spirits among his elders, such as Robert Browning, James Russell Lowell, the painters Burne-Jones and W. B. Richmond, and others who had hitherto delighted in his work and now learned to delight no less in his society.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known Russian estimate (1859) {{gives the}} population of Qing subjects in the [...] "Trans-Zeya District" [...] as 3,000, <b>without</b> <b>breakdown</b> by ethnicity; the next one (1870) gives it as 10,646, including 5,400 (Han) Chinese, 4,500 Manchus and 1,000 Daurs. The estimates published between the late 1870s and early 1890s varied between 12,000 and 16,000, peaking in 1894, at 16,102 (including 9,119 Han Chinese, 5,783 Manchus, and 1,200 Daurs). After that, reported numbers went down (7,000 to 7,500 residents reported each year from 1895 to 1899); by that time, however, the Trans-Zeya villagers constituted {{only a minority of}} the Chinese present in the region. For example, besides the Trans-Zeya villagers, in 1898 statistics reported 12,199 Chinese otkhodniki (migrant workers) [...] and 5,400 Chinese miners in the Amur Oblast as it existed at the time, as well as 4,008 Chinese urban residents in Blagoveshchensk and probably elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{intention}} {{of this paper}} is to present the instantaneous electromagnetic field measurement by signature of a neutral object (MICHELSON) method.

The incident field scattering on the target allows us to move the field measurement to a new location where the scattered field can then be measured using simple equipment and <b>without</b> <b>breakdown</b> risk. This method does away with the necessity for cables in the test zone. When using small targets, the induced disturbances in the incident field are limited.

40|$|Caloric {{effects are}} {{currently}} under intense study {{due to the}} prospect of environment-friendly cooling applications. Most of the research is centred on large magnetocaloric effects and large electrocaloric effects, but the former require large magnetic fields that are challenging to generate economically and the latter require large electric fields {{that can only be}} applied <b>without</b> <b>breakdown</b> in thin samples. Here we use small changes in hydrostatic pressure to drive giant inverse barocaloric effects near the ferrielectric phase transition in ammonium sulphate. We find barocaloric effects and strengths that exceed those previously observed near magnetostructural phase transitions in magnetic materials.

40|$|The {{influence}} of sparks and ion bombardment on the emitting {{properties of the}} electrodes and consequently on the breakdown voltage of a vacuum gap are investigated. The cathode used was either a stainless steel or a copper needle (radius of the tip 0. 10 and 0. 15 mm, respectively). The anode was a hollow hemisphere (radius 15 mm) of stainless steel. It appears that the field-enhancement factor β can be reduced by sparking from about 100 to 10 for the stainless steel cathode and from about 120 to 30 for the copper cathode. By ion bombardment β further decreases to 7 and 20, respectively.

In manufacturing companies the pressure to ensure equipment operates <b>without</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> stoppages, failures and so forth {{has become a major}} concern for maintenance staff (Carannante, Haigh & Morris, 1996). The failure of equipments or machines to produce products on time as required can reflect the inefficiency in operations thus, failure to deliver quality products to the customers on time.

More than 1000 questionnaires were sent out to investigate the extent of TPM practices in Malaysian manufacturing companies and to study the relationship of TPM practices and performance.
