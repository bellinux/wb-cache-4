5|$|Initial {{reaction}} {{within the}} Communist Bloc was mixed. Hungary's János Kádár was highly supportive of Dubček's appointment in January, but Leonid Brezhnev and others grew concerned about Dubček's reforms, which they feared might <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> {{position of the}} Communist Bloc during the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2007 article, the mite Varroa {{destructor}} {{remains the}} world's most destructive honey bee killer, {{due in part}} to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus, which have both been implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa mites also tends to <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> immune system of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied 413 Ontario bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed to <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> immune systems of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.|$|E
5|$|By 1796, {{the end of}} George Washington's eighth year as {{president}} of the United States, the United States' strategic position was dire. Interstate rivalries, violent insurrections (such as the Whiskey Rebellion), and solidifying opposition to the national government {{in the form of the}} Anti-Federalist Party combined with its dependence on trade with Europe to <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> new nation. During this time, the country's increasingly-brittle government was held together almost entirely by Washington's charismatic authority.|$|E

5|$|Culturally, the wall's {{symbolic}} {{role as a}} {{line between}} civilized society and barbarism was suppressed by the Qing, who were keen to <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> Han culturalism that had been propagated by the Ming.

5|$|Cunningham, {{realising}} that an {{air attack}} could <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> Italians, ordered {{an attack by}} the Formidables Albacore torpedo-bombers. A hit on the Vittorio Veneto slowed her temporarily and Iachino, realising his fleet was vulnerable without air cover, ordered his forces to retire. Cunningham gave the order to pursue the Italian Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Having already {{released}} precious destroyers for convoy duty, {{they were}} unwilling to further <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> ability of the U.S. to defend itself through the scattering of the all-important battle fleet. Furthermore, Admiral Benson was uneasy about the prospect, ever-present in the early 20th century, of a second war breaking out with Japan. For the moment, the U.S. Navy would send destroyers to Europe, but no battleships.|$|E

5|$|Muhanna was {{succeeded by}} his son Musa, and his {{descendants}} filled the office of amir al-ʿarab {{for the next seven}} decades with minor interruption. Throughout his reign, Muhanna was granted numerous iqtaʿat (fiefs) by an-Nasir, including Palmyra, Salamiyah, Sarmin and Douma. Muhanna later criticized an-Nasir's generous iqtaʿ distribution to the Bedouin tribes, believing it would ultimately degrade the character of the Bedouin and in turn, <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> Muslim armies.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski's Promethean program, {{designed}} to <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> Russian Empire and its successor state, the Soviet Union, by supporting nationalist independence movements of major non-Russian peoples dwelling in Russia and the Soviet Union, was coordinated from 1927 to the 1939 outbreak of World War II in Europe {{by the military}} intelligence officer, Edmund Charaszkiewicz. In the Interbellum, the Prometheist movement yielded few tangible results.|$|E

5|$|Strong {{partisan}} disagreement in Congress prevented {{adjustments to}} the Act's provisions.

5|$|The Arabs {{hoped that}} the disunity among the Byzantines would play to their advantage. Maslama had already {{established}} contact with Leo the Isaurian. French scholar Rodolphe Guilland theorized that Leo offered to become a vassal of the Caliphate, although the Byzantine general intended to use the Arabs for his own purposes. In turn, Maslama supported Leo hoping to maximize confusion and <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> Empire, easing his own task of taking Constantinople.|$|E

However, faithful people—concerned that having a Catholic {{as the head of the}} Church of Greece would <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> Orthodox Church—criticised the unilateral declaration of Autocephaly as non-canonical. For the same reason, they likewise resisted the foreign, mostly Protestant, missionaries who established schools throughout Greece.|$|E
