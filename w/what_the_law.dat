5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E

25|$|One {{contention}} by {{some tax}} protesters {{is that a}} taxpayer {{should be allowed to}} introduce, as evidence in court, copies of statutes, cases or other materials to persuade the jury about <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is. Courts do not allow this procedure as, under the U.S. legal system, the general rule is that neither side in a civil or criminal case is allowed to try to prove to the jury <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is. For example, in a murder case the defendant is not allowed to persuade the jury that there is no law against murder, or to try to interpret the law for the jury. Likewise, the prosecution is not allowed to do this. Instead, disagreements about <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is are argued by both sides before the judge, who then makes a ruling. Prior to jury deliberations, the judge instructs the jury on the law. Examples of applications of this rule in tax controversies are United States v. Ambort, United States v. Bonneau, and United States v. Willie.|$|E
25|$|It is emphatically the {{province}} and {{duty of the}} Judicial Department to say <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is.

25|$|Somalis {{for centuries}} have practiced {{a form of}} {{customary}} law, which they call xeer. Xeer is a polycentric legal system {{where there is no}} monopolistic agent that determines <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> should be or how it should be interpreted. It is assumed to have developed exclusively in the Horn of Africa since approximately the 7th century. Given the dearth of loan words from foreign languages within the xeer's nomenclature, the customary law appears to have evolved in situ.|$|E
25|$|While he {{was still}} on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and before being named to the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. {{published}} a short volume called The Common Law, which remains a classic in the field. Unlike Blackstone and the Restatements, Holmes' book only briefly discusses <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is; rather, Holmes describes the common law process. Law professor John Chipman Gray's The Nature and Sources of the Law, an examination and survey of the common law, is also still commonly read in U.S. law schools.|$|E
25|$|Although {{natural law}} is often {{confused}} with common law, {{the two are}} distinct. Even though natural law theories have exercised a profound influence {{on the development of}} English common law, the latter is not based on inherent rights, but is the legal tradition whereby certain rights or values are legally recognized by virtue of already having judicial recognition or articulation. Natural law is often contrasted with the human-made laws (positive law) of a given state, political entity or society. In legal theory, the interpretation of a human-made law requires some reference to natural law. On this understanding of natural law, natural law can be invoked to criticize judicial decisions about <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> says, but not to criticize the best interpretation of the law itself.|$|E

25|$|Scalia also {{attacked}} {{the majority opinion}} as being fundamentally antidemocratic. His dissent cited a passage from The Federalist Papers in arguing {{that the role of}} the judiciary in the constitutional scheme is to interpret the law as formulated in democratically selected legislatures. He argued that the Court exists to rule on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> says, not what it should say, and that it is for the legislature, acting in the manner prescribed in Article V of the Constitution to offer amendments to the Constitution in light of the evolving standard of decency, not for the Court to arbitrarily make de facto amendments. He challenged the right of unelected lawyers to discern moral values and to impose them on the people in the name of flexible readings of the constitutional text.|$|E

5000|$|Van Inwagen's central {{argument}} (the Consequence Argument) {{for this}} view says that [...] "If determinism is true, then our acts {{are the consequences}} of <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of nature and events in the remote past. But it {{is not up to}} us what went on before we were born, and neither is it up to us <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of nature are.

500|$|The {{majority}} {{began by}} explaining that judiciary's authority under Article III of the United States Constitution is to [...] "'say <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is'", quoting Marbury v. Madison (1803). [...] "Congress, no doubt, may not usurp a court's power to interpret {{and apply the}} law to the circumstances before it" [...] by, for example, saying in a hypothetical case Smith v. Jones that Smith wins or compelling the courts to reexamine a case after final judgment has been issued.|$|E
500|$|Another way to {{interpret}} the clause is {{through the lens of}} textualism, that is, giving primary consideration to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> says rather than to its purpose. Most legal scholars who take this view argue that the Saxbe fix does not address the constitutional problem. Because to textualism believers the language of the rule is an absolute prohibition, law professor and textualist Michael Paulsen has said, a [...] "'fix' can rescind the salary, ... but it cannot repeal historical events. The emoluments of the office had been increased. The rule specified in the text still controls." [...] Most textualists agree that the spirit of the Ineligibility Clause would be addressed by a Saxbe fix, but they dispute that a clause's [...] "spirit" [...] overrides its text.|$|E

Kyle Smith of the New York Post, who found the police tactics distasteful, wrote, [...] "Justice is supposed to be blind, but in this case I think <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> really wants is unaccountability" [...] and called Dredd a [...] " [...] thudding, repetitive movie". He also wrote, [...] "It’s not that the movie is in bad taste or cheesy (though it is) but that all of its hyper-violence adds up to nothing". Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger called it a [...] "gray and ugly film", said that there was little to draw viewers in, and wrote that apart from the drug-induced slow-motion sequences, the film offers nothing new.|$|E
