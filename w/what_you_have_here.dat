60|$|Now, if {{the mouth}} of that Chine at Bournemouth was lifted twenty feet out of the sea, one thing would happen,--that the high tide would not come up any longer, and wash away the cake of dirt at the entrance, as we saw it do so often. But if the mud stopped there, the mud behind it would come down more slowly, and lodge inside more and more, till the Chine was half filled-up, and only {{the upper part of}} the cliffs {{continue}} to be eaten away, above the level where the springs ran out. So gradually the Chine, instead of being deep and narrow, would become broad and shallow; and instead of hollowing itself rapidly after every shower of rain, as you saw the Chine at Bournemouth doing, would hollow itself out slowly, as this glen is doing now. And one thing more would happen,--when the sea ceased to gnaw at the foot of the cliffs outside, and to carry away every stone and grain of sand which fell from them, the cliffs would very soon cease to be cliffs; the rain and the frost would still crumble them down, but the dirt that fell would lie at their feet, and gradually make a slope of dry land, far out where the shallow sea had been; and their tops, instead of being steep as now, would become smooth and rounded; and so at last, instead of two sharp walls of cliff at the Chine's mouth, you might have--just <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> at {{the mouth of}} this glen,--our Mount and the Warren Hill,--long slopes with sheets of drifted gravel and sand at their feet, stretching down into what was once an icy sea, and is now the Vale of Blackwater. And this I really believe Madam How has done simply by lifting Hartford Bridge Flat a few more feet out of the sea, and leaving the rest to her trusty tool, the water in the sky.|$|E

Then either side of it are two other puzzle games, the slightly less interesting Maze Paint, and the slightly more fiddly Magipic, like lovely bridesmaids either side of the gorgeous bride." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{significance}} of this recording {{was not lost on}} Buffalo News music critic Jeff Simon:This disc is as groundbreaking and as hugely valuable as her Newman adaptations were regrettable. This is what Grammys, it seems to me, ought to be for. <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> sung by Vitro is music by Clare Fischer, a great jazz composer whose complex and difficult melodies and gorgeous songs are perfect for Vitro’s abundant gifts as a jazz singer ... What she hopes to do, she says, is introduce Fischer to the repertoire of many more jazz singers. With what she does here - along with pianist Mark Soskins sic and violinist Sara Caswell - she may wind up doing just that. An important disc, whether she succeeds or not.|$|E

Thanks {{for buying}} this CD.Your support {{is very much}} appreciated. <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> was {{recorded}} at Blast Studios, Newcastle upon Tyne on the 19th of August 2014. The engineer was Liam Gaughan.We started the session at 11.30am and finished at 17.00. There are sixteen songs, four 'interludes' and two pieces of sound recorded on my phone.Armed With Anger takes its title from a book by Ian Glasper and a UK hardcore record label. It was originally intended for the next Therapy? record but was deemed [...] "too poppy" [...] as was Demons! Demons! Both these tunes were written {{under the influence of}} the Ulster record label Good Vibrations.Meltdown Bound has been kicking about for over a year now but it's finally recorded. I usually use a guitar capo for this one but I was confused about the tuning so played it in a lower key.For the four interludes I have one guitar in the left speaker and another in the right. Neither guitar has any idea what the other is doing. The first phone sample is from a beach in East Anglia and the second is from The House is Black by Forough Farrokhzad.Many of the T? songs here are recorded in a lower register than usual as it's an approach I wanted to try.I hope you enjoy this. I'm looking forward to catching up with you again with Therapy? very soon,Love and Respect, ANDY CThis was recorded using mainly my Gibson J200 acoustic but with my Norman B18 as 'The Other Guitar' on the interludes.The photographs are by Jonah Cairns. Thanks to Kris, Jonah, Michael, Neil, Gerry, Susan, Paul Bolton, Steve Firth, Eric, Carol, Polly and Liam at Blast, Paul Burgess for the sleeve, Julian at Gibson UK and to your good selves for helping keep me plough my own musical path for the last twenty five years"- (liner notes) ...|$|E

The handout is brief, but {{if you are interested in}} more information, there several references in back. What is a proof?
