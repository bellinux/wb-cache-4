6000|$|The {{theory of}} {{politics}} which has possessed {{the mind of}} men, and which they have expressed {{the best they could}} in their laws and in their revolutions, considers persons and property as the two objects for whose protection government exists. Of persons, all have equal rights, in virtue of being identical in nature. This interest of course with its whole power demands a democracy. Whilst the rights of all as persons are equal, in virtue of their access to reason, their rights in property are very unequal. One man owns his clothes, and another owns a county. This accident, depending primarily on the skill and virtue of the parties, of which there is every degree, and secondarily on patrimony, falls unequally, and its rights of course are unequal. Personal rights, universally the same, demand a government framed on the ratio of the census; property demands a government framed on the ratio of owners and of owning. Laban, who has flocks and herds, wishes them looked after by an officer on the frontiers, lest the Midianites shall drive them off; and pays a tax to that end. Jacob has no flocks or herds and no fear of the Midianites, and pays no tax to the officer. It seemed fit that Laban and Jacob should have equal rights to elect the officer who is to defend their persons, but that Laban and not Jacob should elect the officer who is to guard the sheep and cattle. And if question arise whether additional officers or watch-towers should be provided, must not Laban and Isaac, and those who must sell part of their herds to buy protection for the rest, judge better of this, and <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>right,</b> than Jacob, who, because he is a youth and a traveller, eats their bread and not his own? ...|$|E
6000|$|The north {{wind had}} already begun to cool the pond, though it took many weeks of steady blowing to {{accomplish}} it, it is so deep. When I began to have a fire at evening, before I plastered my house, the chimney carried smoke particularly well, because of the numerous chinks between the boards. Yet I passed some cheerful evenings in that cool and airy apartment, surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots, and rafters with the bark on high overhead. My house never pleased my eye so much after it was plastered, though I was obliged to confess that it was more comfortable. Should not every apartment in which man dwells be lofty enough to create some obscurity overhead, where flickering shadows may play at evening about the rafters? These forms are more agreeable to the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or other the most expensive furniture. I now first began to inhabit my house, I may say, when I began to use it for warmth as well as shelter. I had got a couple of old fire-dogs to keep the wood from the hearth, and it did me good to see the soot form {{on the back of the}} chimney which I had built, and I poked the fire <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>right</b> and more satisfaction than usual. My dwelling was small, and I could hardly entertain an echo in it; but it seemed larger for being a single apartment and remote from neighbors. All the attractions of a house were concentrated in one room; it was kitchen, chamber, parlor, and keeping-room; and whatever satisfaction parent or child, master or servant, derive from living in a house, I enjoyed it all. Cato says, the master of a family (patremfamilias) must have in his rustic villa [...] "cellam oleariam, vinariam, dolia multa, uti lubeat caritatem expectare, et rei, et virtuti, et gloriae erit," [...] that is, [...] "an oil and wine cellar, many casks, so that it may be pleasant to expect hard times; it will be for his advantage, and virtue, and glory."

5000|$|Research {{has found}} that {{compensatory}} stereotypes might lead to increased justification of the status quo. That is, stereotypes that have components that would offset the negative aspects of the stereotypes would allow people to more easily explain or justify the inequality of the prevailing system. One of the more common examples is the compensatory stereotype of “poor but happy” or “rich but miserable.” [...] Stereotypes like these that incorporate a positive aspect to counterbalance the negative aspect would lead people to increase their justification of the status quo. Interestingly, other findings suggested that these compensatory stereotypes are preferred by those with more left leaning political ideologies, while those <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>right</b> leaning political ideologies preferred non-complimentary stereotypes that simply rationalized inequality rather than compensated for it. [...] But that overall, conservatives {{were more likely to}} have increased system justification tendencies than liberals.|$|E
40|$|Burnout is {{prevalent}} in residency training and practice and {{is linked to}} medical error and suboptimal patient care. However, {{little is known about}} how burnout affects clinical reasoning, which is essential to safe and effective care. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine how burnout modulates brain activity during clinical reasoning in physicians. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), brain activity was assessed in internal medicine residents (n = 10) and board-certified internists (faculty, n = 17) from the Uniformed Services University (USUHS) while they answered and reflected upon United States Medical Licensing Examination and American Board of Internal Medicine multiple-choice questions. Participants also completed a validated two-item burnout scale, which includes an item assessing emotional exhaustion and an item assessing depersonalization. Whole brain covariate analysis was used to examine blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal during answering and reflecting upon clinical problems with respect to burnout scores. Higher depersonalization scores were associated with less BOLD signal in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and middle frontal gyrus during reflecting on clinical problems and less BOLD signal in the bilateral precuneus while answering clinical problems in residents. Higher emotional exhaustion scores were associated <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>right</b> posterior cingulate cortex and middle frontal gyrus BOLD signal in residents. Examination of faculty revealed no significant influence of burnout on brain activity. Residents appear to be more susceptible to burnout effects on clinical reasoning, which may indicate that residents may need both cognitive and emotional support to improve quality of life and to optimize performance and learning. These results inform our understanding of mental stress, cognitive control as well as cognitive load theory...|$|E

40|$|The QWERTY effect postulates {{that the}} {{keyboard}} layout influences word meanings by linking positivity {{to the use}} of the right hand and negativity {{to the use of}} the left hand. For example, previous research has established that words <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>right</b> hand letters are rated more positively than words with more left hand letters by human subjects in small scale experiments. In this paper, we perform large scale investigations of the QWERTY effect on the web. Using data from eleven web platforms related to products, movies, books, and videos, we conduct observational tests whether a hand-meaning relationship can be found in decoding text on the web. Furthermore, we investigate whether encoding text on the web exhibits the QWERTY effect as well, by analyzing the relationship between the text of online reviews and their star ratings in four additional datasets. Overall, we find robust evidence for the QWERTY effect both at the point of text interpretation (decoding) and at the point of text creation (encoding). We also find under which conditions the effect might not hold. Our findings have implications for any algorithmic method aiming to evaluate the meaning of words on the web, including for example semantic or sentiment analysis, and show the existence of "dactilar onomatopoeias" that shape the dynamics of word-meaning associations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to reveal the extent to which the QWERTY effect exists in large scale human-computer interaction on the web.

40|$|Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) {{have been}} {{reported}} to have electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities in the form of increased levels of theta band activity and lower than normal levels of beta band activity. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine if these abnormalities can also be observed in adults with ADHD. There were 32 control subjects, 25 subjects with ADHD of the primarily hyperactive type (ADHDhy), and 17 subjects with ADHD of the primarily inattentive type (ADHDpi). For the purposes of analysis, the ADHDhy and ADHDpi groups were combined to form a CLINICAL group. The subjects were right handed males and females between the ages of 20 and 50 years of age. During the study, EEG activity was recorded from 19 electrode sites while subjects sat with their eyes open and eyes closed, and while they performed a variety of tasks including: the Tests of Variability of Attention (TOVA), a reading task, a mental rotation task, a selective attention task, and a listening task. The results of the discriminant function analyses produced functions that correctly classified an average of 60 out of 74 of the control and ADHD subjects during the TOVA, listening, and selective attention tasks (p <. 0005). An ANOVA of inter-hemispheric activity revealed that only the ADHDpi group were significantly different from the control group <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>right</b> than left hemispheric activity in the delta band during the mental rotation task (p <. 006). A paired t-test analysis of inter-hemispheric activity showed that both the ADHDhy and ADHDpi groups had different percentage levels of right and left hemispheric activity (p <. 005) during the performance of the eyes closed, T. O. V. A., mental rotation, and reading tasks; there were no significant differences in the control group in any of these comparisons. A MANOVA of regional (frontal, central, posterior, left temporal, and right temporal) activity revealed statistically significant differences in the theta/beta ratio during the eyes closed condition for the ADHDhy group with a higher ratio in the frontal region and right temporal area (p <. 006). The results suggest that the differences between normal and ADHD children continues into adulthood but that the magnitude of the differences is reduced. A dysfunction in EEG activity caused by a maturational lag is supported by the results of this study. Based on the results of the analyses, recommendations are made as to which frequency bands and electrode sites should be targeted for use in neurotherapy...|$|E
