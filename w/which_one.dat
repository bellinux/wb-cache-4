5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Shai Lachman, between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often {{cooperated with}} Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. They were initially on good terms, and al-Qassam's various official appointments required the mufti's prior consent. He suggests their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots, in <b>which</b> <b>one</b> source claims al-Qassam's men were active. The two fell {{out in the}} mid-1930s, perhaps due to al-Qassam's independent line of activism. In 1933, al-Qassam sent an emissary to al-Husseini, requesting the latter's participation in a revolt against the British. At the time, al-Husseini refused, preferring a political solution.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between noon and evening. The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, {{for which there is}} no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along <b>which</b> <b>one</b> concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe.|$|E

5|$|Creatively, {{the focus}} of Watchmen is on its structure. Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout {{throughout}} the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley face. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter, <b>which</b> <b>one</b> of the characters reads. Structured, at times, as a nonlinear narrative, the story skips through space, time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogue have parallels with others through synchronicity, coincidence and repeated imagery.|$|E
