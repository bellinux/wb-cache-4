5|$|An Act of Parliament dated 10 June 1825 {{created the}} New Harbour Company, with powers {{to build the}} harbour at Tywyn Bach, on the sands near Pembrey.

5|$|Cromer High {{railway station}} {{was the first}} station opened in Cromer, {{situated}} to the south {{on the outskirts of}} the town on a steep escarpment. Built initially by the short-lived East Norfolk Railway, the station (along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>line)</b> was incorporated into the Great Eastern Railway, who had operated the services from the beginning. It served as the terminus of Great Eastern Railway services from London and Norwich. Initially named Cromer on opening, it was renamed Cromer High on 27 September 1948.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. The management of London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and {{it was felt that}} there was little chance of the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> were sold at auction. Most of the infrastructure was subsequently demolished, though three station cottages survive.|$|E
5|$|The Anglesey Central Railway Act 1863 (26 & 27 Vict. c.cxxviii) {{founded the}} company, with capital of £120,000.

The ceremonial first sod was cut on 11 September 1863, with construction starting {{the following year}} by the contractors Dickson and Russell. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> approaching Llangefni later in October 1864, LNWR engineers were authorised to build the main line junction at Gaerwen, at the Anglesey Central Railway's expense.|$|E

5|$|The District {{also had}} {{parliamentary}} permission to extend westward from Brompton and, on 12 April 1869, it opened a single-track line to West Brompton on the WLR. There were no intermediate stations {{and at first}} this service operated as a shuttle. By summer 1869 separate tracks had been laid between South Kensington and Brompton and from Kensington (High Street) to a junction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to West Brompton. During the night of 5 July 1870 the District secretly built the disputed Cromwell curve connecting Brompton and Kensington (High Street).|$|E
5|$|The Severn Beach Line {{declined}} {{over the}} latter half of the twentieth century, with passenger numbers falling significantly. All station staff were withdrawn in 1967, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> through the station reduced to single track in 1970, with the second platform taken out of use. Services had decreased to ten per day each direction by 2005, but have since increased to twenty-four trains per day.|$|E
5|$|The {{new link}} opened on 2July 1926, from which date both former Ramsgate {{stations}} were closed along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{through the tunnel}} to Ramsgate Harbour.

5|$|The {{opening of}} the Great Western Railway in 1841 removed much of the canal's traffic, and in 1852 the railway company took over its running.

It is in an asymmetrical Tudor style with curving gables, and lies on the north bank of the Avon, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> swerving elegantly across from the southern bank to the station and then back again.|$|E
5|$|A First Avenue line, {{consisting}} of four tracks, would stretch from the Harlem River to City Hall. At 10th Street, the line would {{cease to be}} a four-track line, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> splitting into two branches. One branch would run to a loop near City Hall, while the other {{would go to a}} new Lafayette Avenue line in Brooklyn, running via Third Avenue and the Bowery. On the northern end, at 161st Street, the line would split into two 3-track lines. One of the lines would go to Southern Boulevard and Fordham Road; the other would continue to 241st Street after merging with the existing IRT White Plains Road Line at Fordham Road and Webster Avenue.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, work to electrify the line from Liverpool Street to Shenfield began in association with the LNER. Progress had been halted by the war but work resumed after the end of hostilities. The line between Liverpool Street and Stratford was electrified from 3 December 1946, and the full electrification of the Shenfield line at 1500V DC was completed by late 1949. At the same time electrification of London Underground services in Essex and northeast and east London led to the withdrawal of some services from Liverpool Street, being replaced with LU operations. Electrification continued <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to Chingford electrified by November 1960.|$|E

5|$|All vessels were {{fitted with}} {{defensive}} guns at {{the bow and}} stern. In June 1917 Manchester Port (1904) beat off a submarine attack with gunfire near Cape Wrath. Manchester Commerce (1899), outward-bound for Quebec City was sunk off northwest Ireland on 26October 1914, {{with the loss of}} 14crew, becoming the first merchant ship to be sunk by a mine. On 4 June 1917 the second Manchester Trader, en route from Souda Bay in Crete to Algiers, was engaged in a running battle with U-boat U 65 before she was captured and sunk near Pantellaria island, with the loss of one crewmember. The master, Captain F. D. Struss, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, and went on to complete 40years service <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> after surviving another sinking in the Second World War. A further nine ships were sunk by U-boats, seven of the losses occurring in 1917.|$|E

The line is a portion of the L's former main line from Lebanon Junction to Corbin; the museum operates the segment from Boston to New Haven, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> having been abandoned east of the museum site. There is a large model train layout and a gift shop at New Haven, in a brick building that is a replica of the former L depot there.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, stubs {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E

Despite Kassian surpassing his goal total from his rookie season, the Sedins started the year with their lowest output in nearly ten years, combining for 14 {{points in the first}} 10 games. Coinciding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> changes, Vancouver went on a six-game winning streak between the end of January and their February 12 game.

5|$|Bart and his catchphrase {{continue}} to be popular, while Krusty creates {{a wide array of}} merchandise featuring Bart's likeness. Bart becomes sick of his fame and begins to fear that the fad will wear off, so he tries to expand his act and personality during an interview on Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show, to no avail. Bart decides to stop performing, but Marge convinces him that he should continue because he makes people happy.

5|$|Construction of {{the line}} started in 1924, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> opening in 1940. It allowed the {{district}} of Sogn access to Bergen and Oslo via the Bergen Line. Electric traction was taken into use in 1944; at first El 9 locomotives were used, and from 1982 El 11. Until 1991, the train connected with a ferry service from Flåm to Gudvangen. In 1992, freight services were terminated, and due to low ticket prices and high operating costs, the line was nearly closed. In 1998, Flåm Utvikling took over marketing and ticket sale for the line, prices were heavily increased and El 17 locomotives were introduced. The trains remain operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB), while the line itself is {{owned and operated by}} the Norwegian National Rail Administration.|$|E
