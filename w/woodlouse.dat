5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The <b>woodlouse</b> (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies {{show that they are}} willing to consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E
25|$|When {{rolled into}} a ball, G. marginata can be {{distinguished}} from a rolled–up pill <b>woodlouse</b> by the asymmetrical ball it rolls into; pill woodlice roll into much more perfect spheres. The cuticle is also darker and shinier, and the antennae are shorter. The head and tail of a <b>woodlouse</b> have {{a greater number of}} small plates, while the head of Glomeris is protected by a single large shield, and it lacks the uropods of woodlice at the read end. Although usually black, red, yellow and brown individuals do occasionally occur.|$|E
25|$|Common {{names for}} {{woodlice}} vary throughout the English-speaking world. A number of common names {{make reference to}} the fact that some species of woodlice can roll up into a ball. Other names compare the <b>woodlouse</b> to a pig.|$|E
25|$|The family Dysderidae (<b>woodlouse</b> hunters, sowbug-eating spiders or cell spiders) are araneomorph spiders found {{primarily}} in Eurasia, although extending into North Africa, {{with very few}} species occurring in South America, and one (Dysdera crocata) introduced into many regions of the world.|$|E
25|$|Woodlice are {{eaten by}} {{a wide range of}} insectivores, and some animals are known to prey {{exclusively}} on woodlice, for example, spiders of the genus Dysdera, such as the <b>woodlouse</b> spider Dysdera crocata, and land planarians of the genus Luteostriata, such as Luteostriata abundans.|$|E
25|$|Glomeris marginata is {{a common}} European species of pill millipede. It is a short millipede, rounded in cross-section, which is capable of rolling itself up into a ball when disturbed. This {{behaviour}} {{is also found in}} the pill <b>woodlouse</b> Armadillidium, with which G. marginata is often confused.|$|E
25|$|The <b>woodlouse</b> has a shell-like exoskeleton, {{which it}} must {{progressively}} shed as it grows. The moult {{takes place in}} two stages; the back half is lost first, followed {{two or three days}} later by the front. This method of moulting is different from that of most arthropods, which shed their cuticle in a single process.|$|E
25|$|Predators of Glomeris marginata are {{reported}} to include the starling, the common toad, the <b>woodlouse</b> spider, and hedgehogs. As well as rolling up into a ball for protection, G. marginata produces noxious chemicals to ward off potential predators, as many millipedes do. One to eight drops of a viscid fluid are secreted, containing quinazolinone alkaloids, dissolved in a watery protein matrix. These chemicals act as antifeedants and toxins to spiders, insects and vertebrates, and the fluid is sticky enough to entrap the legs of ants. Having completely discharged these chemical defences, it {{can take up to}} four months for the millipede to replenish their supplies.|$|E
500|$|The colonies are {{quiescent}} {{during the}} winter, and young individuals emerge in February and March to establish new burrows. Sheltered sites below bushes are chosen, although larger males will often try to pair {{with a female}} who has already established a burrow, sometimes ousting her male partner. The anatomy of H. reaumuri is not specialised for digging, and the excavation is a slow process, taking place only in early spring. The first [...] are dug by a single <b>woodlouse,</b> which then stops to guard the new burrow. Eventually, it will allow one other <b>woodlouse</b> {{of the opposite sex}} to enter, and they then engage in a ritual which often lasts for hours, before copulating.|$|E
500|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri is {{a species}} of <b>woodlouse</b> that lives {{in and around the}} deserts of North Africa and the Middle East, [...] "the driest habitat conquered by any species of crustacean". It reaches a length of [...] and a width of up to , and has seven pairs of legs which hold its body unusually high off the ground. The species was {{described}} in the [...] after the French Campaign in Egypt and Syria of 1798–1801, but was first formally named by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1840 as Porcellio reaumuri. It reached its current scientific name in 1930 after the former subgenus Hemilepistus was raised to the rank of genus.|$|E
500|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri {{can only}} escape {{the heat of}} the desert by {{constructing}} a burrow, which is time-consuming and energetically costly. One parent must therefore guard the burrow while the other forages for food. H. reaumuri can spend up to ten months of the year returning to the surface to forage, which is far longer than species which do not dig burrows, such as Armadillidium vulgare or Armadillo officinalis. Although they will forage at temperatures as high as , these woodlice retreat to their burrow when the temperature is too high. They are also unable to tolerate air with a relative humidity below 6%, which often occurs at depths of up to [...] in the desert soil in the hottest months, and the burrows are therefore dug at least [...] deep. The burrows are vertical, with a single entrance [...] in diameter, and there may be up to 20 burrows per square metre (nearly 2 per square foot) in favourable areas. If a foraging <b>woodlouse</b> cannot find the burrow entrance on its return, it employs a complex and efficient strategy to find it again. It begins with a spirally widening search, and develops into a more meandering approach the longer it is unable to find the burrow.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are over}} 45 native or naturalised species of <b>woodlouse</b> in the British Isles, ranging in colour and in size (...) [...] Of these 45 species, only five are common: Oniscus asellus (the common shiny <b>woodlouse),</b> Porcellio scaber (the common rough <b>woodlouse),</b> Philoscia muscorum (the common striped <b>woodlouse),</b> Trichoniscus pusillus (the common pygmy <b>woodlouse),</b> and Armadillidium vulgare (the common pill bug).|$|E
2500|$|A <b>woodlouse</b> (plural woodlice) is a {{terrestrial}} [...] isopod crustacean with a rigid, segmented, long exoskeleton {{and fourteen}} jointed limbs. Woodlice mostly feed on dead plant material, {{and they are}} usually active at night. Woodlice form the suborder Oniscidea within the order Isopoda, with over 5,000 known species.|$|E
2500|$|A female <b>woodlouse</b> {{will keep}} fertilised {{eggs in a}} {{marsupium}} {{on the underside of}} her body until they hatch into offspring that look like small white woodlice curled up in balls. The mother then appears to [...] "give birth" [...] to her offspring. [...] Females are also capable of reproducing asexually.|$|E
2500|$|These spiders {{of about}} 2 to 5mm are rarely noticed, but {{generally}} look like somewhat faded <b>woodlouse</b> hunter spiders in the genus Dysdera. [...] The carapace (cephalothorax or prosoma) is orange and the abdomen (opisthosoma) light gray. The two-eyed species have their two {{eyes in the}} anterior middle of the carapace.|$|E
2500|$|A giant isopod is any of {{the almost}} 20 species of large isopods (crustaceans distantly related to shrimp and crabs, which are decapods) in the genus Bathynomus. They are {{abundant}} in cold, deep waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. [...] Bathynomus giganteus, the species upon which the generitype is based, is often considered the largest isopod in the world, though other comparably poorly known species of Bathynomus may reach a similar size (e.g., B. kensleyi). The giant isopods are noted for their resemblance to the much smaller common <b>woodlouse</b> (pill bug), {{to which they are}} related.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the side}} garden {{there is a}} raised lawn, with a minibeast {{trapdoor}} laid on the bare earth. [...] This allows small invertebrates to shelter under it, and children can expose them by lifting the trapdoor. [...] The trapdoor is light enough for a five-year-old to lift easily. Slugs, snails, earthworms, <b>woodlouse</b> and millipedes are likely inhabitants here. On the lawn is another animal hutch, a safety cage for beehives - disused due to colony collapse disorder - and a shed with batboxes fixed to the side. [...] There are two old bramley apple trees, and a facsimile cup and ring stone {{for the children to}} handle.|$|E
2500|$|Dysderids {{have six}} eyes, and are haplogyne, i.e. the females lack a sclerotized epigyne. There is a {{substantial}} number of genera, but two of them, Dysdera and Harpactea, account for {{a very large number of}} the species and are widespread across the family's range. One species, Dysdera crocata (the <b>woodlouse</b> hunter), has been transported over much of the planet together with its preferred foods—woodlice. Dysdera also feeds on beetles. These spiders have very large chelicerae, which they use to pierce the armored bodies of woodlice and beetles. [...] There are also some reports that they have a mildly toxic venom that can cause local reactions in humans.|$|E
2500|$|Dysdera crocata, Dysdera ninnii, Dysdera dubrovninnii, [...] Dysdera hungarica and Dysdera longirostris are {{the five}} species still found in Central Europe {{after the last}} glacial period. They are also abundantly found in North African {{countries}} like Morocco and Egypt, but also in Ethiopia, the Iberian Peninsula and Australia. Some species {{are found in the}} U.S., Dysdera crocata is found from New England down to Georgia and {{all the way across the}} country in California. However, at least two species inhabit South America (Dysdera solers in Colombia, (possibly a relict species from the post-miocene era) and Dysdera magna in Brazil and Uruguay, they are also very common in the central area of Chile). While Dysdera inhabits all of the Macaronesian archipelagos, the most drastic change from strictly the Canary Islands. Researches have discovered around 50 species just on the Canary Islands, six of those 50 are associated with the oldest eastern island. The spider population are limited to the highest elevation on Lanzarote and Fuerteventura islands. The most likely reason why Dysdera are abundantly found on the Canary Islands is due to 27 species found on the close shores of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. Groups like Dysdera crocata and Dysdera erythrina found on the two neighboring lands are found more often than Dysdera lata and Dysdera longirostis, which are also found in North Africa and Iberia. This family of spiders from there separate species have many common names; European garden spider, slater-eating spider, sow-bug killer, <b>woodlouse</b> hunter, and <b>woodlouse</b> spider.|$|E
6000|$|... "O-o-o!" [...] "O-o-o! go to bed! go to bed!" [...] with annoyed derision from everybody. So {{the poor}} old <b>Woodlouse</b> retreated out of sight, {{consumed}} with shame.|$|E
6000|$|... "With feverish {{interest}} {{we called}} for our ancient scientific records to discover if perchance {{the description of}} Man there set down would tally with the fossils before us. Professor <b>Woodlouse</b> read it aloud in its quaint and musty phraseology, to wit: ...|$|E
6000|$|Professor <b>Woodlouse</b> {{affirmed that}} the word [...] "Museum" [...] was {{equivalent}} to the phrase [...] "lumgath molo," [...] or [...] "Burial Place." [...] Upon entering, the scientists were well astonished. But what they saw may be best conveyed {{in the language of}} their own official report: ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{near the}} Double Man-Bird was found what was plainly an ancient record of his, marked upon numberless sheets of a thin white {{substance}} and bound together. Almost the first glance that Professor <b>Woodlouse</b> threw into it revealed this following sentence, which he instantly translated and laid before the scientists, in a tremble, and it uplifted every soul there with exultation and astonishment: ...|$|E
60|$|The Tumble-Bug {{was driven}} away with stripes, and the draftsmen of the {{expedition}} were set to making views of the Monument from different standpoints, while Professor <b>Woodlouse,</b> {{in a frenzy of}} scientific zeal, traveled all over it and all around it hoping to find an inscription. But if there had ever been one, it had decayed or been removed by some vandal as a relic.|$|E
6000|$|With {{infinite}} trouble, Professor <b>Woodlouse</b> {{succeeded in}} making a translation of this inscription, which was sent home, and straightway an enormous excitement was created about it. It confirmed, in a remarkable way, certain treasured traditions of the ancients. The translation was slightly marred by one or two untranslatable words, but these did not impair the general clearness of the meaning. It is here presented: ...|$|E
60|$|Now Professor Field-Mouse having {{placed his}} {{sensitive}} {{ear to the}} tree, detected a rich, harmonious sound issuing from it. This surprising thing was tested and enjoyed by each scholar in turn, and great was the gladness and astonishment of all. Professor <b>Woodlouse</b> was requested to add to and extend the tree's name {{so as to make}} it suggest the musical quality it possessed--which he did, furnishing the addition Anthem Singer, done into the Mastodon tongue.|$|E
6000|$|This was {{the first}} {{successful}} and satisfactory translation {{that had been made}} of the mysterious character left behind him by extinct man, and it gave Professor <b>Woodlouse</b> such reputation that at once every seat of learning in his native land conferred a degree of the most illustrious grade upon him, and it was believed that if he had been a soldier and had turned his splendid talents to the extermination of a remote tribe of reptiles, the king would have ennobled him and made him rich. And this, too, was the origin of that school of scientists called Manologists, whose specialty is the deciphering of the ancient records of the extinct bird termed Man. [For it is now decided that Man was a bird and not a reptile.] But Professor <b>Woodlouse</b> began and remained chief of these, for it was granted that no translations were ever so free from error as his. Others made mistakes--he seemed incapable of it. Many a memorial of the lost race was afterward found, but none ever attained to the renown and veneration achieved by the [...] "Mayoritish Stone" [...] it being so called from the word [...] "Mayor" [...] in it, which, being translated [...] "King," [...] "Mayoritish Stone" [...] was but another way of saying [...] "King Stone." ...|$|E
6000|$|The summer passed, {{and winter}} approached. In and about {{many of the}} caverns were {{what seemed to be}} inscriptions. Most of the {{scientists}} said they were inscriptions, a few said they were not. The chief philologist, Professor <b>Woodlouse,</b> maintained that they were writings, done in a character utterly unknown to scholars, and in a language equally unknown. He had early ordered his artists and draftsmen to make facsimiles of all that were discovered; and had set himself about finding the key to the hidden tongue. In this work he had followed the method which had always been used by decipherers previously. That is to say, he placed a number of copies of inscriptions before him and studied them both collectively and in detail. To begin with, he placed the following copies together: ...|$|E
60|$|After {{another day}} devoted {{to rest and}} recovery, the {{expedition}} proceeded upon its way. Some days later it went into camp in a pleasant part of the plain, and the savants sallied forth {{to see what they}} might find. Their reward was at hand. Professor Bull Frog discovered a strange tree, and called his comrades. They inspected it with profound interest. It was very tall and straight, and wholly devoid of bark, limbs, or foliage. By triangulation Lord Longlegs determined its altitude; Herr Spider measured its circumference at the base and computed the circumference at its top by a mathematical demonstration based upon the warrant furnished by the uniform degree of its taper upward. It was considered a very extraordinary find; and since it was a tree of a hitherto unknown species, Professor <b>Woodlouse</b> gave it a name of a learned sound, being none other than that of Professor Bull Frog translated into the ancient Mastodon language, for it had always been the custom with discoverers to perpetuate their names and honor themselves by this sort of connection with their discoveries.|$|E
60|$|But {{there are}} other {{instances}} of insects which haunt ants' nests, which it is far harder to account for on any hypothesis save that of superstitious veneration. There is a little weevil that runs about by hundreds in the galleries of English ants, in and out among the free citizens, making itself quite at home in their streets and public places, but as little noticed by the ants themselves as dogs are in our own cities. Then, again, there is a white <b>woodlouse,</b> something like the common little armadillo, but blind from having lived so long underground, which walks {{up and down the}} lanes and alleys of antdom, without ever holding any communication of any sort with its hosts and neighbours. In neither case has Sir John Lubbock ever seen an ant take the slightest notice of the presence of these strange fellow-lodgers. 'One might almost imagine,' he says, 'that they had the cap of invisibility.' Yet it is quite clear that the ants deliberately sanction the residence of the weevils and woodlice in their nests, for any unauthorised intruder would immediately be set upon and massacred outright.|$|E
6000|$|... "So be it, good your lordship," [...] piped {{the weak}} treble of the {{wrinkled}} and withered Professor <b>Woodlouse,</b> [...] "for we shall hear from your lordship's lips naught but wisdom." [...] [Here the speaker threw in {{a mess of}} trite, threadbare, exasperating quotations from the ancient poets and philosophers, delivering them with unction in the sounding grandeurs of the original tongues, they being from the Mastodon, the Dodo, and other dead languages.] [...] "Perhaps I ought not to presume to meddle with matters pertaining to astronomy at all, in such a presence as this, I who have made it the business {{of my life to}} delve only among the riches of the extinct languages and unearth the opulence of their ancient lore; but still, as unacquainted as I am with the noble science of astronomy, I beg with deference and humility to suggest that inasmuch as the last of these wonderful apparitions proceeded in exactly the opposite direction from that pursued by the first, which you decide to be the Vernal Equinox, and greatly resembled it in all particulars, is it not possible, nay certain, that this last is the Autumnal Equi--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Those kinds {{which include}} no other subdivisions than the sexes, or various breeds, are called, in {{technical}} language, species. The English lobster is a species, our cray fish is another, our prawn is another. In other countries, however, there are lobsters, cray fish, and prawns, very like ours, and yet presenting sufficient differences to deserve distinction. Naturalists, therefore, express this resemblance and this diversity by grouping them as distinct {{species of the}} same [...] "genus." [...] But the lobster and the cray fish, though belonging to distinct genera, have many features in common, and hence are grouped together in an assemblage which is called a family. More distant resemblances connect the lobster with the prawn and the crab, which are expressed by putting all these into the same order. Again, more remote, but still very definite, resemblances unite the lobster with the <b>woodlouse,</b> the king crab, the water flea, and the barnacle, and separate them from all other animals; whence they collectively constitute the larger group, or class, Crustacea. But the Crustacea exhibit many peculiar features in common with insects, spiders, and centipedes, so that these are grouped into the still larger assemblage or [...] "province" [...] Articulata; and, finally, the relations which these have to worms and other lower animals, are expressed by combining the whole vast aggregate into the sub-kingdom of Annulosa.|$|E
60|$|We {{found on}} St. Paul's only {{two kinds of}} birds--the booby and the noddy. The former is a species of gannet, and the latter a tern. Both are of a tame and stupid disposition, and are so unaccustomed to visitors, that I could have killed any number of them with my {{geological}} hammer. The booby lays her eggs on the bare rock; but the tern makes a very simple nest with seaweed. By the side {{of many of these}} nests a small flying-fish was placed; which I suppose, had been brought by the male bird for its partner. It was amusing to watch how quickly a large and active crab (Graspus), which inhabits the crevices of the rock, stole the fish {{from the side of the}} nest, as soon as we had disturbed the parent birds. Sir W. Symonds, one of the few persons who have landed here, informs me that he saw the crabs dragging even the young birds out of their nests, and devouring them. Not a single plant, not even a lichen, grows on this islet; yet it is inhabited by several insects and spiders. The following list completes, I believe, the terrestrial fauna: a fly (Olfersia) living on the booby, and a tick which must have come here as a parasite on the birds; a small brown moth, belonging to a genus that feeds on feathers; a beetle (Quedius) and a <b>woodlouse</b> from beneath the dung; and lastly, numerous spiders, which I suppose prey on these small attendants and scavengers of the waterfowl. The often-repeated description of the stately palm and other noble tropical plants, then birds, and lastly man, taking possession of the coral islets as soon as formed, in the Pacific, is probably not quite correct; I fear it destroys the poetry of this story, that feather and dirt-feeding and parasitic insects and spiders should be the first inhabitants of newly formed oceanic land.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Professor Snail was making some {{telescopic}} inspections. He discovered {{a great number}} of these trees, extending in a single rank, with wide intervals between, as far as his instrument would carry, both southward and northward. He also presently discovered that all these trees were bound together, near their tops, by fourteen great ropes, one above another, which ropes were continuous, from tree to tree, as far as his vision could reach. This was surprising. Chief Engineer Spider ran aloft and soon reported that these ropes were simply a web hung there by some colossal member of his own species, for he could see its prey dangling here and there from the strands, in the shape of mighty shreds and rags that had a woven look about their texture and were no doubt the discarded skins of prodigious insects which had been caught and eaten. And then he ran along one of the ropes to make a closer inspection, but felt a smart sudden burn on the soles of his feet, accompanied by a paralyzing shock, wherefore he let go and swung himself to the earth by a thread of his own spinning, and advised all to hurry at once to camp, lest the monster should appear and get as much interested in the savants as they were in him and his works. So they departed with speed, making notes about the gigantic web as they went. And that evening the naturalist of the expedition built a beautiful model of the colossal spider, having no need to see it in order to do this, because he had picked up a fragment of its vertebra by the tree, and so knew exactly what the creature looked like and what its habits and its preferences were by this simple evidence alone. He built it with a tail, teeth, fourteen legs, and a snout, and said it ate grass, cattle, pebbles, and dirt with equal enthusiasm. This animal was regarded as a very precious addition to science. It was hoped a dead one might be found to stuff. Professor <b>Woodlouse</b> thought that he and his brother scholars, by lying hid and being quiet, might maybe catch a live one. He was advised to try it. Which was all the attention that was paid to his suggestion. The conference ended with the naming the monster after the naturalist, since he, after God, had created it.|$|E
