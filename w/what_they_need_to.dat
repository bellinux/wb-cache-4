25|$|The {{focus on}} {{outcomes}} creates a clear expectation of {{what needs to}} be accomplished {{by the end of the}} course. Students will understand what is expected of them and teachers will know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> teach during the course. Clarity is important over years of schooling and when team teaching is involved. Each team member, or year in school, will have a clear understanding of {{what needs to be}} accomplished in each class, or at each level, allowing students to progress. Those designing and planning the curriculum are expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided upon; they must determine what knowledge and skills will be required to reach the outcome.|$|E

25|$|Simplicity to Friends has {{generally}} been a reference to material possessions. Friends have often limited their possessions to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> live their lives, rather than accumulating luxuries. The testimony {{is not just about}} the nature of one's material possessions, but rather also about one's attitude towards these material goods. Many Friends who have been considered exemplary have also been wealthy; their commitment to the testimony, however, led them to use their wealth for spiritual purposes, including aid to the poor and oppressed. On the other hand, some Friends, such as John Woolman, gave up much of their wealth and economic position when they felt it to be a spiritual burden.|$|E
25|$|As {{human beings}} (Dasein) {{navigate}} their world around them, {{they look for}} tools and ways to accomplish <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do: food and water for survival, instruments to complete tasks, shelter for protection etc. Heidegger theorized that Dasein’s “quest” to exist, so to speak, can only be completed via his relationship with others and his world around him. This is what Slife termed radical relationality: human beings are fundamentally and inescapably relational beings. That human beings exist in-the-world as radically relational beings ultimately means that Dasein must seek out his existence through opportunities that present themselves in his world and through his relationships with others. In other words, what ontological hermeneutics is saying about what nature is that human beings cannot {{be thought of as}} merely “self-certain actants” capable of distancing themselves above and against their world effortly to determine rational courses of action, nor as little more than computers that have been programmed to react to stimuli. Instead, all understanding of how to exist comes from being-in-the-world and understanding one’s relation to, or place in, that world. Put another way, human beings conduct themselves within the context of their life-world (the world in which their lives take place) which provides Dasein with possibilities of how to act. It is this understanding of himself in that life-world that informs his choice.|$|E
500|$|Jackson was a {{national}} co-chairman of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. As such, he is involved in garnering support from the superdelegates. During the campaign, he provided the voice for some advertisements such as one South Carolina radio ad in which he said: [...] "Once, South Carolina voted for my father, and sent a strong message to the nation,...Next year, you can send more than a message. You can launch a president.'" [...] When describing Obama he stated that [...] "Barack Obama is not speaking {{as a friend of}} the community; he's part of the community...He doesn't always tell people what they want to hear. He tells them <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> hear.'" [...] During the campaign, he described Obama as the first [...] "successor" [...] of Martin Luther King Jr. to use the thoughtful and careful approach to language to frame social debate {{in a way that is}} unlikely to alienate whites and noted his ability to get various factions to agree with him and his political positions.|$|E

500|$|Before the character's debut, de Matteo {{described}} Angie as [...] "brassy" [...] and a [...] "liberal New Yorker," [...] {{which she}} said contrasts with the more conservative nature of the other characters. She commented that Angie [...] "is less of a housewife {{than the rest of}} them. She's a real broad." [...] However, de Matteo also noted that Angie is [...] "not just the brassy smart-talker" [...] and has a vulnerable side, which would be explored in the show. Cherry boosted Angie as [...] "a loving but tough Italian woman... who will do what she has to protect her family." [...] He also described her as [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "shielded," [...] which leaves her largely detached from the other women on the series. Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly described the character as [...] "icy." [...] Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky wrote that Angie was [...] "very real and very gritty," [...] noting that the character was capable [...] "of doing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> survive, no matter what the price." [...] Within the series, Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross) describes Angie as blunt and tactless.|$|E
500|$|William Luis {{argues that}} How the García Girls Lost Their Accents [...] "is {{an attempt to}} {{understand}} memory, the past and a time before the sisters lost their innocence and accents". Memory {{plays a significant role}} in the text, as a means by which the girls can return to the past of their childhood in the attempt to make sense of their present-day realities. The youngest child, Sofía carries with her only a single memory of her brief childhood on the island, in which the García's Haitian maid, Chucha, says a voodoo goodbye to the girls before they leave for the United States. Sofía feels segregated and deprived [...] "because she has only this one memory to help her reconstruct her bicultural, bilingual self. Though this lack of memory makes her the least divided of her sisters in many ways... the most disturbed, the most rebellious against her circumstances." [...] Ironically enough, Chucha’s voodoo prediction itself is largely concerned with the concept of memory, as she insists that after leaving the island the girls [...] "will be haunted by what they do and don't remember. But they have spirit in them. They will invent <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> survive". Julie Barak confirms this notion of memory as both a positive and negative force in the García girls’ constant struggle to unearth their true identities.|$|E

At the age of four, Nell receives a stolen copy of an interactive book, Young Lady's Illustrated : a [...] , in which is told the tale of Princess Nell and her various friends, kin, associates, , [...] originally intended for the wealthy Neo-Victorian [...] "Equity Lord" [...] Alexander Chung-Sik Finkle-McGraw's granddaughter. The story follows Nell's development under the tutelage of the Primer, and to a lesser degree, the lives of Elizabeth and Fiona, [...] girls who receive similar books. The Primer is intended to steer its reader intellectually toward a more interesting life, as defined by [...] "Equity Lord" [...] Alexander Chung-Sik Finkle-McGraw, and growing up to be an effective member of society. [...] The most important quality to achieving an [...] "interesting life" [...] is deemed to be a subversive attitude towards the status quo.
