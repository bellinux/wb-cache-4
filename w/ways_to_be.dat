However, his ideas for the office are ignored by Andy, leading to a discussion with Jim in the warehouse about their increasing dissatisfaction with Dunder Mifflin. Jim tells Darryl about his sports marketing job opportunity in Philadelphia and offers him a possible position. However, as Jim has yet to tell Pam, Darryl says he should before going forward. When Pam comes back, Jim reveals the job opportunity to Pam, who, despite giving her approval, is upset that Jim did not consult her beforehand.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, in 1990, Ted Turner's Goodwill Games {{were held}} in Seattle. News crews at the Pike Place Market {{discovered}} the fish market and its performances with customers, and they filmed them. Soon afterwards, the fish market appeared on Good Morning America, leading to the business and its employees being filmed by various film crews, and being featured in numerous magazines. Now, during the summer tourist season, the fishmongers will perform now in front {{of as many as}} 10,000 visitors daily. The success of the business has been cited to its human resources and employee attitudes. The employees of the fish market will often speak to businesses, civic groups, and schools on <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> successful, and has led to their being featured in motivational books.|$|E

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{community}} or collective authorship that Fitzpatrick explores {{is related to}} remix culture. She proposes a possible model of scholarly writing that collects and compiles work in illuminating <b>ways.</b> <b>To</b> <b>be</b> viable, this would require institutional acknowledgement {{that this kind of}} work is as valuable as the traditional scholarly monograph, and also the participation of the scholarly community in a gift economy with their work. She suggests that scholars use a Creative Commons license for scholarly work to facilitate the use and reuse of material for the collective benefit of the community.|$|E
60|$|I {{told you}} before, that good works must flow from faith: and now I tell you, {{that the best}} <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{fruitful}} in them, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much {{in the exercise of}} the doctrine of justification by grace; and they both agree; for as faith animates to good works, so the doctrine of grace animates faith. Wherefore, the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rich in good works, it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rich in faith; and the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rich in faith <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conscientiously affirming the doctrine of grace to others, and believing it ourselves.|$|R

500|$|Democratic Party figures {{claimed they}} did not know much about him or his businesses, but {{appreciated}} his support; and he became known to them as someone who could quickly raise large amounts of money, and as someone who networked tirelessly and always found <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> included in high-profile events.

Electronic Gaming Monthly's Nick Plessas wrote that Dishonored 2 [...] " [...] many of the positive experiences from the previous instalment, but [...] much greater {{effort on the part of}} the player this time around to achieve it".

500|$|Although Sullivan {{sought in}} some <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{moderate}} {{voice in the}} highly partisan disagreements between Federalists and Republicans, he supported the policy of President Thomas Jefferson in embargoing trade with Great Britain and France, who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars. [...] The Embargo Act of 1807 had a significant negative impact on shipping interests based in Massachusetts ports, and Federalists sought to use this, and the threats of war emanating from the Jefferson administration, to unseat Sullivan in 1808. [...] Federalist Senator Timothy Pickering wrote an open letter raising the specter of war and charging Jefferson with failing to publish critical documents in ongoing negotiations. [...] He then asked Sullivan to formally {{send it to the}} state legislature, with the view that this would imply Sullivan's agreement with its content. [...] Sullivan refused, after which Federalists used that fact to charge that Republicans generally were withholding damaging information. [...] Sullivan's defense included letters by Senator John Quincy Adams countering the Federalist charges. [...] While this was sufficient to ensure Sullivan's reelection in 1808, control of the legislature was returned to the Federalists. [...] Republicans were unhappy with Sullivan's handling of the political attacks, and for his refusal to remove Federalists from patronage positions in the government.|$|E
500|$|The {{time period}} of {{recording}} was a high-point in musical style for both Joey and Johnny, though they directed their sound towards {{different styles of}} music: Joey's inspiration by pop music became evident in his writing, while Johnny's keenness of hard-rock guitar riffs are apparent in much of his performing on the album. Johnny thought that this did not result well for the band's sound, saying: [...] "I knew going in {{that this was not}} going to be the type of album I wanted. It really could have used another two of three punk songs...All I [...] want to do is keep our fans happy and not sell out. I'm fighting within the band. They are trying to [...] go lighter, looking for <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more commercial. I'm against the band for doing that." [...] Joey countered Johnny's point of preventing the band from selling out by explaining: [...] "By Road to Ruin [...] End of the Century, I was doing the majority of the songwriting. I started feeling that the Ramones were faceless; there were no individual identities in the band." [...] He went on to say that this method worked well in the beginning of their career, but would later annoy Joey since [...] "everything [...] wrote, the band would take credit for." ...|$|E

In regards to Jason Sudeikis, Rabin commented that he is a [...] "gifted comic actor" [...] but this episode [...] "found him at his hammy, embarrassing worst." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, remarked that the episode [...] "may have been the worst one yet", and said that when Floyd [...] called Liz a [...] "badger", her heart broke into smithereens, [...] "There's mean-funny, and then there's plain old mean. [...] Liz's love life has become the central butt of the joke on 30 Rock... and it's starting to feel like the writers have run out of <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> funny without being sadistic." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said that [...] "Floyd" [...] was not a great episode, [...] "but it's still pretty good by this season's standards, if a somewhat disappointing use of Floyd's return."

[...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that it [...] "really didn't do it for me. I didn't really laugh out loud much, and the cameo from one of my favorite SNL players came off a bit forced." ...|$|E
