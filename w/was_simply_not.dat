5|$|The {{alternative}} {{train of}} thought is that it <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> advantageous to be large until {{the appearance of the}} Ediacarans: the environment favoured the small over the large. Examples of such scenarios today include plankton, whose small size allows them to reproduce rapidly to take advantage of ephemerally abundant nutrients in algal blooms. But for large size never to be favourable, the environment would have to be very different indeed.|$|E
5|$|By 1963 McNamara had {{convinced}} Kennedy that the Zeus <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> worth deploying. The earlier concerns about cost and effectiveness, {{as well as}} new difficulties in terms of attack size and decoy problems, led McNamara to cancel the Zeus project on 5 January 1963. In its place they decided to continue work on Nike-X. Nike-X development was based in the existing Nike Zeus Project Office until their name was changed to Nike-X on 1 February 1964.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} this success, it was clear the Blenheim <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> going {{to work as a}} fighter. On several {{occasions}} the CH stations directed the fighters to a successful radar capture, only to have the target slowly pull away from the fighter. In one case the Blenheim was able to see the target, but when it spotted them the aircraft increased power and disappeared. From 1 to 15 October 1940 Mk. III-equipped fighters from RAF Kenley made 92 flights, performed 28 radar interceptions, and made zero kills.|$|E
5|$|The new He 162 {{had about}} 30 minutes worth of fuel. This {{endurance}} <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> enough, {{and at least}} two JG 1 pilots were killed making Deadstick landing after exhausting their fuel. By April, I./JG 1 had scored a number of kills, but at the cost of 13 He 162s and 10 pilots. The losses were mostly attributed to issues with the He 162 such as engine flame-outs or occasional structural failures, which can most probably be attributed to poor design and insufficient development time. On 24 April 1945, III./JG 1 was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|According to musicologist Francis Maes, Rubinstein {{could not}} be accused of any lack of artistic integrity. He fought for change and {{progress}} in musical life in Russia. Only his musical tastes were conservative—from Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven to the early Romantics up to Chopin. Liszt and Wagner were not included. Neither did he welcome many ideas then new about music, including the role of nationalism in classical music. For Rubinstein, national music existed only in folk song and folk dance. There {{was no place for}} national music in larger works, especially not in opera. Rubinstein's public reaction to the attacks <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> to react. His classes and concerts were well attended, so he felt no reply was actually necessary. He even forbade his students to take sides.|$|E

5|$|Stroma's {{population}} fell precipitously {{through the}} first half of the 20th century, leading eventually to the island's final abandonment at the end of the 1950s. There was no single cause that precipitated the collapse of Stroma's population. Living conditions on the island were always basic; there was no running water or electricity, and gas only arrived in the 1950s, which contrasted poorly with the improvements being made on the mainland. The fishing deteriorated after the First World War, and crofting became an increasingly difficult way to make a living. The island was relatively overpopulated; by 1901 the population was nearly twice that of sixty years previously, and there was little spare land left for farming. Families of six to eight children were common, but there <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> enough work for all, so the eldest often left for the mainland or emigrated to Canada or the United States to find work. The lack of a proper harbour meant that the islanders could not make use of larger boats or develop a modern fishery. Young people started moving away to seek better-paying opportunities elsewhere, eventually followed by their parents.|$|E
5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or rotoscope the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> possible for the live action crew.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the general}} public were unaware, {{chairman}} Peter Ridsdale had taken out large loans against the prospect of gate receipts from Champions League games. As Leeds had failed {{to qualify for the}} competition, there <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> enough money coming in to repay the debt. The first indication that the club was in financial trouble was the sale of Rio Ferdinand to Manchester United for £30million, a world record for a defender.

25|$|Bill Edrich {{did some}} {{service as a}} fastish bowler with a {{slinging}} action while Norman Yardley's all-round skill won him a place in all the Tests.

25|$|The {{system did}} exactly what had been asked of it; it {{provided}} very accurate range measurements {{on the order of}} 50yards. However, in the field it became clear that this <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> enough. By late 1939 the spectre of night bombing was a major concern, and as the GL system could not provide accurate bearing information, and no elevation, it was unable to direct the guns at night. Instead the World War I style of operation was used, with searchlights hunting for targets largely at random, and conventional optical instruments being used to determine bearing and elevation once a target was lit up.|$|E
25|$|On December 23, 1948, Hideki Tōjō and {{six other}} Class A war criminals were hanged. The next day, all Class A {{suspects}} {{who had not been}} indicted were released (aside from the seven who were executed, eighteen were given very long or life sentences.) Sasakawa and Kodama were among those who were released. There is much speculation surrounding Sasakawa's release, while some suggest that there <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> enough evidence to indict him of Class A war crimes, others believe it was {{due to a lack of}} resources available to carry out trials of all suspected war criminals. The two men subsequently chose different paths in life, but maintained their friendship until the death of Kodama in 1984.|$|E
25|$|On 5 December 1940, Hitler {{met with}} the German High Command and decided to request {{permission}} from Franco for German troops to cross the Spanish border on 10 January 1941. It was planned that General Jodl would go to Spain to make preparations for the attack on Gibraltar as soon as Canaris had obtained Franco's agreement. Canaris accordingly met with Franco on 7 December and put to Franco the need for Spain's immediate entry into the war. Franco responded that Spain <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> capable of supporting the German army, due to shortages of food and the crippled infrastructure {{and nature of the}} country still recovering from its recent civil war. He also expressed his fear that German seizure of Gibraltar would lead to the loss of the Canary Islands and Spain's other overseas possessions by a British counter-invasion.|$|E

25|$|This {{diplomacy}} {{was initially}} successful because the reigning Tsar, Alexander I (r.1801–25), {{was reluctant to}} support any revolutionary movement because of his experience during the Napoleonic Wars. Despite fervent support for the Greek cause in Russian nationalist circles, Alexander proved unwilling to defy Metternich and Castlereagh and offer the Greeks more than (limited) diplomatic support. Indeed, at the Congress of Verona (1822), Castlereagh persuaded Tsar Alexander to ignore the Greek cause altogether, even refusing to admit a Greek delegation to the conference. In the same year, Alexander also forced the resignation of his ethnic Venetian/Greek foreign minister, Count Giovanni Capo d'Istria (Ioannis Kapodistrias, later president of the First Hellenic Republic), for his passionate advocacy of the Greek cause. In 1824 the Tsar proposed a plan for Greek autonomy to the other powers, {{but it was clear}} that he <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> prepared to act unilaterally.|$|E
25|$|In August 1997, Liverpool, {{having been}} unable to agree a new {{contract}} with McManaman and fearing that the player might leave on a Bosman free transfer, accepted a £12million bid for the player from Barcelona. The deal subsequently fell apart amidst recriminations about the player's remuneration demands and Barcelona's motives for the bid, being in negotiation with Rivaldo {{at the same time}} and snubbing McManaman when he travelled to Spain to meet them. By the end of the saga, the whole fiasco seemed to be a non-affair, with Barcelona signing Rivaldo after Sir Bobby Robson intervened and told Louis van Gaal that McManaman was a cosmetic player who would not score 18 goals a season for Barcelona, while McManaman himself stated that he had no desire to leave Liverpool and with two years left on his contract <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> in any rush to sign a new one. A subsequent bid of £11million from Juventus in November of the same year was rejected by both club and player.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-two {{members of}} the Obama {{administration}} are either in the United States Cabinet (15) or are in positions considered to be Cabinet-level (7) and must be confirmed by the current Senate. The {{members of the}} Cabinet are {{the heads of the}} fifteen major departments (State, Defense, Justice, etc.), and the seven cabinet-level positions are the Vice President, White House Chief of Staff, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador to the United Nations, and Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Since Robert Gates {{was a member of the}} previous administration, his letter of resignation (a formality at the end of a President's term) <b>was</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> accepted, and he did not need confirmation.

On January 21, Obama presided over the swearing in of the seven unanimous nominees. Later that day, the Senate confirmed Hillary Clinton by a 94–2 vote. On January 22, several more confirmations were approved unanimously: Susan E. Rice, Ray LaHood, Lisa P. Jackson, and Shaun Donovan. On January 26, the Senate confirmed Timothy Geithner by a 60–34 margin, and Holder was confirmed on February 2 by a 75–21 margin.
