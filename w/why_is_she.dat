500|$|M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003) {{indicates}} Potter was venturing into new territory in creating a tale with a large human presence (Lucie). Potter's artistic uncertainty is evident in her attempt to establish a relationship between clothes and the social and animal selves of humans and animals. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle wears human clothing while the neighbourhood animals wear and shed only their skins. Logically, Kutzer points out, all the animals should wear either human clothing or only their skins. She believes Peter Rabbit's blue jacket {{is used in the}} tale as a gimmick to remind the reader that other Potter books exist for purchase, and a gimmick that disrupts Potter's artistic intent. If Peter wears human clothing then why do the other animals wear only their skins? The issue of animal clothing versus human clothing is further confused when Mrs. Tiggy-winkle sheds her human clothing {{at the end of the}} tale to reveal herself a hedgehog who may or may not be able to shed her skin as well. If she can shed her skin, then <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> wearing human clothes? [...] Kutzer believes these questions remain unanswered and erode the tale's logic.|$|E
500|$|Cyrus' first live {{performance}} of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] at the Teen Choice Awards held on August 10, 2009. Clothed by {{a tank top}} that revealed a portion of her bra, black hot pants, and leather boots, Cyrus and backup dancers appeared from a trailer. Midway through the performance, Cyrus danced atop an ice cream pushcart with a pole (which was suggested to be a dance pole by numerous critics) for approximately forty seconds. Cyrus described the performance to be about her heritage: [...] " [...] performance tonight is funny, but I {{wanted it to be}} about [...] I'm like, 'This is to represent where I am from. I'm so proud of it.' All the girls trying to be Hollywood and stuff with their big glasses, me shooing them away." [...] The performance was met with a media uproar in regards to her dancing being too suggestive and sexual for a teen-oriented event, which caused The Walt Disney Company to issue a statement distancing themselves from the performance. Ian Drew, senior editor of Us Weekly said, [...] "She already has this risque image, so it really wasn't much of a stretch. That's how Britney [...] took off. She was the good girl gone bad, and it looks to be working for Miley as well." [...] Other contemporary critics used negative comparisons to Spears, but Cyrus welcomed the comparisons via a post on her official Twitter account. Child psychologist Wendi Fischer told Newsday: Cyrus was communicating to her fans that it is acceptable to pole dance, which, according to Fischer, was unacceptable. [...] "Miley's only 16. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> rushing it?", she concluded. Other critics defended Cyrus. Apryl Duncan of About.com said viewers should have fixated on her accomplishments that night, winning six awards, rather than the sexuality of the performance. Following the backlash of the performance, Cyrus replaced the ice cream pushcart with a luggage cart while touring.|$|E

After nineteen years in which to learn every line of her face and body, every secret of her nature, she still eluded him; that elusiveness, which had begun by being such a charm, had got on his nerves, and extinguished the flame it had once lighted. He had so often tried to see, and never seen, the essence of her soul. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> made like this? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> for ever mocking herself, himself, and every other thing? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> so hard to her own life, so bitter a foe to her own happiness? Leonardo da Vinci might have painted her, less sensual and cruel than his women, more restless and disharmonic, but physically, spiritually enticing, and, by her refusals to surrender either to her spirit or her senses, baffling her own enticements.|$|R
