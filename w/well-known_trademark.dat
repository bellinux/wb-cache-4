40|$|The luxury {{industry}} {{plays an}} important role in many contemporary western and eastern societies. This Article discusses the rapid global expansion of the luxury industry and the role of anti-dilution laws in protecting luxury brands. It reveals that luxury companies face two major challenges in securing adequate anti-dilution protection while they market their products or services globally. At the international level, the major intellectual property treaties afford no minimum standards for anti-confusion protection of <b>well-known</b> <b>trademarks.</b> At the domestic level, divergences in anti-dilution protections in the world’s three main luxury markets, the European Union, the United States, and China, have rendered it more difficult for luxury companies to prevent and stop the potential dilutions of their brands. Based on the analysis of these two challenges, the Article offers thoughts about how policy makers should improve anti-dilution protection for luxury brands while meeting their duties to adequately protect the public interest...|$|R
40|$|What characterizes <b>well-known</b> <b>trademarks</b> is {{that they}} carry a certain power of attraction, image and {{prestige}} and cannot only be looked upon as symbols of origin for goods and services. As such, these brands are particularly exposed to brand-napping, which {{could be described as}} a one-way and free value transfer of the vital parts of a brand concept. The purpose of the thesis is to investigate the legal protection against this unfair market behaviour in the EU and, based on that, outline appropriate strategic actions for brand-owners in order to build a strong brand position. The results indicate that goodwill increasingly is being recognized as an autonomous objective in need of protection and that brand-owners have advanced their positions when it comes to protecting the goodwill of their brands. The conclusion of the thesis is that by claiming a unique position, protecting the right triggers, penetrating the market and by the use of brand diversification and a conform brand approach, brand-owners will stand well prepared against potential value transfers.

40|$|Trademark {{counterfeiting}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious problems ever encountered in China. The Chinese government, recognizing the adverse effects that counterfeiting has had on both foreign investment and the nation's economy, has begun to take steps to protect intellectual property rights. To this end, the nation amended its Trademark Law on 27 October 2001. The aims of the amendment are to improve management of trademarks, to strengthen punishment for infringements, and to further meet the requirements of the TRIPs. Although the new amendment is laudable, eliminating the problem will take time. This thesis offers an overview of trademark enforcement in China, beginning with a historical review of China's trademark law before moving on to examine the original version of current trademark legislation, the 1982 Trademark Law. The entry into force of the WTO placed tremendous pressure on China to meet international standards, resulting in the 2001 amendment and the protection it affords to <b>well-known</b> <b>trademarks,</b> as is discussed next. Finally, an examination of the enforcement of the trademark law in China, including the status of counterfeiting, the enforcement system, and the difficulties associated with enforcing trademark rights, is undertaken. The thesis concludes that the Chinese government has made remarkable progress in its quest to combat trademark counterfeiting and that the problem will gradually be overcome as the nation continues to develop its economy and enhance its legal system...|$|R
