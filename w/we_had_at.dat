500|$|On August 28, the FBI New York {{field office}} {{requested}} that {{a criminal case}} be opened to determine whether Mihdhar {{was still in the}} United States, but the request was refused. The FBI ended up treating Mihdhar as an intelligence case, which meant that the FBI's criminal investigators could not work on the case, due to the barrier separating intelligence and criminal case operations. [...] An agent in the New York office sent an e-mail to FBI headquarters saying, [...] "Whatever has happened to this, someday someone will die, and the public will not understand why we were not more effective and throwing every resource <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> certain 'problems.'"

500|$|The 2007–08 {{season began}} badly for Drogba as he {{expressed}} {{doubts about the}} departure of manager José Mourinho. He was reportedly in tears when Mourinho {{told him he was}} leaving the club, and said [...] "Mourinho's departure destroys a certain familiarity <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> the club. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation". Following these claims, Drogba told France Football Magazine [...] "I want to leave Chelsea. Something is broken with Chelsea, The damage is big in the dressing room". Despite having signed a four-year contract with the club in 2006, Drogba reportedly pointed out several favoured clubs in the interview, identifying Barcelona, Real Madrid, Milan or Internazionale as possible future destinations, he later admitted he regretted this and was 100% committed to Chelsea. Drogba made it up to the fans by scoring in Chelsea's 2–0 victory over Middlesbrough on 20 October 2007, against Schalke 04 in the Champions League four days later, and two goals against Manchester City. In December 2007, Drogba was voted fourth (after Kaká, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo) for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year.|$|E
500|$|McGovern was {{assigned}} to Liberal Army Airfield in Kansas and its transition school to learn to fly the B‑24 Liberator, an assignment he was pleased with. McGovern recalled later: [...] "Learning how to fly the B‑24 was {{the toughest part of}} the training. It was a difficult airplane to fly, physically, because {{in the early part of}} the war, they didn't have hydraulic controls. If you can imagine driving a Mack truck without any power steering or power brakes, that's about what it was like at the controls. It was the biggest bomber <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> the time." [...] Eleanor was constantly afraid of her husband's suffering an accident while training, which claimed a huge toll of airmen over the course of the war. This schooling was followed by a stint at Lincoln Army Airfield in Nebraska, where McGovern met his B-24 crew. Traveling around the country and mixing with people from different backgrounds proved to be a broadening experience for McGovern and others of his generation. The USAAF sped up training times for McGovern and others due to the heavy losses that bombing missions were suffering over Europe. Despite, and partly because of, the risk that McGovern might not come back from combat, the McGoverns decided to have a child, and Eleanor became pregnant. In June 1944, McGovern's crew received final training at Mountain Home Army Air Field in Idaho. They then shipped out via Camp Patrick Henry in Virginia, where McGovern found history books with which to fill downtime, especially during the trip overseas on a slow troopship.|$|E

2500|$|Orwell relates his {{involvement}} in the Barcelona street fighting that began on 3 May when the Government Assault Guards tried to take the Telephone Exchange from the CNT workers who controlled it. For his part, Orwell acted as part of the POUM, guarding a POUM-controlled building. Although he realises that he is fighting {{on the side of the}} working class, Orwell describes his dismay at coming back to Barcelona on leave from the front only to get mixed up in street fighting. Assault Guards from Valencia arrive—"All of them were armed with brand-new rifles ... vastly better than the dreadful old blunderbusses <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> the front." [...] The Communist-controlled Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia newspapers declare POUM to be a disguised Fascist organisation—"No one who was in Barcelona then ... will forget the horrible atmosphere produced by fear, suspicion, hatred, censored newspapers, crammed jails, enormous food queues, and prowling gangs ...." [...] In his second appendix to the book, Orwell discusses the political issues at stake in the May 1937 Barcelona fighting, as he saw them at the time and later on, looking back.|$|E
2500|$|George Martin, the Beatles' producer, {{questioned}} {{the validity of}} the major sixth chord that ends the song, an idea suggested by George Harrison. [...] "They sort of finished on this curious singing chord which was a major sixth, with George [...] doing the sixth and the others doing the third and fifth in the chord. It was just like a Glenn Miller arrangement." [...] The device had also been used by country music-influenced artists in the 1950s. McCartney later reflected: [...] "We took it to George Martin and sang 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeeeeaah ...' and that tight little sixth cluster <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> the end. George [...] said: 'It's very corny, I would never end on a sixth'. But we said 'It's such a great sound, it doesn't matter'". The Beatles: Complete Scores shows only the notes D (the fifth) and E (the sixth) sung for the final chord, while on the recording McCartney sang G (the root) as Harrison sang E and Lennon sang D.|$|E
