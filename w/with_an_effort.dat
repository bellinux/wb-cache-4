5|$|Rapid, however, appealed, {{citing the}} alleged injury to their player. The initial appeal was {{dismissed}} by UEFA, but a second appeal {{from the club}} was upheld and a replay was ordered to take place at least 150 kilometres (90 miles) from Glasgow. The Celtic board acquiesced to this decision in spite of considered opinion that Celtic should withdraw from the tournament on principle. As such, the match at Parkhead was declared void and a third match was held in Manchester at Old Trafford. Celtic lost 0–1, the goal coming on 18 minutes when after Roy Aitken had hit the post <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> for Celtic, Rapid immediately caught Celtic on the break to score the only goal of the game. Worse, two Celtic fans assaulted Rapid Wien players; one fan running onto the pitch and accosting the goalkeeper during the game, whilst at full-time another Rapid player was kicked by a fan. UEFA fined Celtic and ordered their next home European tie to take place behind closed doors.|$|E

25|$|Stalin died in March 1953, and {{apparently}} fearing that the Soviet ruler's demise might encourage rivals within the Albanian party's ranks, neither Hoxha nor Shehu risked traveling to Moscow to attend his funeral. The Soviet Union's subsequent movement toward rapprochement with the hated Yugoslavs rankled the two Albanian leaders. Tirana soon came {{under pressure from}} Moscow to copy, at least formally, the new Soviet model for a collective leadership. In July 1953, Hoxha handed over the foreign affairs and defense portfolios to loyal followers, but he kept both the top party post and the premiership until 1954, when Shehu became Albania's prime minister. The Soviet Union, responding <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to raise the Albanian leaders' morale, elevated diplomatic {{relations between the two}} countries to the ambassadorial level.|$|E
25|$|A week later, at the {{beginning}} of March, Stevenage won their second away game on the bounce; beating Eastbourne Borough 60. Captain Mark Roberts gave Stevenage the lead just before the break, following a well-worked free-kick involving both Joel Byrom and Scott Laird. After the interval, Stevenage doubled their lead when David Bridges headed in Joel Byrom's cross. It was three shortly after following a mistake from Eastbourne goalkeeper Danny Knowles, Chris Beardsley blocked the goalkeepers clearance and slid the ball into an empty net. It got worse for the home side ten minutes from time when Beardsley chased a long through ball and was hauled down by Darren Baker just inside the area - the defender being shown a straight red. Substitute Mitchell Cole slotted the penalty home, before adding another after good work from Eddie Odhiambo. Cole completed his hat-trick moments later slotting home Stacy Long's through ball. A third successive victory followed in a 20 win at home to Crawley Town. In a tight game, Stevenage took the lead just after the interval thanks to a rasping effort from Michael Bostwick after a well-worked corner. A second goal came deep into injury-time, Chris Beardsley countering and setting up Lee Boylan to slide the ball into the net. Three days later, Stevenage beat Barrow 40 to ensure a fourth consecutive win. In a tight first half, the home side took the lead through Yemi Odubade. Borough doubled their lead shortly before the interval; left-back Scott Laird firing the ball home. Odubade then scored his second after countering a Barrow corner, and subsequently completed his hat-trick late on <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> drilled high into the net. Stevenage recorded their fifth straight win, beating Histon 10 at Broadhall Way. Jon Ashton scored the only goal of the game when he swept home Stacy Long's corner.|$|E

500|$|After Reading went {{four games}} without a win {{starting}} on 24 January 1976, a late goal from Friday ended this run on 25 February, {{in a home}} match against Hartlepool United; twelve minutes from time, he collected a pass from Stewart Henderson and neatly placed the ball past the goalkeeper {{from the edge of}} the penalty area. [...] "One is increasingly under the impression", the Evening Post reported, [...] "that if Friday was out for some time through injury the Reading team would fall to pieces". Led by the free-scoring Friday, the side continued its push for promotion; fourth or higher would be enough to go up. A vital fixture on 31 March 1976 pitted fourth-placed Reading at home against Tranmere Rovers, who occupied third spot; internationally experienced referee Clive Thomas took charge of the game. Friday, who had already scored 18 goals that season, rose to the occasion <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> that has been described by many sources as one of the greatest ever scored.|$|E
500|$|In Pound's Fenollosa translations, unlike {{previous}} American translators of Chinese poetry, which {{tended to}} work with strict metrical and stanzaic patterns, Pound created free verse translations. Whether the poems are valuable as translations {{continues to be a}} source of controversy. [...] Hugh Kenner contends that Cathay should be read primarily as a work about World War I, not as an attempt at accurately translating ancient Eastern poems. The real achievement of the book, Kenner argues, is in how it combines meditations on violence and friendship <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to [...] "rethink the nature of an English poem". These ostensible translations of ancient Eastern texts, Kenner argues, are actually experiments in English poetics and compelling elegies for a warring West. Pound scholar Ming Xie explains that Pound's use of language in his translation of [...] "The Seafarer" [...] is deliberate, in that he avoids merely [...] "trying to assimilate the original into contemporary language".|$|E
500|$|It took {{twenty-two years}} for {{an attempt to}} revive the rivalry. In 1911, both schools agreed to open their seasons <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> {{to bring back the}} competition. The game, played on October 7, began [...] " [...] {{somewhat}} of a disappointment" [...] for the Naval Academy, when Johns Hopkins scored early in the contest. Navy managed an 8–0–1 record the previous season, and went unscored upon. However, the Academy recovered and put up twenty-seven unanswered points to win 27–5. Only one other team, North Carolina A, managed to score on the Naval Academy that season, putting up just six points. The teams agreed to start their following season with another playing of the rivalry. Navy considered Hopkins to be [...] "a small eastern college to practice upon", instead of a serious opponent. The Academy's team entered the game expecting an easy win, but were surprised by Johns Hopkins and barely managed a 7–3 victory. The rivalry was yet again ended after that game, but returned for one final playing in 1919. The 1921 Naval Academy yearbook wrote that Johns Hopkins was [...] "outweighed, outgeneraled, and outclassed in every department of the game, they were shoved back over their goal line ten times". The game was the most lopsided in the rivalry's history, Navy winning 66–0.|$|E

500|$|African Americans pioneered rural {{settlements}} in the state throughout {{the first half of}} the nineteenth-century. Although Indiana entered the Union in 1816 as a free state it gave only a tepid welcome to African Americans and frequently sought to exclude and/or marginalize African Americans from public and social life. African Americans faced discrimination on a variety of fronts. Blacks were denied the right to testify in court in 1818. In 1829 the Indiana Colonization Society was founded to help repatriate African Americans to Liberia which reflected a desire to rid the state of its black residents. [...] The 1830 census recorded three slaves in the state. The earliest days of the territory and of statehood witnessed intense debates over whether to allow slavery in Indiana. Laws in the 1830s sought to prevent free blacks from entering the state without certificates of freedom under threat of fines and expulsion. [...] While the 1830 law was only sporadically enforced it reflected hostility towards African Americans and their settlement in the state. Throughout the early nineteenth century, Black Hoosiers struggled to enjoy basic civil rights in the state, including the right to educate their children. In 1837 and 1841 the state shifted towards formally excluding African Americans from public education. In 1837 the state legislature moved to recognize [...] "The white inhabitants of each congressional district" [...] as the citizens qualified to vote in school board elections. Four years later, they followed <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to preclude black households from school board assessments. This helped to establish Hoosier schools as de facto white. Efforts in 1842 to formally exclude African American children from public education were rebuffed, however. The State Committee on Education responded to the matter acknowledging that they [...] "...Are here, unfortunately, for us and them, and we have duties to perform in reference to their well-being." [...] Indiana also passed laws against interracial marriage in 1818 and 1821. Under 1840 state laws to ban miscegenation Indiana became the first state to make interracial marriage a felony. [...] Article XIII of the Indiana Constitution of 1851 sought to exclude African Americans from settling in the state, declaring [...] "No negro or mulatto shall come into or settle in the State." [...] This was the only provision of the new constitution submitted to a special election. Indiana constitutional convention delegates voted 93 to 40 in favor of the article. The popular vote was even more enthusiastic in its support for exclusion with a vote of 113,828 in favor and only 21,873 against excluding African Americans. [...] Throughout {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century, Indiana attempted to keep Black Hoosiers from attending public school, voting, testifying in court, and endeavored to set other limits on African American citizenship and inclusion. Racial hostility and discrimination co-existed alongside abolition sentiments and efforts, however. The Underground Railroad in Indiana sought to help runaway slaves escape to northern states and Canada. White Quakers, Baptists, and others worked to secure safe passage for runaway slaves. Abolition efforts conflicted with a growing antipathy towards free blacks in the state.|$|E
