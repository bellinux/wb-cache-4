40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{lubricating}} oil on surface {{quality of the}} extruded aluminum product were investigated by carrying {{out a series of}} plane strain cold extrusion experiments. The forming dies of extrusion apparatus were assembled with a combination of the taper die and the <b>plane</b> plate <b>tool</b> with the micro-groove arrays formed on its surface. Four lubricants were tested by using the above apparatus. Then, adhesion of aluminum billet to the surface section of the <b>plane</b> plate <b>tool</b> on which the micro-groove arrays were formed, surface roughness of the billet after passing through the above section of the <b>plane</b> plate <b>tool</b> and surface conditions of the billet and tool at the die bearing section of a tool were investigated, and performance evaluation of lubricant for producing smooth surface product could be carried out successfully...|$|R

Pressing both attack buttons together allows the character to block or dodge attacks. Another button combo gets the character to perform a special trick attack. The character can also jump and do jump attacks. Occasionally the character will be mounted on horseback and have to carefully hack and slash enemies during a canter.|$|R
5000|$|Tuscan {{is often}} used for doorways and other entrances where only a pair of columns are required, and using another order might seem pretentious. Because the Tuscan mode is easily worked up by a {{carpenter}} with a few <b>planing</b> <b>tools,</b> it {{became part of the}} vernacular Georgian style that lingered in places like New England and Ohio deep into the 19th century. In gardening, [...] "carpenter's Doric" [...] which is Tuscan, provides simple elegance to gate posts and fences in many traditional garden contexts.|$|R

40|$|Some {{planning}} and scheduling {{problems are not}} best modelled by a centralised, single processor environment. Due to external pressures, perhaps geographic or political, {{there is a natural}} distribution that does not just make some form of distributed solution easily imagined but to be positively encouraged. The problems arise when constraints on a local level interact on the <b>wider</b> <b>plane,</b> how should the constraints be propagated and enforced whilst still allowing local decision making and control?

50|$|On wide body-aircraft {{the center}} block of seats between the aisles can {{have as many}} as 5 seats on planes like the layout on most McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and some Boeing 777 aircraft, {{although}} Boeing recommends the 3+3+3 over the 2+5+2 layout. Very <b>wide</b> <b>planes</b> such as the Boeing 747 or the Airbus A380 have ten seats abreast, typically in a 3+4+3 layout, although this layout is also sometimes used as a high density layout on aircraft normally seating nine abreast, such as the 777 or DC-10. Recently, airlines have been adopting ten abreast seating on the Boeing 777-300 aircraft.|$|R

50|$|The {{shoulder}} plane (also bullnose plane) is a <b>plane</b> <b>tool</b> with a blade {{flush with the}} edges of the plane, allowing trimming right up {{to the edge of a}} workpiece. Like a rebate plane, the {{shoulder plane}}'s blade extends, therefore cuts, to the full width of the <b>tool.</b> The shoulder <b>plane</b> is used to trim the shoulders and faces of tenons. It is used when it is necessary to trim right into the concave corner where two surfaces of the same piece of wood meet perpendicularly. It is also commonly used to clean up dadoes (housings) and tenons for joinery.|$|R
40|$|Caustics {{experimental}} method {{is applied to}} a typical three dimensional problem, that is, out-of-plane loading problem to develop the applicational possibility of this method, because we can hardly find some examples of aaplying to three dimensional problem.

Moreover, the creating mechanism of Caustics patterns is investigated analytically by taking the path of the reflecting light ray from the specimen into consideration...|$|R
3000|$|We now review some of {{the design}} {{processes}} students displayed in their initial design creations, as evident in group transcripts. From the transcripts, {{it was apparent that}} students commenced with problem scoping where they frequently added familiar contexts (e.g., observing jet planes) to help them understand the boundaries of the problem and clarify its goal. Specifically, the issue arose of how closely the paper plane should be modeled on an actual aircraft. For example, Lilly’s group suggested that “The way I’d design it is like a normal plane…because the wings should be flat…but if it’s like a big <b>wide</b> <b>plane,</b> it has to be very thin so it can get through (the air) easily.” [...]...|$|R

40|$|The {{stages of}} contact between a metal chip of AISI 1018 steel and a coated cutting tool creates {{significant}} opportunities for manufacturers of machined products {{to understand how}} dry machining and minimum quantity lubrication affects the economics of manufacturing. The present work not only compares various computational approaches to the solution of shear <b>plane</b> and <b>tool</b> face temperatures during dry machining with nanostructured coated milling tools, but also explains why {{there is a large}} discrepancy when calculating temperature generated during machining when using Loewen and Shaw's method for calculating shear <b>plane</b> and <b>tool</b> face temperatures.

40|$|Based on the Navier-Stokes {{equations}} {{in which}} the pressure {{is assumed to be}} constant across the film thickness, various approximate solutions for the static and dynamic performances of an infinitely <b>wide,</b> <b>plane</b> inclined slider pad in a laminar flow regime are presented under the assumption of a small harmonic vibration. From comparison of the approximate solutions with the numerical one, it is concluded that one kind of averaging approach in which some of the time dependent terms are treated exactly while the convective inertia terms are averaged out across the film thickness gives close approximations {{in a wide range of}} desigining conditions, and that an other kind of averaging approach in which all the inertia terms including the time dependent terms are averaged out across the film thickness is a fairly good approximation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the two seemingly unrelated concepts of ‘Familiness’ and ‘Harambee Spirit’ {{in the context}} of Kenya. The key questions addressed in this paper are ‘to what extent are family firms, in particular, those operating in ICT sector, are embedded in ‘Harambee spirit’ and how does such embeddedness shape the family firms’ business operations? Based on the purposively selected three family ICT firms and relevant literature, the study provides evidence which shows the presence of main features of the ‘Harambee spirit’ and ‘Familiness’, and that some elements of these overlap. Furthermore, the study found variations in the extent to which some ‘Familiness” features were observed in sample firms. In a <b>wider</b> <b>plane,</b> the study furthers our understanding of how both the family and the national cultural contexts shape the behaviour of firms...|$|R

In interactive visualization, we adopt the ray casting algorithm of volume rendering and modify it to accelerate the rendering speed. We also provide the fundamental rotation and zooming operations in the visualization platform, and further implement an interface to display three regular views of the volume data. Furthermore, a clipping <b>plane</b> <b>tool</b> is provided to crop the heart at arbitrary point of view. 1...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of shape}} as a cue for {{indexing}} into pictorial databases has been traditionally based on global invariant statistics and deformable templates, {{on the one}} hand, and local edge correlation on the other. This paper proposes an intermediate approach based on a characterization of the symmetry in edge maps. The use of symmetry matching as a joint correlation measure between pairs of edge elements further constrains the comparison of edge maps. In addition, a natural organization of groups of symmetry into a hierarchy leads to a graph-based representation of relational structure of components of shape that allows for deformations by changing attributes of this relational graph. A graduate assignment graph matching algorithm is used to match symmetry structure in images to stored prototypes or sketches. The results of matching sketches and grey-scale images against a small database consisting {{of a variety of}} fish, <b>planes,</b> <b>tools,</b> etc., are depicted...|$|R
