25|$|In 2007 and 2008, Wallenda was a {{featured}} {{performer in}} the Ringling Brothers production Bellobration, performing with Bello Nock on a newly contrived, double {{version of the}} Wheel of Steel. At {{the beginning of the}} act, Wallenda and Nock stood balanced atop twin circles 39feet in the air. To the audience, the circles appeared to be connected until the act started with a burst of fireworks. The wheels then split, sending the performers in opposite directions without safety nets or harnesses. To stay on the device, the duo had to move in unison, running at up to 20 miles an hour. Vibrations were transferred from one wheel to the other, meaning each performer was affected by what the other <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>At</b> the top of each arc the performers were rendered weightless, while being subjected to several times the force of gravity at the bottom.|$|E

[...] Minogue commended the photo shoot at the time, saying [...] "So much of what I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>at</b> this time had a tiny budget so I {{brought a lot of}} pieces, including the pink glitter stick roll, from home [...] It was a great, simple shoot with a lot of heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Qutb, {{to ignore}} this fact {{and attempt to}} {{introduce}} elements of socialism or nationalism into Islam or the Muslim community (as Egypt's Arab Socialist Union government <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>at</b> the time), is against Islam. Qutb stresses {{that in the early}} days of Islam, Muhammad did not make appeals to ethnic or class loyalty. Though these crowd-pleasing appeals would have undoubtedly shortened the thirteen years of hardship Muhammad had to endure while calling unresponsive Arabs to Islam, [...] "God did not lead His Prophet on this course. ... This was not the way," [...] and so must not be the way now.|$|E

[...] "Squalls, and gusts, and reefin', and brailin' up, and haulin' down, won't {{wait for the}} seaman's leisure. His work must <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>at</b> once, or it will not <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>at</b> all. I'm not afeard of the doctor; so let him come {{as soon as he}} pleases.

2500|$|When {{asked whether}} Linett and Boyd {{had arrived at}} what he had envisioned during the 1960s, Brian responded: [...] "Somewhat, yeah. To some degree. It's not {{a far cry from}} what I thought it would be." [...] He added that he {{preferred}} his 2004 version, and that the sound of The Smile Sessions disappointed him because of its unfinished state. Linett argued that The Smile Sessions may be more accurate to Brian's vision than if he had completed the album in 1967, surmising that [...] "he would have been happier if he had had a bigger canvas to present this," [...] referencing the overwhelming amount of material that would have had to have been condensed into a two-sided vinyl LP, and Brian's ambition to [...] "expand the boundaries of what a pop record was beyond what anybody <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>at</b> the time." ...|$|E

Nazir-Ali said, [...] "the reason behind some of the difficulties I was facing was removed when General Zia was killed - unfortunately for him, and I am now not doing the work that I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>at</b> the time with the very poor". He became an assistant to the Archbishop at Lambeth and assisted with the planning of the 1988 Lambeth Conference; he was General Secretary of the Church Mission Society 1989-1994 and concurrently an Assistant Bishop in the Diocese of Southwark.
