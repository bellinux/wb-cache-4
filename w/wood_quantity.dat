40|$|The {{impact of}} forest fire on three Mediterranean forest types: Pinus pinea, Pinus halepensis/brutia and broadleaved was {{assessed}} through three indicators: regeneration capability, wood and Non Wood Forest Product (NWFP) losses. In every forest type, five plots of burnt forest through {{a sequence of}} 5 years interval, from 1 to 20 years repeated 4 times, were investigated to follow the plant canopy restoration capability. Another 10 healthy non burnt plots were randomly chosen in each forest type for <b>wood</b> <b>quantity</b> estimations. The burnt broadleaved trees regenerate immediately through dormant buds located on stems or on roots. The P. brutia has always shown abundant seed regeneration, while the P. pinea regeneration has taken place only in burnt stands whose cones were not collected previously. The forest understorey canopy regeneration has followed the same plant species that preexist before the fire. The plant composition is related mainly to the “series of vegetation ” associated to the soil mother rock, rather than any other abiotic factor. Their density is negatively correlated with the altitudinal zonality. In addition, the germination o...|$|E

This study assessed the amount of coarse woody debris in municipal forests in Warsaw (central Poland). Based on the forest site type, dominant tree species and age class, we stratified all complexes of the Warsaw urban forests in order to allocate 55 sample plots. For these plots, we determined the volume of dead wood including standing dead trees, coarse woody debris and broken branches as well as uprooted trees. We calculated the amount of dead wood in the distinguished site-species-age layers and for individual complexes. The volume of dead matter in municipal forests in Warsaw amounted to 38, 761 m 3, i. e. 13. 7 m 3 /ha. The obtained results correspond to the current regulations concerning the amount of dead organic matter to be left in forests. Only in the Las Bielański complex (northern Warsaw) volume of dead wood is comparable to the level observed in Polish national parks or nature reserves, which is still far lower than the values found for natural forests. In general, municipal forests in Warsaw stand out positively in terms of dead <b>wood</b> <b>quantity</b> and a high degree of variation in the forms and dimensions of dead wood...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the potential use of airborne {{light detection and ranging}} (LiDAR) data to predict key wood fiber properties from extrinsic indicators in lodgepole pine leading forest stands {{located in the}} foothills of central Alberta, Canada. Six wood fiber attributes (wood density, cell perimeter, cell coarseness, mature fiber length, microfibril angle, and modulus of elasticity) were measured at 21 plots, and with use of data reduction techniques, two components of wood properties were derived: wood strength, stiffness, and fiber yield and fiber strength and smoothness. These wood fiber components were then compared with extrinsic indicators of wood characteristic-derived LiDAR-estimated topographic morphology, tree height, and canopy light metrics. The first principal component indicating wood strength and stiffness was significantly correlated to the depth of different canopy zones (or light regimes; r 2 = 0. 55, P < 0. 05). The second component, related to fiber strength and smoothness, was significantly correlated to the height of the canopy and canopy thickness (r 2 = 0. 65, P < 0. 05). The results indicate that airborne LiDAR attributes can explain about half of the observed variance in intrinsic wood fiber attributes, which is approximately 5 ? 10 % less than that explained by growth-related field-measured variables such as diameter increment and height. This reduction in explained variance can be balanced by the opportunities for much broader spatial characterizations of <b>wood</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality at the stand and landscape levels...|$|E

This material is widely used for decking and automotive applications. With respect to wood it requires less maintenance, shows better durability in wet environment and {{can be obtained from}} recycled materials. With respects to plastics the main advantage is its lower cost. The aim of this thesis has been to investigate the mechanical and rheological properties of PP based Wood Polymer Composites. The mechanical characterization has shown that wood fibers make the composite stiffer without lowering strength values too much, while thermal properties have confirmed that the processing window for this material is rather narrow, being limited upwards by wood fiber degradation and downwards by the melting temperature, which is around 165 °C. Commercial PP-based WPCs filled with different filler concentration have been investigated with an off – line rheometer in oscillation mode at 170 °C. Complex viscosity increases with the percentage of fibers. All materials show a shear-thinning behaviour with similar slopes of the flow curves and neat PP also displays a Newtonian plateau at low shear rates. The test temperature is imposed by the requirement of performing the test within the linear viscoelasticity region, but the data that are measured are not directly useful for processing, as a convenient processing temperature should be around 195 °C. In order to obtain the WPC viscosity at such temperatures, a model that uses the WPC viscosity measured at 170 °C at various <b>wood</b> <b>quantities</b> and of neat PP viscosity measured at various temperatures is proposed. The main hypothesis of this model is that the effects of temperature and filler content on the composite viscosity are disjoint.

Abstract: Climate and stands management have an effect on the process of wood formation via resource availability. To improve knowledge of <b>wood</b> <b>quantity</b> and physical structure, increment cores of ponderosa pine were taken in high- and low-density stands growing in Patagonia, Argentina. Microdensity profiles were performed on trees for which sapflow density (Qs) data were available over two consecutive years (2004 and 2005, dry and wet years, respectively). Conventional and non-conventional microdensity variables were analyzed in the segment of the microdensity profile where Qs was measured. Trees in the low-density stand showed a greater capacity for water transport than trees in the high-density stand, even if no constraints in the soil water availability were confirmed, as was the case for the wet year. Minimum and earlywood density were significantly higher in the high-density stand in several analyzed years. These differences were not reflected in mean density of the whole radial profile. The structural changes in physical wood properties in relation to silvicultural treatments appear to affect plant water status, even in the wet growing season: greater wood density in the first part of the tree-ring may contribute to the observed Qs decrease found in the high-density stand. This fact may lead trees to lack the coordinated mechanisms of response to drought observed in more xeric sites. The increase of wood density in the first part of the tree-ring in ponderosa pine could be not conducive to acclimation, exposing trees to an increasing “dilemma” facing drought...|$|E
40|$|Instream wood is {{recognized}} as an important feature linked to channel processes that benefit salmonids. Stream channel assessments and restoration/enhancement efforts often associate salmon habitat quality with the quantity and volume of woody debris. Existing wood targets used to assist resource managers do not adequately account for variations in quantity or volume {{due to differences in}} geomorphology, ecoregions, or disturbance regimes. To address this issue, field data on instream wood quantities and volumes from 150 stream segments draining unmanaged basins within Washington State (without logging, roads, dams, or other human-induced condition that may influence natural wood loading and retention rates) are used to develop target suggestions for management. Based on the assumption that streams draining unmanaged forest basins incorporate the range of conditions to which salmonids and other species have adapted, wood loads in these systems provide a defensible reference for management. Surveyed sites represent a wide array of geomorphic channel types, channel origins, natural disturbances, and climate regions where the process of wood input and distribution has most likely evolved under a natural rate of disturbance, with the exception of potential fire suppression. Analyses of these data imply that the most consistent predictor of wood volumes and quantities is bankfull width (as a function of basin size) and ecoregion. <b>Wood</b> <b>quantity,</b> volume, and mean piece size increased with channel size due to the increased proclivity for fluvial transport and spatial accretion, along with greater lateral area for wood to accumulate. Forest stand characteristics such as stem density and diameter are influenced by distinctive climates particular to each ecoregion, which in turn influence the size and quantity of instream wood. Percentile distributions describe the range of wood quantities and volumes in streams draining unmanaged basins by discrete bankfull width classes for three distinguishable ecoregion groups. The data also support expanded definitions for minimum volumes of "Key Pieces. " Due to both favorable and adverse conditions comprising wood loading ranges; we suggest that the 75 th percentiles in each bankfull width class and ecoregion should be used to represent the lower limit for optimum wood quantities and volumes as an index of habitat quality.

This study utilizes three key concepts: sustainable competitive advantage in cost of production, reduce emission of greenhouse gas and an Integrated National Plan to acquire bare land and grow a suitable fuel wood crop to fulfill the future demand. This study was carried out through a situational analysis and an in-depth questionnaire surveys in both raw and value added sectors in Sri Lankan rubber industry. The questionnaire survey was carried-out covering main plantation companies and key value added manufacturers. This study shows that biomass application is already happening in raw rubber sector without using any fossil fuels. Problem exists in value added industry since a massive amount of thermal energy is required for their processes. This research has estimated the equivalent fuel <b>wood</b> <b>quantity</b> required by their machines to be switched in to fuel wood and a national level program is proposed to assure a strong and sustainable supply chain of fuel wood. This study only covers rubber industry in western province, concentrating on high-end consumers of thermal energy and hence SME sector was not covered.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2003 Field {{data were}} {{collected}} from 150 stream sites with a diverse array of channel types and disturbance patterns within basins relatively unaffected by anthropogenic disturbance to assess the characteristics of natural large woody debris (LWD) organization, size, and riparian areas across forested regions of Washington State. Bankfull channel width was found to be the dominant factor influencing the grouping of LWD pieces. LWD group size as well as stability increased with channel size. Jams (groups ≥ 10 pieces) contained proportionately similar diameter distributions regardless of size. As bankfull channel width increased the percent of LWD volume decreased in the low-flow channel but increased in the high-flow channel. Both the median LWD lengths and diameters increased with bankfull width and proximity to the low-flow channel, as well as with increasing LWD group size. As channel width increased, the proportion of pieces oriented parallel to the high-flow channel increased while the frequency of perpendicular pieces decreased, especially if rootwads were attached. Forest zones, as defined by climatic influence and fire history, are the best regional predictors of riparian stand attributes such as tree height, basal area, stem diameter and density. Observed riparian stand composition ranged from 8 to 17 tree species within each of six forest zones. Species richness was greater in milder climates and lower in more extreme climates. The greatest observed tree species diversity was within 35 m of the stream channel; however, stream influences on riparian characteristics were observed out to 65 m, the extent of the sample transect. Large streams with active flood plains had a significantly greater deciduous riparian component than channels less prone to fluvial disturbances. LWD volumes did not peak or plateau until adjacent riparian stands reached 550 years in age; however, LWD quantities were also high during the first 150 years of stand origin. The percent of instream <b>wood</b> <b>quantities</b> that could be attributed to an adjacent riparian source decreased with increasing channel size. Where restoration of instream wood and/or riparian areas are warranted, these characteristics offer guidance to the range of conditions found in natural systems to which aquatic and riparian species have adapted...|$|R

They are changes {{in the structure of}} non-industrial private forest (NIPF) ownership, forest taxation, in forest legislation, in price recommendation agreement, diminishing resources of forestry extension services, etc. At the same time, the roundwood demand has been rising. All these developments cause uncertainty in wood procurement organisations, and call for research {{to find out how to}} adapt into the changing environment. The objective of this study is to produce information for roundwood purchasing planning and cus-tomer satisfaction management to be used by Stora Enso Metsä Customer Service, Helsinki. For this pur-pose, data needs to be gathered about the urban NIPFs and their forest estates, behaviour related to forestry and timber-selling, customer satisfaction in their latest timber selling transaction, and their opinions about Enso’s new customer service office and its service concept. To fulfil the objective of the study, a NIPF -owner -survey (N= 1064, response rate 39, 7 %) was con-ducted in October 1998 -January 1999. The sample was made on the basis of the marketing database of Stora Enso Oyj Forest Customer Service in Helsinki. In planning the frame of reference of the empirical study, the model of service quality by Grönroos was applied. The following aspects were included in the 7 -page questionnaire: demographic, sosio-economic and forest estate background, relation to the forest service supply, behaviour related to forestry, timber-selling motives and behaviour, last contact organisation and its image in forestry business, expectations and percep-tions in the latest timber-selling transactions, and behavioural intentions. The results revealed that the share of women, pensioners and academically educated people among forest owners was quite high. The majority of the forest estates of the metropolitan forest owners were situ-ated in the provinces of South Finland and East Finland. The average forest estate area was considerably smaller than in a previous study. Economic and recreational objectives were most important in the use of forests. Forest Associations were involved in half of the roundwood sales transactions of the respondents in the metropolitan area. The <b>wood</b> <b>quantity</b> of transactions was considerably higher than the average in the whole country. Bank-organised forest-related activities, taxation infos and trips to the forest were the most popular activities. Among the services, silvicultural advices were needed mostly and stub treatment least. Brochure material related to stumpage timber sales and taxation were considered most important compared to material related to delivery sales. The service expectations were at highest for women and they were less satisfied with the service than men. 2 nd and 3 rd generation residents of the metropolitan area thought about the new customer service concept more positively than the 1 st generation residents. Internet users under 60 years thought more positively about new satellite picture-based woodlot search concept. Cross-tabulation of factor scores against background variables indicated that women with relatively low education level a greater need to sell roundwood than entrepreneurs, white-collar workers and directors, and Internet users. Suspiciousness towards timber procurement organisations was relatively strong among women and those whose forest income share of the total income was either null or over 20 %.

50|$|About thirty-five {{natural forest}} fires are ignited {{each year by}} lightning, while another six to ten are started by people— in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive {{exhibits}} and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September— the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity {{in the late afternoon}} and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acre, {{and the vast majority of}} fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down <b>wood</b> <b>quantities,</b> soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.In an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential for fire. Controlled burns are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{important}} Canadian Wood Fibre Centre’s mandates is to develop methods to facilitate {{the flow of information}} on the <b>wood</b> quality and <b>quantity</b> along the chain of forest values. Among its research projects, one entitled Enhanced Forest Inventory aims to produce tools to map the wood attributes in terms of physico-mechanical properties by using prediction models based on the attributes of the forest tree and stand. The main inputs of these models come from non-destructive measurements on standing trees (acoustic probe, resistograph, terrestrial lidar) and from spatial data (aerial lidar). Among the obtained results, the correlations are significant between acoustic velocity, drill resistance, tree and stand attributes. These results open the prospect of using the data of non destructive measurements such as acoustic probe and resistograph as complementary input with tree and stand attributes (dbh, crown, and competition index) for prescribing the intensity of thinning to a desired level of wood density.
