5|$|The entire {{second floor}} houses the library. It {{contains}} the scriptures of Gyetengpa, Doduipa, Mamtha, Kangyur, Tengyur and Zungdui, {{which have been}} affected due to insect attacks. The collection in the library consists of two printed books of Tengyur (in 25 volumes), which are commentaries on Buddhist teachings; three sets of Kangyur, the translated version of the canons of Buddhist teachings; and Chanjia Sangbhums in five volumes. Of the three sets of Kangyur, two are handwritten and one is printed. The printed sets are in 101 volumes. One handwritten set has 131 volumes and the other 125 volumes; the letters of these 125 books are washed in gold. The religious text, Gyentongpa, has letters washed in gold in all its pages. At some stage, some of the sacred scriptures were lost and the reason was attributed to the monks of the Tsona monastery who used to visit Tawang during <b>winter</b> <b>time.</b> In the past, these monks had demanded that the gilded image of the Buddha be gifted to them. This was not accepted by the Lamas of the Tawang Monastery and as result the Tsona Lamas refused to part {{with some of the}} sacred texts and records of the Tawang Monastery which were with them. They again took away more books in 1951.|$|E

Another essential problem for SKM management are people defacing Electrical Multiple Units (EMUs) with graffiti.

25|$|Natchez oral {{literature}} {{has been documented}} by John R. Swanton, and Mary Haas both of whom worked with Watt Sam in 1907 and the mid 1930s respectively.

Protagonists in such stories would encounter cannibals, trick cannibals, marry the daughters of cannibals, kill cannibals, and be eaten by cannibals. In these stories Natchez storytellers would employ a special speech register when impersonating the cannibal characters. This register was distinct from ordinary Natchez by substituting several morphemes and words for others.|$|E
25|$|Located {{near the}} 47th {{parallel}} north, the Cote de Nuits {{is one of}} the northernmost regions to produce premium quality red wines. However, this northerly location brings with it a lot of vintage variation from year to year. From <b>winter</b> <b>time</b> hail, spring time frost and cool autumns that may bring devastating rains that impede ripening and harvest, the quality of each vintage can be highly variable. The vineyards of the Cote de Nuits are planted on east and southeast facing slopes that receive the most opportune sun exposures with vineyards designated as premier and grand cru almost always planted on this ideal aspect at elevations between 800–1000ft (250–300 m).|$|E

25|$|The southwestern United States {{features}} a semi-arid to arid climate, {{depending on the}} location. Much of the Southwest is an arid desert climate, but higher elevations in the mountains in each state, {{with the exception of}} West Texas, feature alpine climates with very large amounts of snow. The metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and El Paso hardly ever receive any snow at all, as they are strictly desert lands with mountains. Albuquerque receives less snow than other cities, but still receives significant snowfalls in the <b>winter</b> <b>time.</b> Although it snows in this region, the snow {{in this part of the}} United States melts rapidly, often before nightfall. This is due mainly to the higher altitude and abundant sunshine in these states.|$|E
25|$|According to Arthur Ahkinga, {{who lived}} on Little Diomede island {{at the turn of}} the 1940s, the Iñupiat on the island made their living by hunting and carving ivory which they traded or sold. Fish they caught were bullheads, tomcods, bluecods and a few others, {{although}} the fishing was not so common. During the <b>winter</b> <b>time</b> they used fur parkas and skin mukluks made out of hunted animals to protect themselves from cold and wind. Recreations were skating, snowshoeing, handball, football and Inuit dancing. After dark, people spent the rest of the evening telling jokes and old-time stories. In summer time they travelled with skin boats equipped with outboard motors to either Siberia or Wales, Alaska. Winter travel was limited to neighboring Big Diomede due to weather conditions. Between July and October half the population went to Nome for selling their carving and skin sewing and trading for supplies.|$|E
