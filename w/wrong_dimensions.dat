We have been having, as I believe you have, a blessedly mild winter, and the climax at this moment is a kind of all uncannily premature May-day of softness and beauty. I sit here with my big south window open to the River, open wide, and a sort of healing balm of sunshine flooding the place. Truly I feel I did well for myself in perching--even thus modestly for a [...] "real home"--just on this spot. My beginnings of going out again have consisted, up to to-day, in four successive excursions in a Bath-chair--every command of which resource is installed but little more than round the corner from me; and the Bath-chair habit or vice is, I fear, only too capable now of marking me for its own. This of course not [...] "really"--my excellent legs are, thank heaven, still too cherished a dependence and resource and remedy to me in the long run, or rather in the long (or even the short) crawl; only, if you've never tried it, the B.C. has a sweet appeal of its own, for contemplative ventilation; and I builded better than I knew when I happened to settle here, just where, in all London, the long, long, smooth and really charming and beguiling Thames-side Embankment offers it a quite ideal course for combined publicity (in the sense of variety) and tranquillity (in the sense of jostling against nobody and nothing and not having to pick one's steps.) Add to this that just at hand, straight across the River, by the ample and also very quiet Albert Bridge, lies the large convenient and in its way also very beguiling Battersea Park: which you may but too unspeakably remember our making something of the circuit of with William on that day of the so troubled fortnight in London, after our return from Nauheim, when Theodate Pope called for us in her great car and we came first to just round the corner here, where he and I sat waiting together outside while you and she went into Carlyle's house. Every moment of that day has again and again pressed back upon me here--and how, rather suddenly, we had, in the park, where we went afterwards, to pull up, that is to turn and get back to the sinister little Symonds's as soon as possible. However. I don't know why I should stir that dismal memory. The way the [...] "general location" [...] seems propitious to me ought to succeed in soothing the nerves of association. This last I keep saying--I mean in the sense that, especially on such a morning as this, I quite adore this form of residence (this particular perch I mean) in order to make fully sure of what I have of soothing and reassuring to tell you.... Lamb House hangs before me from this simplified standpoint here as a rather complicated haze; but I tend, I truly feel, to overdo that view of it--and shan't settle to any view at all for another year. It is the mere worriment of dragged-out unwellness that makes me see things in <b>wrong</b> <b>dimensions.</b> They right themselves perfectly at better periods. But I mustn't yet discourse too long: I am still under restriction as to uttering too much vocal sound; and I feel how guarding and nursing the vocal resource is beneficial and helpful. I don't speak to you of Harry--there would be too much to say and he must shine upon you even from N.Y. with so big a light of his own. I take him, and I take you all, to have been much moved by Woodrow Wilson's fine, and clearly so sincere, even if so partial and provisional address yesterday. It isn't he, but it is the so long and so deeply provincialised and diseducated and, I fear--in respect to individual activity and operative, that is administrative value--very below-the-mark [...] "personalities" [...] of the Democratic party, that one is pretty dismally anxious about. An administration that has to [...] "take on" [...] Bryan looks, from the overhere point of view, like the queerest and crudest of all things! But of course I may not know what I'm talking about save when I thus embrace you all, almost principally Peg--and your Mother!--again and am your ever affectionate ...|$|E

Since then, the Kurdish population of Turkey has long sought to have Kurdish included as a language of instruction in public schools {{as well as a}} subject. Several attempts at opening Kurdish instruction centers were stopped on technical grounds, such as <b>wrong</b> <b>dimensions</b> of doors. Turkish sources claimed that running Kurdish-language schools was wound up in 2004 because of an apparent lack of interest. Even though Kurdish language schools have started to operate, many of them have been forced to shut down due to over-regulation by the state. Kurdish language institutes have been monitored under strict surveillance and bureaucratic pressure. Using Kurdish language as main education language is illegal in Turkey. It is accepted only as subject courses.|$|E

It is quite possible to concede every point made by the critics and still write, as I do here, in praise of rankings...|$|E
40|$|We study Quot schemes of vector bundles on {{algebraic}} curves. Marian and Oprea gave {{a description}} of a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) studied by Witten in terms of intersection numbers on Quot schemes of trivial bundles. Since these Quot schemes can have the <b>wrong</b> <b>dimension,</b> virtual classes are required. But Quot schemes of general vector bundles always have the right dimension. Using the degree of the general vector bundle as an additional parameter, we construct a weighted TQFT containing both Witten's TQFT and the small quantum cohomology TQFT of the Grassmannian. This weighted TQFT is completely geometric (no virtual classes are needed), can be explicitly computed, and recovers known formulas enumerating the points of finite Quot schemes.

40|$|Uncertainty {{is often}} ignored in urban {{hydrology}} modelling. Engineering practice typically ignores uncertainties and uncertainty propagation. This can have large impacts, {{such as the}} <b>wrong</b> <b>dimensioning</b> of urban drainage systems and the inaccurate estimation of pollution in the environment caused by combined sewer overflows. This paper presents an uncertainty propagation analysis in urban hydrology modelling. The case study was the Haute-Sûre catchment in Luxembourg for one yearly time series measured in 2010, and 10 individual rainfall events measured in 2011. The selection of model input variables for uncertainty quantification was based on their level of uncertainty and model sensitivity. Probability distribution functions were defined to represent {{the uncertainty of the}} input variables. We applied a Monte Carlo technique using a simplified model, EmiStatR, which simulates the volume and substance flows in urban drainage systems. We focus in loads and concentrations of chemical oxygen demand and ammonium, which are important variables for wastewater and surface water quality management. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The quantum cohomology ring of a Kahler {{manifold}} X is a {{deformation of}} the usual cohomology ring which appears naturally in theoretical physics {{in the study of}} the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models with target X. In [W], Witten introduces the quantum multiplication of cohomology classes on X as a certain deformation {{of the usual}} cup-product, obtained by adding to it the so-called instanton corrections (see also [V]). These can be in turn interpreted as intersection numbers on a sequence of moduli spaces of (holomorphic) maps P ! X. To make this interpretation rigorous according to mathematical standards, one encounters severe problems, mainly because these moduli spaces are not compact and they may have the <b>wrong</b> <b>dimension.</b> Recently, substantial efforts have been made to put the theory on firm mathematical footing, and a proof for the existence of the quantum cohomology ring, using methods of symplectic topology, has been given by Ruan and Tian [RT], for a large cl...|$|R
40|$|Many {{algorithms}} in {{machine learning}} and computational geometry require, as input, the intrinsic {{dimension of the}} manifold that supports the probability distribution of the data. This parameter is rarely known and therefore has to be estimated. We characterize the statistical difficulty of this problem by deriving {{upper and lower bounds}} on the minimax rate for estimating the dimension. First, we consider the problem of testing the hypothesis that the support of the data-generating probability distribution is a well-behaved manifold of intrinsic dimension d_ 1 versus the alternative that it is of dimension d_ 2, with d_ 1 <d_ 2. With an i. i. d. sample of size n, we provide an upper bound on the probability of choosing the <b>wrong</b> <b>dimension</b> of O(n^-(d_ 2 /d_ 1 - 1 -ϵ) n), where ϵ is an arbitrarily small positive number. The proof is based on bounding the length of the traveling salesman path through the data points. We also demonstrate a lower bound of Ω(n^-(2 d_ 2 - 2 d_ 1 +ϵ) n), by applying Le Cam's lemma with a specific set of d_ 1 -dimensional probability distributions. We then extend these results to get minimax rates for estimating the dimension of well-behaved manifolds. We obtain an upper bound of order O (n^-(1 /m- 1 -ϵ) n) and a lower bound of order Ω(n^-(2 +ϵ) n), where m is the embedding dimension. Comment: 48 page...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{evidence-based}} psychotherapy can {{be understood}} by consideration of six key concepts from evolution science that {{have an impact on}} behavioral science: variation, selection, retention, dimensions, levels, and context. Human behavior problems are most likely to emerge when repertoires are narrow or rigid, are under inappropriate selection criteria targeted at the <b>wrong</b> level or <b>dimension,</b> and without retention of successful variants that are fitted to context. Modern effective psychotherapies represent the inverse process of creating broad and flexible repertoires, selected by personal values, and fitted to particular contexts at the appropriate level and in the right dimension.

40|$|International audiencePerturbation {{theory for}} the random-field Ising model (RFIM) has the infamous {{attribute}} that it predicts at all orders a dimensional-reduction property for the critical behavior {{that turns out}} to be <b>wrong</b> in low <b>dimensions.</b> Guided by our previous work based on the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (NP-FRG), we show that one can still make some use of the perturbation theory for a finite range of dimensions below the upper critical dimension, d[*][*]=[*][*] 6. The new twist is to account for the influence of large-scale zero-temperature events known as avalanches. These avalanches induce nonanalyticities in the field dependence of the correlation functions and renormalized vertices, and we compute in a loop expansion the eigenvalue associated with the corresponding anomalous operator. The outcome confirms the NP-FRG prediction that the dimensional-reduction fixed point correctly describes the dominant critical scaling of the RFIM above some dimension close to 5 but not below...|$|R
40|$|We {{show how}} the Atiyah-Singer family index theorem for both, usual and self-adjoint {{elliptic}} operators fits naturally into {{the framework of the}} Madsen-Tillmann spectra. Our main theorem concerns bundles of odd-dimensional manifolds. Using completely functional-analytic methods, we show that for any smooth proper oriented fibre bundle E → X with odd-dimensional fibres, the family index ind(B) ∈ K 1 (X) of the odd signature operator is trivial. The Atiyah-Singer theorem allows us to draw a topological conclusion: the generalized Madsen-Tillmann map α: B Diff + (M 2 m− 1) → Ω ∞ MTSO(2 m − 1) kills the Hirzebruch L-class in rational cohomology. If m = 2, this means that α induces the zero map in rational cohomology. In particular, the three-dimensional analogue of the Madsen-Weiss theorem is <b>wrong.</b> In higher <b>dimensions,</b> we show that the Hirzebruch L-class is the only class for which such a vanishing theorem holds. For 3 -manifolds M, we also prove the triviality of α: B Diff + (M) → MTSO(3) in mod p cohomology in many cases...|$|R
