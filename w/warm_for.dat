Fisichella set the fifth quickest time, ahead of Villeneuve, who spun into the gravel late in the session. Barrichello, Irvine, Johnny Herbert and de la Rosa completed the top ten. In the final practice session, Häkkinen set the quickest time, a 1:37.037, one-tenth of a second faster than Michael Schumacher. Button was happy {{with the performance of}} his car and was third fastest. Barrichello maintained his consistent performance and set the fourth fastest time despite again spinning into the gravel traps. He was ahead of Ralf Schumacher who had his fastest time revoked after exceeding track limits. Coulthard was sixth, two-tenths of a second faster than Fisichella.

5|$|The winter {{affected}} {{many other}} European countries. Similar cold periods and snowfalls {{were seen in}} much of Central Europe and the southern Baltic region. De Bilt, near Amsterdam in the Netherlands, experienced its worst winter since 1790. Because of the anticyclone {{to the north of}} the United Kingdom several incoming Atlantic depressions which would normally have hit Britain were forced south to the Mediterranean region, resulting in Portugal, Spain and Southern France having more rain than usual while remaining relatively <b>warm.</b> <b>For</b> example, the February rainfall at Gibraltar was , three times the average. As a result, France experienced both the extreme cold in the north, and much rain in the south. The winter caused 150 deaths from the cold and lack of food in Berlin, which was still recovering from its devastation during the final stages of the Second World War. It forced schools in the Netherlands to shut, led to a mob attack on a goods train carrying coal in Copenhagen, and caused the closure of businesses and the restriction of domestic gas supplies in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} 75 minutes. The cars were {{split into two}} groups with the leading championship point-standing leaders and the fastest two drivers from the previous road course race composing the second group. Both groups were allowed 30 minutes on the circuit with a 15-minute break in {{between the two groups}} recording their lap times. Weather conditions were <b>warm</b> <b>for</b> the 75-minute session. De Ferran clinched his first pole position of the season, his second at Toronto, and the twelfth of his career with a time of 57.703 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by teammate Castroneves and had the pole position until de Ferran's lap. Bräck qualified third, Kanaan fourth and Tagliani fifth (all three drivers went off into the track's run-off areas but continued without damaging their cars.) Franchitti, Fernández, Tracy, Roberto Moreno and Scott Dixon rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Servià was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his best lap time was 0.534 seconds off de Ferran's pace. He was followed by Carpentier in twelfth. Andretti, 13th, slid and hit the turn one tire barrier lightly with the left front section of his nose cone; he later contacted the turn five wall with his right-rear tire on his final timed lap. Fittipaldi took 14th position, ahead of Herta who spun at turn nine without damaging his car. Vasser, da Matta, Michel Jourdain Jr., Gugelmin, Junqueira filled the next five places on the grid. Papis took 21st and was joined by Tora Takagi on the grid's eleventh row. 23rd-place qualifier Gidley made contact with Carpentier who was braking heavily for the turn eight right-hander and Gidley damaged his front suspension heavily with his front wheels out of line. Both drivers were unhurt. Zanardi took 24th position. Wilson and Nakano qualified {{at the back of the}} grid in 25th and 26th places; Wilson closely followed Nakano on his first timed lap made heavy contact with the rear-left of Nakano's car and went airborne briefly. Both drivers were uninjured but switched to their back-up cars as their primary chassis were heavily damaged.|$|E

Coral reefs support {{some of the most}} diverse marine habitats in the world, but they are fragile ecosystems. When tropical waters become unusually <b>warm</b> <b>for</b> extended periods of time, microscopic plants called zooxanthellae, which are symbiotic partners living within the coral polyp tissues, die off.

Over 42% of corals are completely bleached and 95% are experiencing some type of whitening. Historically the Caribbean is thought to contain 14% of the world's coral reefs.|$|E

500|$|The inner Solar System, {{the region}} of the Solar System inside 4AU, was too <b>warm</b> <b>for</b> {{volatile}} molecules like water and methane to condense, so the planetesimals that formed there could only form from compounds with high melting points, such as metals (like iron, nickel, and aluminium) and rocky silicates. These rocky bodies would become the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars). These compounds are quite rare in the Universe, comprising only 0.6% of the mass of the nebula, so the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The terrestrial embryos grew to about 0.05 Earth masses (...) and ceased accumulating matter about 100,000years after the formation of the Sun; subsequent collisions and mergers between these planet-sized bodies allowed terrestrial planets to grow to their present sizes (see Terrestrial planets below).|$|E

40|$|Author abstract]In {{order to}} achieve {{the purpose of this}} title, the vitamin B_ 1 and vitamin B_ 2 {{contents}} in cooked rices were determined by using the photofluorometry and the mutagenicity of these were assayed in Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 strains using the method of Ames et al. In the next report the mutagenicity of the cooked white rice <b>warmed</b> <b>for</b> 24 or 36 hrs are weak, using TA 98. However in this investigation the revertant colonies per 1. 2 g of the cooked rice, <b>warmed</b> <b>for</b> 36 or 48 hrs was less than 71 in TA 100 and the dose-response curves of the mutagenicity were not obtained. Even these scorched rices had little mutagenic action in TA 100. Vitamin B_ 1 retentions of the cooked white rices, <b>warmed</b> <b>for</b> 12 hrs were 76 ～ 83 % in a 1. 5 l cooker, 70 % in a 2 l cooker, and these retentions, <b>warmed</b> <b>for</b> 36 hrs were 42 ～ 72 % in the 1. 5 l cooker, 49 % in the 2 l cooker. On the B_ 1 contents of the warming cooked rices, these rices sampled from near the wall of the cooker were less than ones sampled {{from the center of the}} cooker. The B_ 1 retentions of brown rice, half-milled rice and undermilled rice, cooked and <b>warmed</b> <b>for</b> 12 hrs were 94 %, 73 ～ 86 % and 77 % respectively. However, these B_ 1 contents were much higher than the cooked white rices, <b>warmed</b> <b>for</b> the same hrs. The B_ 1 retentions of the enriched rices using polyrice were 66 ～ 92 % when these cooked rices <b>warmed</b> <b>for</b> 12 hrs, but the B_ 1 contents were 121 ～ 186 μg%. Throughout all the experiments the B_ 2 contents in these rices during warming reduced little. From the facts described above, the results were as follows: the limiting time of warming of cooked rice was 12 hrs because of the loss of palatability and the retention of B_ 1. These B_ 1 contents were varied with the cooking and warming conditions and also different from the descriptions of these cookers. The B_ 2 contents did not reduce during warming in order to its thermostability. Judging from the bioassay for B_ 1,using common finches, the negative correlation between birds' ages and warming time of the cooked white rices was statistically significant at the level of 1 % (N= 45 r= 0. 463). No bird did die by the addition of B_ 1 ・HCl solution to even the cooked rice, <b>warmed</b> <b>for</b> 36 hrs. No other harmful substance which kill even one bird was produced during warming, except the loss of B_ 1.
