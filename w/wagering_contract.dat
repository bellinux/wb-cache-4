(AGL), on December 31, 2008 sued an insurance trust owned {{by one of}} Carlson's companies to contest a $15 million claim in federal district court (Southern District of Indiana). The AIG lawsuit alleged that Carlson secured a life insurance policy without possessing the required insurable interest so that he, his company and trusts could later profit from selling the policy on the secondary market. This is called stranger-originated life insurance (SOLI). AIG alleged that the policy {{was nothing more than}} a <b>wagering</b> <b>contract</b> which is void ab initio. Count one requested a declaratory judgment for rescission and/or voiding of the policy based on lack of insurable interest.|$|E

The Court noted that in Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd 1991 2 AC 548 that payments pursuant to a gaming contract {{were considered to be}} gifts and were not recoverable. However, having touched upon the relevant legal analysis, Hobhouse J abruptly stopping, and stated that having held that the swaps were not gaming or wagering contracts, {{he was not going to}} answer the third question on a hypothetical basis.|$|E
5000|$|H. H. Asquith QC (the future Prime Minister) and Herman William Loehnis {{represented}} the Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. They made three submissions. First, {{there was no}} contract, because Carbolic had not intended to create an obligation enforceable by law upon themselves, shown by the wide terms in which the advertisement was expressed. The advertisement said the [...] "reward" [...] was for anyone getting influenza [...] "after having used the ball", which could mean any time in someone's life. It would be absurd to impose an obligation on the company for some who got the flu years after using the ball. Moreover, contracting the flu was not something in the plaintiff's control, and so this case should be distinguished from reward cases like Williams v Carwardine where someone positively does something to deserve a reward. Second, even if a contract existed, it should be void because of the Lottery Act, which said [...] "wagering contracts" [...] (gambling contracts) were unlawful and void. This was a wager, gambling, like a lottery, as {{in a number of}} cases, such as Brogden v Marriott Rourke v Short and Taylor v Smetten. Third, even if it were contract and not a <b>wagering</b> <b>contract,</b> it still would be void because it would be an insurance contract that failed to follow the prescribed form of stating people's names.|$|E

40|$|The law of gaming and <b>wagering</b> <b>contracts</b> in New Zealand has a {{long and}} complex history which pre-dates the birth of this nation by almost two centuries. The Gaming Act 1908 (N. Z.) is a {{consolidating}} statute, but ss. 69, 70 and 71, the enactments having specific application in this area, fall far short of providing a complete code of the law. English statutes enacted in the reigns of Charles II (1664), Anne (1710) and William IV (1835) have always been, {{and continue to be}} in force in this country, and indeed, their survival here has been more complete than in England where many of their provisions have been excised by the process of legislative repeal. The New Zealand law of gaming and <b>wagering</b> <b>contracts</b> is very much a product of the English experience for the English enactments in force here are in turn supplemented by New Zealand provisions which have been largely copied from English Gaming Acts of 1845 and 1892. But the New Zealand Legislature has not been completely lacking in imagination. Section 71 of the Gaming Act 1908 (N. Z.) has no counterpart in the English statutes, and sections 69 and 70 of the New Zealand Act both contain subtle, but significant differences, to their English equivalents. However, although New Zealand law in this area is modelled on that of England, there the similarity ends. English law in existence and applicable to the circumstances of the Colony of New Zealand on the 14 th of January 1840 was declared to be in force in New Zealand by the English Laws Act, 1858 (N. Z.). That Act did not, however, apply subsequent English enactments, and substantial reforms to the law of gaming and <b>wagering</b> <b>contracts</b> effected by the gaming Act, 1845 (U. K.) were not adopted in New Zealand until the colonial Gaming and Lotteries Act was enacted in 1881. The English Act of 1845 replaced the gaming contract provisions of the Act of Anne (1710) and repealed all but those securities provisions of that Act that had been modified by the Gaming Act, 1835 (U. K.) Thus, within a period of five years from the inception of the colony, New Zealand was applying English gaming laws that were more than two centuries old whilst the English Courts were {{faced with the prospect of}} construing a brand new Act. Thirty six years later the colonial legislature adopted verbatim the contract provisions in the Imperial Act of 1845. But by an apparent over-sight the colonial draftsman failed to effect the substantial repeals of the Acts of 1664 and 1710 the English Act had done. But that was only the first of the colonial errors. A further English Act in 1892 was copied and enacted by the colonial legislature in 1894 but with an appendage that demonstrated that the New Zealand legislature had not fully understood the full import of the English measure. This created difficulties of interpretation which were only compounded by a further error of the draftsman of the 1881 Act when he mistakenly copied s. 6 of the Betting Houses Act 1853 (U. K.) into s. 34 of the former Act without realising the significance of doing so. The 1894 Act also introduced what is now s. 71 of the 1908 Act, a provision the reason for the enactment of which has remained unexplained to the present day. When a consolidation of the Colonial Acts was effected by the Gaming Act 1908 the law of gaming and <b>wagering</b> <b>contracts</b> was already in a state of considerable confusion. That confusion was, of course, carried into that Act, but it did not end there and indeed can be said to have gained a new dimension when, as recently as 1970, the New Zealand legislature enacted the Illegal Contracts Act. The New Zealand law of gaming and <b>wagering</b> <b>contracts</b> is largely a product of misunderstandings and errors that occurred when legislative attempts were made to re-enact and effect modifications of the English statutes in this country. In this work the writer seeks to identify the points of departure and to find a rational basis for the law of gaming and <b>wagering</b> <b>contracts</b> and this investigation proceeds in the context of a recognised need for proposals for reform. To this end, in chapters 1 and 2 the social climate in which the Acts of 1664, 1710, 1835 and 1845 are enacted, and their purpose and scope, is identified. In chapter 3 the case for the proposition that the Acts of 1664, 1710 and 1835 are in force in New Zealand is made out and this is followed in chapter 4 by an attempt to explain the motivation behind the enactment of the colonial Acts of 1881 and 1894. Included in this chapter is an outline of the difficulties inherent in both the language of these Acts, and the construction applied to them by the Courts, Chapter 5 is devoted to ascertaining the actual scope of the law of gaming and <b>wagering</b> <b>contracts</b> in New Zealand today and in the penultimate chapter the Impact upon, and the implications for that law, of the Illegal Contracts Act 1970 is discussed. Each section is, where appropriate, accompanied by specific proposals for reform, and those proposals are brought together in summary form in chapter 7...|$|R

Over time, he made comments which threw doubt on his true sex. Being well known in London, comments about his sex became the subject of talk and comment in the press.

5000|$|William Graham and John Patrick Murphy QC for Mrs Carlill {{responded to}} the {{submissions}} by first arguing {{that there was a}} contract. The contract was a warranty to prevent disease that sounded in liquidated (money) damages. The advertisement was an offer. It was accepted when the conditions of the offer were performed. This could be seen in Denton v Great Northern Ry.

40|$|When {{credit markets}} froze {{up in the}} fall of 2008, many economists {{pronounced}} the crisis both inexplicable and unforeseeable. That’s because they were economists, not lawyers. Lawyers who specialize in financial regulation, and especially the small cadre who specialize in derivatives regulation, understood what went wrong. (Some even predicted it.) That’s because the roots of the catastrophe lay not in changes in the markets, but changes in the law. Perhaps the most important of those changes was the U. S. Congress’s decision to deregulate financial derivatives with the Commodity Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) of 2000. Prior to 2000, off-exchange derivatives contracts were subject to a common-law rule called the “rule against difference contracts” that treated derivative contracts that could not be proven to hedge against a real position in the underlying asset as legally unenforceable <b>wagering</b> <b>contracts.</b> Speculative <b>wagers</b> on prices could only be safely made on regulated exchanges. Congress overturned this centuries-old rule in 2000, making it legal for hedge funds, banks and insurance companies to use derivatives for speculative gambling, not just for true hedging. This led to the collapse of AIG and the 2008 credit crisis...|$|R
5000|$|The {{use of an}} {{advisory}} jury {{is derived from the}} practice of the Court of Chancery of referring issues of fact to one of the Common Law Courts of Westminster be tried by a jury as a feigned issue. The feigned issue was to inform the conscience of the court, and could be disregarded by the Chancellor. The feigned issue was a legal fiction by stating that a <b>wager</b> <b>contract</b> was laid between two parties interested in respectively maintaining the affirmative and the negative of certain propositions. The Gaming Act 1845 section 19 abolished the feigned issue and provided that the issue should the directly state the question of fact in dispute instead of a wager. The same abolition occurred in New York by section 72 of the Field Code in 1850.In Watt v Starke [...] (1879) the United States Supreme Court stated [...] "the verdict of a jury upon an issue out of chancery is only advisory." [...] Federal Equity Rule 23, effective 1913, provides in an equity case when a question arises that is triable by jury, a jury trial is held on the equity side without transfer to the law side of the United States District Court.

2500|$|Because {{contracts}} {{of insurance}} {{have many features}} in common with <b>wagers,</b> insurance <b>contracts</b> are often distinguished under law as agreements in which either party {{has an interest in}} the [...] "bet-upon" [...] outcome beyond the specific financial terms. e.g.: a [...] "bet" [...] with an insurer on whether one's house will burn down is not gambling, but rather insurance — as the homeowner has an obvious interest in the continued existence of his/her home independent of the purely financial aspects of the [...] "bet" [...] (i.e., the insurance policy). Nonetheless, both insurance and gambling contracts are typically considered aleatory contracts under most legal systems, though they are subject to different types of regulation.|$|R

He also noted that decision of Leggatt LJ in City Index Ltd v Leslie 1992 QB 98 where the Court of Appeal had previously held that [...] "before the 1986 Act came into force, contracts for differences were void, but other contracts which were superficially similar were not.

5000|$|For the Carbolic Smoke Ball Co., two new barristers (Asquith QC {{had just}} become Home Secretary), Finlay QC and T. Terrell made similar {{submissions}} to the counsel in the Queen's Bench, but also relied on new authorities {{to argue the}} company out of any contract. They again argued that the contract was not like other reward cases, because catching the flu was not something you had control over, and that {{the words in the}} advertisement expressed a vague intention but in no way amounted to a promise. They said the terms were far too vague to make any contract. New arguments were that there was no [...] "consideration" [...] moving from the plaintiff - Mrs Carlill did nothing of value for the company - by getting the flu. They also argued that there was no communication of an intention by Mrs Carlill to accept the offer, and they relied on Brogden v. Metropolitan Ry. Co., where Lord Blackburn had said that to get a contract simply performing a private act is not enough to create obligations on other people. If one was honestly going to take the advertisement seriously, then it would allow someone that stole the Smoke Ball, and used it and got the flu, to get a reward. But that would be absurd because there would be no benefit given to the company. And, using the arguments from the Queen's Bench briefly, even if it was a contract between a purchaser and the company, it would still be void as a <b>wagering</b> (gambling) <b>contract</b> or as an insurance contract without the required form.|$|R
