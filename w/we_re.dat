Prior to testing all subjects engaged in 15 minutes of treadmill walking and running and performed a graded treadmill exercise test to maximal effort. On 3 additional days <b>WE</b> and <b>RE</b> were measured during five minutes each of walking and running.

5000|$|ADDRESS TO FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN The White House, November 11, 1919. A {{year ago}} today our enemies laid down their arms in {{accordance}} with an armistice which rendered them impotent to renew hostilities, and gave to the world an assured opportunity to reconstruct its shattered order and to work out in peace a new and juster set of inter national relations. The soldiers and people of the European Allies had fought and endured {{for more than four}} years to uphold the barrier of civilization against the aggressions of armed force. We ourselves had been in the conflict something {{more than a year and}} a half. - With splendid forgetfulness of mere personal concerns, <b>we</b> <b>re</b> modeled our industries, concentrated our financial resources, increased our agricultural output, and assembled a great army, so that at the last our power was a decisive factor in the victory. We were able to bring the vast resources, material and moral, of a great and free people to the assistance of our associates in Europe who had suffered and sacrificed without limit in the cause for which we fought. Out of this victory there arose new possibilities of political freedom and economic concert. The war showed us the strength of great nations acting together for high purposes, and the victory of arms foretells the enduring conquests which can be made in peace when nations act justly and in furtherance of the common interests of men. To us in America the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with - solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country’s service, and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of nations.

40|$|For {{a simple}} (unbiased) random walk on a {{connected}} graph with n vertices, the cover time (the expected {{number of steps}} it takes to visit all vertices) is at most O(n^ 3). We consider locally biased random walks, in which the probability of traversing an edge depends on the degrees of its endpoints. We confirm a conjecture of Abdullah, Cooper and Draief [2015] that the min-degree local bias rule ensures a cover time of O(n^ 2). For this we formulate and prove the following lemma about spanning trees. Let R(e) denote for edge e the minimum degree among its two endpoints. We say that a weight function W for the edges is feasible if it is nonnegative, dominated by R (for every edge <b>W(e)</b> < <b>R(e))</b> and the sum over all edges of the ratios W(e) /R(e) equals n- 1. For example, in trees <b>W(e)</b> = <b>R(e),</b> and in regular graphs the sum of edge weights is d(n- 1). Lemma: for every feasible W, the minimum weight spanning tree has total weight O(n).
