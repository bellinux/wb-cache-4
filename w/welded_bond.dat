40|$|Abstract <b>Welded</b> <b>bond</b> {{quality is}} a very {{important}} working aspect for the manufacturing and construction industries. A product is affected by quality of welding. A set of evaluation methods for welding operators is pro-posed in this paper, based on a theoretical analysis, to assure the quality of product. A new index using a cat-egorical quantity expression to evaluate the welding performance is proposed. The mathematical relationship of welding performance, number of bad welds and the maximum tolerable number of bad welds are derived. Then, the best estimators and the deviations of this in-dex are statistically inferred. Finally, a procedure and criteria are proposed to evaluate the performance of a welding operator. This evaluation method can be used in decision-making for the selection of a welding operator. Besides, it can also be used as an analytical tool to evaluate and improve the welding ability of a welding technician and the welding performance of a welding operator...|$|E

Currently, spot welding adhesives process or {{also known as}} <b>weld</b> <b>bonding</b> process was the effective solution for improving mechanical properties of metal joining. However, it also created issues in occupational safety and health. Previous study confirmed notably higher airborne contaminants were detected prior to usage of welding adhesive. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the personal welding fumes exposure and pulmonary function of welders involved in the <b>weld</b> <b>bonding</b> process. <b>Welding</b> fumes analysis revealed out of 15 investigated elements, none were exceeding the threshold limits for both spot and <b>weld</b> <b>bonding</b> processes. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) were conducted by using hand held spirometer to 15 control group, 11 spot welders and 19 <b>weld</b> <b>bonding</b> welders. Result of the study shows a significant mean difference of pulmonary functions values in investigated welder groups. <b>Weld</b> <b>bonding</b> welders had the lowest mean pulmonary functions values compare to other groups. Statistical analysis reveals that the pulmonary function of spot welders were affected significantly by number of smoking years but not significantly affected to duration of exposure. However, <b>weld</b> <b>bonding</b> welders pulmonary functions values were not significantly affected neither by smoking years nor working durations. It is suggested for future works to include the airborne contaminant monitoring of toxic gases for further understanding of <b>weld</b> <b>bonding</b> process on safety and health effects towards welders...|$|R
