The cluster configuration transmits the roll separating force from the work rolls to the mill housing. The small size of the <b>work</b> <b>roll</b> permits superior reductions on very hard materials, such as stainless steel or titanium. Furthermore, the small, chock-less <b>work</b> <b>roll</b> allows for a quick roll change enabling less down time, and more efficient variable production runs.|$|E
50|$|The {{heart of}} the temper mill is the cold rolling mill stand which {{produces}} the temper pass. It will include electric powered drive motors and speed reduction gearing suited to the process desired. The design of the rolling mill can be a 2-high or 4-high (even 6-high in some cases). The mill stand can be <b>work</b> <b>roll</b> driven or back up roll driven. The mill can be designed with hydraulic <b>work</b> <b>roll</b> bending or back up roll bending. Installations typically have a single rolling mill stand, but may have two. Pinch rolls provide back tension for the pay off reel in the entry section and entry and exit tension for the temper pass.|$|E
50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{compensating}} for roll deformation include continual varying crown (CVC), pair cross rolling, and <b>work</b> <b>roll</b> bending. CVC {{was developed by}} SMS-Siemag AG and involves grinding a third order polynomial curve into the work rolls and then shifting the work rolls laterally, equally, and opposite to each other. The effect is that the rolls will have a gap between them that is parabolic in shape, and will vary with lateral shift, thus allowing {{for control of the}} crown of the rolls dynamically. Pair cross rolling involves using either flat or parabolically crowned rolls, but shifting the ends at an angle so that the gap between the edges of the rolls will increase or decrease, thus allowing for dynamic crown control. <b>Work</b> <b>roll</b> bending involves using hydraulic cylinders at the ends of the rolls to counteract roll deflection.|$|E

40|$|<b>Work</b> <b>roll</b> thermal contour {{is one of}} the {{important}} factors for roll contour design and configuration in hot strip rolling, for which the temperature field calculation is a critical factor. To realize the <b>work</b> <b>roll</b> thermal behavior for 1450 mm hot strip mill, the temperature field and thermal contour calculation model was built with finite different methods, and the genetic algorithm was introduced to the model parameter optimization in order to improve the simulation precision.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the product quality improvement in hot rolling mills. The simplest scheme for modeling the rolling process considers the reduction of a strip thickness by passing the hot strip through a preset roll gap between two <b>work</b> <b>rolls.</b> Each rolling stand is driven by a DC motor, which is equipped with a speed controller. Usually the two DC motors are separately controlled; i. e. each servo drive acts only on its motor, by imposing equal set points. An important condition to guarantee for a high product quality is the equalization of the motor torque acting on the two <b>work</b> <b>rolls.</b> Experimental data show that small differences between the angular speeds of the upper and of the lower <b>work</b> <b>rolls</b> lead to sensible differences between the two motor torques, deteriorating the product quality. A combined-control of the upper and lower DC servo-drives reduces the speed fluctuations; different control techniques, - including variable structure PI controllers - are proposed, evaluated and compared by extensive simulation tests...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLubrication {{is a key}} {{parameter}} {{for improving}} the finishing mill process in hot rolling. The lubrication changes the contact interface between the <b>work</b> <b>rolls</b> and the hot strip. The lubrication can reduce the rolling force, the rolling torque, the energy consumption, the <b>work</b> <b>rolls</b> consumption and the <b>work</b> <b>rolls</b> wear. Lubrication is also a lever to optimize finishing mill capability. That is why understanding the lubrication effect is important. A way to study the lubrication is thanks {{to the analysis of}} the friction coefficient between the <b>work</b> <b>rolls</b> and the strip, which characterizes the contact at the interface. The lubrication reduces the friction coefficient which has an impact on the mass flow disturbing the thickness reduction and the interstand strip tension. The understanding of the lubrication effect goes through a design of a model that relies on lubrication and friction. ArcerlorMittal R&D performed industrial lubrication trials in the pilot plantâ€™s finishing mill. For this purpose, R&D designed a dedicated mobile dosing unit (oil in water concentration control and portable system). R&D studied the lubrication behavior based on data from industrial trials and developed a dynamical model. The friction variation is mainly linked to the oil in water concentration, the lubrication plate out, the rolling speed, the thickness reduction. We studied these physicals parameters {{in order to determine the}} most significant ones and we designed a dynamical model. The proposed model has a Linear Parameter-Varying structure with three parameters: static gain, time constant and delay. A study of these parameters according to physical parameters is investigated to design a complete and operational model...|$|R

It explores to examine if these PVD coatings can aid in extending the <b>work</b> <b>roll</b> life by either mitigating against material transfer or aiding {{in the early}} development of the roll coatings. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and focus ion beam (FIB) microscopy were used to investigate material transfer and adhesion to the surfaces of the work rolls.

A two-way material transfer mechanism between the <b>work</b> <b>roll</b> and the rolled aluminum alloy surfaces was confirmed to {{determine the amount of}} material transfer on the <b>work</b> <b>roll</b> surfaces.
