2500|$|On November 2, 2015, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Debre Katz Weintraub ruled Cosby and {{his former}} lawyer Martin Singer must give a {{deposition}} despite their efforts to have the case thrown out (Singer is not named as a defendant in the case). The ruling states Dickinson's lawyers can only seek answers {{as to whether the}} denials were made maliciously, and Cosby and Singer can assert attorney-client privilege and refuse to answer some questions. Singer was scheduled to be deposed November 19 in Los Angeles, with Cosby's deposition occurring on November 23 in Boston. On November 12, a California appeals court temporarily halted an order requiring them to testify. Both parties are required to provide information {{by the end of this}} month to state their cases as to <b>why</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> the deposition should proceed. [...] "We are confident that once the Court of Appeals hears full argument on the issues it will allow the deposition of Mr. Cosby and his attorney to go forward," [...] Dickinson's attorney Lisa Bloom wrote in an email. An email sent to Cosby's Attorney seeking comment was not answered. Marty Singer announced that he was planning a new legal move of his own.

Aim: To evaluate trends in seasonal influenza vaccine coverage and identify determinants for vaccination among pregnant women in Western Australia. Methods: We conducted an annual telephone survey in {{a random sample of}} post-partum women who delivered a baby in Western Australia between 2012 and 2014. Women were asked whether {{influenza vaccination}} was recommended and/or received during their most recent pregnancy; women were also asked <b>why</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> they were <b>not</b> immunised.

40|$|Sentences {{that begin}} with Why don’t you （I, we） <b>or</b> <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> are {{primarily}} interrogatives, and they normally take question marks. A {{large number of}} these instances are used with question marks, {{but some of them}} are not. The instances with question marks can imply suggestions, offers or requests as well as doubt or interrogative meanings. The instances without question marks can also imply suggestions, offers or requests. The expressions similar to <b>Why</b> don’t you <b>or</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> include How （What）about, Can I, Can（ Could） you, Can’t（ Couldn’t） you, Will（ Would） you, Won’t（ Wouldn’t） you and Will （Would） … please. The objective {{of this article is to}} explore how and why these expressions are sometimes used without question marks. The instances were largely taken from the corpora in the BNC and Wordbanks. Although both of these expressions used with or without question marks can show suggestions, offers or requests, when they are not used with question marks, they sound less polite than when they are used with them...|$|R
40|$|The paper uses {{qualitative}} data from Norway and the United Kingdom {{to understand the}} new technology of In Home Display monitors as a material object loaded with meaning and norms that may affect social practices and relations. The displays are designed to encourage householders to reduce electricity consumption. In contrast to technologies associated with ‘smart meters’, the monitors under study cannot be used for controlling or automatising various types of electricity consumption, but these devises nonetheless often form part of ‘smart grid solutions’. A {{large part of the}} research in this area has attempted to quantify the impact of displays, and qualitative research focusing on the users has also mainly sought to explain <b>why</b> - <b>or</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> – the introduction of displays has resulted in reduced household consumption. This paper follows a more open approach to the introduction and impact of displays by paying attention to the existing routines and social practices into which the display enters and potentially becomes integrated and domesticated. We examine to what extent ideas and norms inscribed in the display continue to have a bearing on the household moral economy and internal dynamics as the objects are negotiated and taken in use in British and Norwegian homes. Drawing on earlier studies that have sought to combine practice and domestication theory for understanding displays, the study’s novelty lies in its focus on the materiality of displays and social implications thereof, and its analysis of the social status of this object in two different contexts...|$|R

40|$|The {{educational}} use {{of technology}} {{is the subject of}} this dissertation. It deals in particular with the use of Internet applications as a medium or a tool for education. The study is focused on the adoption and diffusion of e-learning in higher education, and on universities in Flanders and Brussels in particular. The author verified if, in general, e-learning has found its way to teachers and students. And, if yes, <b>why?</b> <b>or</b> If no, <b>why</b> <b>not?</b> The primary research interests are bundled in the following two questions: - (1) What conditions on micro (students & educators), meso (university) and macro(government) influence the success of e-learning at Flemish universities? - (2) Which e-learning modalities are actually implemented in different Flemish universities? The study applies a multi-level and multi-actor approach. The author studied the integration of elearning on the micro actor level, but incorporated factors from the micro, meso and macro levels in the research design, keeping in mind the top-down and bottom-up (change) processes. Multivariate analysis techniques are deployed to gain insight into both the factors and their interrelationships. This approach enabled the author to construct a theoretical framework with determinants for the success or failure of e-learning in university settings. By doing this, Katie Goeman fills in to a certain extent the existing theoretical and practical gaps, possibly of interest to different groups of persons involved with technology for education. Among them 1) researchers in the grey area between Communication Sciences, Computer Science and Educational Sciences who are interested in the reasons why universities, teachers and learners act the way they do when confronted with technology innovations; 2) designers and developers of educational resources to be used in an e-learning project or environment and 3) meso and macro government bodies who have to plan current and future e-learning philosophies and policies. nrpages: 450 status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|An {{epistemology}} {{deals with}} how we know things. In {{the philosophy of}} economics this means asking questions such as: {{what kind of a}} [...] "truth claim" [...] is made by economic theories - for example, are we claiming that the theories relate to reality or perceptions? How can or should we prove economic theories - for example, must every economic theory be empirically verifiable? How exact are economic theories and can they lay claim to the status of an exact science - for example, are economic predictions as reliable as predictions in the natural sciences, and <b>why</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> <b>not?</b> Another way of expressing this issue is to ask whether economic theories can state [...] "laws". Philosophers of science and economists have explored these issues intensively since the work of Alexander Rosenberg and Daniel Hausman dating to 3 decades ago.|$|E

The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to produce. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $1,000 which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: “No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it.” So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's laboratory to steal the drug for his wife.

Each entry consisted of the same 10 questions regarding the implementation (date of session; how many youth participated; what life skill was incorporated; were the life skill activities successfully implemented, <b>why</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> not?; what PA/sport was incorporated?; were the physical activities successfully implemented, <b>why</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> not?; did the session go as planned, if no explain; what went well in the session; what challenges did you face and what could be improved?) and one question that involved rating the group of youth in general on four of the TPSR components (self-control, effort, self-coaching, leadership) on a scale from “Needs Work” (1) to “Great” (4). Transference was not included as it was not possible for the leaders to observe transference. These questions were discussed verbally in the leader debrief session prior to the completion of the Leader Logbook and the same leader recorded the leaders’ comments that were expressed during the debrief session and was also responsible for entering the data online.|$|R
