In 1894, Parker gained {{national}} attention in a dispute with the Supreme Court over the case of Lafayette Hudson. Hudson was convicted of assault <b>with</b> <b>intent</b> to kill and sentenced to four years imprisonment. He appealed to the Supreme Court and was granted bail. Parker refused to release Hudson on the grounds that statute law did not provide the Supreme Court the authority to demand Hudson's release.|$|E

5|$|The {{trial began}} at the Old Bailey on 20 July 1931 before Mr Justice Wright, with Sir William Jowitt, D.N. Pritt and Eustace Fulton for the prosecution, Sir John Simon, J.E. Singleton and Wilfred Lewis for Lord Kylsant and Sir Patrick Hastings, Stuart Bevan, Frederick Tucker and C.J. Conway for John Moreland. The {{indictment}} contained 3 counts. On count 1 Kylsant was charged with issuing a document, namely the annual report for 1926 <b>with</b> <b>intent</b> to deceive the shareholders about the true state of the company, Morland was charged with aiding and abetting this offence. Count 2 was an identical count relating to the annual report for 1927 against both defendants and on count 3 Kylsant alone was charged with issuing a document—the debenture stock prospectus of 1928 <b>with</b> <b>intent</b> to induce people to advance property to the company. All counts were contrary to section 84 of the Larceny Act 1861. Both defendants {{pleaded not guilty to}} all counts.|$|E

Jeliffe replied that he intended to charge murder, piracy, and running away with a vessel <b>with</b> <b>intent</b> to steal it. Vroom granted an adjournment until Tuesday at 11am. Jackalow was remanded to the city prison.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} on September1, 1911 that Lavender {{was drafted by}} the Chicago Cubs in the Major League Baseball(MLB) draft. Charles Murphy, the Cubs' owner, drafted him <b>with</b> <b>intent</b> of then trading him to a Montreal minor league team as compensation for an earlier trade that brought Ward Miller to the Cubs. The Providence team owner, Frank Navin (who also owned the Detroit Tigers of the American League(AL)), appealed the transaction to the National Commission, forerunner to the modern-day Commissioner of Baseball. The commission ruled that Murphy had to either keep Lavender for one year, or return him to Providence. Murphy chose to keep Lavender, and his contract was approved on February9, 1912 by NL president Thomas Lynch.|$|E

Cody's agent, Peter Schaffer, denied his client's guilt and said that Cody's dog died of worms {{and that there was}} no animal cruelty.

On November 6, 2009, Adolf pleaded guilty to the firearm possession charge, {{and the other two}} charges were dropped. On February 5, 2010, Adolf was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison over the weapons charges; that sentence is concurrent with Adolf's subsequent sentence on March 15 to 10 years in Colorado state prison on unrelated robbery charges.|$|E
5|$|Barbara Bell, another scholar, {{believes}} that an economic catastrophe {{such as a}} famine or a long-lasting drought affected Egypt. To better {{address the problem of}} feeding the Egyptian population, Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms, perhaps <b>with</b> <b>intent</b> to reunite after the famine. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in her opinion, the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period. Bell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who asserts her calculations were incorrect. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription take into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, but not elsewhere along the river. A state-wide drought was unlikely.|$|E

5|$|Raj Thackeray and SP leader Abu Asim Azmi were booked under Indian Penal Code {{sections}} 153 (wantonly giving provocation <b>with</b> <b>intent</b> {{to cause}} riot), 153 A (promoting enmity between {{groups on the}} basis of place of birth, residence, etc.) and 153 B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) on 11 February. The police also applied section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code to both politicians and warned them not to hold any press conferences or rallies in the next seven days. On 13 February, however, police arrested both the leaders. Later that day, a local court granted Raj conditional bail and ordered him not to make any speeches that would inflame public tension. He obtained a release after furnishing a personal bond of Rs.15,000. Azmi was arrested and taken to the Bhoiwada court in South Central Mumbai and was released on surety of Rs.10,000.|$|E
5|$|The First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54) saw the {{development}} of the line of battle, a tactic where ships formed a continuous line to fire broadsides at an enemy. Previously, naval tactics had favored short-range firepower and boarding <b>with</b> <b>intent</b> to take prizes. After the mid-17th century, tactics shifted from close-quarter fighting to disabling or sinking opponents through superior, long-distance firepower. This entailed major changes in doctrine, shipbuilding, and professionalism in European navies from the 1650s onwards. The line of battle favored large ships that were heavily armed and robust enough to hold the line in the face of enemy fire. The increased centralization and concentration of power in the emerging nation-states during the late 17th century allowed for a great expansion of armies and navies, and new government shipyards began building much much larger ships. Sweden embarked on an expansive shipbuilding program in the late 1660s.|$|E
5|$|The Governor didn't {{have the}} right to make or suspend any laws, unless in cases of urgent necessity, he could do it with the consent of the Governor-General of India. He didn't have the power of {{creating}} a new office, or granting any salary, gratuity, or allowance, without the sanction of the Governor-General of India. The Governor-General had full power to superintend and control the Governor in all points relating to the civil or military administration of the Presidency, and the Governor had to obey the orders and instructions of the Governor-General in all cases. The Governors could propose to the Governor-General drafts of any laws which they thought expedient, together with their reasons for the same; and the Governor-General communicated the resolutions to the Governor, after considering the reasons. The Governors regularly transmitted to the Governor-General true copies of all orders and acts of their governments, and also advice of all matters which they felt to be communicated to the Governor-General. The powers of the Governors were not suspended when the Governor-General visited the Presidency. The departure of the Governor from India <b>with</b> <b>intent</b> to return to Europe was deemed to be a resignation from his office. Alternately, the Governor could resign by declaring it in writing and delivering it to the secretary for the public department of the Presidency.|$|E

5|$|Within {{less than}} a week of the mutiny, a Court of Inquiry was set up to {{investigate}} and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the Court of Inquiry was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public the impression that the mutineers “were being tried for mutiny and shooting <b>with</b> <b>intent</b> to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey’’. Although the Court of Inquiry was clearly trying to downplay the link between Turkey and the mutiny, with the declassification of new documents and evidence, another perception has emerged in explaining the cause of the mutiny and that is the role of pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the law of}} {{countries}} whose legal systems derive from English common law, uttering is a crime similar to forgery.

Statute law offences of forgery replace the common law offences nowadays, often subsuming the offence of uttering, and forgery is usually a felony rather than a misdemeanour.|$|R
