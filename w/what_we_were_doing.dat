5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} because <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> {{was in such}} a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E

According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect and we felt like he was a person that understood <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> and could maintain a focus on what we were trying to attain. But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality that we thought would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E

He believed in <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> {{is the right thing}} and had the courage to lay his life on the line to do it. A few minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|E

He came 12th out of 26 candidates, with 110 votes (0.46%), resulting in a lost deposit. He explained that he was standing because [...] "if we don't face this now {{we are going to have}} some serious explaining to do when we are asked by our children and grandchildren <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> when the global fascist state was installed. 'I was watching EastEnders, dear' will not be good enough." ...|$|E

When we put that record out, we knew <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> was illegal, but {{we thought it was}} gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear about it. So the first thing that shocked us is that British rock papers gave a big review.|$|E

500|$|Work on {{the album}} was {{interrupted}} by the recording of [...] "Spectre", which Radiohead wrote for the James Bond film of the same name. The song was rejected, according to Greenwood, for being [...] "too dark". Godrich said: [...] "That fucking James Bond movie threw us a massive curveball. It was a real waste of energy. We stopped doing <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> and had to concentrate on {{that for a while}} since we were told it was something that was going to come to fruition ...

[...] Other Swedish groups, such as General Surgery and Regurgitate, practiced goregrind. Inhume, from the Netherlands, Rotten Sound, from Finland, and Leng Tch'e, from Belgium, were subsequent European groups who practiced grindcore with death metal inflections. In 2000s, the Belgium-based Aborted [...] "had grown into the role of key contributors to the death-grind genres".|$|E

It wasn't to shock people, though, but to get people involved in <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing.</b> We had to get peoples' attention.

500|$|After {{the release}} and tour for the album Radio-Activity, Kraftwerk {{continued}} to move {{further away from}} their earlier Krautrock style of improvised instrumental music, refining their work more into the format of melodic electronic songs. During the tour for Radio-Activity, the band began to make performance rules such {{as not to be}} drunk on stage or at parties. Karl Bartos wrote that about these rules, stating that [...] "it's not easy to turn knobs on a synthesizer if you are drunk or full of drugs. ... We always tried to keep very aware of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> while acting in public." [...] During this tour, early melodies that would later evolve into the song [...] "Showroom Dummies" [...] were being performed.|$|E
500|$|Bangalter {{stated that}} [...] "to be free, {{we had to}} be in control. To be in control, we had to finance <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> ourselves.

He noted that [...] "they were doing everything based on how they wanted to do it. As opposed to, 'oh we got signed to this record company, we gotta use their plan.' They wanted to make sure they never had to do anything that would make them feel bummed on making music." [...] Although Virgin Records holds exclusive distribution rights over Daft Punk's material, the duo still owns their master recordings through their Daft Trax label.|$|E

During {{a series of meetings}} early in April 1945, Caldwell proposed that the eight resign en masse, and the others agreed. Arthur later stated that, [...] "I meant to make as big a fuss as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected... All the same, we realised that, to lay ourselves open to any charge of mutiny, we might lessen the force of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing,</b> which was the reason we put the things in as resignations and not as any attempt to unseat people higher up." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{began working}} with Prince {{producer}} David Leonard on their debut record, which excited Meany: [...] " [...] loved <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> musically, {{and they wanted to}} find the producer who would capitalize on that." [...] Kaleidoscope Superior was released on June 20, 2000 and elicited positive reviews from critics. It also received a Dove Award nomination and experienced some success on Christian radio stations. Christian rock peers Rebecca St. James and dc Talk members, Kevin Max and Michael Tait, expressed excitement over the record. The same year, Earthsuit embarked on a tour called Festival Con Dios with other Christian bands, such as the Elms, PAX 217, and Switchfoot. The following year saw the band embark on their [...] "Do You Feel The Distortion" [...] tour with Ill Harmonics and The Benjamin Gate.|$|E
500|$|While piecing {{together}} the final {{components of the}} album, the band recorded a video for [...] "Warped". They asked Flea's brother-in-law, Gavin Bowden, to direct it. The video involved Kiedis and Navarro kissing towards the end {{as a way of}} breaking the monotony of cumbersome video recording. Thinking nothing of it, they continued to shoot and finished several days later. Warner Bros., however, saw the video and instantly wanted it thrown away, considering it to be unmarketable and that the kiss would alienate {{a large portion of the}} band's fan base. The band came to a consensus to let the kiss remain on the final cut, prompting a backlash from the college segment of their audience, who took offense at the action. Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "If they couldn't accept <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing,</b> we didn't need them anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{abruptly}} ended Band of Gypsys performance and their subsequent dissolution, Jeffery made arrangements to reunite the original Experience lineup. Although Hendrix, Mitchell, and Redding were interviewed by Rolling Stone in February 1970 as a united group, Hendrix {{never intended to}} work with Redding. When Redding returned to New York in anticipation of rehearsals with a re-formed Experience, {{he was told that}} he had been replaced with Cox. During an interview with Rolling Stone Keith Altham, Hendrix defended the decision: [...] "It's nothing personal against Noel, but we finished <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> with the Experience and Billy's style of playing suits the new group better." [...] Although the lineup of Hendrix, Mitchell, and Cox became known as the Cry of Love band, after their accompanying tour, billing, advertisements, and tickets were printed with the New Jimi Hendrix Experience or occasionally just Jimi Hendrix.|$|E

500|$|The songwriting session—held at Absolute's studio {{located on}} Tagg's Island near Chertsey—did {{not seem to}} go well at the beginning, as the duo was heavily into R music at the time, while the group {{according}} to Wilson was [...] "always very poptastic". After two sessions the duo phoned their managers {{and told them that}} the musical association between them and the group was not working. At this point, the duo heard [...] "Wannabe" [...] for the first time, Wilson remembers: [...] "We listen to it, and we didn't get it at all. It was so different to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing.</b> We thought, 'How's this gonna work? We're not the right people to be doing this band.'" [...] For the next session the group wanted to write something uptempo and a bit more fun. A full-on disco backing track came up, and [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] evolved from there. Wilson commented about that session: ...|$|E
500|$|A {{paramedic}} {{also said}} police allowed the first ambulances that reached Pearl Roundabout to pass safely, while some security personnel captured videos, {{but when the}} ambulances moved out carrying casualties security forces had targeted the vehicles. He said: [...] "Later Bahrain T.V. showed only the scenes where they allowed us to pass in order to mislead the public opinion. I personally heard orders given to security forces via their communication devices to target, threat and delay paramedics {{as long as they}} can. Security forces dealt with us as if we were defendants and partners to protesters who wanted to hide them, whereas <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> was a professional and humane duty {{that has nothing to do}} with our political position." [...] When the block was lifted in the late morning till noon, paramedics did not find any casualties to take back to the SMC at Pearl Roundabout, despite seeing handcuffed protesters being stomped on by police when they arrived.|$|E
500|$|Rolo Tomassi only {{completed}} {{one short}} {{tour of the}} United Kingdom in 2011. They spent all the year preparing for their new album {{and the creation of}} Destination Moon, the band's own record label. They released a compilation CD, Eternal Youth, in mid-2011 to compile selected works from their numerous split EPs, demos and out-of-print extended plays. When asked about leaving Hassle to form their own record label, the band stated [...] "We were questioning <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> for our label that we couldn't do ourselves. We've always been very proactive with the running of our band and we've never given away much freedom." [...] The band announced in early February 2012 that both Joseph Thorpe and Joe Nicholson had left the band. This was because Joe Nicholson wanted to read chemistry at university, while Thorpe's reasons were related to personal differences. The band replaced both with Chris Cayford, who is the current frontman and former guitarist of No Coast, and Nathan Fairweather, who plays in Brontide, making this the first release with the new line-up.|$|E
