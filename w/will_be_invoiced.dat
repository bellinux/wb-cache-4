50|$|Prominent {{players in}} the {{dedicated}} server market offer large amounts of bandwidth ranging from 500 gigabytes to 3000 gigabytes using the “overselling” model. It {{is not uncommon for}} major players to provide dedicated servers with 1Terabyte (TB) of bandwidth or higher. Usage models based on the byte level measurement usually include a given amount of bandwidth with each server and a price per gigabyte after a certain threshold has been reached. Expect to pay additional fees for bandwidth overage usage. For example, if a dedicated server has been given 3000 gigabytes of bandwidth per month and the customer uses 5000 gigabytes of bandwidth within the billing period, the additional 2000 gigabytes of bandwidth <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>invoiced</b> as bandwidth overage. Each provider has a different model for billing. No industry standards have been set yet.|$|E

50|$|While {{the eastern}} {{terminus}} of the toll ticket system was {{moved from the}} Delaware River Bridge to a spot 2 mi west of the interchange, the previous tollbooth at the bridge {{was replaced by a}} new cashless toll system—a first for Pennsylvania.

40|$|The {{idea that}} the payment of {{commission}} to those working within the financial services sector {{is not in the}} interests of consumers is gaining ground. Legislation now exists banning the majority of such payments within the financial advice sector. This work considers compliant strategies that might be employed to the benefit of both the adviser community and their clients. To ascertain existing attitudes, beliefs and practices amongst advisers and product providers semi-structured interviews were conducted and the existence or absence of recurring themes analysed using Applied Thematic Analysis techniques. The needs, as opposed to wants of consumers were identified by analysing records of what clients had actually done and comparing these with their original requirements. Analysis showed that product providers’ aims only partly satisfied the needs of consumers and that independent financial advisers are seen as elements of providers’ distribution channels. IFAs espoused the view that they were free from any influence from product providers, without being able to demonstrate what other sources of revenue they had. Furthermore, the income they did receive was usually calculated {{as a percentage of the}} value of the investment product sold, both initially and thereafter. Changes in practice are inevitable for to survive as Independent Financial Advisers and Planners there must be compliance with the regulations that a regulator imposes. Commissions, by any name, <b>will</b> ultimately <b>be</b> replaced by a fees-based service. To comply a knowledge of business management, including cost awareness and product pricing, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> vital. <b>Invoicing</b> clients transparently for the entirety of the service will ensure that businesses operate ethically and have long-term futures that are no longer reliant upon product providers. Furthermore, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> organised around the constituent parts of the title, “Independent,” “Financial” and “Adviser/Planner. ” This work points towards a practical solution...|$|R

50|$|Continuation or Recurring <b>Invoicing</b> <b>is</b> {{standard}} {{within the}} equipment rental industry, including tool rental. A recurring <b>invoice</b> <b>is</b> one generated on a cyclical basis during {{the lifetime of}} a rental contract. For example, if you rent an excavator from 1 January to 15 April, on a calendar monthly arrears billing cycle, {{you would expect to}} receive an invoice at the end of January, another at the end of February, another at the end of March and a final Off-rent <b>invoice</b> would <b>be</b> generated at the point when the asset is returned.

40|$|Cross-country {{differences}} {{in the choice of}} an invoicing currency in international trade is one reason for cross-country {{differences in}} estimated exchange rate coefficients in short-run balance of trade equations. If exports <b>are</b> <b>invoiced</b> in domestic currency while imports <b>are</b> <b>invoiced</b> in a foreign currency, a depreciation will increase the domestic currency value of outstanding import contracts, and may cause the balance of trade to fall in the short run. Countries with different invoicing patterns will have different effects on the short-run trade balance following a depreciation. We explore a simple theory of invoicing currency choice, drawing inferences regarding the likely choices for 14 countries. This allows a classification of countries according to the expected short-run balance of trade effect of a currency depreciation. Empirical estimates support the hypothesized groupings based on suggested currency invoicing patterns.

50|$|In recent years, it {{has become}} {{increasingly}} difficult for SMEs to obtain traditional finance from banks. Alternative options <b>are</b> <b>invoice</b> discounting or factoring, whereby the company borrows against its outstanding invoices, with the ability to obtain funds as soon as new <b>invoices</b> <b>are</b> created. It is often questioned which option is best for your business - factoring or discounting - and the answer depends on how the business wants to be perceived by customers. With factoring, the finance company charges interest on the loan until the <b>invoice</b> <b>is</b> paid, as well as fees, and the finance company takes ownership of the debtor ledger and uses its own credit control team to secure payment. With invoice discounting, the business maintains control of its own ledger and chases debts itself.|$|R
