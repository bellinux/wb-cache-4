5|$|For most of {{the eighth}} century, Mercia was {{dominant}} among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms south of the river Humber. Æthelbald, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne in 716, had established himself as the overlord of the southern Anglo-Saxons by 731. He was assassinated in 757, and was briefly succeeded by Beornred, but within a year Offa ousted Beornred and took the throne for himself. Offa's daughter Eadburh married Beorhtric of Wessex in 789, and Beorhtric became an ally thereafter. In Kent, Offa intervened decisively in the 780s, {{and at some point}} became the overlord of East Anglia, whose king, Æthelred, was beheaded at Offa's orders in 794.|$|E

5|$|Maeser {{was elected}} as the regent of the University of Deseret in 1860, 1863 and in 1865. In 1865, {{he began to}} privately tutor Young's fifty-six {{children}} and also instructed other children <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Young household including Ellis Reynolds Shipp. During this time, he also kept books for Leonard H. Hardy to supplement his income. He was teaching at Young's family school when he was called {{on a mission to}} Germany in 1867.

5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old coach {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season, which the Browns finished with a 7–7 record. Collier told Modell that he could no longer hear his players, and it was difficult to read their lips through new face masks that obscured their mouths. Modell tried to help by getting Collier to try new hearing aids and even sent him for acupuncture treatment, but none of it worked. Collier struggled during press conferences because he often could not hear what reporters were asking and answered the wrong questions. In eight years as coach, Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 76–34–2 record. Nick Skorich, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Browns as offensive coordinator in 1964, was named as his replacement in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The President of the Puerto Rican Senate, Luis Muñoz Marín {{together}} with Governor Rexford Tugwell, the last non-Puerto Rican Governor of Puerto Rico appointed by an American president, helped advance legislation geared towards agricultural reform, economic recovery and industrialization. This program {{became known as}} Operation Bootstrap. As {{a result of the}} program, many Jews migrated to the city of Ponce located in the southern region of the island and worked in the agricultural industry. Operation Bootstrap also attracted clothing manufactures from New York and many {{of the people in the}} industry <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island were Jews.|$|E
5|$|The role {{of women}} in the Fasci siciliani was substantial, but is {{regularly}} overlooked in historical accounts. Women were often at the forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public meetings and conferences. During municipal elections they made sure that men were going to vote (women did {{not have the right to}} vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> towns with flowers.|$|E

5|$|The town's name in Welsh, Llanilltud Fawr, {{is derived}} from the name of Saint Illtud, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area from Brittany, Gaul. He founded the monastery of Illtud and the college {{attached}} to it, Cor Tewdws, which would grow {{into one of the most}} esteemed Christian colleges of the times. At its peak it attracted over 2000 students, including princes and numerous eminent clergymen, some now revered as saints. Destroyed by the Vikings in 987, the monastery was rebuilt in 1111 and continued to be a centre of learning governed by Tewkesbury Abbey until it closed in 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The 13th-century St Illtyd's Church, built near the ancient monastery, is today a Grade I listed building and one of the oldest parish churches in Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{villages of}} La Grace, Piaye and Laborie in the {{southwest}} area of Saint Lucia were known for a unique song-dance called the koutoumba. The koutoumba was only performed {{for the death of}} a djiné, a person descended from Africans <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. The koutoumba is unique among Lucian folk dance in that it is performed by a sole dancer and using only two to four lines of text, which is evocative of the song's atmosphere rather than narrative. The last drummer who knew this tradition died in 1986.|$|E
5|$|After the Bolshevik {{revolution}} in October 1917, Russia quickly disintegrated into civil war. Negotiations {{for the release}} of the Romanovs between their Bolshevik (commonly referred to as 'Reds') captors and their extended family, many of whom were prominent members of the royal houses of Europe, stalled. As the Whites (anti-Bolshevik forces, although not necessarily supportive of the Tsar) advanced toward Yekaterinburg, the Reds were in a precarious situation. The Reds knew Yekaterinburg would fall to the better manned and equipped White Army. When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg, the imperial family had simply disappeared. The most widely accepted account was that the family had been murdered. This was due to an investigation by White Army investigator Nicholas Sokolov, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion based on items that had belonged to the family being found thrown down a mine shaft at Ganina Yama.|$|E

5|$|Belichick, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Browns after 12 years {{mostly with}} the Giants under Bill Parcells, quickly {{made his mark}} by restricting media access to the team. He acted gruff or bored at press conferences, shrugging, rolling his eyes and often giving short answers to long questions. This bred the {{perception}} that the new coach was not a good communicator and lacked a vision for the team. Behind the scenes, however, he was trying to remake the Browns. He reformed Cleveland's scouting methods and, in conjunction with player personnel director Mike Lombardi, tried to form a coherent identity: a big and strong cold-weather team. Belichick's new way forward, however, did not immediately translate to on-field success. Cleveland's record only improved slightly in 1991 to 6–10 as the offense struggled to produce scoring drives and the defense was plagued by injuries. Kosar was a rare bright spot, passing for almost 3,500yards and 18 touchdowns. Bridging the end of the 1990 season and the beginning of 1991, the quarterback threw a then-record 307 straight passes without an interception. Kosar broke his ankle twice and sat out for most of the 1992 season, leaving quarterback Mike Tomczak under center. The team finished with a 7–9 record and did not make the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Blank debuted for the ECW brand as Kelly Kelly. Originally, {{she was to}} {{be named}} just 'Kelly', but her ring name was {{expanded}} to 'Kelly Kelly' by WWE chairman Vince McMahon. She made her debut on the first episode of ECW on June 13, 2006, becoming the youngest Diva on the WWE roster at the age of 19. Her character, an exhibitionist, was introduced performing a striptease for the crowd. The next week, while performing another striptease, Kelly was interrupted by her on-screen boyfriend, Mike Knox, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stage and covered her with a towel before dragging her backstage. Her stripping became a weekly segment known as Kelly's Exposé and usually followed the same routine; Kelly would dance and strip until she was interrupted by Knox, who was upset by her exhibitionism and showing off her body to others. Originally a solo segment, Kelly was joined by the villainous Candice Michelle on the July 11 edition of ECW.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, Paul {{called for}} a vote of no {{confidence}} in United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Later that month, Paul blocked legislation that would strengthen safety rules {{for oil and gas}} pipelines, because, he stated, the bill was not strong enough. In October, Paul blocked a bill that would provide $36million in benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, saying that he was concerned that it could be used to aid domestic terrorists. This was in response to two alleged terrorists <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States through a refugee program and were receiving welfare benefits when they were arrested in 2011 in Paul's hometown of Bowling Green. Paul lifted his hold on the bill after Democratic leaders promised to hold a Congressional hearing into how individuals are selected for refugee status and request an investigation on how the two suspects were admitted in the country through a refugee program. In June 2012, Paul endorsed Mitt Romney after it became apparent that he would be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election. However, he was later vocal about his disagreements with Romney on a number of policies.|$|E

5|$|The {{next night}} on Raw, Orton faced Batista, {{who had become}} World Heavyweight Champion. Orton stated {{on-screen}} that his match with The Undertaker had aggravated a shoulder injury. While sidelined, Orton appeared on Raw and claimed that he was ineligible for the WWE Draft Lottery due to his injury. He was informed by WWE Chairman Vince McMahon that he was indeed {{a candidate for the}} draft, leaving a possibility of a return to SmackDown!. Orton returned to WWE programming for SmackDown! on June 16, announcing that he was the second pick in the 2005 draft lottery. He rekindled his feud with The Undertaker, defeating him at SummerSlam following a distraction from his father. Two months later, Orton and his father Bob Orton defeated The Undertaker in a Handicap Casket match, after the match Randy Orton and his father Bob locked the Undertaker in the casket and, in a move similar to Kane at the 1998 Royal Rumble, chopped holes {{in the top of the}} casket with an axe, poured gasoline over the casket and set it ablaze, kayfabe killing The Undertaker. The following month, Orton replaced the late Eddie Guerrero as a participant in the annual elimination match of Team SmackDown against Team Raw at Survivor Series, after having lost a qualifying match to Rey Mysterio. In the match, Orton was the last remaining wrestler in the match for the third straight year, as he pinned Shawn Michaels to get the victory for Team SmackDown. At the event, The Undertaker returned by emerging from a flaming casket and attacked the SmackDown superstars <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring to celebrate Team SmackDown's victory. On the SmackDown! episode after Survivor Series, The Undertaker interfered in a match between Rey Mysterio and Big Show after Kane interfered. Randy Orton RKO'd the Undertaker, he then struck the Undertaker with a tire iron and set him on the back of the lowrider Mysterio had driven to the ring, he then reversed the lowrider into the SmackDown set, causing an explosion. The feud was finally settled with a Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon, where The Undertaker offered to retire if he lost. On December 16, The Undertaker entered the ring to deliver a promo while one of his druids appeared to be standing in the ring. The Undertaker sustained an RKO from Orton in a surprise attack. The druid revealed himself to be Orton's father, who gave Orton The Undertaker's urn, which, according to the storyline, allowed whomever held it to control The Undertaker. The Undertaker, however, beat both Ortons in a Hell in a Cell match, ending their nine-month-long feud.|$|E
5|$|Ulis debuted {{with the}} Suns on October 26, 2016 against the Sacramento Kings. He posted 2 points, a rebound, an assist, a steal, and a block in 13 minutes of action during the blowout loss, but {{was on the}} court as Phoenix cut the deficit from 26 to 10 points at one point. His play in mop-up time earned him {{a role in the}} second unit. On October 31, Ulis posted a team-high 6 assists in 18 minutes of play against the Los Angeles Clippers. On November 18, he scored a season-high 10 points and 4 steals in a 116–96 win over the Indiana Pacers. He matched the 4 steals and added 4 rebounds the next night against the Philadelphia 76ers. On December 14, he was {{assigned}} to the Northern Arizona Suns of the NBA Development League. He managed to record 13 points, 9 assists, and 5 rebounds in a loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors before returning to Phoenix to play against the San Antonio Spurs the next day. On December 29, he matched his season and career high with 10 points in 15 minutes in a 99–91 win over the Toronto Raptors. On February 8, there was an oncourt altercation between the Suns and the Memphis Grizzlies resulting in suspensions and fines, including a $15,000 fine for Ulis (<b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defense of Booker). On February 11, 2017, Ulis recorded a career-high 13 points and tied another career high with six assists in a 133–102 loss to the Houston Rockets. On February 17, he had his number retired at Marian Catholic. Following the break for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, Ulis was moved into the main rotation of players ahead of Brandon Knight. In his new role, Ulis set new career-highs in assists on February 28 against Memphis (7), and March 2 against Charlotte (8); and new career-highs in points on March 3 against Oklahoma City (14) and March 5 against Boston (20, including a buzzer beater game-winning three point shot). Ulis helped improve the team's assist production post All-Star break from 18.6 assists per game (tied for last in the NBA) prior to the break to 24.8 per game in the first two weeks after the break. Ulis received his first NBA start (in place of an injured, resting Eric Bledsoe) on March 15 against the Sacramento Kings and former Kentucky teammate Skal Labissière, who had a career-high 32 points. Ulis record his first career double-double with 13 points and a season-high 13 assists in a 107–101 loss against the Kings. Ulis became the first Suns rookie with at least 12 points and 12 assists in a game since Steve Nash in November 1996. Two days later, Ulis, making his second career NBA start, scored 19 points and added eight assists in a 109–103 loss to Orlando Magic. On March 30, he had 16 points and matched his career best with 13 assists in a 124–118 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. On April 2, he had a near triple-double with career highs of 34 points and nine rebounds as well as nine assists in a 123–116 loss to the Houston Rockets. The 34 points was a 2016–17 season single-game high for all NBA rookies. Ulis was subsequently named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for April, becoming the second Suns rookie to win the award during the 2016–17 season (after Marquese Chriss in January). It was the first time two different Suns earned the award in the same season since the 1987–88 NBA season. Ulis ended April by leading all rookies in points (20.7) and assists (6.8), while also recording 3.8 rebounds. His average of 20.7 points and 6.8 assists was the most by an NBA rookie in a month since Damian Lillard in March 2013. While he averaged 7.3 points, 3.7 assists, and 1.6 rebounds in 61 games for the season, he averaged 16.1 points and 8.5 assists in games that he started. Ulis finished 14th in the voting for the 10-man NBA All-Rookie team.|$|E
