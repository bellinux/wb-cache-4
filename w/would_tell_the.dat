Electors must also have resided in the territory for at least 12 months to the day of the writ being dropped.|$|E
5|$|Former Georgetown University {{basketball}} coach John Thompson had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77. As he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> story {{many times in}} the following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on Jim Rome's radio show, he had been scheduled to appear on that show on September 12, 2001. Thompson was planning to be in Las Vegas for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel {{on the day of the}} show. After a Rome staffer personally assured Thompson that he would be able to travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, Thompson changed his travel plans. He felt the impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon.|$|E

25|$|In {{that year}} also, Tanguito {{was killed when}} {{he was hit by}} a train. Conspiracies about his death abound, {{including}} that he committed suicide and even that he was thrown onto the tracks by police. A heavy user of drugs, others contend he simply might have tripped. The 1993 motion picture Tango Feroz ("Wild Tango"), <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> life of Tanguito to new generations and the movie was an international hit.|$|E
25|$|The SADC {{postponed}} {{a meeting}} of its defence committee indefinitely until Mbeki could finalise a unity deal in Zimbabwe; while confirming that he would attend the meeting, Mbeki told journalists that, if the deal fell through at the last minute, he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> SADC {{that he had done}} his best as mediator, and that the deal would fall through because {{one or more of the}} parties were not serious about the negotiations.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} few seasons, the {{contestant}} would first meet the panel up close, for a casual inspection, and the panel was allowed one initial guess. Beginning in 1955 Daly simply greeted and seated the contestant, who then met the panel {{at the end of}} the game. Additionally, starting April 17, 1955, the panel stopped taking initial guesses. The contestant's line was then revealed to the studio and home audiences, and Daly <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> panel whether the contestant was salaried or self-employed, and from 1960 on, dealt in a product or a service.|$|E

25|$|The {{qualifying}} round {{was played}} in two parts. In the first part, {{a clue to}} the word was given. The point value for the word decreased by five points from a starting value of 100 for every third of a second no one rang in. If the value reached 25 points, host Chuck Henry <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> contestants what line the word was on. In {{the second part of the}} round, a new board was played and the point values doubled. The first contestant to reach 1,000 points advanced to the championship round while the losing contestant went home with parting gifts.|$|E
25|$|Sitting {{after dinner}} at Ilam {{about a month}} ago, I said I saw no hope for a better state of public policy here unless {{there was a new}} {{newspaper}} started which <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> truth without fear or favour. In five minutes the thing was settled. If I would undertake the management of it, it was to be started and five hundred pound was put down on the spot; it was soon found there was a little press and some types to be bought. I promised I would write and would exercise a general superintendence over the matter... The first number appeared three weeks after the conversation referred to.|$|E
500|$|The second {{block of}} episodes was {{critically}} acclaimed however, {{with the crew}} dealing with problems from the first block. More answers were written into the show and Nikki and Paulo were killed off. [...] It was also announced that the series would end three seasons after the third season, which Cuse hoped <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> audience that the writers knew where the story was going.|$|E

500|$|Muntz {{developed}} a television chassis that produced an acceptable monochrome picture with 17tubes. He often carried {{a pair of}} wire clippers, and when he thought {{that one of his}} employees was [...] "overengineering" [...] a circuit, he would begin snipping components out until the picture or sound stopped working. At that point, he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> engineer [...] "Well, I guess you have to put that last part back in" [...] and walk away.|$|E
500|$|Thinking {{of music}} in terms of basic elements, Jewel <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> {{director}} that for certain scenes, {{it should not have}} bass since, as an earth tone, it is usually used for a more emotional or ominous part. Jewel thought the music should be in the upper register and relaxing for the [...] "dreamlike" [...] scene. To help himself with the music composition process, and to conjure up melodies, the producer would highlight many phrases from the novel, then print those words in large font, and hung them on his walls or draw pictures during viewings of Drive.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Tangled (2010), on December 22, 2011, Disney {{announced}} a release date, November 27, 2013, for the film, together with a new title, Frozen, and Peter Del Vecho and John Lasseter took up as the project's producers. Now, when the film was revived again, {{one of the main}} challenges that Buck and his team had to face with was the character. The storyboards were presented to John Lasseter, who <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> assembled production team [...] "You haven't dug deep enough." [...] Lasseter commended that Chris Buck's latest version was fun and very light-hearted, but the characters were not multifaceted, and thus did not resonate for the producer.|$|E

500|$|After {{her book}} was published, Brodie was {{contacted}} by some Eston Hemings Jefferson descendants who recognized {{his name from}} her account. They discovered that their fathers in the 1940s had decided that, to protect their children from racial discrimination associated with descent from Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson, they <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> children they were descended from Jefferson's uncle. All these Jefferson descendants learned in the 1970s of their alleged descent from Eston Hemings, Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson. Brodie wrote a follow-up article about the Jefferson-Hemings grandchildren in 1976, entitled [...] "Thomas Jefferson’s Unknown Grandchildren: A Study in Historical Silences"], published in October 1976 in American Heritage magazine. Photographs and other documentary material they gave her have been donated to UCLA archives.|$|E
500|$|As {{a reward}} for her actions at WrestleMania 28, John Laurinaitis {{appointed}} Eve the Executive Administrator of Raw and SmackDown. As her {{first order of business}} as Executive Administrator, Eve fired the Bella Twins on the April 30 episode of Raw. Despite her new authority figure role, she continued to participate in matches throughout mid-2012. On the August 10 episode of SmackDown, Eve asked SmackDown General Manager Booker T if she could be his assistant, but Kaitlyn was given the job instead. Eve threatened Booker T that she <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> Board of Directors about his [...] "discriminatory hiring practices," [...] and was given a match against Kaitlyn the following week to determine who would become his assistant, which Eve won.|$|E
500|$|At the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con it was {{revealed}} that the series would be adapting the character of Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider during its fourth season, with the first eight episodes making up the opening [...] "pod" [...] of episodes for the season, subtitled Ghost Rider. That October, executive producer Jed Whedon said that the series' use of Reyes and his supporting characters and mythology was [...] "definitely pivoting from the storyline in the comics. We’re pulling the characters, the character names and the relationships, but I think you can already feel that we’ve changed it. Those dynamics will be entirely different. We’re using them as inspiration." [...] Marvel soon revealed that the sixth episode of the season would be titled [...] "The Good Samaritan", and <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> series' version of Reyes' origin story. It is written by executive producer Jeffrey Bell, with Billy Gierhart directing.|$|E

500|$|During the {{backwards}} guitar solo, Frusciante {{was filmed}} waving a large aluminum ribbon; Kiedis was initially apprehensive about Sednaoui's {{desire for the}} guitarist to do so, believing he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> director [...] "'Fuck you and take that dancing ribbon and shove it up your French ass, buddy' but [...] gladly went off and made love to the air with this dancing ribbon. He would have danced around for hours with that thing." [...] The footage was edited in reverse to complement the solo. While some of the scenes in the video were planned with a storyboard, {{much of it was}} improvised or made up on the spot over the two-day shoot. During a particular scene Kiedis began to move his tongue flamboyantly to dramatically accentuate the lyrics, which Sednaoui believed was extremely beneficial to the exuberant nature of the video. Where the video begins in {{what appears to be the}} daytime, it concludes at dusk with silhouettes of the band members running into the setting sun.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{rented the}} Sony Music Studios in New York City, and was {{influenced}} by her husband Jay-Z's method of collaborating with multiple record producers; she used four recording studios simultaneously. She booked Harrison, Jerkins and Garrett, each with a room to work in. During the sessions, Beyoncé would move from studio to studio to check her producers' progress, later claiming this fostered [...] "healthy competition" [...] among producers. When Beyoncé conceived a potential song, she <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> group who would deliberate, and after three hours the song would be created. While Beyoncé and the team brainstormed the lyrics, other collaborators such as the Neptunes, Jerkins and Swizz Beatz would simultaneously produce the tracks. They would sometimes begin working at eleven o'clock, spending up to fourteen {{hours a day in}} the studios during the recording process. Beyoncé arranged, co-wrote and co-produced all the songs. Makeba Riddick, in an interview with MTV News, recounted her experience in the production: ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Mercedes' {{relationship}} with Russ Owen (Stuart Manning), she {{had sex with}} Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) and feeling guilty, proposed to Russ which he accepted. Metcalfe felt Mercedes might again stray with [...] "Warren hanging around on the sidelines" [...] although she hoped Mercedes would remain faithful to Russ. Mercedes and Russ marry despite the ceremony being interrupted by Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee). Looking back at the wedding, Metcalfe commented that the wedding [...] "didn't go smoothly". Warren was accused of attempting to murder Clare Devine (Gemma Bissix), but his innocence and her infidelity was established when {{it was revealed that}} they were together the night Clare was attacked. Metcalfe said that [...] "although Mercedes knew she was taking a risk by sleeping with Warren, she genuinely thought she'd get away with it". She opined that after her and Russ' [...] "honeymoon period" [...] ended, Mercedes felt guilty and considered [...] "spilling the beans", although Metcalfe was not sure she <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> truth about her affair with Russ.|$|E
