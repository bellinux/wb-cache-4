25|$|Seafood is {{the most}} {{important}} part of Khuzestani cuisine, but many other dishes are also featured. The most popular Khuzestani dish is Ghalyeh Mahi, a fish dish that is prepared with heavy spices, onions and cilantro. The fish used in the dish is locally known as mahi soboor (shad fish), a species of fish found in the Persian Gulf. Other provincial specialties include Ghalyeh Meygu ("shrimp casserole"), ashe-mohshala (a Khorramshahri breakfast stew), sær shir (a Dezfuli breakfast of heavy cream), hælim (a Shushtari breakfast of <b>wheatmeal</b> with shredded lamb), and kohbbeh (a deep-fried rice cake with ground beef filling and other spices of Arabic origin, a variant on Levantine kibbeh).

Seemingly contaminated <b>wheatmeal</b> and butter two years past its expiry date were among discoveries claimed by an undercover reporter at Hangzhou Guangqi Trade Co, in the eastern city of Hangzhou.|$|E

[...] "Gloucester Chronicle" [...] also mentions that [...] "Hercules" [...] (stoneground) <b>wheatmeal</b> flour and barley meal {{was produced by}} the Company at North Mill. This mill was powered by electricity. Test bakery for Mills.|$|E
50|$|Staffordshire oatcakes are a local {{component}} of the full English breakfast. It is a plate-sized pancake, made with equal parts medium oatmeal and <b>wheatmeal</b> (flour), along with frothing yeast. Once the mixture has risen to produce something like a Yorkshire pudding batter, it is ladled onto a griddle or bakestone, and dried through. Staffordshire oatcakes are commonly paired with bacon, sausages, mushrooms, kidney, and baked beans, among others.|$|E
5000|$|The {{institute}} {{was charged}} in 1942 with {{looking into the}} nutritional value of high extraction wheat. As {{a result of this}} research a [...] "national <b>wheatmeal</b> loaf" [...] of 85% extraction was introduced. It was priced the same as the staple white bread to encourage the public to use it (in this period brown bread was normally considered a speciality bread and was more expensive). The reseearch was particularly looking at the issues of digestibility and calcium absorption.|$|E

50|$|It is {{a typical}} Irish stone tower mill, with a {{moveable}} cap turned {{by means of an}} automatic fantail, ensuring that the sails always faced into the wind. When the wind blows directly onto the sails the blades or vanes of the fantail are not moved. However, if the wind veers, it catches the blades and the whole cap turns on an iron ring or ‘curb’, bringing the sails back into the wind. As well as the ground floor the mill has three storeys - a ‘drive’ floor, ‘stone’ floor and ‘hopper’ floor, from the first to third level respectively. The rotating cap sits above the hopper floor. Three pairs of millstones sit at the ‘stone’ floor - one set for making <b>wheatmeal,</b> one for shelling the grains of corn (a process which separated the useless ‘hulls’ from the valuable ‘seeds’ or grain) and a set for grinding grains into oatmeal. The power of the wind is transmitted back from the sails or ‘sweeps’ by means of the central ‘windshaft’ passing back into the cap. On the inner end of the rotating windshaft is the ‘brake wheel’ which drives a bevel gearwheel or ‘wallower’ perched on top of the main (vertical) driveshaft. This power turns the three sets of grinding stones below. The sails would have been covered with canvas sailcloth. The amount of sailcloth used determined the amount of power and this would have been adjusted from within the cap, even while the sails were turning, to suit the particular grinding requirements at any given time. Ballycopeland produced oatmeal and <b>wheatmeal</b> for human consumption, as well as animal feed such as shelled and bruised oats, yellow meal (from maize), kibbled (crushed) grain for poultry and ground peas and beans.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was developed aiming {{to evaluate the}} potentiality of soy bean, rice flour, maize flour, oatmeal and manioc flour, as alternative extenders to <b>wheatmeal</b> for plywood manufaturing. Twenty one boards were produced using Eucalyptus cloeziana venner, being three boards per treatment according to the following formulation in parts per wheight: urea-formaldheyde resin 100, extender 75, water 80 and catalyst 7. The average values of shear bonding tests (dry and wet), showed that the ricemeal and oatmeal {{could be used as}} an alternative extender to the <b>wheatmeal...</b>|$|E
40|$|All {{forms of}} baking and {{processing}} cause {{a loss of}} nutrients, including vitamin E, but {{little is known about}} these occurrences or if they could be avoided. The objective of this research was to study the incorporation of palm oil and the stability of vitamin E in palm oil during breadmaking. <b>Wheatmeal</b> and rye breads were baked with and without the addition of 0, 2, 5 or 8 % palm oil. The eight E group vitamers (tocopherols and tocotrienols) were extracted using accelerated solvent extraction, freeze dried then analysed using normal phase HPLC. Compared to the controls, the inclusion of palm oil was found to increase the quantity of all forms of vitamin E in the final baked products. It is concluded that palm oil is very effective in increasing the vitamin E content of wholegrain bread...|$|E
40|$|This work aims at {{evaluating}} the potentiality of babaçu flour under differents percents (0 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 %) as alternative extensers to <b>wheatmeal</b> for plywood manufacturing. Third three panels with five veneers were produced using Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) Ktze, with urea-formaldehyde – UF and phenol-formaldehyde – FF resins and being three panels per treatment. The following formulations (in parts per wheight) were used: UF resin – 100 x extender – 50 x water – 50 x catalyst – 7 and FF resin – 100 x extender – 18 x water – 22. The results of both glue line shear strength obtained for plywood manufactured with urea-formaldehyde and phenol-formaldehyde resins showed {{the feasibility of}} the use of babaçu flour as the extender in parcial or total substitution of wheat flour in the plywood manufactures. </p...|$|E
