50|$|There {{are three}} basic shapes of ear ornaments: Especially {{common in the}} 1st century are {{circular}} or drop-shaped pendants. Archaeological finds indicate that these were fully or semi-spherical. Later tastes favoured S-shaped hooks of gold wire, on which up to five beads of different colours and materials could be strung. The third shape are elaborate pendants with a horizontal bar from which two or three, occasionally four, vertical rods are suspended, usually each decorated with a <b>white</b> <b>bead</b> or pearl at the bottom. Other common ornaments include gold hairpins, often decorated with pearls, fine diadems, and, especially at Antinoopolis, gold hairnets. Many portraits also depict amulets and pendants, perhaps with magical functions.|$|E

The outer and basal lip are sharp, angled where they meet, margined with a <b>white</b> <b>bead.</b> The columella is subvertical, slightly arched, with a slight swelling in the middle.

50|$|The {{height of}} the shell attains 12 mm. The solid shell has a low-trochiform shape. It is angular at the {{periphery}} and slightly convex beneath. The ground color is red or dull red. The sculpture of the spiral cords cuts into smooth rounded beads. These cords are a little narrower than the intervals on the upper surface, smaller on the base and about equal in width to their intervals. Above the periphery on the body whorl there are five rows of beads, all of them dotted, either having a black interval between two white beads, or with a black and a <b>white</b> <b>bead.</b> The intervals consist {{of two or three}} red beads. The base of the shell is similarly variegated, but the dots are sometimes brown. Furrows between the bead-rows are finely and densely decussate by spiral and oblique raised striae or threads. The spire is straightly conic with an acute, roseate apex and about six whorls. The body whorl is deflexed in front. The aperture is oblique, and contracted by a simple,rather compressed fold {{at the foot of the}} columella, and another near the upper end of the outer lip with several small folds between them. The columella is contorted above and enters deeply the false umbilicus, the margin of which is toothed. The parietal callus is strongly plicate.|$|E

40|$|Chicks {{exposed to}} light during late foetal life {{experience}} {{stimulation of the}} right eye only and, in consequence, develop asymmetries of the crossed visual projections from thalamus to forebrain and differences in performance of some visual tasks when using the right or left eye. The present study compared dark- and light-incubated chicks in a test of olfaction in which clove oil odour was presented together with a coloured bead. When the chicks were tested with a blue bead and using the right nostril (left nostril occluded by wax), head shaking and pecking were elevated, compared to pretest responses to an unscented, <b>white</b> <b>bead.</b> No significant elevation of head shaking occurred in chicks tested with the blue bead and using the left nostril, although pecking increased, which indicates that these chicks attended to the visual parameters of the bead but not the odour. It appears that, when the left nostril is used, attention to an attractive visual stimulus suppresses responses to olfactory input to the left hemisphere. When the clove oil odour was presented together with a less attractive, red bead, no significant lateralisation emerged. Light or dark experience prior to hatching {{had no effect on}} the lateralised performance of the blue-bead lest. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

30|$|<b>White</b> <b>beads</b> were {{coloured}} with calcium antimoniate (CaSb 2 O 6, CaSb 2 O 7) (seventeenth c.) {{and lead}} arsenate (nineteenth c.), both pigments readily recognised through their Raman spectra [21, 22] and XRF. The pigment {{in the glass}} of the white dots on the large red bead (“fancy bead”) and in the white core of the small red-on-white bead (“white heart”) is lead arsenate, placing them in the same time period as the other arsenate-containing beads. One of the <b>white</b> <b>beads</b> (Mag-eu-w 15) (Fig.  7) is actually a white button which was made by a Prosser moulded production process from 1840 onwards. They were made by moulding a mixture of feldspar or clay with quartz and other materials and compressing it under pressure i.e. a glass-ceramic. This is reflected in its spectrum that shows several sharp peaks at 476, 514, 1122  cm− 1 corresponding to a mixture of feldspars (Fig.  4 a, d).|$|R
