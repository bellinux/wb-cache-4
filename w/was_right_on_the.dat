500|$|The role of Frank, the suicidal Proust scholar, was {{originally}} written for Bill Murray, {{and there was}} also studio pressure for Robin Williams. The directing duo chose Steve Carell for the role a few months before filming began, and in an interview revealed: [...] "When we met with Steve Carell, we didn't know he could do this based upon what he had done. But when we met with him and talked to him about the character, the tone of the movie and the way we were approaching it, he <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same page with us". Although known to Comedy Central viewers for many years as a correspondent on the highly rated satirical news program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, at the time Carell was cast for Little Miss Sunshine, he was relatively unknown in Hollywood. Producers of the film were worried that he was not a big enough star and did not have much acting experience.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} to draw {{comparisons}} with The Year of the Sex Olympics and the rise of reality television programmes (soap operas without professional actors), such as Big Brother, Castaway 2000 and Survivor, was the journalist Nancy Banks-Smith [...] in a review {{of the first}} series of the UK version of Big Brother for The Guardian in 2000, a theme she later expounded upon in 2003, writing that the play [...] "foretold the reality show and, in the scramble for greater sensation, its logical outcome". Banks-Smith had long been an admirer of The Year of the Sex Olympics, having written in The Sun following its original broadcast in 1968: [...] "Quite apart from the excellent script and the 'big big' treatment, the play radiated ripples. Is television a substitute for living? Does the spectacle of pain at a distance atrophy sympathy? Can this coffin with knobs on furnish all we need to ask?". Another admirer, the writer and actor Mark Gatiss, has said that upon seeing Big Brother he yelled at the television, [...] "Don't they know what they're doing? [...] It's The Year of the Sex Olympics! Nigel Kneale was right!". When The Year of the Sex Olympics was repeated on BBC Four on 22 May 2003, Paul Hoggart in The Times noted that [...] "in many respects Kneale <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> money [...] when you consider that nothing gets contemporary reality show audiences more excited than an emotional train-wreck on live TV".|$|E
500|$|The light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group {{were the}} first German ships visible to Evan-Thomas's ships and Barham opened fire on them at 15:58 until the cruisers {{disappeared}} into their own smoke screen at around 16:05.

The impact <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> joints between several armour plates and drove them inwards and destroyed part of the hull behind them. The damage allowed over [...] of water to flood the stern and nearly knocked out the ship's steering gear. Between them, Barham and Valiant hit Moltke four times from 16:16 to 16:26, but only one of those hits {{can be attributed to}} Valiant. Two of the others detonated upon striking the waterline armour, but failed to penetrate. The impacts drove in the plates and fragments caused much flooding by damaging the surrounding structure. The last shell passed {{all the way through the}} ship without detonating; it struck and dislodged a [...] armour plate on the waterline on the other side of the ship that caused also some flooding. Barham was herself was struck twice during the [...] "Run to the South": the first was a [...] shell from von der Tann that failed to do any damage when it hit the waterline armour and the battlecruiser [...] fired a [...] shell that detonated in the aft superstructure. This sent splinters in every direction and started a small fire, but otherwise did no significant damage.|$|E

Judah had reclaimed the IBF title two months earlier against Kaizer Mabuza. Khan was unhappy that a fight with Bradley could not be made. He said, [...] "Bradley was the guy I wanted to fight but he chickened out. I offered him 50% of UK revenue, which is unheard of, and 50% of all revenue in America, that's how much I wanted to fight him, but he didn't want it." [...] The fight was broadcast on Primetime in UK and HBO in USA. Khan started the fight with a left jab. Round 1 saw a busy Amir Khan as he fought from the outside and kept Judah away with jabs and straights. All four rounds were taken by Khan. Ultimately on the fifth round Zab was taken down with a right uppercut to the body, in which at first commentators believed it was a low blow, since Judah was showing signs of agonising pain, {{but when it was}} seen from a different camera angle, it <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> belt, leading to an 18th knockout for Khan in his career so far. Khan later rejected claims for the low blow saying, [...] "He went down. It was above the belt. Zab's a great fighter. I respect him a lot. But it was nowhere near below [...] It was a great shot." [...] Over 5 rounds, Khan landed 61 of 284 total punches (21%) and Judah landed 20 of 115 (17%). For the fight, Khan earned $1,072,500 and Judah had a $500,000 purse. The fight averaged 1.4 million viewers on HBO.|$|E
