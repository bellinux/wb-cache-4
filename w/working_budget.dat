It {{was part of}} a plan to bring in revenue for the school, as it had proved to be very successful. The work was to be donated as a gift to the school, and it was to join an expanding collection of African-American art, including a large group of paintings by Washington abstractionist Sam Gilliam and works by Elizabeth Catlett, Romare Bearden, Alma Thomas, Hale Woodruff, Jacob Lawrence and Lois Mailou Jones, among others. These - along with works by a group of local white Color Field painters and some white UDC faculty members also in the university collections - were to become the core of what was presented in early 1990 as a ground-breaking multicultural art center, a hopeful coalition between artists of color, feminists and other artists depicting the struggle for freedom and human equality. Judy Chicago donated the Dinner Party with the understanding that one of the school's buildings would be repaired to house it.

The following year, the festival's attendance more than doubled, owing, according to Fringe officials, to better marketing and the 68 shows at that years festival, an increase from previous years. In 2000, the Fringe won a $10,000 grant from the McKnight Foundation and once more expanded, to 80 shows.

40|$|Advancements in {{construction}} project management have necessitated a comprehensive rethink of construction project processes. Gantt charts and {{critical path analysis}} have been produced to create {{a work breakdown structure}} which can identify challenges and crucial infrastructure development activities which can have an adverse impact on the project. However, they do not improve the construction process. Integration Definition Language 0 (IDEF 0) models present an opportunity for construction project managers to identify essential workflows during construction and improve them. The improvement process is continuous. Hence, kaizen, which is part of lean construction, can be implemented. This study demonstrated the use of IDEF 0 in a building construction project in Nigeria where the construction companies have issues with cost, overruns, low competitive advantage and unsatisfied clients. The build up to the challenges identified post-contract cost controlling techniques as an important variable in establishing the challenges above in the construction industry. With the aid of Kendall's coefficient of concordance, the analysis was carried out to determine the techniques which are most important and effective in managing construction costs during the execution phase. Monitoring building material cost was identified {{to be the most important}} technique. The recognised significant and effective techniques were used to build a continuous improvement model with accompanied drivers such as the <b>working</b> <b>budget</b> and monitoring of overheads. The output of the findings was presented in an IDEF 0 model with some written guidelines.
