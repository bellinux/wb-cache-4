5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed {{south of the}} Gulf of Tehuantepec on September23. Steered by a deep layer high over Mexico, the disturbance moved <b>west</b> <b>for</b> four days before attaining tropical depression status. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone the depression was situated over warm waters; however, wind shear subsequently increased {{in the vicinity of}} the storm. Therefore, significant development was impeded as the depression curved back to the north along an adjacent upper-level low.|$|E

5|$|As {{previously}} planned, {{most of the}} Texians {{fell back}} to the barracks and the chapel. Holes had been carved in the walls to allow the Texians to fire. Unable to reach the barracks, Texians stationed along the west wall headed <b>west</b> <b>for</b> the San Antonio River. When the cavalry charged, the Texians took cover and began firing from a ditch. Sesma was forced to send reinforcements, and the Texians were eventually killed. Sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50Texians, but Edmondson believes that number was inflated.|$|E
5|$|Aylmer Road is a {{very short}} stretch of road, running <b>west</b> <b>for</b> {{less than half a}} mile between the {{junction}} with the A1000 in Haringey to the junction with The Bishops Avenue in Barnet. The entire southern side of the road is taken up by Highgate Golf Course, while the northern side is a mixture of small shops, flats and allotments. The road is named for General Sir Fenton John Aylmer, VC KCB, who received the Victoria Cross for his part in the assault on Nilt Fort on 2 December 1891.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{finishing}} as the NHL's top-scoring team, the Canucks {{entered the}} 2002 playoffs as the eighth {{seed in the}} <b>West</b> <b>for</b> the second consecutive season. Facing the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round, they were eliminated in six games. Morrison notched two assists during the series. After initially failing {{to come to terms}} on a new contract with the Canucks in the off-season, Morrison filed for arbitration. He won his hearing and was awarded a two-year, US$4.6 million contract on August 3, 2002, more than doubling his previous year's salary of US$775,000.|$|E

5|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries {{the castle}} {{continued}} to be maintained and modified; the seaward half of the castle {{was turned into a}} solid gun platform and additional accommodation was built for the fort's gunners. A bulwark was built {{on the east side of}} the castle and an additional gun battery was placed on the town's quay, just to the <b>west.</b> <b>For</b> most of the English Civil War of the 1640s it was held by Parliament; following the Restoration, it was refortified by Charles II in the 1670s.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, and {{particularly}} in the late 1950s, the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China adopted a strategy of destabilisation of Western powers by disruption of their hold on African colonies. Nikita Khrushchev, in particular, viewed the 'underdeveloped third of mankind' as a means to weaken the <b>West.</b> <b>For</b> the Soviets, Africa represented a chance to create a rift between western powers and their colonial assets, and create pro-communist states in Africa with which to foster future relations.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the true}} {{second wave of}} {{immigration}} did not begin until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 abolished national origins quotas. After the passage of that act, Armenians from the Soviet Union, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran and other Middle Eastern countries began migrating in large numbers, many fleeing political instability in their host countries. In the 1950s, most Armenian immigrants in the US were from Soviet Armenia and Turkey. The Istanbul pogrom in 1955 frightened the local Turkish Armenian population, which looked to the <b>West</b> <b>for</b> a safe and more prosperous life.|$|E

In addition, Joyce moved south of <b>west</b> <b>for</b> a time at a location where it is rare for tropical cyclones to do so.|$|E
5|$|The Avery Homestead {{is located}} {{on the west side of}} Ledyard, Connecticut and faces south on Avery Hill Road. The house overlooks 100 acres (40.46 hectares) of stone-walled pasture land that extends south to Stoddards Wharf Road. The two-story house has a shed to the {{immediate}} east and a two-story barn to the southeast. Past the barn is a farm pond that is located in a small valley formed by Billings-Avery Brook.

5|$|The Byzantine {{emperors}} {{appealed to}} the <b>West</b> <b>for</b> help, but the Pope would only consider sending aid {{in return for a}} reunion of the Eastern Orthodox Church with the See of Rome. Church unity was considered, and occasionally accomplished by imperial decree, but the Orthodox citizenry and clergy intensely resented the authority of Rome and the Latin Rite. Some Western troops arrived to bolster the Christian defence of Constantinople, but most Western rulers, distracted by their own affairs, did nothing as the Ottomans picked apart the remaining Byzantine territories.|$|E

5|$|After the 1953 armistice, {{the defense}} of the Korean Demilitarized Zone was handled by the South Korean and American armies.

In 1971, under Nixon's détente policy, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, leaving the 2nd Infantry Division as the only US Army unit in Korea.
