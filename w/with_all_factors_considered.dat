40|$|Organic farming {{has often}} been {{suggested}} {{as a way of}} increasing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, but literature reports a variable success. The drivers in play are multi-factorial and include the particular species groups under consideration, the precise form of organic management, the landscape structural and management context, the area and scale considered, and the historical context. Here ALMaSS, a comprehensive agent-based model simulation system, was used to produce an assessment of the impact of organic and conventional farm types, landscape structure, and management context for six common agricultural wildlife species. ALMaSS outputs can be expressed as a simple index of relative change in abundance and distribution, allowing easy comparison between scenarios. Results indicate that organic farming generally had a beneficial effect, but the degree was variable <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>factors</b> <b>considered</b> and there were strong interactions between factors. Targeted managements provided much greater impacts than changes in farm types. Predictions of biodiversity impacts depended on precise inputs, underlying both the view of this system as being complex, and the necessity for detailed knowledge. However, this combination of detailed modelling platform with a simple index of impact provides an easily interpreted method for objective evaluation of impacts of potential policy scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsTed C. SchroederThe {{beef cattle}} {{industry}} {{is one of}} the last industries in production agriculture that is not heavily integrated. Therefore each segment of the industry is constantly looking for opportunities to increase the value of their cattle. In recent years, one of those opportunities available to cow-calf producers was verification of certain production practices (i. e. Age and Source, Natural, and Non-Hormone Treated). The value flows from the consumer to the cow-calf producer. The packers need these verified cattle to fill export contracts therefore they are willing to pay a premium for these types of cattle. The objective of the thesis was to determine the value of a Health Verified Program (HPV) to feedlot operators. HPV is not required to export beef like other verified programs, but it does verify the procedures that a group of calves has received from the previous owner. Since the feedlot is a deciding factor of value for HPV, feedlot managers were asked from across the United States not only what value they place on HPV but other questions that could be beneficial to others involved in the beef cattle industry. Regression models were used along with a correlation analysis to determine value. There is value to a health verified program along with other procedures that are available to cow-calf producers. Individual producers need to determine which verifications and procedures are economical and efficient for their individual operations <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>factors</b> <b>considered...</b>|$|E

40|$|Centroid {{depth of}} {{earthquakes}} {{is essential for}} seismic hazard mitigation. But, various studies provided different solutions for the centroid depth of the damaging 2013 Lushan earthquake, thus hindering further studies of the earthquake processes. To resolve its centroid depth and assess the uncertainties, we apply the teleseismic cut and paste method to invert for centroid depth with teleseismic body waves in the epicentral distance of 30 °– 90 °. We performed the inversion for P waves only as well the case of both P and SH waves and found that both cases lead to depth solutions with difference less than 0. 5 km. We also investigated the effects on depth inversion from azimuth gap of seismic stations, source duration, and corner frequency of filter. These various tests show that even azimuthal distribution of seismic stations is helpful for accurate depth inversion. It is also found that estimate of centroid depth is sensitive to source duration. Moreover, the depth is biased to larger values when corner frequency of low-pass filter is very low. The uncertainty in the velocity model can also generate some error in the depth estimation (~ 1. 0 km). <b>With</b> <b>all</b> the above <b>factors</b> <b>considered,</b> the centroid depth of Lushan earthquake is proposed to be around 12 km, with uncertainty about 2 km...|$|R

In 2004 the Hospital Infection Society was asked to conduct a third national prevalence survey, which included England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. A similar but not identical survey was carried out in Scotland. Data were collected on standardised forms using Centres for Disease Control and Prevention definitions. This report considers associations {{with a wide range of}} risk <b>factors</b> for <b>all</b> HCAI and for four main categories. The overall prevalence rate of HCAI was 7. 6 % and increased significantly <b>with</b> age. <b>All</b> risk <b>factors</b> <b>considered</b> were associated with highly significantly increased risk of HCAI, except recent peripheral IV catheter and other bladder instrumentation use. Primary bloodstream infection (PBSI) was associated with antibiotic, central intravenous catheter and parenteral nutrition use. Pneumonia was associated with antibiotic, central catheter, parenteral nutrition use, mechanical ventilation and current peripheral catheter use. Surgical site infection was associated with recent surgery, antibiotic and central catheter use, mechanical ventilation and parenteral nutrition. Urinary instrumentation and antibiotic use were associated with urinary tract infection. Patients under a critical care medicine consultant had the highest prevalence of HCAI (23. 2 %). This report highlights those areas requiring attention to prevent HCAI, i. e. device-related infections such as PBSI (e. g. central catheters) and pneumonia (e. g. mechanical ventilation) and should influence protocols for future prevalence surveys of HCAI, e. g. the recording of risk factors at the time of assessment only is sufficient...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the coverage of selected newspapers in relation to this war from its beginning in 1934 to its end in 1941. The publications selected for study include: the New York Times, the Chicago Daily Tribune, the Christian Science Monitor, the Los Angeles Times, and the London Times. The newspapers were chosen as being representative of the region known as the ???Western world???, and also on the reputation of the newspapers and their perceived influence on the ???West???. The analysis of the press coverage is divided into four different periods in the war. The first section covers the smaller but critical incidents of 1934. The second section looks at follow-up coverage of the incidents of 1935, which built the bridge leading to the war of 1936. The third section presents an analysis of the ???real war??? of 1936, which caused Ethiopia???s defeat. The final section captures the highlights of the Ethiopian comeback and victory of 1941. The study found many factors. Among these are: (1) an increase in the space allotment that the newspapers provided as the war continued; (2) the pattern of continuity that the newspapers followed in presenting the story; (3) generally favorable placement of stories; (4) use of illustrations such as maps, drawings and photos; (5) the use of lengthy stories to narrate the different events; and, (6) the positive impact on Haile Selassie's world image. There were also some weak points discovered in the coverage. Most of the newspapers did not provide sufficient background to their articles to make the news understandable to their readers. The use of language, particularly in one newspaper in the study, was not justifiable in terms of fairness. And, most of all, objectivity and balance in the reporting was considerably handicapped by government censorship and restrictions, language problems, transportation shortages, and inadequate communication systems. The study indicates, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>factors</b> <b>considered,</b> that these papers did a reasonably fair job in bringing the news surrounding this war to the ???Western world???...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Individuals in {{the soft}} white wheat {{industry}} in the Pacific Northwest are looking for new marketing tools which will be helpful for their operations and reduce some of their risk. During the past 18 - 24 months their interest has centered on the commodity futures market, where {{they would like to}} see a wheat futures contract established that would offer adequate hedging potential for the Pacific Northwest. Two conferences have been sponsored (May 25, 1971 and July 7, 1971) at the Dalles, Oregon, by the Oregon Wheat Growers League to discuss this topic. For an objective analysis of the desire and need for such a futures contract and of its potential for success, data on supply, demand, and prices were helpful but not entirely adequate. An industry questionnaire similar to the questionnaire technique (Delphi) developed by RAND corporation for forecasting future technological changes was used. The results were two-fold. Other than just forecasting technology and target dates, the Delphi technique probed opinions and attitudes of the industry. It was determined that the demand for soft white wheat is changing. Some countries are reducing their demand while other countries are expanding their demand. Also present is the possibility of creating new markets. With this uncertainty present in the demand for soft white wheat, along with the advent of increased risk as a result of expansion in operation size, the industry panel indicated a desire and need for a futures contract appropriate for their industry. With soft white wheat fulfilling the characteristics traditionally thought necessary for a market and its commodity to succeed as a futures contract, all that remains is attracting the proper interest, both commercially and speculative; and providing a contract with terms favorable to both the industry and the speculator. Close coordination between the soft white wheat industry and the Chicago Board of Trade should lead into good contract conditions. Commercial interest does exist but the hedger will have to be educated on the use of the futures contract. Deciding when to get into the market, deciding whether to buy or sell, is just a start. It requires time to watch the market, manage its use, and integrate it into one's operation. With this accomplished, speculative interest should be attracted. The attributes often cited as necessary for successful futures trading are not necessarily required for a successful futures market. The number of characteristics a market and its commodity has will not guarantee its success, and if any characteristics are lacking, does not mean assured failure. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>factors</b> <b>considered,</b> soft white wheat does seem to have as much potential of being successfully traded as any commodity now traded...|$|E

40|$|The AgraPure Mississippi Biomass {{project was}} a congressionally {{directed}} project, initiated {{to study the}} utilization of Mississippi agricultural byproducts and waste products {{in the production of}} bio-energy and to determine the feasibility of commercialization of these agricultural byproducts and waste products as feedstocks in the production of energy. The final products from this project were two business plans; one for a Thermal plant, and one for a Biodiesel/Ethanol plant. Agricultural waste fired steam and electrical generating plants and biodiesel plants were deemed the best prospects for developing commercially viable industries. Additionally, oil extraction methods were studied, both traditional and two novel techniques, and incorporated into the development plans. Mississippi produced crop and animal waste biomasses were analyzed for use as raw materials for both industries. The relevant factors, availability, costs, transportation, storage, location, and energetic value criteria were considered. Since feedstock accounts for more than 70 percent of the total cost of producing biodiesel, any local advantages are considered extremely important in developing this particular industry. The same factors must be evaluated in assessing the prospects of commercial operation of a steam and electrical generation plant. Additionally, the access to the markets for electricity is more limited, regulated and tightly controlled than the liquid fuel markets. Domestically produced biofuels, both biodiesel and ethanol, are gaining more attention and popularity with the consuming public as prices rise and supplies of foreign crude become less secure. Biodiesel requires no major modifications to existing diesel engines or supply chain and offers significant environmental benefits. Currently the biodiesel industry requires Federal and State incentives to allow the industry to develop and become self-sustaining. Mississippi has available the necessary feedstocks and is geographically located to be able to service a regional market. Other states have active incentive programs to promote the industry. Mississippi has adopted an incentive program for ethanol and biodiesel; however, the State legislature has not funded this program, leaving Mississippi at a disadvantage when compared to other states in developing the bio-based liquid fuel industry. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> relevant <b>factors</b> being <b>considered,</b> Mississippi offers several advantages to developing the biodiesel industry. As a result of AgraPure's work and plan development, a private investor group has built a 7, 000 gallon per day facility in central Mississippi with plans to build a 10 million gallon per year biodiesel facility. The development of a thermochemical conversion/generation facility requires a much larger financial commitment, making a longer operational time necessary to recover the capital invested. Without a renewable portfolio standard to put a floor under the price, or the existence of a suitable steam host, the venture is not economically viable. And so, it has not met with the success of the biodiesel plan. While the necessary components regarding feedstocks, location, permitting and technology are all favorable; the market is not currently favorable for the development of this type of project. In this region there is an abundance of energy generation capacity. Without subsidies or a Mississippi renewable portfolio standard requiring the renewable energy to be produced from Mississippi raw materials, which are not available for the alternative energy source selected by AgraPure, this facility is not economically viable...|$|R
