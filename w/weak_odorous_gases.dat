40|$|In this study, methyl {{mercaptan}} (CH 3 SH) gas {{was used}} to prepare synthetic <b>odorous</b> <b>gases,</b> and a photocatalytic wet scrubbing process as a new approach was developed for treating such <b>odorous</b> <b>gases.</b> In this process, gaseous CH 3 SH is first absorbed by the solution, and the dissolved CH 3 SH/CH 3 S - is then adsorbed onto the solid surface of TiO 2 particles and oxidized under UV illumination in the aqueous phase. Experiments were conducted under different reaction conditions of CH 3 SH loading, TiO 2 dosage, and pH. The reaction kinetics of CH 3 SH reduction indicates that the pH of the reaction solution greatly influences the rate of CH 3 SH absorption by the solution. At pH 11. 5, the photoreaction becomes the RDS in such a system. The experiments demonstrated that the efficiency of CH 3 SH degradation determined by two methyl mercaptan sensors and the ratio of odor removal determined by olfactometry measurements can be well maintained at high levels of > 95 % for a CH 3 SH loading of 10 g m - 3 h - 1. The main intermediates and final products from CH 3 SH degradation were identified by GC/MS and ion chromatography, and a pathway for CH 3 SH degradation with three routes is proposed and discussed.

Hydrogen sulfide {{is one of the major}} <b>odorous</b> <b>gases</b> present in the waste emissions coming from municipal wastewater treatment facilities. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is odorous, highly toxic and flammable. Exposure to lower concentrations can result in eye irritation, a sore throat and cough, shortness of breath, and fluid in the lungs. Biofiltration has become a widely accepted technology for treating air streams containing H 2 S. When compared with other nonbiological technologies, biofilter is more cost-effective for treating large volumes of air containing low concentrations of biodegradable compounds. Optimization of biofilter media is essential for many reasons such as: providing a higher surface area for biofilm growth, low pressure drop, physical stability, and good moisture retention. In this work, a novel biofilter media is developed and tested at a pumping station of a municipality located in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

TSIFT analysis showed an overall decrease in the concentration of terpenes, and sulphurous compounds in the outlet gas from the column for both bulk densities. No significant trend could be identified for the concentrations at different depths within the column. Results show the ability of compost to reduce landfill odours under differing conditions. The inconclusive data provided by TSIFT analysis {{may be due to the}} analysis of compounds that are not contributing to odour, and thus highlights the potential for synergetic effects and the importance of sensory measurement when examining odorous emissio...|$|R
40|$|Odorous {{volatile}} organic compounds emissions from fried-food industries posed severed pollution problems both to the workers and the surrounding inhabitants. These industries need to look for cost effective and efficient methods to reduce these emitted gases.   Several solutions {{such as the use}} of centrifugation, scrubbers, ion exchangers, biofiltration, condensation, adsorption, absorption, and incineration have been exploited to reduce these smelling gases. Centriair in collaboration with KTH aim at using UV light in combination with ozone and hydrogen peroxide to degrade these odorous VOCs emitted from the frying of meat balls (SCAN) and chips. Several {{volatile organic}} compounds which are odorants with low threshold values were identified in the emitted gases from meat frying which includes: aldehydes, sulphur containing compounds, ketones, pyrazines, and alcohols. The type and concentration of these odorants emitted depends among other things primarily on the type of oil used during the frying process.   This work focuses on the use of advanced oxidation processes to abate theses <b>odorous</b> <b>gases.</b> The effect of UV dosage and the use of hydrogen peroxide were tested in a flow reactor. Ozone producing UV lamps were used for the treatment of 2, 4 -decadienal, Hexanal, furfural, and 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine. A simultaneous chemical and odour analysis was done using a GC/MS Olfactometry system. UV/Ozone/H 2 O 2 was effective in reducing the {{volatile organic compounds}} tested thus reducing the odor concentration. The percent removal was proportional to the energy dosage...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{pilot plant}} for the {{treatment}} of Sulphur-based <b>odorous</b> <b>gases</b> was installed in a line of a phosphoric acid plant located in Skhira, Tunisia. The air pollution control system train consisted of a first stage, including a chemical scrubber operating with an alkaline solution containing caustic soda, followed by a two-stage biotrickling filter (BTF) filled with Mytilus edulis shells. This study evaluated the performance of the dual-stage BTF in removing hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S), sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and dimethyl sulphide (DMS) from the phosphoric acid reactor's exhaust air current. Concentrations of H 2 S, SO 2 and DMS at the inlet of the two-stage BTF were 10 - 30 ppm, < 1 - 20 ppm and 16 - 30 ppm, respectively. All of the respective concentrations at the outlet of the biological step were < 1 ppm, except for the H 2 S in the outlet during the first day of operation (10 ppm). Removal efficiencies were generally higher than 95 % for all compounds, and remained high even with an increase of the off-gas flow rate. Mass-removal capacity was at least 2. 0 g m- 3 h- 1, 0. 5 g m- 3 h- 1 and 6. 2 g m- 3 h- 1, for H 2 S, SO 2 and DMS, respectively. The removal efficiencies of the process were satisfactory, especially considering the already low inlet concentrations, due to the high quality of the raw phosphate used...|$|R
40|$|Comprehensive {{control of}} odors, {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H 2 S), ammonia (NH 3), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with swine production {{is a critical}} need. A pilot-scale experiment was conducted to evaluate surface-applied soybean peroxidase (SBP) and calcium peroxide (CaO 2) as a manure additive to mitigate emissions of odorous volatile organic compounds (VOC) including dimethyl disulfide/methanethiol (DMDS/MT), dimethyl trisulfide, n-butyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, p-cresol, indole, and skatole. The secondary impact on emissions of NH 3, H 2 S, and GHG was also measured. The SBP was tested at four treatments (2. 28 – 45. 7 kg/m 2 manure) with CaO 2 (4. 2 % by weight of SBP) over 137 days. Significant reductions in VOC emissions were observed: DMDS/MT (36. 2 %– 84. 7 %), p-cresol (53. 1 %– 89. 5 %), and skatole (63. 2 %– 92. 5 %). There was a corresponding significant reduction in NH 3 (14. 6 %– 67. 6 %), and significant increases in the greenhouse gases CH 4 (32. 7 %– 232 %) and CO 2 (20. 8 %– 124 %). The remaining emissions (including N 2 O) were not statistically different. At a cost relative to 0. 8 % of a marketed hog it appears that SBP/CaO 2 treatment could be a promising option at the lowest (2. 28 kg/m 2) treatment rate for reducing <b>odorous</b> <b>gas</b> and NH 3 emissions at swine operations, and field-scale testing is warranted...|$|R
30|$|The {{co-culture}} of E. coli {{in human}} whole blood emitted appreciable amounts of dimethyl sulfide {{when compared to the}} level from naive E. coli in the LB broth (Figure  1 A). Dimethyl sulfide is a sulfur-containing <b>odorous</b> <b>gas</b> known to be released from marine phytoplankton and algae, and its release has been reported to protect algae and phytoplankton against environmental changes in salinity, radiation, and temperature [20, 21]. Dimethyl sulfide released from damaged phytoplankton has also been proposed to act as a deterrent, or chemical weapon, against consumption by zooplankton [22]. In addition, it has been proposed that some microorganisms are able to generate gaseous dimethyl sulfide from dimethylsulphoniopropionate [23 – 25]. A significant concentration of dimethyl sulfide was observed in the headspace of E. coli-inoculated whole blood, whereas the headspace of E. coli in LB broth contained much less dimethyl sulfide (Figure  1 A). This is the first observation that E. coli-inoculated {{human whole blood}} produces dimethyl sulfide. Allardyce and colleagues reported that dimethyl sulfide was detected from E. coli culture using BacT/ALERT, which contains a mixture of media with blood [8, 26]. It is interesting to speculate the possible roles for dimethyl sulfide. Considering that dimethyl sulfide is a cryoprotectant for algae, dimethyl sulfide could be a mediator of survival of blood cells in response to the stresses of bacterial infection or the response of E. coli {{in the face of the}} bactericidal components of whole blood. Other studies utilizing different media/broth to culture E. coli did not observe dimethyl sulfide in the headspace above the culture [9, 13].|$|R
40|$|Odour {{control in}} Hong Kong has been {{addressed}} {{as an important}} issue by the authorities, since odour pollution is generated from many sources including wastewater treatment plants. Although a number of existing technologies are available for odour abatement and control, biological technique is still more attractive due to its low operating cost and ease of maintenance. A newly innovated fibrous bed bioreactor with twin columns was specially designed and constructed in our laboratory, in which an inner column was centred in an outer column. The bioreactor was fully filled with water in order to absorb the odorous components from foul gas and also contained both suspended and attached biomass to degrade the absorbed odorous pollutants. In this study, hydrogen sulphide (H?S) and butyric acid (C?H?O?) were used as odorous components and successfully removed from synthetic foul gases. Many factors affecting the H?S and butyric acid removal efficiency and maximum elimination capacity, such as pH of water solution, gas flow rate and its fluctuation, and sulphate content in solution have been studied. The experimental results demonstrated that the reduction rates of 97. 8 % for H 2 S and 99. 9 % for butyric acid were achieved in this experimental condition. It is proved that this bioreactor was a compact <b>odorous</b> <b>gas</b> treatment system with an application potential for treating foul air with high odour strength and low airflow rate such as the offensive gases from sludge treatment processes in a wastewater treatment plant.

40|$|The reingestion {{of toxic}} or <b>odorous</b> <b>gases</b> {{exhausted}} from rooftop stacks {{may be a}} cause of indoor air quality problems of a building. In order to avoid such problems, certain precautions should be taken during the design period. One of the current engineering practices is to evaluate the exhaust dispersion using ASHRAE dispersion models. As another alternative, a wind tunnel study {{can be carried out}} to predict peak concentrations at critical locations. However, neither ASHRAE models nor wind tunnel modeling have been thoroughly validated with full-scale data. For the purpose of evaluating empirical formulas and wind tunnel modeling techniques, four field tests {{on the roof of the}} Hall Building of Concordia University and a wind tunnel study have been carried out. The influence of various parameters on the dispersion process were investigated. These included the exhaust momentum ratio, stack location, stack height and building shape. Flow visualization was performed as well to determine the flow pattern around buildings. Several results were drawn from the current study: (1) the ASHRAE models generally provide reasonable prediction of minimum dilution (Dmin) with some notable exceptions. (2) In general, wind tunnel results compared well with the full-scale data; however, for receptors close to the stack, the wind tunnel overestimates Dmin. (3) Both wind tunnel and field results indicate that Dmin is significantly affected by the exhaust momentum ratio (M); wind tunnel tests with the isolated building do not show this dependence on M. (4) Roof level concentration can be reduced by increasing the stack height. (5) Building shape has a considerable influence on rooftop flow patterns...|$|R
