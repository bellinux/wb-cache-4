40|$|ObjectivesThis {{analysis}} described Latino migrant farmworkers' <b>work</b> safety <b>climate</b> and {{its association}} with musculoskeletal discomfort, working while injured or ill, and depressive symptoms. MethodsData were from a cross-sectional survey of 300 farmworkers conducted in North Carolina in 2009. Generalized estimating equations models were used to investigate the association of <b>work</b> safety <b>climate</b> with health and safety outcomes. ResultFarmworkers perceived their <b>work</b> safety <b>climate</b> to be poor. About 40 % had elevated musculoskeletal discomfort, 5. 0 % had worked at least 1 day while injured or ill, and 27. 9 % had elevated depressive symptoms. The odds of elevated musculoskeletal discomfort were 12 % lower and the odds of working while injured or ill were 15 % lower with each 1 -unit increase in the <b>work</b> safety <b>climate.</b> <b>Work</b> safety <b>climate</b> {{was not associated with}} depressive symptoms. ConclusionsWork safety climate was important for agricultural workers. Poor <b>work</b> safety <b>climate</b> was associated with health outcomes (musculoskeletal discomfort) and safety (working while injured or ill). Interventions to improve <b>work</b> safety <b>climate</b> in agriculture are needed, with these interventions being directed to employers and workers.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to test the mediating role of work satisfaction {{in the relationship between}} <b>work</b> unit <b>climate</b> and labour productivity. Two <b>work</b> unit <b>climate</b> facets are examined: goals and service orientation. Longitudinal data obtained from more than 14, 000 employees in 171 branches of a financial services organization provided no evidence for work satisfaction as a mediator of the relationship between <b>work</b> unit <b>climate</b> and productivity. An increase in service orientation and an increase in goals orientation are both associated with an increase in work satisfaction. An increase in work satisfaction is not associated with an increase in productivity, thereby precluding a mediation effect. An increase in service orientation is related to increased labour productivity, but an increase in goals orientation is not. In addition, relationships across time are reported and interpreted. In this study no evidence was found for work satisfaction as an intermediary mechanism, however, results highlight the importance of differential effects of the two <b>work</b> unit <b>climate</b> facets on <b>work</b> satisfaction and labour productivity.

As {{participants in this study}} continue through adult life, the research focuses on inequalities in health and functioning in an aging population. With an increasingly large population of older citizens in the UK, there is an urgent need to identify the causes of social inequalities and to study the long-term effects of previous circumstances on people’s ability to function and stay healthy during retirement. Researchers in the Whitehall II team are also considering the role of social inequalities in relation to dementia risk.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} attends to a {{broad range}} of practically significant employee achievement goals and provides insight into how to enhance individual-level performance by examining the antecedents to individual-level state goal orientation in organizational work groups. State goal orientation is defined here as a temporary achievement goal, and it is theorized that leadership and <b>work</b> group <b>climate</b> processes parallel each dimension of state goal orientation to cue and ultimately induce the corresponding achievement goal among individual work group members. The leader's achievement priority is argued to drive the formation of <b>work</b> group <b>climate</b> consistent with this priority. The resulting <b>work</b> group <b>climate</b> signals and compels group members to adopt the ascribed form of state goal orientation. The quality of the leader-member exchange (LMX) relationship is viewed as a means to internalize cues from the <b>work</b> group <b>climate</b> in the emergence of state goal orientation. Results from experimental and field studies provide evidence that (1) leadership and climate perceptions are related to their parallel form of state goal orientation, (2) the relation between individual perceptions of a climate for learning and state learning goal orientation is stronger when group members enjoy higher quality exchange relationships with their leader, and (3) state goal orientation may be validly and reliably assessed using the measure created especially for this research...|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} between agreeableness and job satisfaction is most apparent in exchange-oriented or transactional work environments. When {{workers who are}} low in agreeableness are satisfied with their work environment and those {{they are required to}} interact with, they are likely to engage in prosocial organizational citizenship behaviors. Low-agreeable workers are likely to disengage in such behaviors when they find the work environment less favourable. Highly agreeable workers, on the other hand, are likely to engage in prosocial organizational citizenship behaviors regardless of the <b>work</b> <b>climate,</b> environment, or disposition of others they are required to work with, since they tend to focus more on the needs of others and the organization as opposed to keeping track of transactions. Further, deviant behavior is higher among workers low in agreeableness, particularly when organizational support is low.|$|E
5000|$|Karl Marx took an {{interest}} in Fraas's work, writing to Engels on 25 March 1868 that he found Fraas's 1847 <b>work</b> <b>Climate</b> and the Vegetable World throughout the Ages, a History of Both [...] "very interesting, especially as proving that climate and flora have changed in historic times". Marx calls Fraas [...] "a Darwinist before Darwin" [...] and goes on to say: This man is both a thoroughly learned philologist (he has written books in Greek) and a chemist, agricultural expert, etc. The whole conclusion is that cultivation when it progresses in a primitive way and is not consciously controlled (as a bourgeois of course he does not arrive at this), leaves deserts behind it, Persia, Mesopotamia, etc., Greece. Here again another unconscious socialist tendency! These references to Fraas are of interest to recent scholars of Marx's ecological ideas.|$|E
50|$|Skill variety has {{the strongest}} {{relationship}} with internal work motivation. Jobs that allow workers {{to use a}} variety of skills increase workers’ internal work motivation. If teleworkers are limited in teamwork opportunities and have fewer opportunities to {{use a variety of}} skills, they may have lower internal motivation towards their work. Also, perceived social isolation can lead to less motivation. It can be argued that without a <b>work</b> <b>climate</b> or manager nearby, the ability to motivate oneself is even more important when telecommuting than when working in an office. Though working in an office has its distractions, it is often argued that telecommuting involves even greater distractions. According to one study, children are ranked as the number one distractions, followed by spouses, pets, neighbors, and solicitors. The lack of proper tools and facilities also serves as a major distraction, though this can be mitigated by using short-term coworking rental facilities.|$|E
