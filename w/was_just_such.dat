25|$|This {{idea was}} made more precise by Leonard Susskind, {{who had also}} been {{developing}} holography, largely independently. Susskind argued that the oscillation of the horizon {{of a black hole}} is a complete description of both the infalling and outgoing matter, because the world-sheet theory of string theory <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a holographic description. While short strings have zero entropy, he could identify long highly excited string states with ordinary black holes. This was a deep advance because it revealed that strings have a classical interpretation in terms of black holes.|$|E
25|$|American chemist Harold Urey, {{who founded}} cosmochemistry, {{put forward a}} {{scenario}} in 1951, 1952, 1956, and 1966 based largely on meteorites and using Chandrasekhar's stability equations and obtained density distribution in the gas and dust disk surrounding the primitive Sun. In order that volatile elements like mercury could be retained by the terrestrial planets he postulated a moderately thick gas and dust halo shielding the planets from the Sun. In order to form diamonds, pure carbon crystals, Moon-size objects, gas spheres that became gravitationally unstable, would have to form in the disk with the gas and dust dissipating at a later stage. Pressure fell as gas was lost and diamonds were converted to graphite, while the gas became illuminated by the Sun. Under these conditions considerable ionization would be present and the gas would be accelerated by magnetic fields, hence the angular momentum could be transferred from the Sun. He postulated that these lunar-size bodies were destroyed by collisions, with the gas dissipating, leaving behind solids collected at the core, with the resulting smaller fragments pushed far out into space and the larger fragments staying behind and accreting into planets. He suggested the Moon <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a surviving core.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the Wizard of Oz references, Underwood {{commented that}} [...] "it {{was all about}} having subtle references," [...] such as the plaid shirt and red shoes she wore on the video. When asked if her aim was to {{generate}} controversy with the storyline, the singer {{said that it was}} not what she were aiming for at all, adding: [...] "I try to stay away from controversy in any form or fashion. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a great story and such a mini-movie, listening to the song, and we really wanted to do it justice in the video." ...|$|E

500|$|Five singles were {{released}} from the album, including Madonna's first US number-one [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and her first UK number-one [...] "Into the Groove". To promote the album, she embarked on The Virgin Tour, which had shows in cities of North America only. Like a Virgin has attained significance as a cultural artifact of the 1980s. Madonna proved {{that she was not}} a one-hit wonder and was able to provide herself with a permanent footing in the music world. Her songs became a lightning rod for both criticism by conservatives and imitation by the younger female population, especially [...] "Material Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin". According to author J. Randy Taraborrelli, [...] "Every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes the artist's magic moment; for Madonna, Like a Virgin <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a defining moment." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{company was}} {{depicted}} as based in New York City, with branches in smaller Northeastern cities. Episodes {{are set in}} the Scranton branch, but other branches have been mentioned and seen. The now-closed Stamford, Connecticut, branch was seen when Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) transferred there {{during the first half}} of the third season. Another episode, [...] "Branch Wars", gave viewers a brief glimpse of the Utica branch, one of several purportedly in upstate New York. Zbornak says that city was on the short list for where to base the show, with some of its writers having ties to Central New York, and that they always intended for at least a branch office to be located there, for reasons of phonetics. [...] "Utica <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a different-sounding name than Scranton," [...] Zbornak says. But also, [...] "we had done a little research and thought our kind of business could survive in Utica." ...|$|E
500|$|The other {{material}} on Eat a Peach comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, [...] "When we recorded At Fillmore East, {{we ended up}} with almost a whole other album's worth of good material, and we used [...] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I was listening to the last things that Duane ever played and there <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him". He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a [...] "special thanks." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{short film}} was {{produced}} by Emma Ludbrook, Allan Wachs and Jared Leto, who also directed. Although it is billed as a [...] "Bartholomew Cubbins Film" [...] (Leto's [...] longtime pseudonym), [...] "City of Angels" [...] is the first directorial project directly credited to Jared Leto. He explained, [...] "It {{was the first time}} I'd ever done that. I'd used several different names, but it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a personal thing. I thought it was appropriate to put my name on that piece." [...] Previous collaborator Devid Levlin served as director of photography. It was edited by Leto, Benjamin Entrup and Mischa Meyer. The short film included commentary from Kanye West, Christopher Lloyd Dennis, Juliette Lewis, Heather Levinger, Haywood, Lindsay Lohan, Olivia Wilde, Steve Nash, Ashley Olsen, Lily Collins, James Franco, Selena Gomez, Alan Cumming, Anthony Warfield, Jovan Rameau, Holly Beavon, Shaun White, Corey Feldman, and Yosh. [...] "City of Angels" [...] marked the second collaboration of Thirty Seconds to Mars with Kanye West, as they first worked together on the track [...] "Hurricane" [...] (2010).|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Fiasco co-founded 1st & 15th Entertainment with Charles [...] "Chilly" [...] Patton. 1st & 15th is an {{independent}} record label separate from Atlantic Records named after the traditional twice-monthly paycheck dates. [...] Although his albums are released by Atlantic since he is under contract with them, most of his works are usually produced by 1st & 15th and its in house producers. Although Fiasco was initially to serve as vice-president, he became CEO after Patton was convicted on drug charges. Fiasco and singer Matthew Santos {{were two of the}} most recognizable signed artists. In November 2009, Fiasco announced he would discontinue the 1st & 15th label: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a 'this isn't right for you right now. This isn't gonna work for you right now. You need to be focused on you. Do you really want that, do you really have the capacity to do it?'"

500|$|Taraborrelli {{felt that}} [...] "Like a Virgin {{is really a}} {{portrait}} of Madonna's uncanny pop instincts empowered by her impatient zeal for creative growth and her innate knack for crafting a good record." [...] He added {{that the success of}} the album made it clear what was Madonna's real persona. [...] "She was a street-smart dance queen with the sexy allure of Marilyn Monroe, the coy iciness of Marlene Dietrich and the cutting and protective glibness of a modern Mae West". Although the album received mixed reviews, Taraborrelli believed that the [...] "mere fact {{that at the time of}} its release so many couldn't resist commenting on the record was a testament to the continuous, growing fascination with Madonna... Every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes the artist's magic moment; for Madonna, Like a Virgin <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a defining moment" [...] Chris Smith, author of 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music believed that it was with Like a Virgin that Madonna was able to steal the spotlight towards herself. She asserted her sexuality as only male rock stars had done before, moving well beyond the limited confines of being a pop artist, to becoming a focal point for nationwide discussions of power relationships in the areas of sex, race, gender, religion, and other divisive social topics. Her songs became a lightning rod for both criticism by conservatives and imitation by the younger female population.|$|E

500|$|Matt Norris of Cinema Blend {{stated that}} most of the events portrayed in the episode were unexpected, {{including}} Dualla's suicide, Starbuck finding her own supposed body, discovering the thirteenth tribe were Cylons, and that Ellen Tigh is the final model, but still thought the episode was among the top five Battlestar Galactica episodes in its run. Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly stated that a lot had been going on in the episode, but criticised the writers' decision of having Ellen as the fifth Cylon. While Dualla's suicide was surprising for Bernardin, he was critical about the Adama scene after her suicide, stating it as [...] "some of Olmos' worst acting in the series", and that the answered questions for the episode raised more questions, but felt the episode was good overall. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger commented: [...] "What really grabs me about the show (as I discussed in today's column) is its humanity, the way its characters react to situations the way you imagine real, contemporary people might" [...] and felt that [...] "as the stakes for the characters has risen, so has the intensity of [...] performances," [...] with even the extras in character. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune praised Nankin's directing, particularly [...] "the moment in which we see Kara Thrace, silhouetted in black against a dark blue sky, preparing to burn “her” body—that’s sent a shiver down my spine. That <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a beautifully operatic image, spot-on in tone and perfectly executed." ...|$|E

Christine de Pisan complained of such behaviour, among women in particular, {{pointing}} out that the pax [...] "is for the little people as much as the big ones". [...] She recommended just hanging the pax {{on the wall of the}} church [...] "on a nail and let whoever wants to kiss it do so". [...] This was actually recommended by a synod in Seville in 1512, which said the pax should be fixed rather than carried round the church. [...] Thomas More also complained that [...] "men fall at variance for kissing of the pax".|$|E
2500|$|This legend as perpetuated by geology {{textbooks}} {{over the}} last century claims that geology remained {{in the service of the}} Mosaic story of creation so long as armchair geological theorists refused to place fieldwork ahead of scriptural authority. [...] Thomas Burnet <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> an archetypical religious spokesman. [...] A century later, Hutton heroically broke with this biblical zealotry by arguing that geological evidence must rest upon a solid empirical foundation. [...] The Earth's strata, when carefully examined, betray [...] "no vestige of a beginning—no prospect of an end." [...] But Hutton was far ahead of his time. So it was not until Charles Lyell published the Principles of Geology that geologists finally came to accept Hutton's basic message and banished miraculous intervention, catastrophes, and biblical deluges from their science.|$|E

2500|$|The {{gold medal}} at the 1994 world {{championship}} was Canada's first title in 33 years. Going unbeaten through the tournament, Canada faced Finland in the final. Finland took the lead, but Canada courtesy of Rod Brind'Amour tied the game. Ten minutes of overtime solved nothing, and the game went into a shoot out. In the first five shots, Robitaille and Joe Sakic scored for Canada but Jari Kurri and Mikko Makela responded for the Finns, meaning the game moved to a sudden-victory shootout. Robitaille was up first for Canada and, despite losing the puck on his approach, was able to beat Jarmo Myllys to put the pressure on the Finns. Bill Ranford made the save, and Canada was once again world champion. “I’m not sure I’ve ever jumped so high in my life,” Robitaille said later of his reaction after Ranford’s final save. “It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a relief, and the celebration was something I will never forget.” ...|$|E
