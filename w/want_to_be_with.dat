During the night at the hotel, Cathy asks to hang out for a while in Jim's room under the pretext that the heat in her room is malfunctioning. She repeatedly makes seductive signals, making Jim uncomfortable, so he calls Dwight saying he has bed bugs. Dwight arrives and forces Cathy off Jim's bed so he can lure out the bed bugs with his nearly naked body.

After ordering some desserts from room service and asking Jim to touch her legs, he finally comes out saying that he is happily married, and does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> her.

I {{was in the middle of}} this drama, because the other guy was [...] friend, and my boyfriend was just not getting it together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought that was a good relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them and they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> their guy," [...] she added.|$|E

500|$|Already a star at {{the time}} of release, Knightley's {{appearance}} in the film was emphasised by featuring her in all promotional materials (similar to Colin Firth's prominent appearance in the 1995 adaptation). Several commentators likened the main poster of Pride & Prejudice to that of 1995's Sense and Sensibility, which was seen as an attempt to attract the same demographic. Advertising noted that the film came [...] "from the producers of Bridget Jones's Diary", a 2001 romantic comedy film, before mentioning Austen. Leading up to the release, fans were allowed to download pictures and screensavers online, which emphasised the differences between Pride & Prejudice and previous adaptations. Lydia Martin wrote that in contrast to past Pride and Prejudice productions, marketing materials downplayed the [...] "suggested antagonism between the heroes" [...] in favour of highlighting a [...] "romantic relationship", as can be seen with the positioning of the characters {{as well as with the}} tagline, [...] "Sometimes the last person on earth you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> is the one you can't be without." ...|$|E

When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we still have {{some of these people}} in the mix ... but right now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick." [...] On having Johnson and Reyes join up with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whedon called it uneasy [...] "for everyone involved.

Many commentators have alluded to Lawson's attractiveness, and she was once named as one of the world's most beautiful women. She has been referred to as [...] "stunningly beautiful, warm, honest, likeable and amazingly normal", as well as being described as having [...] "flawless skin, perfect white teeth, a voluptuous body, ample height and lots of lush, brown hair". Nigella Lawson has been voted, Sexiest Celebrity Chef. [...] The media have also noted Lawson's ability to engage with both male and female viewers; The Guardian wrote, [...] "Men love her because they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> her.

500|$|The group {{sent out}} demo tapes to record {{companies}} but received few responses until executives at GRT Records signed the band to a one-record contract, issuing their debut single, [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>with</b> You Tonight", in 1977. GRT {{was more interested}} in the band as songwriters, and convinced the group to change their name to the Alabama Band, later shortened to Alabama. The song only reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, and GRT declared bankruptcy the following year. Due to a hidden clause in their contract, Alabama was forbidden from recording with another label. For the next two years, the band raised money to buy out their contract and they began recording again in 1979. Following self-recorded efforts Wildcountry (1976) and Deuces Wild (1977), Alabama Band No. 3 became the band's third album, and the band performed over 300 shows on the road that year. The group hired independent radio promoters to receive radio play for the single [...] "I Wanna Come Over", and they sent hand-written letters to program directors and DJs nationwide. It received the attention of Dallas-based MDJ Records, who signed the band. Scott left the group at this time, and was replaced by Mark Herndon, a rock drummer later credited with bringing the band their signature sound. [...] "I Wanna Come Over", became their first radio hit, reaching the top 40 in the Billboard country chart.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the episode Ford {{describes}} it as [...] "an all out romp" [...] and an [...] "action, rollercoaster ride" [...] with [...] "a lot of comedy in it as much as thrills and nasty monsters". Davies stated that [...] "the whole point of the episode is to have a right old laugh". Expanding on the comedic aspects, something Ford considered whilst writing the episode was that [...] "the trick is to have the comedy come out of the characters" [...] rather than the scenario itself. It was Eve Myles' idea to have Gwen compulsively eat gherkins after waking up pregnant; the script had only specified the character drinking a glass of water. The episode also plays on Gwen's conflicted feelings between Jack and Rhys. Davies felt it would be [...] "irresistible" [...] to have the wedding temporarily halted by [...] "the one man Rhys doesn't want to see running down the aisle." [...] Ford stated that whilst Jack is [...] "the series hero" [...] Rhys is [...] "the hero of this episode". He compares a sequence where Rhys arms himself with a chainsaw to defend Gwen to the character being in [...] "Evil Dead mode". [...] Producer Richard Stokes commented that the episode illuminated that [...] "even though 's put [...] through some really difficult times, she really does love him and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> him." [...] In an early draft of the script Gwen and Rhys had their memories wiped {{at the end of the}} episode in addition to the other guests and were convinced by Jack that the wedding had been problem free.|$|E
