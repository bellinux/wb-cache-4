5|$|Back in Oslo, {{his colleagues}} throw him a {{farewell}} party, but Odda timid manis {{uncomfortable with the}} attention. As the party moves to a co-worker's apartment, he ends up getting accidentally locked out. He climbs up a scaffold, {{trying to reach the}} apartment window, and ends up in a young boy's room. The boy asks him to stay and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too late for the train he was to drive on his final working day. He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from Kyoto, Keitarō and Naru decide to retake the exams. After a while, Mutsumi moves to Tokyo, {{and the three}} begin to study together. During this period, Naru becomes convinced that Mutsumi is Keitarō's promised girl, but Mutsumi states that she made a childhood promise with Naru, not Keitarō. During {{the next round of}} Tokyo University exams, Keitarō believes he has failed them once again and runs away before finding out his results. After learning of this, Naru chases after him without checking her exam results either, and they are followed {{by the rest of the}} residents of Hinata House who announce that Keitarō and Naru both passed the exams along with Mutsumi. Unfortunately for him, Keitarō has an accident at the Tokyo University opening ceremony and is unable to attend classes for three months. After recovering from his injuries, Keitarō decides to study overseas with Noriyasu Seta. As Keitarō is about to leave, Naru finally confesses her feelings to him at the airport and decides to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return.|$|E

25|$|The British {{liaison officer}} Edward Spears later wrote that Lanrezac's {{reputation}} as an academic lecturer made him “the star turn” of the French Army. The British commander Sir John French, at his meeting with Joffre on 16 August, was advised to hurry up and join in Lanrezac’s offensive, as he would not <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> catch up. On 16 August, {{in exchange for the}} loss of XI Corps, Joffre transferred XVIII Corps to Lanrezac. Lanrezac received three reserve divisions, containing men from Bordeaux, Gascony and the Basque Country, and two extra divisions of French settlers from Algeria.|$|E
25|$|Back at {{the main}} crusaders' camp, two Turkish spies had spread rumor that the Germans who had taken Xerigordos had also taken Nicaea, which caused {{excitement}} to get there {{as soon as possible}} to share in the looting. The Turks were waiting on the road to Nicaea. Peter the Hermit had gone back to Constantinople to arrange for supplies and was due back soon, and most of the leaders argued to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return (which he never did). However, Geoffrey Burel, who had popular support among the masses, argued that it would be cowardly to wait, and they should move against the Turks right away. His will prevailed and, on the morning of 21 October, the entire army of 20,000 marched out toward Nicaea, leaving women, children, the old and the sick behind at the camp.|$|E

25|$|Zhou {{received}} Doudou's message {{shortly after}} Doudou's phone call, {{directly from the}} general office of the Central Committee responsible for guarding China's senior leaders. The message contained Doudou's warning that Ye Qun and Lin Liguo were attempting to persuade Lin Biao to flee the country using an aircraft currently being prepared at Qinhuangdao Shanhaiguan Airport. Zhou called Wu Faxian, {{the commander of the}} air force, who verified the plane's existence. Zhou then issued orders that the plane could not take off without the written permission of himself and several other senior military officials, including Wu Faxian, general chief-of-staff Huang Yongsheng, and the commander of the navy and general chief-of-staff, Li Zuopeng. At 11:30, Ye Qun called Zhou and informed him that Lin Biao was planning to fly to Dalian, and denied that they had prepared a plane at Shanhaiguan. Zhou then told Ye to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> travel to see Lin before they left Beidaihe (where they were staying), issued orders to neutralize potentially disruptive officers close to Lin (Wu Faxian and Huang Yongsheng), and ordered two planes readied in Beijing so that he could fly to Lin's residence to personally deal with the matter.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E
25|$|Ridgway began each {{murder by}} picking up a woman, usually a sex worker. He {{sometimes}} showed the woman {{a picture of his}} son, to trick her into trusting him. After raping her, Ridgway strangled her from behind. He initially strangled them manually. However, many victims inflicted wounds and bruises on his arm while trying to defend themselves. Concerned these wounds and bruises would draw attention, Ridgway began using ligatures. He killed most victims in his home, his truck, or a secluded area. In the early 1980s, the King County Sheriff's Office formed the Green River Task Force to investigate the murders. The most notable members of the task force were Robert Keppel and Dave Reichert, who periodically interviewed incarcerated serial killer Ted Bundy in 1984. Bundy offered his opinions on the psychology, motivations, and behavior of the killer; he suggested that the killer was revisiting the dump sites to have sexual relations with his victims, {{which turned out to be}} true, and if police found a fresh grave, they should stake it out and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come back. Also contributing to the investigation was John E. Douglas, who has since written much on the subject of the Green River Killer.|$|E

She recalled: [...] "I once {{received a letter from}} someone who said they were to attend the Academy of Arts, and that I should wait for him; he could come back and marry me! I had no idea who the letter might have been from or who I should have send it to." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2011, Hanneman {{contracted}} necrotizing fasciitis. According to the band, {{doctors say}} that it likely originated from a spider bite. Araya said of Hanneman's condition: [...] "Jeff was seriously ill. Jeff ended up contracting a bacteria that ate away his flesh on his arm, so they cut open his arm, from his wrist to his shoulder, and they did a skin graft on him, they cleaned up ... It was a flesh-eating virus, so he was really, really bad. So we'll <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get better, and when he's a hundred percent, he's gonna come out and join us." [...] The band decided to play their upcoming tour dates without Hanneman. Gary Holt of Exodus was announced as Hanneman's temporary replacement. Cannibal Corpse guitarist Pat O'Brien filled in for Holt during a tour in Europe. On April 23, 2011, at the American Big 4 show in Indio, California, Hanneman rejoined his bandmates to play the final two songs of their set, [...] "South of Heaven" [...] and [...] "Angel of Death."This was Hanneman's final live performance with the band.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} recorded by Roberts and Tikovoi. However, the pair struggled to finish its production, with Roberts describing {{the process as}} something that [...] "just wouldn't work". The incompletion of the song led to stress and illness for Roberts, and she decided to contact producer Diplo {{to work on the}} record. Discussing her choice in an interview for The Guardian, Roberts said that she only had one chance to get him to work with her and asked for his assistance. After Diplo reassured the singer that he would help, Roberts revealed that the situation was no longer in her hands and that she would <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> contact her with some progress. Despite her worries, she felt that [...] "he just got it straight away". Communications were limited between the pair, but when Roberts received Diplo's finished production, she was too nervous to listen to it immediately. Instead, she burnt the track to a CD, and drove to a deserted field with her younger brother and sister, where she played the song loudly. After positive responses from her siblings, Roberts declared Diplo a [...] "genius".|$|E
500|$|According to Hecht biographer, William MacAdams, [...] "At dawn on Sunday, February 20, 1939, David Selznick ... and {{director}} Victor Fleming shook Hecht awake to inform {{him he was}} on loan from MGM and must come with them immediately {{and go to work}} on Gone with the Wind, which Selznick had begun shooting five weeks before. It was costing Selznick $50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting for a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence. Hecht {{was in the middle of}} working on the film At the Circus for the Marx Brothers. Recalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend Gene Fowler, he said he hadn't read the novel but Selznick {{and director}} Fleming could not <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> read it. They would act out scenes based on Sidney Howard's original script which needed to be rewritten in a hurry. Hecht wrote, [...] "After each scene had been performed and discussed, I sat down at the typewriter and wrote it out. Selznick and Fleming, eager to continue with their acting, kept hurrying me. We worked in this fashion for seven days, putting in eighteen to twenty hours a day. Selznick refused to let us eat lunch, arguing that food would slow us up. He provided bananas and salted peanuts ... thus on the seventh day I had completed, unscathed, the first nine reels of the Civil War epic." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1992 Hooters 500, {{the final}} {{race of the}} 1992 season, is {{considered}} one of the most eventful races in NASCAR history. It was the final race for Richard Petty and the first for Jeff Gordon. Sixdrivers were close enough in the points standings to win the championship that day. Allison led second-place Kulwicki by 30 points, Bill Elliott by 40, Harry Gant by 97, and Kyle Petty by 98 and needed to finish sixth or better to clinch the championship. Kulwicki received approval from NASCAR and Ford to change the [...] "Thunderbird" [...] lettering on his bumper for the race to [...] "underbird" [...] because he felt like the underdog in the contention for the championship. During Kulwicki's first pit stop, the first gear in the car's transmission broke. Andrews said, [...] "We had to leave pit road in fourth gear, because we had broken metal parts in there, and only by leaving it in fourth are you not going to move metal around as much. We could only hope that the loose piece of metal didn't get in there and break the gears in half. We had three or fourpit stops after it broke. I held my breath all day long." [...] Allison was racing in sixthplace, closely behind Ernie Irvan, when Irvan's tire blew with 73 (of 328) laps left in the event. As a result, Allison ran into the side of Irvan's spinning car and his car was too damaged to continue. Kulwicki and Elliott were left to duel for the title. While leading late in the race, Andrews calculated the exact lap for his final pit stop so that Kulwicki would be guaranteed to lead the most laps and would gain fivebonus points. Kulwicki made his final pit stop only after leading enough laps to guarantee the bonus points. To save time, the pit crew did a fuel-only pit stop. Not changing tires allowed them to be available to push the car to prevent it from stalling, since the car had to start moving in a higher gear. Because the team's fuel man hurried to add the gasoline during the quick stop, he did not add the desired amount into the tank. As a result, Kulwicki had to conserve fuel to ensure that his car was still running at the end of the race. Elliott won the race and Kulwicki stretched his fuel to finish second. Kulwicki won the 1992 Winston Cup Championship by maintaining his 10-point lead over Elliott. He celebrated the championship with his second Polish victory lap. Always conscious of his appearance for potential sponsors, Kulwicki combed his hair, making a national television audience <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> emerge from his car.|$|E
