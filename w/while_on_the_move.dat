5|$|Replenishment ships, {{known as}} oilers in the United States and fleet tankers in Commonwealth countries, are ships {{that can provide}} oil {{products}} to naval vessels <b>while</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move.</b> This process, called underway replenishment, extends {{the length of time}} a naval vessel can stay at sea, as well as her effective range. Prior to underway replenishment, naval vessels had to enter a port or anchor to take on fuel. In addition to fuel, replenishment ships may also deliver water, ammunition, rations, stores and personnel.|$|E
5|$|The {{tendency}} to panic continued {{in nearly all}} the 24th Infantry operations west of Sangju. Men left their positions and straggled to the rear. They abandoned weapons on positions. On many occasions units lost most of their equipment <b>while</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> even when not under fire, causing logistical shortages.

5|$|<b>While</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> {{the lead}} {{vehicles}} of the patrol commanders and sergeants flew a small flag. Because the LRP was organised on divisional cavalry lines the leaders carried green flags for 'A' (HQ) Troop, black for 'B' Troop, yellow for 'C' Troop and red for 'D'. When the LRDG was organised into 11 vehicle patrols this was simplified to a green flag displaying the patrol letter in white; the later half-patrols used a plain green flag on occasion. When it became necessary {{to change course}} from an intended route, or {{in the event of}} enemy action, patrol movements were controlled by a simple semaphore flag system using blue and white signal flags, or hand signals, depending on how widely dispersed the trucks were.|$|E

500|$|The 24th Infantry {{first came}} into heavy contact with North Korean People's Army troops on 22 July {{during the battle of}} Sangju. North Korean rifle fire came in on the {{dispersed}} regiment, and its troops almost immediately began retreating from the front, ignoring officers' commands to stay in position. Historians blame the retreat as much on officers' ineptitude as on the panicking of individual soldiers. The tendency to panic continued in nearly all the 24th Infantry operations west of Sangju. Men left their positions and straggled to the rear, abandoning weapons. On many occasions, units lost most of their equipment <b>while</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> even when not under fire, causing logistical shortages. In other cases, the majority of a unit deserted its position {{at the first sign of}} North Korean fire. The situation became so dire that the regiment's senior officers set up a checkpoint west of the town and stopped every vehicle coming from the west, removing stragglers attempting to retreat. Many jeeps were filled with six or seven men claiming they were retreating after their position was overrun. The 24th quickly gained a poor reputation as a [...] "bug out" [...] unit, blasted for its poor performance during combat. Historians contend its accomplishments, particularly at the Battle of Yechon, were ignored, while shortcomings were seized upon to depict the 24th as a sub-par unit, and African-Americans as inferior soldiers to whites.|$|E

40|$|Part 7 : Network Topology ConfigurationInternational audienceTo {{cope with}} the rapid {{increase}} of data traffic in mobile networks, operators are looking for efficient solutions that ensure the scalability of their systems. Decentralization of the network {{is one of the}} key solutions.

In this paper, we devise methods that enable User Equipments (UEs), both in idle and active mode and <b>while</b> being <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> to always have optimal Packet Data Network (PDN) connections in such decentralized networks.

This work proposes a complementary approach to gather, share, and use IP-Connectivity information. The key idea is sense and stored the user’s experience, feedbacks, through a route in a context-aware way, and shares the information using virtual communities to reach people that use the same path (e. g. co-workers probably have common habits).

40|$|In {{this paper}} I will examine how maps in location-based mobile games are used assurfaces on which players can inscribe their {{whereabouts}} {{and other local}} information <b>while</b> being <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move.</b> I will look at three different location-based games to whichmaps are central as a playing surface : RunZombieRun, Paranormal Activity Sanctuary and Own This World. My main argument will be that such cartographical location-basedgames foreground the fluidity of mapping and emphasise the performative aspects of playing with maps. As such they are not representations used by players for consultation, but as Latourian mediators (Latour 1990, 1993, 2004) they produce new social spaces(Lefebvre 1991). It therefore does not suffice to conceive maps in such games as“mimetic interfaces” (Juul 2009). Instead they should be approached as what I will callnavigational interfaces. To understand them as such I will combine perspectives fromgame-studies with understandings of maps as technological and spatial practices asdeveloped in Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Human Geograph...|$|R
