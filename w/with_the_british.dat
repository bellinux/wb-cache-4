The Treaty of Lahore was signed in 1846, in which the Rajas agreed to cede the territory of Chamba district.

5|$|The {{invasion}} {{plan called}} for two brigades of the 3rd Canadian Division to land on two beach sectors—Mike and Nan—focusing on Courseulles, Bernières and Saint-Aubin.

Close support on the beaches was to be provided by amphibious tanks of the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade. Once the landing zones were secured, the {{plan called for}} the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade to land reserve battalions and deploy inland, the Royal Marine commandos to establish contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>British</b> 3rd Infantry Division on Sword and the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade to link up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>British</b> 50th Infantry Division on Gold.
