The <b>wind</b> <b>forcing</b> used was derived from synoptic surface pressure analyses off Lisbon, Portugal. Results obtained show that eddies generated during the coastal upwelling season (generally occurring during the spring and summer) decay during the winter. Only cyclonic eddies form during the 1987 and 1988 upwelling seasons. The eddies are generated through a combination of barotropic and baroclinic instability mechanisms.
