They grossly outnumbered the defenders of the city, reported variously as 1,600 or 1,800, including largely farmers, citizens, shepherds, clerics, teachers, journeymen, day laborers, and various craftsmen. Prior to a punishing cannonade, the Duke offered terms, which Cloedt declined. The city, he claimed, had no authority to treat with him, as the city's rights and protection came from the Holy Roman Emperor himself. As the herald left, the journeymen hurled insults at him and the Duke of Parma. At the assault of the Rhine Gate, over 400 men were killed, and Cloedt was gravely injured. In short order, the fortifications were overrun, and 10,000 Spanish, Italian and Germans entered the city, intent on plunder and <b>whatever</b> <b>else</b> they could find.

25|$|While seen as {{an enemy}} of the United States and Colombian governments, Escobar was a hero to many in Medellín (especially the poor people). He was a natural at public relations, and he worked to create {{goodwill}} among the poor of Colombia. A lifelong sports fan, he was credited with building football fields and multi-sports courts, as well as sponsoring children's football teams. Escobar was also responsible for the construction of houses and football fields in western Colombia, which gained him popularity among the poor. He worked hard to cultivate his Robin Hood image, and frequently distributed money through housing projects and other civic activities, which gained him notable popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented. Some people from Medellín often helped Escobar avoid police capture by serving as lookouts, hiding information from authorities, or doing <b>whatever</b> <b>else</b> they could to protect him. At the height of his power, drug traffickers from Medellín and other areas were handing over between 20% and 35% of their Colombian cocaine-related profits to Escobar, as {{he was the one who}} shipped cocaine successfully to the United States.|$|E
