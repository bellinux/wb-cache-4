In terms of a quantitative prediction, the mechanism of the oxygen permeation is well understood, but not enough for the water vapor and especially not for the aroma permeability. For all different substances the barrier properties of the final laminate result from the synergetic effect between the vacuum <b>web</b> <b>coated</b> barrier layer and the polymer layers next to it. For a systematic investigation, BOPP films were vacuum <b>web</b> <b>coated</b> with Aluminum and silicon oxide on industrial scale.

Therefore, a proper understanding of the permeation processes is a key issue. On laboratory {{as well as on}} industrial scale, the influence of various production parameters on the permeation through coated barrier films and final high barrier laminates was studied by using different inorganic coatings materials and lamination adhesives.

40|$|The food {{packaging}} industry demands cheap polymer films possessing a high barrier agains permeation of gases, moisture and flavor. Candidates {{for the most}} successful materials fulfilling these requirements are newly developed laminates of biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films containing a thin inorganic barrier layer and possessing an oxygen permeability lower than 3 cm 3 /(m 2 /dbar) and a moisture permeability lower than 0. 05 g/m 2 day). The thin barrier layers are produced by vacuum <b>web</b> <b>coating</b> of BOPP films. In order to achieve high barrier laminates, one key issue along the whole production chain - from film extrusion to lamination - is given by the surface properties of the non-coated films. Non-coated BOPP film surfaces were modified by different kinds of plasma pretreatment and characterized before the vacuum coating process.

40|$|This paper aims at {{simulating}} {{the flow}} of a pigment suspension in a short-dwell coater (SDTA), a common device used {{for the production of}} value-added paper. The process consists of depositing onto a paper <b>web</b> a thin <b>coating</b> layer, the uniformity and the quality of which depend on the short-dwell coater geometry and the coating color rheology. In order to understand the possible interactions between the hydrodynamics in the pond and the rheological behavior of the suspension, this study focuses on a phenomenon known as shear-induced particle migration, which may result in an non-homogeneous suspension. For this purpose, a numerical methodology based on a shear-induced particle migration model (Sim) and the finite element method is presented and validated against analytical results and experimental data. This numerical approach constitutes the first step towards {{a better understanding of the}} hydrodynamic mechanisms that govern particle migration in a short-dwell paper coater. In this work, a parametric study of the suspension flow behavior is carried out via the introduction of a new dimensionless number that characterizes the importance of the shear-induced migration with respect to particle convection. The proposed model is used to generate particle distribution templates. It is shown that the particle size and Reynolds number are preponderant factors that affect the extent at which migration occurs in the short-dwell coater. In particular, it is shown that increasing the Reynolds number amplifies the migration phenomena and the formation of high concentration zones within a ring located in a vortex just before the nip. Such a concentration overshoot may then be dragged into the nip, resulting in runnability problems such as <b>web</b> breaks or <b>coating</b> color spitting.

The gravure film thickness experiments conducted {{are similar to those}} presented in previous studies and show a near linear relationship between pickout ratio and speed ratio. This work adds detailed data of the gravure surface for use in computational modelling. Using a white light interferometer, surface images of the gravure topography were captured. From these images the key cell parameters, opening area, cell depth, cell volume and the cell patterning were characterised. Observations of scratches on the <b>coated</b> <b>web</b> were concluded to be caused by contact between the web and roll. A novel computational model was derived for the discrete cell gravure coating process. The model uses a multiscale approach to address the disparate scales of the coating bead and the gravure cell. This is an extension of earlier work and is extended to a three-dimensional, realistic, topography at the small scale and at the large scale a web-to-roll contact model was added. The key topographical gravure features are included via a detailed cell scale model. The computational model was able to predict the near linear relationship between pickout ratio and speed ratio but failed to accurately predict this gradient. The model was shown to be the most accurate at speed ratios near unity. A parametric investigation of both the coating conditions and the gravure cell geometries identified the contact pressure (the pressure caused by the web acting directly on the gravure surface) as being important to the coating process. Its magnitude was related to the web tension, wrap angle and cell size. This led the interesting result that very small cells display no contact pressure and suggests a direction for future work on the investigation of scratch free coatings. ...|$|R

In order to analyze this particular the coating flow, several tools are developed and tested on other coating flows relatively simpler than TWOSD flow. The theoretical conditions for the onset of vortex that degrades product qualities are proposed and the critical vortex birth trajectories inside the parameter space are tracked automatically by a direct tracking method. To detect a defect-causing flow feature in multi-layer coating, mid-gap invasion, the position of an interlayer separation point was tracked by theoretical model. The results are verified by flow visualization experiment for two- layer fixed-gap slot coating. Also linear stability analysis was performed, in order to detect unstable interlayer that signals coating defects in the two-layer slot coating. The purpose of the research is to understand the complicated flow characteristic inside the coating bead by solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes theory using finite element method and visualizing the coating bead flow on a lab-scale TWOSD coater. Using the tools described above, the flow features that leads to coating defects, such as, bead breakup, weeping, mid-gap invasion and feed slot vortex, are identified and mathematical forms of the onset condition for the features are presented.

For final packaging applications, coated layers are normally protected by laminating to another film. On laboratory as well as industial scale, the influence of various production parameters on the permeation through coated barrier films and final high barrier laminates was studied by using different types of substrate films, different kinds of pretreatment, different inorganic coating materials anddifferent lamination adhesives.

This article deals with vacuum <b>web</b> <b>coating</b> as a common way of increasing barrier properties of polymeric films and the problems related to this procedure. Defects caused by particles and surface imperfections are found to dominate the permeation rate for such coated polymeric films. Atomic force microscopy, electron and also optical microscopy was used for analysis of the coating layer. Three-dimensional numerical simulations were performed for modeling {{of the influence of}} defect size, spacing and film thickness. Results of numerical modeling and of many practical experiments show that the permeability is almost independent of the substrate film thickness when a critical thickness is exceeded. In most cases the defects can be treated as independent of each other. The gas permeability of vacuum web-coated polymeric films can be quantitatively predicted by a simple formula. For gases, like oxygen, it is shown that a statistic analysis of the defect sizes by optical microscopy is sufficient.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of desktop color {{scanners}} in the electronic prepress production environment, quality in color separations from transmissive originals has become erratic. The cause of this fluctuation is, in part, due to the transition from PMT to CCD-based scanning technology. Whereas, PMT scanners {{tend to have a}} broad dynamic range, that of CCD scanners is more limited. This characteristic adversely affects the quality of color separations by causing additional tone compression. An original transparency typically has a shadow density of 3. 00 and a diffused highlight density of 0. 30 for an overall density range of 2. 70. On a four-color heatset <b>web</b> press with <b>coated</b> stock, the maximum reproducible tonal range corresponds to a density of 1. 80. The difference in density of 0. 90 between the original and the press sheet is unable to fit through the printing window unless it undergoes considerable tone compression. This project was based on two hypotheses. The first was that the lower the tonal range of a transmissive original the more readily lower-midtone-to-shadow tonality could be retained in the separations produced by a CCD scanner and related equipment. The second was that exposure latitude in the separations would decrease with increasing tonal range. The first stage of production was to produce twelve test transparencies by photograph ing a still life set to four tonal ranges: 3. 5, 4. 5, 5. 5, and 6. 5 f/stops. Within each range, three images were selected to represent normal exposure, 1 / 2 f/stop overexposure, and 1 / 2 f/stop underexposure. Comparison of halftone proofs, made from separations of the normallyexposed transparencies, were later used for the first hypothesis. Proofs from the 1 / 2 f/stop over- and 1 / 2 f/stop underexposures were compared with the normal exposures to test the second hypothesis. vm The twelve test transparencies were first scanned on the Dainippon Screen SG- 608 to produce a set of best-of-kind reference separations and halftone proofs.

40|$|Fluoropolymer webs and {{membranes}} commonly exhibit superior {{optical properties}} {{such as high}} transmittance over a broad wavelength range and very good outdoor stability. Therefore, fluoropolymer films are used in architecture, for example, in membrane roofs and facades in stadiums, shopping malls, and airports or as front-side encapsulation for solar cells. However, thin film deposition on fluoropolymer webs – both in vacuum and at atmospheric pressure – face several critical challenges including poor mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties, especially low dimensional stability and low elastic modulus, high and textured surface roughness, and low adhesion of thin films. This paper discusses critical process parameters in roll-to-roll processing for both vacuum processes and wet coating processes {{with respect to the}} unique properties of fluoropolymer webs. Reactively sputtered oxide layers as well as wet coated ORMOCER® (a trademark of the Fraunhofer Institute) layers were deposited on ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), and ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene (ECTFE) webs form single- and multilayer permeation barrier systems. Layer adhesion and permeation barrier performance was reviewed in relation to the relevant process parameters. Permeation barrier coatings were selected as lead application for this study. Barrier coatings are sensitive to substrate surface irregularities and mechanical damage due to low adhesion, high strain, or roll-to-roll processing issues and therefore were a Germanygood measure for the quality of the coating on the substrate. Reactively sputtered zinc-tin oxide (ZTO) layers as well as wet coated ORMOCER® layers showed surprisingly good adhesion on both ETFE and PVDF surfaces. Both ZTO and – with adhesion promotion treatment – aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) layers have the potential for low water transmission rates (WVTR) below 5 × 10 - 2 g/(m²d) at 38 °C/ 90 % RH. on these substrates. Further reduction of the WVTR using multilayer stacks was demonstrated with a combination of wet coated ORMOCER layers and sputtered ZTO layers yielding a WVTR of 1 × 10 - 3 g/(m²d) at 38 °C/ 90 % RH. To achieve that, adapted process parameters and layer stack designs such as reduced web tension and lower layer thicknesses were needed. The potential of the coatings for specific outdoor application is discussed as well as possible ways to improve the polymer web itself to gain a larger process window for roll-to-roll <b>coating</b> on fluoropolymer <b>webs.</b> Demonstrating successful <b>coating</b> on ETFE and PVDF, the results reviewed in this paper potentially enable the use of <b>coated</b> fluoropolymer <b>webs</b> for functionalization of membrane roofs and facades with flexible thin film solar cells, thermal insulation and solar control functionality, flexible thin film electroluminescence, and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) lighting panels as well as electrochromic devices...|$|R
60|$|The scene now {{represents}} {{a room of}} ten feet square, the floor of which is sunk a yard or two {{below the level of}} the ground; the walls are covered with a dirty and crumbling plaster, on which appear a crowd of ill-favored and lugubrious faces done in charcoal, and the autographs and poetical attempts of a long succession of debtors and petty criminals. Other features of the apartment are a deep fireplace (superfluous in the sultriness of the summer's day), a door of hard-hearted oak, and a narrow window high in the wall,--where the glass has long been broken, while the iron bars retain all their original strength. Through this opening come the sound of passing footsteps in the public street, and the voices of children at play. The furniture consists of a bed, or rather an old sack of barley straw, thrown down in the corner farthest from the door, and a chair and table, both aged and infirm, and leaning {{against the side of the}} room, besides lending a friendly support to each other. The atmosphere is stifled and of an ill smell, as if it had been kept close prisoner for half a century, and had lost all its pure and elastic nature by feeding the tainted breath of the vicious and the sighs of the unfortunate. Such is the present abode of the man of medicine and politics, and his own appearance forms no contrast to the accompaniments. His wig is unpowdered, out of curl, and put on awry; the dust of many weeks has worked its way into the <b>web</b> of his <b>coat</b> and small-clothes, and his knees and elbows peep forth to ask why they are so ill clad; his stockings are ungartered, his shoes down at the heel, his waistcoat is without a button, and discloses a shirt as dingy as the remnant of snow in a showery April day. His shoulders have become rounder, and his whole person is more bent and drawn together, since we last saw him, and his face has exchanged the glory of wit and humor for a sheepish dulness. At intervals, the Doctor walks the room, with an irregular and shuffling pace; anon, he throws himself flat on the sack of barley straw, muttering very reprehensible expressions between his teeth; then again he starts to his feet, and journeying from corner to corner, finally sinks into the chair, forgetful of its three-legged infirmity till it lets him down upon the floor. The grated window, his only medium of intercourse with the world, serves but to admit additional vexations. Every few moments the steps of the passengers are heard to pause, and some well-known face appears in the free sunshine behind the iron bars, brimful of mirth and drollery, the owner whereof stands on tiptoe to tickle poor Dr. Bullivant with a stinging sarcasm. Then laugh the little boys around the prison door, and the wag goes chuckling away. The apothecary would fain retaliate, but all his quips and repartees, and sharp and facetious fancies, once so abundant, seem to have been transferred from himself to the sluggish brains of his enemies. While endeavoring to condense his whole intellect into one venomous point, in readiness for the next assailant, he is interrupted by the entrance of the turnkey with the prison fare of Indian bread and water. With these dainties we leave him.|$|R
