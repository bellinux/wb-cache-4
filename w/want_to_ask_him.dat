6000|$|... 'Oh, no {{occasion}} to trouble yourself, Mrs. Oswald!' {{the old lady}} put in, almost with alacrity, for she had herself seen the announcement of Harry Oswald's election in the 'Times' a few days before. 'No {{occasion to}} trouble yourself, I'm sure; I daresay you may be right, and at any rate it's no business of mine, thank heaven. I never want to poke my nose into anybody else's business. Well, talking of Oxford, Mrs. Oswald, there's a very nice young man down here at present; I wonder if you know where he's lodging? I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to dinner. He's a young Mr. Le Breton--one of the Cheshire Le Bretons, you know. His father was Sir Owen Le Breton, a general in the Indian army--brother officer of Major Standish Luttrell's and very nice people in every way. Lady Le Breton's a great friend of the Archdeacon's, so I should like to show her son some little attention. He's had a very distinguished career at Oxford--your boy may have heard his name, perhaps--and now he's acting as tutor to Lord Lynmouth, the eldest son of Lord Exmoor, you know; Lady Exmoor was a second cousin of my brother's wife; very nice people, all of them. The Le Bretons are a really good family, you see; and the Archdeacon's exceedingly fond of them. So I thought if you could tell me where this young man is lodging--you shop-people pick up all the gossip in the place, always--I'd ask him to dinner to meet the Rector and Colonel Turnbull and my nephew, who would probably {{be able to offer}} him a little shooting.' ...|$|E

50|$|This story {{centers on}} two high school students, Kokusai and Chiga. It {{comes in a}} manga form, where it extends a few {{chapters}} and also exists in a shorter anime form where it extends for only two episodes. The story is a romance between both {{of the high school}} students and largely follows the yaoi genre, dominant in Japanese literature. In the anime, the two students are shown to mainly interact at a judo club, where they spar together. Kokusai holds a leadership position as the class president and as the senior martial artist at the club while the younger Chiga is just a regular. The story starts with an entry level martial artist and Chiga cleaning up the judo activity room. The conversation steers toward the class president and the young member tells Chiga the latest rumor, that the old vice president was accused of sexually assaulting the president Kokusai. Chiga is visually upset by this and the entry level member is confused as to why he reacts so strongly. Kokusai then enters and talks about looking for a replacement for vice president. He laments about how his friend Akutsu declined the position and how he needs to continue looking for someone. Chiga asks him why he did not ask him to fill the position and after some pressure, Kokusai admits he had originally thought of Chiga but did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> as he knew Chiga (unlike his other friend) would take the position very seriously and might be burdened by it. Chiga is touched and says he will gladly take the position. They bond for a bit while the entry level member notes their intense and intrinsic chemistry. Chiga and Kokusai enter the subway and Chiga is confused to see his friend looking uncomfortable and strange. Kokusai later tells him that he is constantly sexually assaulted on the train by men who grab him and make him feel uncomfortable. Chiga is upset and privately wonders what it is about this homely and average man that draws people to him. He inadvertently starts checking him out and suddenly realizes he is admiring him and he recoils in surprise. He decides to protect Kokusai and repel the perverts on the train. As men try to get close to his friend, he pushes them away and defends his friends chastity. However, in doing so, he positions himself very closely to his friend and starts acting inappropriately as well, sniffing his friends hair and neck and leaning close to him. He realizes what he is doing and cuts it out. Chiga mentions how he needs to get a haircut and Kokusai expresses interest in going with him so they agree to go together. Later in the evening, after taking a shower, Chiga reaches into the closet to pick out his clothes in advance and notices that he is a lot more anxious for the reunion than he expected. He gets a call by Kokusai and nervously responds to him. They speak but Kokusai tells him to wait as he is getting a call by Akutsu. He returns and jokes about how his friend asked him if its weird that he always carries extra condoms. Chiga gets jealous but they return to talking about their plan for the next day and Chiga says goodnight in a tender and unique tone. They meet up and Chiga notices his friend is wearing new clothes. He realizes that just as he went out and bought new clothes to look his best, so did Kokusai. Out {{of the corner of his}} eye, he sees someone watching them. Once the guy realizes he has been caught, he deftly hides, too quickly for Chiga to make him out. Chiga senses this person is dangerous and makes a mental note of this intimidating presence. On route to the barbershop, a group of girls ask for them to pose for a picture since they are making a calendar of hot guys. Chiga originally doesn't want to but the girl suggest they pose for the picture together and he gets really into the idea. He starts pressuring Kokusai to accept, grabbing his wrist and pulling him close to him. Kokusai gets frightened and runs off. Chiga later finds him and apologizes for pressuring him after Kokusai apologizes for being too shy to pose for the picture. They get close and Chiga kisses Kokusai, surrendering to his attraction to him. Later Kokusai returns home and finds that the door is open and unlocked. Not thinking much about it, he reflects on his make out session with Chiga and realizes he is really into him. Chiga calls him and asks if it was Kokusai's first kiss. He asks because he doesn't know if his friend was saving it and would feel bad if that were the case. Kokusai tells him not to patronize him and they awkwardly talk for a minute. Chiga asks him not to be awkward since that will make him feel embarrassed and ruin their chemistry. Kokusai feels kind of unsafe so he asks Chiga to stay on the line while he locks the windows. Chiga laughs but agrees. Kokusai goes to lock the windows but notes that the windows are already locked and he finds this strange as he did not remember doing that. He sits down on the couch and falls asleep. The intimidating man who was spying on them earlier steps out of the shadows and approaches the sleeping Kokusai, getting near him. Meanwhile, Kokusai dreams he is wrestling with a random man at the judo class. The random person turns into his friend Chiga and then struggle together, very homoerotically. The dream version of Chiga starts seducing Kokusai and Kokusai resists but appears very into it. Chiga starts talking dirty to him, calling him names and Kokusai gets nervous as he knows that Chiga respects him too much to speak to him like that. Kokusai realizes the man in his dream is not really Chiga and suddenly he awakens to see the real Chiga, trying to wake him up. Chiga rushed there after being called by Akutsu, who told him to check up on Kokusai. He realizes immediately by the unbuttoned pants and raised shirt that someone has sexually abused Kokusai. He hugs him tightly and the first episode ends.|$|E

5000|$|In {{interviews}} Falconer frequently cites Oasis, The Beatles, The Clash, Fleetwood Mac and Squeeze as influences. Although {{all members}} of The View {{are said to be}} fans of The Beatles, Falconer is deemed to be the most infatuated. In 2008 he claimed that the band were the first thing he thought about in the morning. The following year, he admitted that when he met Paul McCartney he was so overwhelmed that he [...] "had to run to the toilet and just burst into tears". He further added, [...] "I love The Beatles.

Kate tells him she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> make sure Ray gets his reward. The marshal laughs, telling Kate that {{she is one of}} a kind, and then asks if he is going to die. Kate nods, and he asks if she is going to do it. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters with the gun, and a gunshot is heard. Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that the marshal <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> be killed. Muffled coughs are then heard, and it is revealed that Sawyer's shot missed the marshal's heart and pierced his lung, causing him more pain.
