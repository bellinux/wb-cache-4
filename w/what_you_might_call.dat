500|$|The BBC {{tracked down}} several {{officials}} {{involved in the}} accident's aftermath. One was William H. Chambers, a former nuclear weapons designer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Chambers headed a team dealing with nuclear accidents, including the Thule crash. He explained the logic behind the decision to abandon the search: [...] "There was disappointment in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> a failure to return all of the components... {{it would be very}} difficult for anyone else to recover classified pieces if we couldn't find them." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{positive}} review for Rolling Stone, Greil Marcus wrote in 1969 that Morrison's lyrics were thoughtful and deeply intellectual, [...] "in {{terms of the}} myths and metaphors that exist within the world of rock and roll". He believed both the music and lyrics captured the spirit of Bob Dylan's 1967 album John Wesley Harding, while calling Astral Weeks a [...] "unique and timeless" [...] record. Rolling Stone later named it the album of the year. Melody Maker also called {{it one of the}} year's best records, featuring Morrison's [...] "small harsh voice" [...] backed by an attractive musical combo that [...] "verges on genius" [...] during [...] "Madame George". When his third album Moondance was released in 1970, Warner Bros. ran full-page advertisements remarking on the unavailability of Astral Weeks in record stores, calling it a [...] "damn shame" [...] that it [...] "ended up as <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> a critically acclaimed but obscure album ... If you want it and can't find it, yell at the store's record buyer. Loud, because you're the customer and you're always right. Undo the veils of potential obscurity." ...|$|E
500|$|James Montogomery from MTV commented: [...] "With 'Telephone', Gaga {{has entered}} the rarest of pop stratospheres, {{up there with the}} Madonnas and the Michael Jacksons." [...] Matt Donnelly from Los Angeles Times wrote that the [...] "Telephone" [...] music video is a [...] "visual feast, packed with fantastic fashion, girl fights, {{poisoned}} diner food, an army of headpieces and lots of Gaga goodness." [...] Amy Odell from New York magazine felt that [...] "This is Gaga's video, but Beyoncé is the best part: she actually shows the angry, crazy side that we just knew lurked beneath her too-perfect facade." [...] Monica Herrera from Billboard wrote: [...] " [...] more than measures up to the hype.... 'Telephone' clip is chock full of intrigue, prison fights, makeout scenes, mass poisoning and plenty of skin-baring versions of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> 'outfits'." [...] Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "Is it as good as her epic 'Bad Romance' video? Sadly, I don't think so. But it's better than anything else out there." [...] Jennifer Cady of the website E! Online praised Beyoncé's [...] "always fierce" [...] look during the video. A writer of The Huffington Post wrote, [...] "As usual there is murder, masturbation, product placement, Tarantino referencing and lots of impractical headwear." [...] In January 2015, Billboard named the video as the best music video {{of the first half of}} the 2010s (decade).|$|E

'Mustn't refuse orders in action. The Gunner was right. Empty cases are on charge. No one ought to chuck 'em away that way, but.... Damn it, {{they were all}} of 'em right! It ought to ha' been a marine. Then they could have killed him and {{preserved}} discipline at the same time." ...|$|R

2500|$|In parliament, Archer was on {{the left}} of the Conservative Party, rebelling against some of his party's policies. He {{advocated}} free TV licences for elderly people and was against museum entrance charges. Archer voted against restoring capital punishment, saying it was barbaric and obscene. In 1971, he employed David Mellor, then needing money for his bar finals, to deal with his correspondence. He tipped Mellor to reach the cabinet. In an interview Archer said, [...] "I hope we don't return to extremes. I'm <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> centre-right but I've always disliked the right wing as much as I've disliked the left wing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Paul Arendt of the BBC {{finds that}} [...] "No Country... can be enjoyed as a {{straightforward}} genre thriller" [...] with [...] "suspense sequences... that rival {{the best of}} Hitchcock", in other respects the film {{can be described as}} a western, and the question remains unsettled. For Richard Gillmore, it [...] "is, and is not, a western. It takes place in the West and its main protagonists are <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> westerners. On the other hand, the plot revolves around a drug deal that has gone bad; it involves four-wheel-drive vehicles, semiautomatic weapons, and executives in high-rise buildings, none of which would seem to belong in a western." ...|$|E
2500|$|Author Phillip Evans said in 2014 that [...] "Henderson's central {{idea was}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of {{overwhelming}} the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that, {{in the business}} world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns—scale, experience. The more you do of something, disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass {{in order to achieve}} competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. ... It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter's idea of the value chain, encompassing heterogenous elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It ain't <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> rightly <b>call</b> a plan, sir," [...] Sergeant Corney replied. [...] "It's only an idee, {{brought out}} {{by the fact that}} from this time we've got to keep a close watch on what's happenin' in this 'ere valley, unless we're willin' to be murdered in our beds. There are boys enough in the {{settlement}} to do the scoutin', leavin' the elders to stand by for defence, an' I see no good reason why they shouldn't perform full share of military duty." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Why, Mrs Peirce and I didn’t have <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> dignify by <b>calling</b> a real accident. It {{was only}} a trivial mishap. We decided {{to land on the}} water and came down {{perfectly}} from a height of 600 feet and would have made a perfect landing had not the hull of our machine struck one of the stakes that dot the water, which staved a hole in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After the new {{headquarters}} {{building was}} opened in '87 the sugar warehouse was given up, and we firemen had <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> almost <b>call</b> a college. There's a yard {{at the back}} of the building nigh on to a hundred feet square, which is put up in such shape that water can be used the same as you would at a fire, and here drills go on like this, for instance: An alarm is sent out for a certain company when they least expect it, and the men find themselves called into headquarters to show what they can do. All that you're going to see, lad, and talking about getting points, why, you can learn more there in one exhibition drill than you could at forty fires, 'cause you're understanding just how the thing is going to be done.|$|R
2500|$|Warbucks {{became much}} more {{ruthless}} in later years. After catching yet another gang of Annie kidnappers {{he announced that he}} [...] "wouldn't think of troubling the police with you boys", implying that while he and Annie celebrated their reunion, the Asp and his men took the kidnappers away to be lynched. In another Sunday strip, published during World War II, a war-profiteer expresses the hope that the conflict would last another 20 years. An outraged member of the public physically assaults the man for his opinion, claiming revenge for his two sons who have already been killed in the fighting. When a passing policeman is about to intervene, Annie talks him out of it, suggesting, [...] "It's better some times to let folks settle some questions by <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> democratic processes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since commencing {{his writing}} process in January 1973, Lucas had done [...] "various rewrites {{in the evenings}} after the day's work." [...] He would write four {{different}} screenplays for Star Wars, [...] "searching {{for just the right}} ingredients, characters and storyline. It's always been <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> a good idea in search of a story." [...] By May 1974, he had expanded the film treatment into a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a general by the name of Annikin Starkiller. He changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy, and he shifted the general into a supporting role {{as a member of a}} family of dwarfs. Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler, Han Solo, as a large, green-skinned monster with gills. He based Chewbacca on his Alaskan Malamute dog, Indiana (whom he would later use as namesake for his character Indiana Jones), who often acted as the director's [...] "co-pilot" [...] by sitting in the passenger seat of his car.|$|E
2500|$|Point Lookout {{has had a}} {{generally}} positive reception, averaging a 79 for the PC and an 83 for the Xbox 360. Eurogamer stated [...] "Like a compacted version of its parent game, {{this is the first}} DLC that has felt like a genuine expansion, as opposed to a just a few inconsequential missions thrown together." [...] IGN noted that [...] "he stories and characters here are filled with that trademark Fallout dark humor, elevating these quests to a level that rivals the main game" [...] and that [...] "he major draw to Point Lookout... is its emphasis on exploration." [...] Edge calls it [...] "the best expansion so far and the game at its worst," [...] stating [...] "if you want a microcosm of Fallout 3, equal parts adventuring, grinding, questing and scavenging, you might just think it the best expansion so far." [...] Edge goes on to criticize Point Lookout for using [...] "a lot of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> 'economy content' in Point Lookout: recycled enemies, text journals, variant weapons, and bogus forks in the storyline." ...|$|E

"'I don't mean,' said Mr. Brownsill, 'that {{you should}} take up this {{business}} for life without knowing {{whether you like it}} or not, but I can offer <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be <b>called</b> a sample situation. I want to go away for a couple of weeks to visit my relations, and if you will come and attend to the library while I am gone, it might be a good thing for both of us.

6000|$|... "God forbid {{that there}} should on those terms. You intend that your {{children}} and her children shall be--bastards. That's about it, Mr. Neville." [...] The romance seemed to vanish when the matter was submitted to him in this very prosaic manner. [...] "As to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> choose to <b>call</b> yourself, that would be nothing to me and not very much I should say, to her. I believe a man needn't be a lord unless he likes to be a lord;--and needn't call his wife a countess. But, Mr. Neville, when you have married Miss O'Hara, and when your uncle shall have died, {{there can be no}} other Countess of Scroope, and her child must be the heir to your uncle's title." ...|$|R
2500|$|Producers {{and writers}} for NCIS were {{initially}} divided {{over how to}} proceed with Tadros' character. In January 2009, some were suggesting possibly making him a relative of Ziva, an idea Cote de Pablo opposed. It was also proposed that Ziva would [...] "stop toying with [...] completely" [...] which would [...] "drive him even more insane". De Pablo relayed, [...] "We're going to play around {{with the idea that}} it could possibly be real love, and see how [...] deals with it." [...] In March, executive producer Shane Brennan stated, [...] "You've got <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> want to <b>call</b> a triangle. It's a triangle with very, very pointy ends. Someone's going to get hurt." [...] He continued, [...] "Something tragic will happen to Tony. Something tragic will happen to Ziva as well." ...|$|R

500|$|Michael Cragg of BBC Music {{wrote that}} it's [...] "surprising that she hadn't {{unleashed}} a hits collection before now given that she's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> politely <b>call</b> a 'singles artist'". He questioned the song choices, writing {{that the person}} who made the decision to not include [...] "Papi" [...] needs to have a [...] "long, hard look in the mirror", although it's [...] "hard to argue with most of what's on offer", Lopez [...] "slipping effortlessly into different guises with each song". He concluded by stating that: [...] "A cipher for good songs rather than the reasons those songs are good she may be, but there are few that do it better". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy too questioned the decisions of which songs appeared on the album, but wrote that: [...] "the very fact that she can't fit all her classics on to one disc can be seen as nothing more than a testament to her enduring career". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine pointed out that Lopez's other well or moderately charted songs such as [...] "Play", [...] "I'm Gonna Be Alright", [...] "I'm Glad", and [...] "Hold You Down" [...] were not present on the compilation, while also writing that her older hits didn't fit neatly with her newer songs and that it's sequencing was [...] "scattershot". Erlewine, nonetheless, said that [...] " [...] does have the familiar tunes, so it serves its purpose".|$|R
6000|$|... "At last I {{got down}} near the water. Just {{at the head of}} the bay was a {{shelving}} shore, and along at the sides, as far as I could see it was rocky, and there were plenty of seals here too. Along on the beach and on the rock and on the terraces were quantities of birds--penguins, as I knew from what I had heard of them. They did not try to get out of my way, but just made an angry sort of noise. 'I will talk to you presently, my hearties,' I said; 'what I have got to do now is to look for a shelter.' It was the end of April, and I knew that it would not be long before winter would be upon me, and if I was not out of it by that time I should soon be frozen stiff. I did not go near the seals, for I did not want to frighten them. I looked about the rest of that afternoon and all next day, but I could not find <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> properly <b>call</b> a cave, and so determined to make use of the best place I could fix upon. This was a spot in the lower terrace, in the face of the rock. It seemed as if the lower part was softer than the upper, which was black and hard and almost like glass. Underneath this the rock had crumbled away perhaps six feet in depth.|$|R
5000|$|Writing in Pitchfork, Jenn Pelly said, [...] "No other {{rock band}} in popular music (an {{anomalous}} statement already) has mixed styles so seamlessly—rattling and gliding from one hook to another...Haim's latticed arrangements and heavily percussive melodies make their music fly." [...] Pelly {{as well as}} several other reviewers stressed the influence of Stevie Nicks and other 1970s and '80s rock; in the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood said the album [...] "makes you believe that rock might have a future," [...] bearing [...] "the polished sound of vintage Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles, and here the sisters continue to rely on guitars and the like at a moment when many of their peers have little use for them." [...] In Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan said, [...] "You can hear the studied sense of craft all over Something to Tell You...These songs don't always explode with the sunny ebullience of the first LP, but the melodies, beats and ideas are layered and piled high." [...] In The Guardian, Kitty Empire writes, [...] "Haim really know what they are doing. There are digressions to kill for here, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> once have <b>called</b> middle eights, indefatigable melodies, and weird little noises - a horse neigh and a seagull coda on Want You Back, a fax machine on Found It in Silence, the gasping on Nothing’s Wrong - to keep you clamping your headphones to your ears in delight." ...|$|R
