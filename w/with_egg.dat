5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it <b>with</b> <b>egg</b> yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a termite begins with an egg, but is {{different}} from that of a bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, <b>with</b> <b>egg,</b> nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and go through a series of moults as they grow. In some species, eggs go through four moulting stages and nymphs go through three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and then some workers go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria can {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases {{can be grown}} in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people <b>with</b> <b>egg</b> allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when {{it may be difficult to}} acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E

5|$|Visual display was prized. Brilliant {{colors were}} {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed <b>with</b> <b>egg</b> whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish {{made to look like}} a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the Deinonychus egg's {{microstructure}} {{confirms that}} {{it belonged to}} a theropod, since it shares characteristics with other known theropod eggs and shows dissimilarities with ornithischian and sauropod eggs. Compared to other maniraptoran theropods, the egg of Deinonychus is more {{similar to those of}} oviraptorids than to those of troodontids, despite studies that show the latter are more closely related to dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus. While the egg was too badly crushed to accurately determine its size, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky estimated a diameter of about 7cm (2.7in) based on the width of the pelvic canal through which the egg had to have passed. This size is similar to the 7.2cm diameter of the largest Citipati (an oviraptorid) eggs; Citipati and Deinonychus also shared the same overall body size, supporting this estimate. Additionally, the thicknesses of Citipati and Deinonychus eggshells are almost identical, and since shell thickness correlates <b>with</b> <b>egg</b> volume, this further supports the idea that the eggs of these two animals were about the same size.|$|E
5|$|The snails mate from May through July, and {{lay eggs}} from June through July. They are hermaphroditic; however, {{it is unclear}} if self-fertilization is possible. The eggs, {{numbering}} 8 to 14, are approximately 2mm in diameter, spherical, transparent, and very distinctive within a cluster. Generally, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis eggs are not {{found to have a}} heavy gelatinous layer surrounding the entire cluster, which is associated <b>with</b> <b>egg</b> masses of Succinea sp. B. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis egg clusters are deposited at the base of plants, under matted vegetation, or in loose, wet soil. The young snails hatch in 2 to 3 weeks, measuring barely 2mm. It is still unclear when the snails mature, although Grimm (1981) believes they reach maturity in five to eight months, or the spring following hatching. At the end of their first full year of growth, snails observed by Aloi and Ringler (1982) averaged around 10mm. By the end of the following year, the adult snails were observed to reach a length of approximately 21mm; they then die, completing a life span of about 2.5 years. This life span is similar to those in captive populations (Rosamond Gifford Zoo, unpublished data).|$|E

25|$|In embryo donation, these extra embryos {{are given}} to other couples or women for {{transfer}} {{with the goal of}} producing a successful pregnancy.

25|$|Oil {{may account}} for 75% {{or more of the}} total volume. This means that the oil {{droplets}} become distorted from their normal, spherical shape. The close packing of the droplets also allow them to interact very strongly with one another. A combination of these factors gives traditional mayonnaise its high viscosity. The viscoelasticity of mayonnaise made <b>with</b> <b>egg</b> yolk reaches a maximum very quickly after preparation.|$|E

25|$|Kiwiburger – In the 1990s, New Zealand sold {{a burger}} {{reflecting}} their national icon the Kiwi. It {{was a single}} beef patty hamburger, <b>with</b> <b>egg</b> (identical to the egg in McMuffins), cheese, lettuce, tomato, beetroot, onions, ketchup ("tomato sauce") and American mustard. It came in distinctive packaging with 46 classic Kiwi quotes, Kiwiana, and Kiwi sporting icons, which were also used in promotions of the burger. Complications with the cooking of the egg {{and the use of}} certain ingredients, that no other McDonald's burger had, saw the Kiwiburger discontinued. It has occasionally returned to the menu for limited times since.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{elevation}} (PE) {{on the day}} of induction {{of final}} maturation is associated with lower pregnancy rates in IVF cycles in women undergoing ovarian stimulation using GnRH analogues and gonadotrophins. At this time, compared to a progesterone level below 0.8ng/ml, a level between 0.8 and 1.1ng/ml confers an odds ratio of pregnancy of approximately 0.8, and a level between 1.2 and 3.0ng/ml confers an odds ratio of pregnancy of between 0.6 and 0.7. On the other hand, progesterone elevation does not seem to confer a decreased chance of pregnancy in frozen–thawed cycles and cycles <b>with</b> <b>egg</b> donation.|$|E

25|$|Bazin is {{a common}} Libyan food made with wheat flour and a little plain flour, which is boiled in salted water to make a hard dough, and then formed into a rounded, smooth dome placed {{in the middle of}} the dish. The sauce around the dough is made by frying chopped onions with lamb meat, turmeric, salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, fenugreek, sweet paprika, and tomato paste. Potatoes can also be added. Finally, eggs are boiled and {{arranged}} around the dome. The dish is then served with lemon and fresh or pickled chili peppers, known as amsyar. Batata mubattana (filled potato) is another popular dish that consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered <b>with</b> <b>egg</b> and breadcrumbs.|$|E
25|$|In Hong Kong and Macau, the {{day after}} the Mid-Autumn Festival is a public holiday rather than the festival date itself (unless that date falls on a Sunday, then Monday is also a holiday), because many celebration events are held at night. There are a number of festive {{activities}} such as lighting lanterns, but mooncakes are the most important feature there. However, people don't usually buy mooncakes for themselves, but to give their relatives as presents. People start to exchange these presents well in advance of the festival. Hence, mooncakes are sold in elegant boxes for presentation purpose. Also, the price for these boxes are not considered cheap—a four-mooncake box of the lotus seeds paste <b>with</b> <b>egg</b> yolks variety, can generally cost US$40 or more. However, as environmental protection has become a concern of the public in recent years, many mooncake manufacturers in Hong Kong have adopted practices to reduce packaging materials to practical limits. The mooncake manufacturers also explore in the creation of new types of mooncakes, such as ice-cream mooncake and snow skin mooncake.|$|E
