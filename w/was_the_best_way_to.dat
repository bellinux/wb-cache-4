5|$|Married couple Jared and Jerusha Hess were co-writers and {{directors}} of the 2004 film Napoleon Dynamite, and had wanted to do an animated version since the film's release. They thought animation <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> continue the world of Napoleon Dynamite as the original actors had grown too old to play teenage characters. Following the film's success, Fox Searchlight Pictures wanted a sequel, but the Hesses delayed due to commitments to other projects and fear that audiences would tire of the Napoleon Dynamite characters.|$|E
5|$|Following the Davis Cup, Murray's {{season was}} cut short by his {{decision}} to undergo surgery, in order {{to sort out the}} lower back problems that had caused him problems since {{the early stages of the}} previous season. After being forced to withdraw from the French Open in May, the injury flared up again during the US Open and later during the Davis Cup World Group Play-offs, Murray made the decision that surgery <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> sort the problem out for the long-term. Following the conclusion of the 2013 season, Murray was voted the 2013 BBC Sport Personality of the Year, after having been heavy favourite since the nominees were announced.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, Lovato {{became a}} {{contributing}} editor for Seventeen magazine, writing an article that described her struggles. In March 2012, MTV aired a documentary, , about her rehab and recovery. She began work on her fourth album the following month. In January 2013, it was reported that Lovato had been living in a sober-living facility in Los Angeles {{for more than a year}} because she felt it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> avoid returning to her addictions and eating disorder. Lovato celebrated the five year anniversary of her sobriety on March 15, 2017. Lovato also started training in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu since 2016.|$|E
5|$|When the new Parliament {{opened in}} 1923, the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin {{suggested}} that tariff reform <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> solve Britain's economic difficulties. Unfortunately Bonar Law, his predecessor, had promised {{that there would}} be no tariff reforms introduced during the current Parliament. Baldwin felt that the only solution was to call a new general election. In the ensuing election Baldwin's Conservatives lost 88 seats, with the Labour Party gaining 47 and the Liberal Party gaining 41. This produced a hung parliament, and Labour and the Liberals formed a coalition government with Labour as the main party. Hastings himself was re-elected without difficulty, increasing his majority.|$|E
5|$|An {{engineering}} report {{dating back}} to 1961 suggested that building a bypass around the last two mainline tunnels <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> solve the congestion. The Commission awarded three contracts to construct the bypass from July 1966 to March 1967. The contracts cost $17.2 million for roadway and another $2.5 million for {{construction of a new}} Sideling Hill Service Plaza to replace the Cove Valley Service Plaza, which was along the to-be-bypassed alignment. The $2.5 million project was to include ramps from both directions to the service plaza, so it could serve both directions. The style of the tunnel bypass was to follow the same style as the Laurel Hill bypass. On November 26, 1968, the three twinned tunnels opened, and the bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels opened. The new bypass also opened the Breezewood Interchange and the number of lanes along the turnpike expanded to four (two in each direction) or five (two in each direction, plus a climbing lane going uphill).|$|E

5|$|Laudon {{wanted a}} fight, so he {{swallowed}} his differences {{and joined the}} Russians in building fortifications. Saltykov established his troops on a strong position from which to receive the Prussian attack, concentrating his force in the center, which he calculated <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> counter-act any attempt by Frederick to deploy his deadly oblique order. Saltykov entrenched himself in a position running from the Judenberge through the Grosser Spitzberge to the Mühlberge, creating a bristling line of fortifications, and faced his troops to the northwest; the Judenberge, most heavily fortified, fronted what he believed would be Frederick's approach. He and the Austrian troops were stretched along the ridge that ran from the outskirts of Frankfurt to {{just north of the}} village of Kunersdorf. Anticipating that Frederick would rely on his cavalry, the Russians effectively negated any successful cavalry charge by using fallen trees to break up the ground on the approaches.|$|E
5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter. She {{obtained}} an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing her first novel while living on state benefits. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep. In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was that taking her baby {{out for a walk}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make her fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a federally-supported {{residential}} school system relied on the expert advice of several prominent Canadian and British statesmen. Sir Peregrine Maitland, a British soldier and colonial administrator, first proposed boarding schools in 1820, believing that civilizing Indigenous children, rather than adults, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> influence cultural change. Residential schools focused on imparting industry and knowledge were proposed again in 1845 in a report that had been commissioned by Governor General Charles Bagot, entitled Report on {{the affairs of the}} Indians in Canada. Referred to as the Bagot Report, it is seen as the foundational document for the federal residential school system. It was supported by James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, who had been impressed by industrial schools in the West Indies, and Egerton Ryerson, who was then the Chief Superintendent of Education in Upper Canada.|$|E

25|$|The {{roads of}} St. Mary's County were largely unpaved and {{notoriously}} treacherous until the 1930s, and so water transportation <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> access the county. The school also received its mail and supplies by boat. Steamboats would {{pull up to}} the school dock, just below the old Statehouse grounds, as often as twice a week. For a fee they would also carry students and faculty on outings over to Piney Point, or to Virginia.|$|E

As a result, Banco de México has as its primary objective maintaining stability in the purchasing power of the peso. It sets an inflation target, which requires it to establish corresponding quantitative targets {{for the growth of}} the monetary base and for the expansion of net domestic credit.|$|E

Baron Konstantin von Neurath, the German Foreign Minister was first opposed to this arrangement, but {{he changed his mind}} when he decided that the British would never accept the 35:100 ratio; having Ribbentrop head the mission <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> discredit his rival.|$|E
25|$|Reith's autocratic {{approach}} {{became the}} stuff of BBC legend. His preferred approach was one of benevolent dictator, but with built-in checks to his power. Throughout his life, Reith remained convinced that that approach <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> run an organisation. Later Director-General Greg Dyke, profiling Reith in 2007, noted that the term Reithian has entered the dictionary to denote a style of management, particularly with relation to broadcasting. Reith summarised the BBC's purpose in three words: inform, educate, entertain; this remains part of the organisation's mission statement to this day. It has also been adopted by broadcasters throughout the world, notably the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States.|$|E
25|$|By 1850 Jung Bahadur had {{eliminated}} all of {{his major}} rivals, installed his own candidate on the throne, appointed his brothers and cronies to all the important posts, and ensured that major administrative decisions were made by himself as prime minister. At this point, he took the unprecedented step of travelling to Britain, France and Egypt leaving from Calcutta in April 1850 and returning to Kathmandu in February 1851. Although he unsuccessfully tried to deal directly with the British government while he was there, the main result of the tour was a great increase in goodwill between the British and Nepal. Recognizing the power of industrialised Europe, he became convinced that close co-operation with the British <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> guarantee Nepal's independence.|$|E
