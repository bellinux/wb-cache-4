Three wild mammals are well-established introductions: the rabbit ({{introduced in the}} mediaeval period), the red squirrel and the hedgehog (both introduced in the 19th century). The stoat (Mustela erminea) became extinct in Jersey between 1976 and 2000.

5|$|In July 2006, a cull of {{invasive}} brown rats on the Scottish island of Canna was deemed a provisional success and {{after two years}} of observation, during which time no rats were observed, the island was declared officially rat free by the Environment Minister, Mike Russell on 7 June 2008. The rats had been outcompeting the rare local <b>wood</b> <b>mouse,</b> known as the Canna mouse and also endangering local seabird populations. The National Trust for Scotland which own the island invested Â£500,000 employing exterminators from New Zealand to cull the estimated 10,000 brown rats. in co-operation with RZSS, approximately 150 Canna mice were captured and homed at Edinburgh Zoo and the Highland Wildlife Park. 40 mice were returned to the island in late 2006 with the remaining being re-introduced in stages.|$|E
40|$|Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV- 68) {{infection}} of laboratory mice (Mus musculus) is an established model of gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis. The fact that M. musculus {{is not a}} host in the wild prompted us to reassess MHV- 68 infection in <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> (Apodemus sylvaticus), a natural host. Here, we report significant differences in MHV- 68 infection in the two species: (i) following intranasal inoculation, MHV- 68 replicated in the lungs of <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> to levels approximately 3 log units lower than in BALB/c mice; (ii) in BALB/c mice, virus replication in alveolar epithelial cells {{was accompanied by a}} diffuse, T-cell-dominated interstitial pneumonitis, whereas in <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> it was restricted to focal granulomatous infiltrations; (iii) within <b>wood</b> <b>mice,</b> latently infected lymphocytes were abundant in inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue that was not apparent in BALB/c mice; (iv) splenic latency was established in both species, but well-delineated secondary follicles with germinal centers were present in <b>wood</b> <b>mice,</b> while only poorly delineated follicles were seen in BALB/c mice; and, perhaps as a consequence, (v) production of neutralizing antibody was significantly higher in <b>wood</b> <b>mice.</b> These differences highlight the value of this animal model in the study of MHV- 68 pathogenesis...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Wood</b> <b>mice</b> (genus Apodemus) {{are common}} murid rodents in the Palearctic region. In {{spite of the}} fact that they exhibit high {{phenotypic}} similarity, individual species (populations) differ in their preferred habitat (woodlands, steppes-fields, rocks) and behaviour (tendency to digging, jumping, climbing). It is therefore of special interest to evaluate interspecific (inter-population) variability in postcranial skeleton within this group and to suggest ecological interpretations of observed differences.

These trains provide improved motility in the female reproductive tract and are a means by which fertilization is promoted.|$|E

40|$|We {{analysed}} 3 independently collected datasets {{of fully}} censused helminth burdens in <b>wood</b> <b>mice,</b> Apodemus sylvaticus, testing the a priori hypothesis of Behnke et al. (2005) {{that the presence}} of the intestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus predisposes <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> to carrying other species of helminths. In Portugal, mice carrying H. polygyrus showed a higher prevalence of other helminths but the magnitude of the effect was seasonal. In Egham, mice with H. polygyrus showed a higher prevalence of other helminth species, not confounded by other factors. In Malham Tarn, mice carrying H. polygyrus {{were more likely to be}} infected with other species, but only among older mice. Allowing for other factors, heavy residual H. polygyrus infections carried more species of other helminths in both the Portugal and Egham data; species richness in Malham was too low to conduct a similar analysis, but as H. polygyrus worm burdens increased, so the prevalence of other helminths also increased. Our results support those of Behnke et al. (2005), providing firm evidence that at the level of species richness a highly predictable element of co-infections in <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> has now been defined: infection with H. polygyrus has detectable consequences for the susceptibility of <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> to other intestinal helminth species...|$|R

500|$|Birch Moss Covert {{is a small}} {{woodland}} containing birch, alder and willow trees, as well {{as various}} species of flora and fauna. The small mammal population includes the <b>wood</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus sylvaticus), which attract both kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) and sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus). Foxes, stoats, weasels, and badgers, are often seen. The area is part of Shell's estate, covering about [...] of land managed by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The trust also manages a small nature reserve located within Manchester United's training ground. This provides a habitat {{for a number of}} species including the red admiral butterfly (Vanessa atalanta), meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis), and grey partridge (Perdix perdix). Carrington Moss is home to the only recorded pairs of breeding grey partridge in Trafford. Six pairs of Eurasian bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) were recorded in 2003. The reduction in the population of these and similar birds is attributed to modern farming methods, the loss of broad hedgerows, and the lack of winter stubble. Action for Nature in Trafford has therefore included the site in its Biodiversity Action Plan. The group intends to develop Carrington Moss as a home for other species, such as reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus). Stigmella continuella (a species of moth occurring in southern and north-west England) has been observed in the area.|$|E

40|$|The {{functional}} septo-temporal (dorso-ventral) {{differentiation of}} the hippocampus {{is accompanied by}} gradients of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in laboratory rodents. An extensive septal AHN in laboratory mice suggests an emphasis on a relation of AHN to tasks that also depend on the septal hippocampus. Domestication experiments indicate that AHN dynamics along the longitudinal axis are subject to selective pressure, questioning if the septal emphasis of AHN in laboratory mice is a rule applying to rodents in general. In this study, we used C 57 BL/ 6 and DBA 2 /Crl mice, wild-derived F 1 house <b>mice</b> and wild-captured <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> and bank voles to look for evidence of strain and species specific septo-temporal differences in AHN. We confirmed the septal > temporal gradient in C 57 BL/ 6 mice, but in the wild species, AHN was low septally and high temporally. Emphasis on the temporal hippocampus was particularly strong for doublecortin positive (DCX+) young neurons and more pronounced in bank voles than in <b>wood</b> <b>mice.</b> The temporal shift was stronger in female <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> than in males, while we did not see sex differences in bank voles. AHN was overall low in DBA and F 1 house mice, but they exhibited the same inversed gradient as <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> and bank voles. DCX+ young neurons were usually confined to the subgranular zone and deep granule cell layer. This pattern was seen in all animals in the septal and intermediate dentate gyrus. In bank voles and <b>wood</b> <b>mice</b> however, the majority of temporal DCX+ cells were radially dispersed throughout the granule cell layer. Some {{but not all of}} the septo-temporal differences were accompanied by changes in the DCX+/Ki 67 + cell ratios, suggesting that new neuron numbers can be regulated by both proliferation or the time course of maturation and survival of young neurons. Some of the septo-temporal differences we observe have also been found in laboratory rodents after the experimental manipulation of the molecular mechanisms that control AHN. Adaptations of AHN under natural conditions may operate on these or similar mechanisms, adjusting neurogenesis to the requirements of hippocampal function...|$|R
40|$|Although {{epidemic}} {{infectious diseases}} are a recognized cause {{of changes in}} host population dynamics, there is little direct evidence for the effect of endemic infections on populations.
