5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> role of language in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.|$|E

Westerberg recorded a new album largely with session musicians but was persuaded to release it as a Replacements album. All Shook Down won critical praise and more mainstream attention, though the many guest players and Mars's quick departure from the band following the album's release led many to <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> band's future.|$|E
25|$|No {{historical}} cometary observation has {{yet been}} securely identified with Pons-Brooks for its next perihelion circa 1740, although some would later <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> 1742 comet. In the West a third observation was logged on July 12, 1812, by Jean-Louis Pons. Independently, this comet was later found by Vincent Wisniewski on August 1, and Alexis Bouvard on August 2 the same year. At the time no-one had brought these observations together.|$|E

For example, {{why did the}} rear seats face inward instead of outward, which {{would allow them to}} fire their weapons through ports, which some versions even lacked. The height and steepness of the dropdown stairs {{at the rear of the}} some versions can make exiting the vehicle dangerous. Troops riding in the rear can hit their heads on the ceiling while bouncing around in rough terrain.|$|E
500|$|The alto aria, [...] "" [...] (Ah, Lord, {{what is a}} human being), is {{accompanied}} by a solo oboe d'amore that [...] "expresses <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of man" [...] and God's interest in him. The aria, as the first one, is not a da capo aria, but in two parts. The idea of man in a sinful condition which is presented first, is changed to redemption. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann relates the choice of the oboe d'amore to the answer to the singer's question [...] "Why do you do all this for man?": [...] "Aus Liebe" [...] (through love).|$|E

According to Deadline Hollywood the film {{originally}} had a February 2010 release date, but it was later given an April 23, 2010, release. In March 2010, the film's release date was pushed back to September 24. Brolin stated that he hoped that audiences would <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ethics of the banking industry, asking [...] "How much is enough?," [...] he concluded, [...] "There used to be a ceiling. Now there's no ceiling". Surveys indicated that the main audience for the movie would be older adults who remembered the first film.|$|E

According to Jon Wiederhon of MTV News, [...] "Martin seems to address the {{helplessness}} {{of being in a}} dysfunctional relationship he doesn't necessarily want to escape." [...] The lyrics are cryptic; the ending lines of the second verse emphasize contradicting emotion: [...] "Come out upon my seas/Cursed missed opportunities/Am I a part of the cure/Or am I part of the disease?" [...] The song's title also [...] "metaphorically alludes" [...] to its lyrics, [...] "pushing one to <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world's obsession with time while connecting it to the theory: {{make the best of it}} when we’re here, present and alive." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, rumours arose {{that she}} would retire, and be {{replaced}} by French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld. An editor at Russian GQ reportedly introduced Russian Vogue editor Aliona Doletskaya as the next editor of American Vogue. Condé Nast responded by taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times defending her record. In that same publication, Cathy Horyn later wrote that while Wintour hadn't lost her touch, the magazine had become [...] "stale and predictable," [...] as a reader had recently complained. [...] "To read Vogue {{in recent years is}} to <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> peculiar fascination for the 'villa in Tuscany' story," [...] Horyn added. The magazine also dealt awkwardly with the recession, she commented.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the industry newsletter [...] "The Jack Myers Report" [...] harshly criticized ABC for selling the doll, and other news outlets reported the snafu. [...] Bob Tedeschi of The New York Times stated, [...] "In the charge toward e-commerce revenues, ABC learned a useful lesson last week: Don't try to sell cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists". Angela Shapiro, president of ABC, said, [...] "I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive {{to the history of}} the character and I wasn't". Another ABC executive stated, [...] "We didn't exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd. [...] We have re-evaluated and decided not to sell the doll". [...] A doll of Todd's daughter, Starr, remained in ABC stores. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times commented, [...] "I suppose ABC didn't have much of a choice but to pull the product--but I have to <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> people who voiced those protests." [...] He added, [...] "It was a stupid SOCK DOLL based on a SOAP OPERA CHARACTER.

[...] Sharkey expressed approval, stating Shank is [...] "bloody, violent, adolescently indulgent, and absolutely beautiful in execution." [...] Shea stated it is [...] "a savage game that revels in the brutality of street fighting."

2500|$|Konoe {{resigned}} on 16 October 1941, one {{day after}} having recommended Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni to the Emperor as his successor. Two days later, Hirohito chose General Tōjō as Prime Minister. In 1946, Hirohito explained this decision: [...] "I actually thought Prince Higashikuni suitable {{as chief of staff}} of the Army; but I think the appointment of a member of the imperial house to a political office must be considered very carefully.

2500|$|Some authors {{consider}} the title {{a reference to}} the Gnostic notion of an Æon, seeing the influence in the use of a demiurge in one episode, and that the relationship between the main characters parallels the Valentinian notion of a syzygy. Peter Chung, the creator, says the main character's name [...] "started out just being the name of the cartoon and then eventually it stuck, so that's her name." [...] The character Æon Flux was not meant {{to be part of the}} series, but MTV pushed to keep her in it, despite Æon dying at the end of the first batch of shorts. Chung intended the cartoon to be a reaction to heroic Hollywood action films, not as a spoof, but rather as a way to make the audience <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> wider context of these action heroes and evoke thought. Æon Flux is therefore notable as one of the very few American adult animated series to be a drama rather than a comedy.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s {{a fierce}} {{interchange}} {{took place between}} Gardner and Colin Wilson. [...] In The Quest for Wilhelm Reich Wilson wrote of this book(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, {{and in most cases}} one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> standards that make him so certain he is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be so sure that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher A. J. Ayer once remarked wryly [...] "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling. By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence. In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in The New York Review of Books describing Wilson as [...] "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene". Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding [...] "What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of CSICOP—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...". Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: [...] "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..." ...|$|E
