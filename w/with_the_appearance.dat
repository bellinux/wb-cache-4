5|$|The loss {{of species}} from {{ecological}} communities, defaunation, is primarily driven by human activity. This has resulted in empty forests, ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates. In the Quaternary extinction event, the mass die-off of megafaunal variety coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> of humans, suggesting a human influence. One hypothesis is that humans hunted large mammals, such as the woolly mammoth, into extinction.|$|E
5|$|American {{science fiction}} {{magazines}} {{first appeared in}} the 1920s <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. The beginnings of science fiction as a separately marketed genre can be traced to this time, {{and by the end of}} the 1930s the field was undergoing its first boom, but World War II and its attendant paper shortages led to the demise of several titles. By the late 1940s the market began to recover again. From a low of eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 in 1950, and a further 22 had commenced publication by 1954. Imagination was launched in the middle of this publishing boom.|$|E
5|$|As the British force {{took control}} of Santa Brigida, a Spanish {{squadron}} of four ships sailed from Vigo <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> of intending to bring Pierrepont's squadron to battle. Pierrepont immediately issued orders for his ships {{to meet with the}} Spanish who promptly turned about and returned to port without coming within range. A shore breeze enabled the British ships and their prize to extricate themselves from the Commarurto rocks without further damage. They then sailed directly for the fleet base at Plymouth, arriving on 22 October to find that Thetis and Ethalion had reached the port the day before. Dispatches were sent to Lord Bridport, commander of the Channel Fleet, which were then forwarded to the Admiralty and revealed the scale of the prize.|$|E

5|$|Over 185 extinct {{members and}} three major {{evolutionary}} radiations {{of the order}} Proboscidea have been recorded. The earliest proboscids, the African Eritherium and Phosphatherium of the late Paleocene, heralded the first radiation. The Eocene included Numidotherium, Moeritherium, and Barytherium from Africa. These animals were relatively small and aquatic. Later on, genera such as Phiomia and Palaeomastodon arose; the latter likely inhabited forests and open woodlands. Proboscidean diversity declined during the Oligocene. One notable species of this epoch was Eritreum melakeghebrekristosi of the Horn of Africa, {{which may have been}} an ancestor to several later species. The beginning of the Miocene saw the second diversification, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> of the deinotheres and the mammutids. The former were related to Barytherium and lived in Africa and Eurasia, while the latter may have descended from Eritreum and spread to North America.|$|E
5|$|The Incas {{arranged}} their empire {{to demonstrate}} their cosmology.

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origins of}} Styracosaurus were not understood {{for many years}} because fossil evidence for early ceratopsians was sparse. The discovery of Protoceratops, in 1922, shed light on early ceratopsid relationships, but several decades passed before additional finds filled in more of the blanks. Fresh discoveries in the late 1990s and 2000s, including Zuniceratops, the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, and Yinlong, the first known Jurassic ceratopsian, indicate what the ancestors of Styracosaurus may have looked like. These new discoveries have been important in illuminating the origins of horned dinosaurs in general, and suggest that the group originated during the Jurassic in Asia, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> of true horned ceratopsians occurring {{by the beginning of}} the late Cretaceous in North America.|$|E
5|$|The foederati {{make their}} first {{official}} appearance on Trajan's Column, {{where they are}} portrayed in a standardised manner, with long hair and beards, barefoot, stripped to the waist, wearing long trousers held up by wide belts and wielding clubs. In reality several different tribes supported the Romans in the Dacian wars. Their attire and weapons would have varied widely. The Column stereotypes them <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> of a single tribe, probably the most outlandish-looking, to differentiate them clearly from the regular auxilia. Judging by the frequency of their appearance in the Column's battle scenes, the foederati were important contributors to the Roman operations in Dacia. Another example of foederati are the 5,500 captured Sarmatian cavalrymen sent by Emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–180) to garrison a fort on Hadrian's Wall after their defeat in the Marcomannic Wars.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Wipha, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Goring, was the strongest typhoon to {{threaten}} the Chinese coastline since Typhoon Saomai in August 2006. Forming out of a tropical disturbance on September15, 2007, it quickly developed into a tropical storm, and intensified into a typhoon the following day <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> of an eye feature. After a period of rapid intensification, Wipha attained its peak intensity on September18, with winds of 185km/h (115mph) and a barometric pressure of 925mbar (hPa), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. Later that day, the storm began to weaken as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan before brushing {{the northern edge of}} the island. Wipha subsequently made landfall near Fuding along the Fujian-Zhejiang provincial border with winds estimated at 185km/h (115mph) by the JTWC. Shortly thereafter, the typhoon weakened as it moved inland, weakening to a tropical storm within 18hours of moving over land.|$|E
5|$|After the Fort Worth tornado dissipated, another {{thunderstorm}} {{developed over}} Johnson County, tracking northeastward into Tarrant County and eventually merging with the supercell that had produced the earlier F3tornado. The new development prompted the re-issuance of the tornado warning for Tarrant County at 6:40p.m. CST (00:40UTC). At 7:05p.m. CST (01:05UTC), the Arlington tornado touched down on South Cooper Road, causing initial {{damage to a}} restaurant; the tornado's touchdown coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> of a tornado vortex signature on radar imagery. Well-built homes within a residential area along Embercrest Drive sustained widespread damage, with some houses experiencing up to F3-rated damage; such damage occurred after garage doors failed, allowing tornadic winds to unroof homes and push out exterior walls. As a consequence, homes that faced the tornadic winds sustained more damage than homes whose attached garages were sheltered from the strong winds. After crossing Matlock Road, the tornado did additional damage to one- and two-story homes in another subdivision, producing F3damage. Many homes suffered the collapse of brick masonry walls due to poor construction as they were not properly anchored to the homes' frames. The tornado then swept across northern portions of the Arlington Municipal Airport, dealing F2damage before briefly paralleling Interstate 20. At 7:12p.m. CST (01:12UTC), the tornado crossed the interstate, overturning at least one 18-wheeler. The twister continued to track northeast, causing F2damage to a subdivision northeast of Grand Prairie Municipal Airport in Dallas County before dissipating at 7:20p.m. CST (01:20UTC).|$|E

This land-use persists north to the Highway407 ETR interchange, a multi-level stack interchange with two flyovers. North of Highway407, the freeway crosses Highway7, where the HOV lanes transition to standard through lanes.

North of Wellington Street, the highway reduces in width to four lanes, which is its configuration north through East Gwillimbury. The route continues, passing east of the community of Sharon, eventually curving northeast and terminating at an at-grade intersection with Woodbine Avenue immediately south of Ravenshoe Road (York Regional Road32).|$|E

The base from which Aeron explores the Thirteen Towers is the Observatory, a building {{on the edge of}} the Scar. In the Observatory, Aeron can save his progress, and interact with Elena and the merchant Mavda. The main objective when inside the Thirteen Towers is the reach the Masters, powerful monsters housed at the top of each tower in a locked room which act as the game's bosses. These rooms must be accessed by solving puzzles throughout each Tower to unlock the door. On his way through the Towers, Aeron must fight numerous smaller enemies: he can perform a basic melee attack, and a charged attack which deals higher damage and will trigger additional attacks if the player times a button press <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> of a targeting ring around Aeron.|$|E
5|$|The Green Goblin is {{armed with}} a variety of bizarre devices. He wears a green costume {{underneath}} bulletproof chainmail with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses. The Green Goblin's trademark weapons are his pumpkin bombs and razor bats. As their name suggests, the bombs were designed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> of jack-o'-lanterns. These varied in function from smoke bombs to traditional explosives, while the razor edged bat-shaped boomerangs-could cut through very durable surfaces and materials. The gloves of the Goblin uniform were fashioned with minuscule conductors that allowed for the release of electricity at nearly 10,000 amps of an undetermined voltage. Originally, Osborn used a mechanical broomstick to fly through the air during his first few exploits as the Green Goblin. The Flying Broomstick did not last long, however, and was improved upon, creating the Goblin Glider. The Goblin Glider was a more efficient flight system than Norman's Flying Broomstick. The Glider allowed the Goblin to carry a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser/launcher with him as he flew and had much greater speed and mobility than the Broomstick.|$|E
5|$|The game begins <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>appearance</b> of {{the four}} {{youthful}} Light Warriors, the heroes of the story, who each carry one of the darkened Orbs. Initially, the Light Warriors {{have access to the}} Kingdom of Coneria and the ruined Temple of Fiends. After the Warriors rescue Princess Sara from the evil knight Garland, the King of Coneria builds a bridge that enables the Light Warriors' passage east to the town of Pravoka. There the Light Warriors liberate the town from Bikke and his band of pirates and acquire the pirates' ship for their own use. The Warriors now embark on a chain of delivery quests on the shores of the Aldi Sea. First, they retrieve a stolen crown from the Marsh Cave for a king in a ruined castle, who {{turns out to be the}} dark elf Astos. Defeating him gains them the Crystal Eye, which they return to the blind witch Matoya in exchange for a herb needed to awaken the Elf Prince cursed by Astos. The Elf Prince gives the Light Warriors the Mystic Key, which is capable of unlocking any door. The key unlocks a storage room in Coneria Castle which holds TNT. Nerrick, one of the Dwarves of the Cave of Dwarf/Dwarf Village, destroys a small isthmus using the TNT, connecting the Aldi Sea to the outside world.|$|E
