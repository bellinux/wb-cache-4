Despite his many commissions, however, Stuart was habitually neglectful of finances and <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> being sent to debtors' prison. In 1787, he fled to Dublin, Ireland where he painted and accumulated debt with equal vigor.|$|E

5|$|After {{twenty minutes}} {{fighting}} both Victory and Temeraire, the Redoutable {{had been reduced}} to a floating wreck. Temeraire had also suffered heavily, damaged when Redoutables main mast fell onto her poop deck, and having had her own topmasts shot away. Informed that his ship <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> sinking, Lucas finally called for quarter to the Temeraire. Harvey sent a party across under the second lieutenant, John Wallace, to take charge of the ship.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{only two}} players left from the {{championship}} team, McNamara and Syracuse struggled through the 2005–2006 regular season. Two highlights were the 38 points McNamara scored against Davidson College, the second-most points ever scored by a Syracuse player at the team's home arena, the Carrier Dome, and a 30-point performance against the visiting Louisville Cardinals. Syracuse finished with a losing record in the Big East; the team <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> missing the NCAA Tournament unless it secured the conference's automatic bid by winning the Big East's postseason tournament.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the change}} in Code Letters in 1934, Centaur was {{allocated}} the Code Letters GMQP. A highlight of Centaurs pre-war career was the rescue of the 385ton Japanese whale-chaser Kyo Maru II in November 1938. Kyo Maru II had developed boiler problems while returning from the Antarctic and was drifting towards the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, where she <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> being wrecked by the reefs in the area. Centaur responded to the distress signal and towed Kyo Maru II to Geraldton.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1918 the cathedral <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> an attack by the Turks. Prior to the May 1918 Battle of Sardarabad, which took place just {{miles away from the}} cathedral, the {{civilian}} and military leadership of Armenia suggested Catholicos Gevorg (George) V to leave for Byurakan for security purposes, but he refused. The Armenian forces eventually repelled the Turkish offensive and set the foundation of the First Republic of Armenia.|$|E

5|$|Produced by NBCUniversal, Friday Night Lights premiered on October 3, 2006, and aired for {{two seasons}} on NBC. Although the show had {{garnered}} critical acclaim and passionate fans, the series suffered low ratings and <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> cancellation {{after the second}} season. To save the series, NBC {{struck a deal with}} DirecTV to co-produce three more seasons; each subsequent season premiered on DirecTV's 101 Network, with NBC rebroadcasts a few months later. The series ended its run on The 101 Network on February 9, 2011, after five seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{meetings}} of the Puerto Rican Independence movement which met in St. Thomas were discovered by the Spanish authorities {{and the members of}} the movement were either imprisoned or exiled. In a letter dated October 1, 1824, which Venezuelan rebel leader José María Rojas sent to María de las Mercedes Barbudo, Rojas stated that the Venezuelan rebels had lost their principal contact with the Puerto Rican Independence movement in the Danish island of Saint Thomas and therefore the secret communication which existed between the Venezuelan rebels and the leaders of the Puerto Rican independence movements <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> being discovered.|$|E

5|$|The season {{aired on}} Thursdays at 9:00pm ET in the United States, {{and was the}} first season to air on The CW {{television}} network, a joint venture of The WB and UPN. The previous season was broadcast on The WB. It averaged only about 3.14million American viewers, and <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> not being renewed. The cast and crew garnered many award nominations, but the episodes received mixed reviews from critics. While both the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors and the decision to finish the main storyline were praised, the formulaic structure of the episodes was criticized.|$|E
5|$|At midnight the 2nd OBLI were {{attacked}} by a force of tanks and infantry. One of the battalion positions at {{the eastern side of}} the road bridge was overrun, and had to be recaptured with a counter-attack. Another attack two hours later <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> capturing the bridge, so Brigadier Bellamy ordered it blown up. German infantry attempted to infiltrate the brigade's positions throughout the night. At 05:30 German armour was detected approaching and the brigade called in close air support from RAF Typhoon fighter bombers, which destroyed several tanks. The main road bridge, held by 1st RUR, was attacked at 07:00 by infantry and two tanks. The attack failed when the tanks were destroyed by the division's anti-tank guns. Later that day infantry from the 15th Scottish Infantry Division, supported by tanks, had advanced to the divisional area and took over the brigade's position. At the same time the division was ordered to prepare to advance eastwards from dawn on 26 March.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Cooper {{made her}} Paralympic debut at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona. She <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> {{not going to the}} 1992 Paralympics because of funding issues for the Australian Paralympic Federation. The Federation made an {{emergency}} appeal for funding from the public in order {{to cover the cost of}} transporting the Australian team to Barcelona. A variety of small donations allowed Cooper and other Australian athletes to compete. She won three gold and two silver medals, and broke two world records and three Paralympic records. She was offered a non-residential Australian Institute of Sport Athletes with a Disability swimming scholarship in 1993 and was supported until 2000.|$|E

5|$|Aurora's {{passage from}} the ice towards safety proved slow and perilous. Coal {{supplies}} had to be conserved, allowing only limited use of the engines, and the improvised emergency rudder made steering difficult; the ship wallowed helplessly at times, in danger of foundering. Even after making {{contact with the outside}} world, Stenhouse was initially reluctant to seek direct assistance, fearful that a salvage claim might create further embarrassment for the expedition. However, he was obliged to request help when, as Aurora neared New Zealand in stormy weather on 31 March, it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> being driven on the rocks. Two days later the tug Dunedin reached the ship and a towline was secured. On the following morning, 3 April 1916, Aurora was brought into the harbour at Port Chalmers.|$|E
5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> sinking.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the heavier}} {{concentration}} of Japanese surface combat vessels and their well-positioned logistical base at Simpson Harbor, Rabaul, and their {{victory at the}} Battle of Savo Island in early August, the Japanese had established operational control over the waters around Guadalcanal at night. However, any Japanese ship remaining within range—about —of American aircraft at Henderson Field, during the daylight hours, <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> damaging air attacks. This persisted for the months of August and September, 1942. The presence of Admiral Scott's task force at Cape Esperance represented the U.S. Navy's first major attempt to wrest night time operational control of waters around Guadalcanal away from the Japanese.|$|E
