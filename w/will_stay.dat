5|$|This {{cockatoo}} usually lays {{a clutch}} of one to two eggs. It generally takes 28 to 29 days for the female to incubate the eggs, and the young fledge ten to eleven weeks after hatching. The young <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> with the family until the next breeding season, and sometimes even longer. The family leaves the nesting site after the young fledge until the following year. Carnaby's black cockatoo forms flocks when not breeding, with birds in drier habitats usually being more migratory than those in wetter ones. It flies with deep and slow wingbeats, generally high above trees. Seeds of plants of the families Proteaceae and, to a lesser extent, Myrtaceae form {{a large part of}} its diet.|$|E

5|$|In 2010–11, the Temple Owls men's {{basketball}} team {{were in their}} 29th season {{as a member of}} the Atlantic 10 Conference. Since 1997, the team has played their home games at the Liacouras Center, which has a capacity of 10,206. In their previous season, an Atlantic 10 Preseason Poll predicted that Temple Owls would finish fifth in the conference, tied with Duquesne. Despite the low expectations, the Owls were tied with Xavier atop the Atlantic 10 standings with a 14–2 conference record, and won their third straight Atlantic 10 tournament title. The team drew a five seed in the 2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where they lost to 12 seed Cornell in the first round, 78–65, and finished with a record of 29–6. Head coach Fran Dunphy was rewarded with a contract extension on May 5, 2010 and <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> with Temple Owls until the 2017–18 season.|$|E
5|$|Other seals, {{like the}} walrus and most phocids, breed on ice with {{copulation}} usually {{taking place in}} the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice. Some of these species are serially monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and hooded seal. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.|$|E

5|$|The game changes however if the {{government}} credibly promises to subsidize the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2. Suppose {{the government}} promises a subsidy of twenty million, {{regardless of whether the}} foreign firm also enters or not. In that case, if the foreign firm enters the domestic firm will lose ten million from entry costs but will be more than compensated by the government subsidy, ending up with a net payoff of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter of course, it is still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> out of the market itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E
5|$|The {{regular season}} has been changed in almost every season that Asia League has been in operation. The first full season mirrors the two most recent seasons in which all teams play all other teams six times. With the number of teams {{changing}} from season to season {{in the first few}} years the league adjusted the schedule each year which often included an unbalanced schedule. Under the current schedule all teams make an away visit to each other team's home rink for a three-game series and also play a three-game series against that team at their own home rink. In order to minimize travel, teams traveling to other countries <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> there for two weeks and play two teams, except in the case of China who only has one team. Teams going to Japan will play against the Cranes and Eagles on the same trip as they are geographically close together, then in another trip play against the Free Blades and Ice Bucks.|$|E

5|$|Half a {{year after}} the Lindisfarne trip, Pete and Jenny have separated. He moves from house to house, {{eventually}} finding a houseshare with a gay landlord. He has a brief fling with Ramona, which is followed by some dates with a teacher (Pooky Quesnel). Jenny begins a relationship with a dotcom millionaire (Ben Miles), who decorates her house with flowers and takes her on a trip to New York. The fling ends when Jenny realises he does not love her. She and Pete reconcile after briefly considering a divorce. David and Karen bring home their newborn twins, and Karen's ex-pat mother (Mel Martin) moves in for a couple of episodes. Karen is reunited with an old boyfriend (Richard Dillane), who is in Manchester for a photography exhibition. Karen is rivalled by Jenny, who has returned to working to pay the bills while Pete is living elsewhere. David takes a sudden interest in politics after meeting local residents' activist Jessica (Yasmin Bannerman). He starts an affair with her but she dumps him after being offended by his insensitivity when he tries to end it. Karen finds out about the affair in Episode 8 but is adamant that she and David <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> together for the children.

They decide to get married instead but Adam is briefly tempted when he reunites with a long-lost love (Victoria Smurfit) on his stag weekend to Belfast.|$|E
5|$|In {{that same}} year, Edmund Grey, {{the son of}} a Marick family maid and gardener, returns to town to see his {{childhood}} friend, Angelique. Dimitri is furious to see Edmund again since he had stolen money from Dimitri's father to pay for his education. Dimitri is stunned when Edmund informs him that they are half-brothers. Edmund had discovered this when he found a will of Hugo Marick that states he is not only his illegitimate son, but that he is the lawful heir to Wildwind. Helga had planted the will because she believed Dimitri was going to leave Angelique for Erica. When Dimitri assures Helga he <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> with Angelique, she destroys the will {{in order to keep the}} estate for her daughter. Edmund accuses Dimitri of stealing the will and files a lawsuit to have Hugo's body exhumed in order to perform a DNA test. Dimitri believes Edmund is lying about everything and is infuriated by the lawsuit. The hatred between the two deepens even more. Eventually, the truth about what Helga did is revealed and she dies. Dimitri and Edmund agree to put the past behind them and they bond as brothers. They develop an extremely close and loving relationship, but they also continue to have a standing rivalry.|$|E
5|$|Moe and Renee seem to form {{a strong}} relationship, but Moe is {{insecure}} about his hold on her and he feels he must spend {{large amounts of money}} so she <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> with him. Upon maxing out his credit card, Moe comes up with a scheme to commit insurance fraud by having Homer steal his car and park it on train tracks so it would be destroyed. The night the scheme is supposed to take place, Moe and Renee attend a police charity event aboard a yacht; the event's attendance by all the officers in town ensures Homer will not get caught perpetrating the scheme, and gives Moe an alibi so that no one will suspect he was behind the act. Homer botches the plan by stopping to watch a drive-in movie, while the train they were counting on to destroy Moe's car passes by. Deciding all is not lost, Homer drives the car over a cliff — but his attempt to exit the car before it sinks into the water below fails. The car ends up sinking just near the yacht where the police charity event is taking place, and when Homer swims to the surface, he is arrested.|$|E
