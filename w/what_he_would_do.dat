5|$|He {{was known}} for his support of {{representative}} democracy and his populist style. For example, he would hold town halls and let constituents vote on motions to decide <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> in Congress on their behalf and these meetings helped Bedell understand the problems of his constituents; as a result, he backed issues that were important to his farming constituency, such as waterway usage fees and production constraints.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{tracks the}} casino robber {{down to a}} {{volunteer}} police officer. She has evidence, and the police comes to arrest him. However, they don’t find the necklace. At the hospital, Keith hesitates when O’Dell asks him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if Veronica were in danger. Veronica gets her necklace back from the perpetrator’s daughter. Because he gave bone marrow, the ex-husband now has a much more favorable divorce settlement. Veronica tracks down the suspect in the photo, Wang Yi, but his roommate tells Veronica that he is Claire’s boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{participated in}} the May 15 GOP debate, where he {{discussed}} his insistence to trim bureaucracy in the federal government, and {{his support for the}} advancements made in stem cell research, lauding the achievements of the his alma mater University of Wisconsin–Madison in the field. He was asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> {{in the event of a}} looming preemptive attack against a hypothetical anti-American nation promoting terrorism. The candidate quoted former Secretary of State Colin Powell reflecting the need to be sure the intelligence was correct, to deploy the right amount of troops and to make sure that an exit strategy was planned. Following the debate, Thompson campaigned in New Hampshire before taking a break for the rest of the month.|$|E

His family moved down soon afterwards, but his council house in Hamilton was burgled about eight weeks after they moved. Jean wanted to return to Scotland, and Stein accepted her desire in light of his own disillusionment with the problems at the club. When asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> by the Llanelli manager, Stein said he would probably quit football and become a miner again.|$|E
25|$|Thayer {{was advised}} by Worth {{regarding}} the events at North Barracks. Captain Hitchcock and Lieutenant Thornton were bruised, while several cadets suffered minor injuries, and Fitzgerald suffered a hand injury. Worth told Thayer that between fifty and ninety cadets {{had been involved}} in the mutiny. Later that day, Thayer met with Gouverneur Kemble, an ordnance manufacturer in Cold Spring, New York, to discuss different items, including the events at West Point. Kemble asked Thayer <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> about the misconduct, to which Thayer replied he did not know.|$|E

25|$|Dost Mohammad Khan also {{fought against}} Diye Bahadur, a Rajput general and Mughal subedar (governor). Diye Bahadur's forces {{initially}} defeated Khan's army, which fled from the battlefield. A badly wounded Khan, {{who had lost}} one of his brothers in the battle, was taken prisoner. He was well-treated by the Rajputs, and was presented before Diye Bahadur after recuperating from his wounds. Diye Bahadur offered Khan a position in his own forces, but Khan declined, while expressing gratitude for Bahadur's kindness. When asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if set free, Khan replied that he will wage another battle against Diye Bahadur. Bahadur, impressed by the Khan's bravery, released him. A few months later, Khan defeated Diye Bahadur with his newly raised force.|$|E
25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger was ripped off and the doctors had to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would never see again. Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with no idea of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> next. He then overheard a doctor and a nurse discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his doctor if the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} December 1744, Saxe had {{prepared}} {{plans for a}} spring offensive in the Low Countries. He had {{made up his mind}} not only as to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> but what he would compel his enemy to do, correctly calculating the operational and political difficulties that such a diverse opponent would face. This opponent comprised Britain, the Dutch Republic, Austria, and Saxony, who had concluded the defensive Treaty of Warsaw in January 1745 – the Quadruple Alliance – by which all contractants committed themselves to uphold the Pragmatic Sanction and the House of Austria's claim to the imperial crown. To the Low Countries, the British sent the son of King George II, the 24-year-old Duke of Cumberland, as the new captain general of Britain's army, while Maria Theresa sent the experienced Count Königsegg to command Austrian forces. The trio of generals was completed by Prince Waldeck, commander of the Dutch contingent in theatre. They hoped to gain the initiative by the establishment of forward magazines and an early opening of the campaign season. Major supply and ammunition depot magazines were set up for the British by General Ligonier at Ghent, Oudenarde and Tournai, while the Dutch general, Vander – Duyn, placed theirs at Mons, Charleroi and Tournai.|$|E

25|$|Haig {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the War Cabinet (7 January). He claimed to have recommended that the British should keep the initiative and draw in German reserves (to prevent a German attack on the French) by renewing the offensive around Ypres, and that this proposal did not meet with political approval. In fact the logistical infrastructure was not available for a breakout from the Ypres salient, and {{there is no mention of}} his suggestion in the official minutes. The minutes do agree with Haig's account that he warned only of limited German offensives. After the meeting Robertson, who had also been present and who had been concerned that Haig had not got his point across, insisted that Haig submit a paper warning of the danger of a major German offensive. Over lunch (9 January) at 10 Downing Street with Lord Derby (Secretary of State for War) and Lloyd George (Derby bet a skeptical Lloyd George 100 cigars to 100 cigarettes that the war would be over by the following year), Haig predicted that the war would end within a year because of the “internal state of Germany” (a broadly accurate prediction). Charteris’ final intelligence report had deduced that Germany was bringing 32 divisions, ten per month, from the moribund Eastern Front, so the most likely time for a German Offensive was in late March (again, a correct prediction). Bonar Law (Chancellor of the Exchequer and Conservative Leader) asked Haig <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if he were a German general: Haig replied that any German attempt to “break through” would be a “gambler’s throw” as Germany had only a million men as reserves and the balance of manpower would shift in favour of the Allies in August (i.e. when more US troops had arrived - in fact this would happen a month or two earlier as US deployment was speeded up after the German Spring Offensives) and that if he were a German general he would launch only limited offensives, although he did warn that the German generals might try to keep the civilians out of power by launching an attack to knock out France. Haig again left the politicians with the impression that he thought the Germans would launch small attacks on the scale of Cambrai.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} at Congress, Bedell took efforts to uphold {{representative}} democracy.

[...] In response to a question about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if he became prime minister, Lewis stated that he would nationalize the CPR. [...] Despite this answer and his socialist views in general, his responses to the board's cross-examination satisfied them that he was not a communist, and they awarded him the scholarship.|$|E

Schaffner added: [...] "True, the critics had been unfair, even vicious. But one could only hope George would rise above them, {{and produce a}} work good enough to fake them all out.

Disney has pursued the film rights to her Mary Poppins stories for twenty years, having promised his daughters that he would produce a film based on them. Travers has steadfastly resisted Disney's efforts because she fears <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> to her character. However, she has not written anything in a while and her book royalties have dwindled to nothing, so she risks losing her house. Still, Russell has to remind her that Disney has agreed to two major stipulations—no animation and unprecedented script approval—before she agrees to go.|$|E

500|$|In 1975, after George Moscone {{had been}} elected Mayor, he {{appointed}} Charles Gain as his Chief of Police. Gain, whose conciliatory position towards African Americans had branded {{him as one of}} the most liberal law enforcement officers in the country, soon earned the ire of the police force. Gain implemented policies that proved unpopular with his staff, such as painting police cars powder blue, and barring officers from drinking on the job. His lenient policies towards gays also angered the police force. When asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if a gay police officer came out, Gain replied [...] "I certainly think that a gay policeman could be up front about it under me. If I had a gay policeman who came out, I would support him 100 percent." [...] This statement sent shockwaves through the police department, and made national headlines. Made during the first week of Gain's tenure, the remark also made Mayor Moscone extremely unpopular with the police. The two were so intensely disliked by the police that in 1977 rumors circulated about a plan by right-wing police officers to assassinate Gain, and a year later similar plans formed targeting Mayor Moscone. Upon being informed of this threat, Moscone hired a bodyguard.|$|E
500|$|The next month, Hunter {{participated in}} the third GOP debate, {{featured}} on CNN.

[...] At the end of the debate, Hunter took the opportunity to criticize the three frontrunners: John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, and Mitt Romney.
