Clean water was unavailable, and power outages were expected to last for weeks.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his sophomore}} year, {{he signed a}} three-year, {{entry-level}} contract with the Canadiens on May 22, 2003. Higgins made his NHL debut on October 11, 2003, registering three minutes of ice time in a 4–0 win against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Struggling to play his <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> the Canadiens' lineup, he was often made a healthy scratch (non-dressing player) in October before being assigned to the team's minor league affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey League (AHL), {{by the end of}} the month. He recorded 48 points over 67 AHL games in 2003–04, ranking fifth in team scoring. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Higgins automatically remained in Hamilton and improved to 51 points, ranking third among Bulldogs scorers.|$|E

On the very next pitch to Molina, he hit it 387 feet into the left field seats for a go-ahead grand slam. This was the 5th grand slam of his career, tying him with Tim McCarver for second-most career grand slams by a Cardinals catcher.

Four laps later, Harvick passed Montoya for fourteenth. On lap 132, Keselowski fell to ninth after being passed by Kurt Busch and Hamlin. On lap 147, Bowyer's lead of over seven seconds was reduced to nothing when the pace car moved on track. During the caution, which was caused by debris, most of the leaders made pit stops.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the mid-1990s, the Daddies toured constantly, {{carrying}} out six cross-country tours in 1996 alone following {{the release of}} their third independent album, Kids on the Street. A remarkable musical departure from their previous work, Kids on the Street was primarily a showcase of the ska influences which had gradually become {{a major part of}} the Daddies' live sound, forgoing their usual brassy funk and swing-based eclecticism in favor of guitar-driven ska, rock and punk. Distributed by noted indie label Caroline Records, Kids on the Street wound up becoming the Daddies' then-most successful release, remaining on The Rockets Retail Sales Top Twenty for over seven months and eventually working its <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> Rolling Stones Alternative Charts.|$|E

5|$|About {{halfway between}} Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức, White {{and the rest}} of the column climbed a {{mountain}} where they cleared the jungle to create a landing zone, and called for helicopters to evacuate the survivors. A flight of CH-46 Sea Knights later arrived and, in a scene that would be repeated at Khâm Đức, chaos descended on the allied formation as Nung and U.S personnel fought their <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> the helicopters. Some of the Nung soldiers had to be thrown off because the helicopters quickly reached their limit capacity; eventually U.S. aircrews had to dump some of their equipment overboard to accommodate the last remaining Nungs on the landing zone. By 08:00, the evacuation of the Ngok Tavak survivors was completed, and White immediately flew out to Đà Nẵng along with the two Australian Warrant Officers after they arrived in Khâm Đức. The fight at Ngok Tavak, though short in duration, took a heavy toll on the allied forces. An unknown number of Nung soldiers and 12 U.S. military personnel were killed, and 52 (including two U.S. Army and 21 U.S Marines) were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Kalākaua's Masonic ties as Master of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie {{would give}} him a global brotherhood in his travels.

As the King made his <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> the ship, many in the crowd at the dock reached out to touch him. Major George W. Macfarlane, his aide-de-camp, would accompany them as far as California. The King traveled as Aliʻi Kalākaua and as Prince Kalākaua, rather than in his capacity as head of state. The intent was to give the impression of a personal vacation, thereby avoiding the large costly retinue required for official business. The Royal Hawaiian Band, the Hawaiian army, and a large contingent of well-wishers bid them farewell as the City of Sydney sailed out.|$|E
5|$|To {{play for}} an inter-county GAA team, Canavan {{had to work}} around a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) bylaw, because of a dispute in his parish, Errigal Ciarán. Two clubs claimed to {{represent}} the parish, the established Ballygawley St. Ciaran's club and the newly formed club, then called Errigal Ciaran Naomh Malachai. Players from the Errigal team were not recognised as being GAA members, because the club failed to register correctly. Canavan registered {{as a member of}} the Killyclogher hurling club, even though he didn't play the sport, just so he would be eligible for selection for the Tyrone minors. Prior to that, he had not played legitimate club football, but had forged his <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> the Tyrone under-age teams with his performances at school level.

5|$|With Cooke dead, Cumby assumed command. Bellerophons decks {{had largely}} been cleared by French fire, and {{boarding}} parties {{began to make}} their <b>way</b> <b>onto</b> the ship. Several French sailors climbed out onto Bellerophons spritsail yard, but a Bellerophon crewman released the brace holding the yard, causing them {{to fall into the}} sea. French sailors holding onto Bellerophons rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. Bellerophons ensign had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest Union Jack he could find and climbed up into the mizzen rigging and hoisted it across the shrouds. The French riflemen on Aigle reportedly held their fire as he did this, in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting hand to hand at the gunports, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into Bellerophon exploded in the gunner's storeroom, blowing open the door but fortunately blowing closed the door of the magazine. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.|$|E
5|$|East of San Diego, US 80 {{followed}} {{the path of}} El Cajon Boulevard through La Mesa and then onto Main Street near downtown El Cajon before heading towards the Mountain Springs grade. The route was realigned from Arnold <b>Way</b> <b>onto</b> Alpine Boulevard as it passed through Alpine and the Viejas Indian Reservation, before entering the Laguna Mountains and the Cleveland National Forest on the alignment used by I-8. At Laguna Junction, a cafe for travelers existed from 1916 until when the building was taken down to provide land for the interchange with I-8. A section of old US 80 — with the first few miles signed as SR 79 — continues to serve as access to the communities of Descanso, Guatay and Pine Valley; SR 79 intersected US 80 east of Descanso. At the time, the Ellis Wayside Rest provided a rest area for travelers; later, the state recognized it as a historic site. Exiting the national forest, US 80 continued in a southeasterly direction towards Live Oak Springs and Boulevard, intersecting with the eastern terminus of SR 94. US 80 then came close to the Mexican border as it curved around the Jacumba Mountains and into the hot spring town of Jacumba. East of there, US 80 passed by the Desert View Tower.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Few {{works are}} {{available}} in the literature to define similarity criteria between First-Order Logic formulæ, where the presence of relations causes various portions of one description to be possibly mapped in different <b>ways</b> <b>onto</b> another description, which poses serious computational problems. Hence, the need for a set of general criteria that are able to support the comparison between formulæ. This could have many applications; this paper tackles the case of two descriptions (e. g., a definition and an observation) to be generalized, where the similarity criteria could help in focussing on the subparts of the descriptions that are more similar and hence more likely to correspond to each other, based only on their syntactic structure. Experiments on real-world datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposal, and the efficiency of the corresponding implementation in a generalization procedure. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{availability}} of techniques for comparing descriptions has many applications in Artificial Intelligence, ranging from description selection to flexible matching, from instance-based learning to clustering. Due {{to the complexity}} of handling First-Order Logic formulæ, where the presence of relations causes various portions of one description to be possibly mapped in different <b>ways</b> <b>onto</b> another description, few works are available in the literature for this kind of representations. This paper tackles the case of Conceptual Clustering, where a new approach to similarity evaluation, based on both syntactic and semantic features, is exploited to support the task of grouping together similar items according to their relational description. After presenting a framework for Horn Clauses (including criteria, a function and composition techniques for similarity assessment), classical clustering algorithms are exploited to carry out the grouping task. Experimental results on real-world datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposal. ...|$|R
40|$|For a {{wide variety}} of applications, both task and data {{parallelism}} must be exploited to achieve the best possible performance on a multicomputer. Recent research has underlined the importance of exploitingtask and data parallelism in a single compiler framework, and such a compiler can map a single source program in many different <b>ways</b> <b>onto</b> a parallel machine. There are several complex tradeoffs between task and data parallelism, depending on the characteristics of the program to be executed, most significantly the memory and communication requirements, and the performance parameters of the target parallel machine. In this paper, we isolate and examine the specific characteristics of programs that determine the performance for different mappings on a parallel machine, and present a framework for obtaining a good mapping. The framework is applicable to applications that process a stream of input, and whose computation structure is fairly static and predictable. We describe three applica [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The walkers' passes of Nan Bield and Gatescarth {{provided}} historic {{trade routes}} from Mardale to Kentmere and Longsleddale respectively.

The upper sections still bear the original zig-zags over steep ground. The fell is most frequently climbed from Mardale, as there is road access along the shore of Haweswater. Harter Fell summit is 1 mile or 1.5 km southwest and 1,800 ft or 550 m above the carpark {{at the head of}} the reservoir. Crags block a direct ascent, however, and Harter Fell is thus normally climbed via Gatescarth Pass to the east of the summit, or Nan Bield Pass to the west. These two passes also provide the easiest access from Kentmere or Longsleddale.|$|R
