500|$|First Rejewski {{tackled the}} problem of {{discovering}} the wiring of the rotors. To do this, according to historian David Kahn, he pioneered the use of pure mathematics in cryptanalysis. Previous methods had largely exploited linguistic patterns and the statistics of natural-language texts—letter-frequency analysis. Rejewski applied techniques from group theory—theorems about permutations—in his attack on Enigma. These mathematical techniques, combined with material supplied by Gustave Bertrand, chief of French radio intelligence, enabled him to reconstruct the internal <b>wirings</b> of the machine's rotors and nonrotating reflector. [...] "The solution", writes Kahn, [...] "was Rejewski's own stunning achievement, one that elevates him to the pantheon of the greatest cryptanalysts of all time." [...] Rejewski used a mathematical theorem—that two permutations are conjugate {{if and only if}} they have the same cycle structure—that mathematics professor and Cryptologia co-editor Cipher A. Deavours describes as [...] "the theorem that won World War II".|$|E

5000|$|The third lunar landing {{expedition}} Apollo 13 in April 1970, was aborted and {{the lives}} of the crew, James Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, were threatened by failure of a cryogenic liquid oxygen tank en route to the Moon. The tank burst when electrical power was applied to internal stirring fans in the tank, causing the immediate loss of all of its contents, and also damaging the second tank, causing the loss of its remaining oxygen in a span of 130 minutes. This in turn caused loss of electrical power provided by fuel cells to the command spacecraft. The crew managed to return to Earth safely by using the lunar landing craft as a [...] "life boat". The tank failure was determined to be caused by two mistakes. The tank's drain fitting had been damaged when it was dropped during factory testing. This necessitated use of its internal heaters to boil out the oxygen after a pre-launch test, which in turn damaged the fan <b>wiring's</b> electrical insulation, because the thermostats on the heaters did not meet the required voltage rating due to a vendor miscommunication.|$|R

50|$|That {{solution}} {{was an extraordinary}} feat. Rejewski did it without knowing the plugboard permutation or the rotor <b>wirings.</b> Even after solving for the six permutations, Rejewski {{did not know how}} the plugboard was set or the positions of the rotors.

5000|$|Slot {{insulation}} is {{the common}} name for shielding material used for the rotor inside a power generator.

50|$|The chief fleet {{communications}} {{code system}} {{used by the}} Imperial Japanese Navy was called JN-25 by the Americans and by early 1942, they had made considerable progress in decrypting Japanese naval messages. The Japanese {{are said to have}} obtained an Enigma machine in 1937, although it is debated whether they were given it by the Germans or bought a commercial version which apart from the plugboard and internal <b>wirings,</b> was the German Heer/Luftwaffe machine. The Japanese did not use it for their most secret communications, having developed a similar machine.|$|E
5000|$|A {{plugboard}} {{was used}} on the famous Enigma machine; it was not removable. In this case the plugboard acted as a [...] "fourth rotor" [...] in the rotor machine's workings. Plugboard <b>wirings</b> {{were part of the}} [...] "day settings" [...] that specified which rotors to insert into which slot, and which plugboard connections to make. In practice the plugboard did improve the security of the cypher being generated, but as it did not change with every keypress, unlike the rotors, its impact was limited. See Cryptanalysis of the Enigma.|$|E
50|$|The {{current entry}} wheel (Eintrittswalze in German), or entry stator, connects the {{plugboard}} to the rotor assembly. If the plugboard is not present, the entry wheel instead connects the keyboard and lampboard to the rotor assembly. While the exact wiring used is of comparatively little importance to security, it proved {{an obstacle to}} Rejewski's progress during {{his study of the}} rotor <b>wirings.</b> The commercial Enigma connects the keys in the order of their sequence on a QWERTZ keyboard: Q''''A, W''''B, E''''C and so on. The military Enigma connects them in straight alphabetical order: A''''A, B''''B, C''''C, and so on. It took inspired guesswork for Rejewski to penetrate the modification.|$|E
5000|$|While it {{is usually}} assumed that a supergun will {{automatically}} play JAMMA-compatible arcade boards, many systems support additional features not provided by JAMMA. The most common additional feature is <b>wirings</b> for extra buttons.

Regardless of the method used, these extra connections fall into the generic name JAMMA+. JAMMA only provides for three buttons per controller, but games requiring wiring for extra buttons have become common enough that many superguns support this out of the box as well.|$|E
50|$|At this point, Rejewski {{ran into}} {{difficulties}} {{due to the}} large number of unknowns in the set of equations that he had developed.

5000|$|Using the {{knowledge}} that the first three letters of a message were the same as the second three, Polish mathematician-cryptologist Marian Rejewski was able to determine the internal <b>wirings</b> of the Enigma machine and thus to reconstruct the logical structure of the device. Only general traits of the machine were suspected, from the example of the commercial Enigma variant, which the Germans were known to have been using diplomatically. The military versions were sufficiently different that they presented an entirely new problem. Having done that much, it was still necessary to check each of the potential daily keys to break an encrypted message (i.e., a [...] "ciphertext"). With many thousands of such possible keys, and with the growing complexity of the Enigma machine and its keying procedures, this was becoming an increasingly daunting task.|$|E
