5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Verbascum has not undergone any significant revision since Svanve Mürbeck's monographies in the 1930s, {{with the exception}} of the work of Arthur Huber-Morath, who used informal group in organizing the genus for the florae of Iran and Turkey to account for many intermediate species. Since Huber-Morath's groups are not taxonomical, Mürbeck's treatment is the most current one available, as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or molecular data extensively to the genus. In Mürbeck's classification, V.thapsus is placed in section Bothrospermae subsect. Fasciculata (or sect. Verbascum subsect. Verbascum depending on nomenclatural choices) alongside species such as Verbascum nigrum (black or dark mullein), Verbascum lychnitis (<b>white</b> <b>mullein)</b> and Verbascum sinuatum (wavy-leaved mullein).|$|E
50|$|This site {{lies within}} the Exmoor National Park, and {{contains}} extensive areas of heathland communities. Associated particularlywith the coastal communities and woods are {{a wide range}} of nationally rare and scarce plants. The site comprises four separate blocks (between Combe Martin and Minehead) centred on Trentishoe, Cosgate Hill, Countisbury and North Hill. There are two nationally rare, endemic whitebeam species which occur in the woodland areas namely Sorbus subcuneata and Sorbus vexans. Several nationally scarce plant species are found within this site; <b>white</b> <b>mullein</b> (Verbascum lychnitis) in its yellow form occurs in fields {{at the edge of the}} site, Cornish moneywort (Sibthorpia europaea) beside streams, rock stonecrop (Sedum forsteranum) on rocky seacliffs and sea storksbill (Erodium maritinum), upright chickweed (Moenchia erecta) and bird's-foot clover (Trifolium ornithopodioides) all in areas of very short turf. A nationally rare butterfly the high brown fritillary (Argynnis adippe) occurs on this site.|$|E
50|$|The Formal Garden is an {{elliptical}} {{flower garden}} ringed with American Holly (Ilex opaca), Eastern White Pine (Pinus strobus), Norway Spruce (Picea abies), Sawara Cypress (Chamaecyparis pisifera), Manitoba Maple (Acer negundo), Copper Beech (Fagus sylvatica), Common Horse-chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), and White Ash (Fraxinus americana), {{as well as}} rose <b>mullein,</b> <b>white</b> daisies, primroses, black-eyed susans, daylilies, purple veronica, balloon flowers, verbena, asters, chrysanthemums, {{and an assortment of}} annuals.|$|R
6000|$|In this Billerica solid {{men must}} have lived, select {{from year to}} year; a series of town clerks, at least; and there are old records that you may search. Some spring the white man came, built him a house, and made a {{clearing}} here, letting in the sun, dried up a farm, piled up the old gray stones in fences, cut down the pines around his dwelling, planted orchard seeds brought from the old country, and persuaded the civil apple-tree to blossom next to the wild pine and the juniper, shedding its perfume in the wilderness. Their old stocks still remain. He culled the graceful elm from out the woods and from the river-side, and so refined and smoothed his village plot. He rudely bridged the stream, and drove his team afield into the river meadows, cut the wild grass, and laid bare the homes of beaver, otter, muskrat, and with the whetting of his scythe scared off the deer and bear. He set up a mill, and fields of English grain sprang in the virgin soil. And with his grain he scattered {{the seeds of the}} dandelion and the wild trefoil over the meadows, mingling his English flowers with the wild native ones. The bristling burdock, the sweet-scented catnip, and the humble yarrow planted themselves along his woodland road, they too seeking [...] "freedom to worship God" [...] in their way. And thus he plants a town. The <b>white</b> man's <b>mullein</b> soon reigned in Indian cornfields, and sweet-scented English grasses clothed the new soil. Where, then, could the Red Man set his foot? The honey-bee hummed through the Massachusetts woods, and sipped the wild-flowers round the Indian's wigwam, perchance unnoticed, when, with prophetic warning, it stung the Red child's hand, forerunner of that industrious tribe that was to come and pluck the wild-flower of his race up by the root.|$|R
40|$|Glomus intraradices and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens are two commercially used {{plant growth}} {{promoting}} micro-organisms. They associate with plant roots to facilitate host plants to absorb nutrients, induce resistance against pathogens and pests, and regulate growth through phytohormones. Growth conditions for plants on green roofs are often unfavorable. In order {{to test whether}} growth and development of green roof plants could be enhanced via improving the microbial interface, G. intraradices and B. amyloliquefaciens were inoculated on experimental plots on a green roof {{in the summer of}} 2012. The experimental plots were marked as R (inoculated with B. amyloliquefaciens from Rhizocell), M (inoculated with G. intraradices from MYC 4000), and C (control). The green roof was made of sedum-herb-grass mats. The plants included e. g. stonecrops, bluegrasses, yellow rockets, <b>white</b> clover, <b>mullein,</b> pennycress, and moss. The survival and development of G. intraradices and B. amyloliquefaciens were studied respectively from Poa alpina roots and soils in the summers of 2012 and 2013. G. intraradices was not detected in P alpina roots according to root staining and microscopy. Probable reasons for the lacking of G. intraradices include high phosphorus content in the soils, high soil temperature, and low soil moisture. PCR and qPCR were used to detect Bacillus content in green roof soils. The abundance of B. amyloliquefaciens was related to soil water content and soil temperature. During the last two measurements in 2012, 4 weeks of high moisture content in the soil resulted in large increase of B. amyloliquefaciens content in both M and R groups, but then decreased substantially due to drought and heat in 2013. In 2013, Only R group increased from the third to the last measurement, indicating probable resistance of the B. amyloliquefaciens strain from Rhizocell additive. The synergistic effect of B. amyloliquefaciens and G. intraradices might be responsible for the thousand-fold increase of Bacillus content in M group in 2012...|$|R
