5|$|The marshall's moans of pain get worse, {{disturbing}} the other survivors. Eventually he asks to see Kate alone, {{and when she}} enters the tent, the marshal asks what Kate <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> before he was knocked unconscious during the crash. Kate tells him {{she wants to make}} sure Ray gets his reward. The marshal laughs, telling Kate that she is one of a kind, and then asks if he is going to die. Kate nods, and he asks if she is going to do it. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters with the gun, and a gunshot is heard. Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that the marshal asked to be killed. Muffled coughs are then heard, and it is revealed that Sawyer's shot missed the marshal's heart and pierced his lung, causing him more pain. Jack then euthanizes the marshal, presumably by suffocating him.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Gaffney visited Fish in Sing Sing, {{accompanied}} by Detective King {{and two other}} men. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> about her son's death, but Fish refused to speak to her. Fish began to weep and asked to be left alone. After two hours of asking him questions through his lawyer, James Dempsey, Mrs. Gaffney gave up. She was still unconvinced that Albert Fish was her son's killer.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1962, Olivia died of measles {{encephalitis}} at age seven. Her death left Dahl [...] "limp with despair", {{and gave}} him a feeling of guilt that he could not do anything for her. Dahl subsequently became a proponent of immunisation and dedicated his 1982 book The BFG to his daughter. After Olivia's death, Dahl lost faith in God and viewed religion as a sham. While mourning her loss he had sought spiritual guidance from the former Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher, but became dismayed when Fisher told him that although Olivia was in Paradise, her beloved dog Rowley would never join her there, with Dahl recalling: [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> how he could be so absolutely sure that other creatures did not get the same special treatment as us. I sat there wondering if this great and famous churchman really knew {{what he was talking about}} and whether he knew anything at all about God or heaven, and if he didn't, then who in the world did?" ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{few years}} later her friend Mary Hanford Ford related some of what took place meeting `Abdu'l-Bahá as a second hand account. A few facts are {{detailed}} - Farmer had met `Abdu'l-Bahá and accepted the religion on one occasion, and on another <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> {{a series of questions}} {{in the context of a}} review of her whole life - but when she wrote it all down she left the notebook in the hurry of being called to come to him in the early morning. She reported he answered the questions spontaneously and in the right order starting in such a way that the translator was confused because no question had been asked. At the end of that interview she cried [...] "…strange tears of ecstatic happiness, and went to her room to recover the composure which had been shaken by these surprising and illuminating events." [...] This list of questions is referred to in another briefer recollection. Anise Rideout had a similar record of the incident. Rideout reports that `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote an inscription in Farmer's Bible dated March 26. For Maria Wilson's part she also joined the religion and was the first Bahá'í to move to Boston.|$|E
60|$|But she {{was willing}} to sit and talk to Mr. Burke, for she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> some {{questions}} about Mrs. Cliff. She had heard about that lady's new house, or rather the improvement to her old one, and she had driven past it, and she did not altogether understand the state of affairs.|$|E
6000|$|The doctor {{crossed over}} to Horton, {{who sat in}} a corner. [...] "If there is {{anything}} you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> lose no time," [...] he said. [...] "The man can't last until the morning." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{found the}} family-tree-man, {{whose name was}} Brandish, {{in a small room}} not too clean, over a shop not far from St. Paul's Churchyard. He had another business, which related to patent poison for flies, and at first he thought I had come to see him about that, but when he found out I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> about my family tree his face brightened up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{except that}} I couldn't get Mr. Valborg {{to say a}} word. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> about the suit Mr. Hicks is making for my husband. But he insisted on singing. Still, it was restful, {{floating}} around {{on the water and}} singing. So happy and innocent. Don't you think it's a shame, Mrs. Bogart, that people in this town don't do more nice clean things like that, instead of all this horrible gossiping?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Clementina <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> if Mrs. Milray {{had said}} {{anything}} to him about her, but she could not, {{and he did not}} speak again till he heard her stir in rising from her chair. Then he said, [...] "I haven't forgotten that letter to my sister, Clementina. I will give it to you before we leave the steamer. Are you going to stay in Liverpool, over night, or shall you go up to London at once?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} the matter has passed the bounds of a doctor's orders. I would go and force my way into his {{presence}} without the slightest scruple. I know that any news that he may glean about Luke, {{within the next few}} days, will be far more fatal to him, than the few questions which I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, if I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> {{anything}} I have {{to write}} it. I'm slow at writing, and bad at writing, and he isn't always patient. However, as you reminded me just now, I {{have got to get}} the things ready. To cut it short, perhaps I might say that I didn't quite expect the tea-party would come off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Americans are old {{of their}} age. I have met some at Mr. Roper's. Oh, {{and do you}} know, Mrs. Roper told Aunt Mary that these Travises are quite millionaires, and that this youth's mother was a prodigious Mexican heiress.

I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to help me. I have never met him, or his daughter either; but my father and Mr. Prim have been friends for many years.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a good}} day, {{with only}} one or two drizzles in the morning, and we had not gone far before I found that the Wye was more of a river than I thought it was, though never any bigger than a creek. It was just about warm enough for a boat trip, though the old man told us there had been a [...] "rime" [...] that morning, which made me think of the [...] "Ancient Mariner." [...] The more the boatman talked and made queer jokes, the more I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> his name; and I hoped he would say David Llewellyn, or at least David, and as a sort of feeler I asked him if he had ever seen a coracle. [...] "A corkle?" [...] said he. [...] "Oh, yes, ma'am, I've seen many a one and rowed in them." ...|$|E
6000|$|She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> something. She would detain {{him only}} a few minutes. The {{questions}} she put to him had been suggested to her by something she had read that morning--a most meager and unsatisfactory passage. She held in her hand the volume which, although she did not tell him so, had taken her a half-hour to select in Mr. Petter's book room. Shortly they were seated together, and he was answering her questions which, as she knew, related to the most interesting experiences of his life. As he spoke his eyes glistened and her soul warmed. He did not wish that this should be so. He wanted to bring this interview to an end. He was nervously anxious {{to go back on}} the lawn, that he might see Miss Mayberry when she came out of doors; that he might show her the lines of [...] "Pickwick" [...] which he had put into Greek, and which she was to turn back into English.|$|E
50|$|Damon (Ian Somerhalder) {{tries to}} deal with the truth about Katherine on his own way; partying with girls. Stefan {{interrupts}} them because he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> about Isobel (Mia Kirshner) but Damon says he does not know her and goes back to partying. Meanwhile, Caroline (Candice Accola) is with Matt (Zach Roerig) at his place and while they are making out, his mother Kelly (Melinda Clarke) gets in. Caroline leaves and Matt catches up with his mother.|$|R
6000|$|All through dinner {{he noticed}} that Sylvia seemed to be {{watching}} <b>him,</b> as if <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> something. She looked very soft in her white frock, open at the neck; and her hair almost the colour of special moonlight, so goldy-pale; and he <b>wanted</b> her <b>to</b> understand that it wasn't a bit because of {{her that he had}} been out alone all day. After dinner, when they were getting the table ready to play 'red nines,' he did murmur: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What does it matter, Lady Lovel? We {{have got}} to get a promise from her, somehow. Since she was much with him, she has seen people of another sort, and she will feel the difference. It may be that she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> release her. At any rate she speaks as though she might be {{released}} by what he would say to her. Unless she thought it might be so herself, she would not make a conditional promise. I would let them meet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{give you}} my honour it had done me good--it rested my brain.' He {{appeared}} to intimate that with an intelligence so active as his these periods of repose were providential. Lyon thought his story very striking, but he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> whether he had not shammed a little--not in relating it, but in keeping so quiet. He hesitated however, in time, to imply a doubt--he {{was so impressed with}} the tone in which Colonel Capadose said that it was the turn of a hair that they hadn't buried him alive. That had happened to a friend of his in India--a fellow who was supposed to have died of jungle fever--they clapped him into a coffin. He was going on to recite the further fate of this unfortunate gentleman when Mr. Ashmore made a move and every one got up to adjourn to the drawing-room. Lyon noticed that by this time no one was heeding what his new friend said to him. They came round {{on either side of the}} table and met while the gentlemen dawdled before going out.|$|E
60|$|We always {{sat on the}} {{verandah}} in the afternoon, when we {{were not}} visiting or being visited. I made a pretence of fancy work, and Aunt Philippa spun diligently on a little old-fashioned spinning-wheel that had been her grandmother's. She always sat before the wood stand which held her flowers, and the gorgeous blots of geranium blossom and big green leaves furnished a pretty background. She always wore her shapeless but clean print wrappers, and her iron-grey hair was always combed neatly down over her ears. Joseph sat between us, sleeping or purring. She spun so expertly that she could keep a close watch on the road as well, and I got the biography of every individual who went by. As for the poor young Methodist minister, who liked to read or walk on the verandah of our neighbour's house, Aunt Philippa never had a good word for him. I had met him once or twice socially and had liked him. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to call but dared not--Aunt Philippa had vowed he should never enter her house.|$|E
60|$|When dusk {{actually}} closed, {{and when}} Adele left {{me to go}} and play in the nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it. I listened for the bell to ring below; I listened for Leah {{coming up with a}} message; I fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the door, expecting it to open and admit him. The door remained shut; darkness only came in through the window. Still it was not late; he often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six. Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many things to say to him! I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> plainly if he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt; and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret. It little mattered whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill. Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy restraint; this suited both him and me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him,</b> Amos," [...] {{said the}} seaman, [...] "why we are yawing and tacking here when {{we should be}} {{cracking}} on all sail to stand after them?" ...|$|R
50|$|Veres {{had many}} {{conflicts}} with the HírTV, which supports the conservative right-wing politics and the biggest opposition party, Fidesz. On 19 December 2006 he head the reporter, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>asking</b> <b>him.</b> Two years later, on March 2008 he shoved away the correspondent deliberately. On {{the next day the}} two journalists appeared at the press conference in a visibility waistcoat. Then Veres declared that the HírTV's colleagues can't approach him. The minister repeatedly threatened the channel with a judicial lawsuit, when the reporters asked about his sons' charge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Condor," [...] Wilkinson said, as the master's mate {{sprang to}} his feet, [...] "you won't do {{yourself}} any good by quarrelling {{with a fellow}} who has just come on board. He has certainly said nothing offensive to you. Moreover, {{it is quite possible}} that the captain may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> questions about Egypt, and if he had any marks on the face you may be pretty sure you would get such a wigging that you would never want another, and possibly you might never have a chance of getting one." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{had become}} of it however when Mr. Offord passed away like any {{inferior}} person--was relegated to eternal stillness after {{the manner of a}} butler above-stairs? His aspect on the event--for the several successive days--may be imagined, and the multiplication by funereal observance of the things he didn't say. When everything was over--it was late the same day--I knocked {{at the door of the}} house of mourning as I so often had done before. I could never call on Mr. Offord again, but I had come literally to call on Brooksmith. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> if there was anything I could do for him, tainted with vagueness as this inquiry could only be. My presumptuous dream of taking him into my own service had died away: my service wasn't worth his being taken into. My offer could only be to help him to find another place, and yet there was an indelicacy, as it were, in taking for granted that his thoughts would immediately be fixed on another. I had a hope that he would be able to give his life a different form--though certainly not the form, the frequent result of such bereavements, of his setting up a little shop. That would have been dreadful; for I should have wished to forward any enterprise he might embark in, yet how could I have brought myself to go and pay him shillings and take back coppers, over a counter? My visit then was simply an intended compliment. He took it as such, gratefully and with all the tact in the world. He knew I really couldn't help him and that I knew he knew I couldn't; but we discussed the situation--with a good deal of elegant generality--at the foot of the stairs, in the hall already dismantled, where I had so often discussed other situations with him. The executors were in possession, as was still more apparent when he made me pass for a few minutes into the dining-room, where various objects were muffled up for removal.|$|E
6000|$|Newman met young Madame de Bellegarde two {{or three}} times, always roaming about with graceful vagueness, as if {{in search of an}} {{unattainable}} ideal of amusement. She always reminded him of a painted perfume-bottle with a crack in it; but he had grown to have a kindly feeling for her, based on the fact of her owing conjugal allegiance to Urbain de Bellegarde. He pitied M. de Bellegarde's wife, especially since she was a silly, thirstily-smiling little brunette, with a suggestion of an unregulated heart. The small marquise sometimes looked at him with an intensity too marked not to be innocent, for coquetry is more finely shaded. She apparently <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> something or tell him something; he wondered what it was. But he was shy of giving her an opportunity, because, if her communication bore upon the aridity of her matrimonial lot, he was at a loss to see how he could help her. He had a fancy, however, of her coming up to him some day and saying (after looking around behind her) with a little passionate hiss, [...] "I know you detest my husband; let me have the pleasure of assuring you for once that you are right. Pity a poor woman who is married to a clock-image in papier-mache!" [...] Possessing, however, in default of a competent knowledge of the principles of etiquette, a very downright sense of the [...] "meanness" [...] of certain actions, it seemed to him to belong to his position to keep on his guard; {{he was not going to}} put it into the power of these people to say that in their house he had done anything unpleasant. As it was, Madame de Bellegarde used to give him news of the dress she meant to wear at his wedding, and which had not yet, in her creative imagination, in spite of many interviews with the tailor, resolved itself into its composite totality. [...] "I told you pale blue bows on the sleeves, at the elbows," [...] she said. [...] "But to-day I don't see my blue bows at all. I don't know what has become of them. To-day I see pink--a tender pink. And then I pass through strange, dull phases in which neither blue nor pink says anything to me. And yet I must have the bows." ...|$|E

Unless the man's a perfect scoundrel {{he will be able}} to answer them satisfactorily, and my having {{discovered}} his whereabouts will not harm him. If, on the other hand, he cannot answer those questions, why, then, you may take my word for it, M. de Cartienne, that he's an unmitigated blackguard, perfectly unworthy of your friendship, and undeserving of the slightest consideration from you." ...|$|R
