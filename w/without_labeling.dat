40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that mere words, {{particularly}} affective words, can dampen emotional responses. However, the effect of affective labels on emotional responding in the long term is unknown. The authors examined whether repeated exposure to aversive images would lead to more reduction in autonomic reactivity a week later if the images were exposed with single-word <b>labels</b> than <b>without</b> <b>labels.</b> In Experiment 1, healthy individuals were exposed to pictures of disturbing scenes with or <b>without</b> <b>labels</b> on Day 1. On Day 8, the same pictures from the previous week were exposed, this time <b>without</b> <b>labels.</b> In Experiment 2, participants were spider fearful and were exposed to pictures of spiders. In both experiments, although repeated exposure to aversive images (<b>without</b> <b>labels)</b> led to long-term attenuation of autonomic reactivity, exposure plus affective labels, but not nonaffective labels, led to more attenu-ation than exposure alone. Thus, affective labels may help dampen emotional reactivity in both the short and long terms. Implications for exposure therapy and translational studies are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Static light {{scattering}} (SLS) measures {{changes in the}} Rayleigh scattering of protein complexes in solution and can characterize both weak and strong interactions <b>without</b> <b>labeling</b> or immobilization of the proteins or other biomacromolecule. The composition-gradient, multi-angle static {{light scattering}} (CG-MALS) measurement mixes a series of aliquots of different concentrations or compositions, measures {{the effect of the}} changes in light scattering {{as a result of the}} interaction, and fits the correlated light scattering changes with concentration to a series of association models in order to find the best-fit descriptor. Weak, non-specific interactions are typically characterized via the second virial coefficient. For specific binding, this type of analysis can determine the stoichiometry and equilibrium association constant(s) of one or more associated complexes, including challenging systems such as those that exhibit simultaneous homo- and hetero-association, multi-valent interactions and cooperativity.|$|E

5000|$|Several recent methods {{allow for}} the quantitation of {{proteins}} by mass spectrometry (quantitative proteomics). Typically, stable (e.g. non-radioactive) heavier isotopes of carbon (13C) or nitrogen (15N) are incorporated into one sample while {{the other one is}} labeled with corresponding light isotopes (e.g. 12C and 14N). The two samples are mixed before the analysis. Peptides derived from the different samples can be distinguished due to their mass difference. The ratio of their peak intensities corresponds to the relative abundance ratio of the peptides (and proteins). The most popular methods for isotope labeling are SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture), trypsin-catalyzed 18O labeling, ICAT (isotope coded affinity tagging), iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation). “Semi-quantitative” mass spectrometry can be performed <b>without</b> <b>labeling</b> of samples. Typically, this is done with MALDI analysis (in linear mode). The peak intensity, or the peak area, from individual molecules (typically proteins) is here correlated to the amount of protein in the sample. However, the individual signal depends on the primary structure of the protein, on the complexity of the sample, and on the settings of the instrument. Other types of [...] "label-free" [...] quantitative mass spectrometry, uses the spectral counts (or peptide counts) of digested proteins as a means for determining relative protein amounts.|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} and prognostic value of microRNAs (miRNAs) {{in a variety}} of diseases is promising. The novel silicon nanowire (SiNW) biosensors have advantages in molecular detection because of their high sensitivity and fast response. In this study, poly-crystalline silicon nanowire field-effect transistor (poly-SiNW FET) device was developed to achieve specific and ultrasensitive detection of miRNAs <b>without</b> <b>labeling</b> and amplification. The poly-SiNW FET was fabricated by a top-down Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) wafer fabrication based technique. Single strand DNA (ssDNA) probe was bind {{to the surface of the}} poly-SiNW device which was silanated and aldehyde-modified. By comparing the difference of resistance value before and after ssDNA and miRNA hybridization, poly-SiNW device can be used to detect standard and real miRNA samples. Poly-SiNW device with different structures (different line width and different pitch) was applied to detect standard Let- 7 b sample with a detection limitation of 1 fM. One-base mismatched sequence could be distinguished meanwhile. Furthermore, these poly-SiNW arrays can detect snRNA U 6 in total RNA samples extracted from HepG 2 cells with a detection limitation of 0. 2 μg/mL. In general, structures with pitch showed better results than those without pitch in detection of both Let- 7 b and snRNA U 6. Moreover, structures with smaller pitch showed better detection efficacy. Our findings suggest that poly-SiNW arrays could detect standard and real miRNA sample <b>without</b> <b>labeling</b> or amplification.
