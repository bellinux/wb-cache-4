40|$|Compared to {{traditional}} areas of finance, academics and practitioners have devoted {{less attention to}} <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management. Although <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management {{is an integral part}} of corporate finance and contributes to the success of operational, financing and investment decisions, this area of corporate finance is relatively unexplored in the finance literature. To this effect, the Finance and Treasury Association of Australia has been promoting research in this area in order to raise awareness among academics and practitioners. This thesis aims to contribute to the literature and examine the latest <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management practices of Australian firms. This thesis proposes a new approach that reconciles traditional <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management with risk management principles. By extending the traditional <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> approach, this research develops a risk-adjusted <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> model and examines the determinants of <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> for Australian firms over the period 2003 - 2008. Using dynamic panel data estimation and median regression techniques, this study finds mixed evidence supportive of the risk-adjusted <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> model. Sectoral analysis reveals heterogeneous <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> patterns. It also identifies the sectors with high reliance on cash and inventory. After controlling for fundamental factors (such as sales, size, leverage and profitability), significant differences in <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> practices are apparent. Firms with low-leverage appear to hold higher cash holdings than high-leverage ones. The evidence provided does not support the window dressing hypothesis. The second section of this thesis examines the determinants of corporate profitability for publicly listed Australian firms by using three measures of corporate profitability namely, net profit, economic value added and return on assets. Through dynamic panel estimation technique, the determinants of corporate profitability are tested. Using panel least squares methods, median regression methodology and after controlling for sectoral variations, the findings shows that the determinants of corporate profitability vary across Australian sectors. The analysis is extended to control for firm’s fundamental characteristics such as <b>working</b> <b>capital,</b> corporate governance ratings and performance, and the results are still supportive of heterogeneous determinants. It is discernable that firms with the worst <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> deficit exhibit a significant negative relationship to debt ratio. The same significant negative relationship is observed between firms with poor corporate governance ratings and debt ratio. Profitable firms on the other hand have a tendency to hold positive cash holdings, whereas non- profitable firms tend to exhibit negative cash holdings. Cash flow adequacy is one of the critical factors influencing corporate <b>credit</b> decisions. Since <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> deals with short-term cash flows, this thesis explores the interaction between <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> and corporate <b>credit</b> ratings. By employing <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> and firm’s characteristics as explanatory variables, this study examines the determinants of corporate credit ratings. Following a rigorous data selection process, corporate credit ratings of Australian firms are collected from Standard &amp; Poor’s for the period 2003 - 2008. By employing ordered logit models, this thesis provides evidence on the determinants of corporate credit ratings. Empirical evidence suggests that <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> influences corporate <b>credit</b> ratings and this research shows that cash, inventory and size are determinants of corporate credit ratings...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature by documenting labor income share fluctuations in emerging economies and proposing an explanation for them. We show that emerging markets differ from developed markets in terms of changes in the labor share over the business cycle. Labor share is more volatile in emerging markets and is pro-cyclical with output, especially in countries facing counter-cyclical interest rates. On the contrary, labor share in developed markets is more stable and slightly counter-cyclical with output. A frictionless RBC model cannot account for these facts. We introduce working capital into an RBC model, which generates liquidity need for labor payments. The main result is that the behavior of the cost of borrowing along with working capital mechanisms can predict the right sign of the comovement between labor share and output, and can partly be responsible for the volatility of labor share. We also show that imperfect financial markets in the form of credit restrictions not only amplify the results for the variability of labor share but also help better explain some of the striking business cycle regularities in emerging markets such as strongly pro-cyclical investment and counter-cyclical net exports. labor income share, emerging markets, <b>working</b> <b>capital,</b> <b>credit</b> constraints...|$|E

This gap in financing found in Latin America is important because SMEs contribute to a dynamic growing economy. When we compare Brazil, Mexico, and Chile as a group to the non-regional counterparts of Korea and Spain, we find fewer funds available for investment, weaker legal protections, and less developed human capital. When we compare across countries, we find that Brazil’s heavy government involvement and bureaucracy imposes high costs that stifle SME growth and private sector efficiency, while Mexico lacks strong financial guidelines and protections necessary for a nascent SME sector. Chile represents a strong partnership with a proactive and involved government partnering with commercial banks and SMEs in order to grow a healthy SME financial sector.

We studied shrimp farming in a rural region in Bangladesh where formal microlending is well established, but where more expensive informal microlending coexists with the formal schemes. Farmers - both those who exclusively use formal loans and those who also use informal loans - remain credit-constrained; both types overutilize labour {{in order to reduce the}} need for <b>working</b> <b>capital.</b> However, the <b>credit</b> constraint is actually milder for the informal borrowers: the implicit shadow price of <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> is substantially higher in the group that only takes formal loans than in the group that also uses informal loans. These results suggest that informal lenders - with their closer ties to the individual farmers - remain more successful in identifying those smallholder farmers that are most likely to use the borrowed funds successfully. Informal lenders have an information advantage that formal microlenders lack: the latter need to find routes to access this information in order for formal microcredit schemes to succeed. ...|$|R
