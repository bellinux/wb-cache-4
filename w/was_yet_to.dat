5|$|In July 2009 the {{receivers}} {{determined that the}} company was insolvent. With a complex business structure to unravel, some commentators expect it may take years for the company's collapse to be fully resolved. By April 2010, timber company Gunns had taken over as the responsible entity running most of Great Southern's pulpwood schemes, but the land on which they were being grown <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> be sold.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Woodruff joined the Australian Army Medical Corps. He stayed in Melbourne until he finished his Master of Surgery Degree in 1941. At that time, {{he was assigned to}} the Tenth Australian Army General Hospital in Malaya as a captain in the Medical Corps. According to Woodruff, his time in Malaya was quiet and relatively leisurely as the war in the Pacific <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> begin in earnest. However, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor changed the situation and he was posted to a casualty clearing station where he worked as an anaesthetist, before being transferred into the Singapore General Hospital. A Japanese offensive resulted in the fall of Singapore and Woodruff was taken prisoner along with thousands of other Australian and British personnel.|$|E
5|$|By 1974, the {{majority}} of the freeway that US-64 was to occupy in Tulsa was complete, and it was relocated onto the completed portion of the freeway. Only the portion in the downtown section of the city <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> be completed. The remainder of the freeway, the concurrency with Interstate 444, was not completed until about 1983. The next and final major modification to the designation of US-64 took place when it was moved from its route through eastern Tulsa onto the newly constructed Creek Turnpike over the first half of 1992. The route has undergone only minor changes since then.|$|E

5|$|For the 1937–38 cricket season, Miller {{transferred}} to the VCA Colts, where he won the team's batting trophy for having the best average. At this stage, his method of playing was slow and steady accumulation of runs. Late in the summer, he made his first-class debut for Victoria and hit 181 against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In 1938–39, he rejoined South Melbourne and also played four further matches for Victoria, scoring 125 runs {{at an average of}} 25.00. However, he <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> play in the Sheffield Shield competition, having appeared only in one-off matches.|$|E
5|$|Funding {{shortfalls}} have constrained {{the development}} of the F-FDTL. The government has been forced to postpone plans to form an independent company stationed in the Oecussi enclave and two reserve infantry battalions. These units formed {{an important part of the}} King's College report's option3 force structure and their absence may have impacted on East Timor's defence policy. As of 2011 the government <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> announce what, if any, reserve units would be formed, though provisions for such units had been included in legislation.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's {{successor}} in 1842 was Richard Harrington, who {{inherited a}} college in good shape: income was around £15,000; only Christ Church was significantly bigger in size. Academic reforms, {{particularly with regard}} to examinations– which were to be administered by the university, rather than the college– were instituted across Oxford {{in the first half of}} the century. Brasenose's proportion of first-class degrees fell sharply from its previous peak. By 1850, no matriculation exam was instituted at Brasenose, as at other colleges, although the other examinations were altered: responsions moved forward and moderations instituted. Brasenose, like the University, <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> truly reform the range of subjects studied, however. It was only in 1849 that modern sciences were only given a separate School (and thus examination) in 1849; law and modern history a year later.|$|E

5|$|In early 1922, he {{made his}} Sheffield Shield debut against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He batted at No. 8 and made an unbeaten 22. Batting at No. 7 in his second match against Western Australia, Woodfull {{registered}} his maiden first-class century with 153. He was run out in his second and final innings of his debut first-class season, so he <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> be dismissed by a bowler. Both matches were won by an innings, part of a dominant summer for the Victorians. During this time, he also studied for an arts degree at night {{in addition to his}} post at Williamstown High School.|$|E
5|$|Macartney hit 105 as Australia amassed 7/708 {{declared}} against Hampshire {{and then}} made 193 as Australia compiled 621 and defeated Northamptonshire by an innings and 484 runs. The two matches were separated by a match against Surrey, which Macartney missed due to injury. In the latter match, Macartney came in at first drop after the hosts took a wicket from the first ball of the match, and he scored 193 of the 318 runs scored {{while he was in}} the middle. Macartney took only 135 minutes and hit 31 fours as Australia added more than 300 in just over two hours of batting. Such was the dominance of Macartney and the rest of Armstrong's men that they disposed of Northamptonshire in less than two days. However, his most famed innings <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{achieved}} {{more success}} as a footballer. In 1937, he followed his brothers Les and Ray and joined the Brighton Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). The VFA was the second tier of Australian rules football below the Victorian Football League (VFL). A defender, Miller played his first two seasons on the flanks; he <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> reach his physical peak and lacked the power required to play in central defensive positions until his third season, in 1939. At this stage, {{he was unable to}} hip and shoulder his opponents and relied on his running ability and accurate kicking.Perry, p. 33.|$|E

5|$|Napoli {{broke the}} world {{transfer}} record fee after acquiring Diego Maradona in a €12million deal from Barcelona on 30 June 1984. The squad was gradually re-built, {{with the likes}} of Ciro Ferrara, Salvatore Bagni and Fernando De Napoli filling the ranks. The rise up the tables was gradual, by 1985–86, they had a third-place finish under their belts, but better <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> come. The 1986–87 season was the landmark in Napoli's history; they won the double, securing the Serie A title by three points and then beating Atalanta 4–0 to lift the Coppa Italia.|$|E
5|$|On the 13 March 2016, Reid's manager Dougie Freedman {{was sacked}} and {{replaced}} by first team coach Paul Williams. The following day, Reid accepted a coaching role assisting Williams {{until the end of}} the 2015–16 season. Although he <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> feature for the club that season due to injury, Reid still harboured hopes of playing again and told Forest Player HD “I’m going to be coupling this with my rehab – I had my operation four weeks ago – and I’m still trying to get back".|$|E
5|$|Saggers {{started the}} tour as the clear second-choice wicket-keeper, as Don Tallon {{had played in}} each of Australia's 11 Tests since the {{resumption}} of cricket after the Second World War, while Saggers <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> make his Test debut. Saggers made his first-class debut shortly {{before the start of}} the war, and after the resumption, was regarded as the second in line for Test selection behind Tallon. However, as Australia did not make any substantial tours in the years immediately after the end of hostilities, there was no need to take a reserve gloveman on such trips. However, the trip to England meant more than six months abroad, so a back-up wicketkeeper was needed, and Saggers was selected for his first national squad.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 Australian Open Men's singles final was the {{championship}} tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2009 Australian Open. It was contested between the world's top two players {{for much of}} the previous four years, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer then world number's 1 and 2 respectively. It was their seventh (out of nine) Grand Slam tournament final meeting and it was the same final match up as had been previously at both the 2008 Wimbledon Men's Singles final and 2008 French Men's Singles final, both of which Nadal won. However this was Rafael Nadal's first Major hardcourt final while it was Roger Federer's ninth and <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> lose in a Major hardcourt final.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan for}} Prior Park was to {{construct}} five buildings along three {{sides of a}} dodecagon matching the sweep {{of the head of}} the valley, with the main building being flanked by elongated wings based on designs by Andrea Palladio. The plans were influenced by drawings in Vitruvius Britannicus originally made by Colen Campbell for Wanstead House in Essex, which <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> be built. The main block had 15 bays and each of the wings 17 bays each. Between each wing and the main block was a Porte-cochère for coaches to stop under. In addition to the stone from the local quarries, material, including the grand staircase and plasterwork, from the demolished Hunstrete House were used in the construction.|$|E
5|$|The third tour {{match and}} the second game between the English XI (led by Lord Harris) and New South Wales—captained by Gregory—commenced on Friday 7 February at the Association Ground.

As well as being a star footballer for Carlton, Coulthard was a ground-bowler employed by Melbourne, but <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> make his first-class cricketing debut. Coulthard accompanied Harris's men from Melbourne following the Test. New South Wales selected Edmund Barton, who later became the first Prime Minister of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, {{which partly}} {{touches on the}} problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself {{considered}} four years earlier, in Free Will). Quoting the New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature. Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of habits. This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin. Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.|$|E
5|$|Carson {{was first}} {{called up to}} the England under-21 squad in October 2003, a month after his 18th birthday, for the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship {{qualifier}} against Turkey. At the time he <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> make his competitive debut for Leeds United's first team, and had previously played only four matches for England at other levels. He made his under-21 debut in a 3–2 win for England against the Netherlands in February 2004. He was selected in the squad for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, and in the third match against Serbia, he earned his 28th under-21 cap, eclipsing the record held by Gareth Barry and Jamie Carragher. His 29th and final cap came against the hosts, the Netherlands, in the semi-final, which finished level at 1–1 after extra-time. In the resultant penalty shoot-out, he saved one of the 16 penalties he faced and also scored one himself, but England lost 13–12. Carson has since been overtaken by James Milner as the England Under-21 team's most-capped player.|$|E
5|$|Darius's European {{expedition}} was a {{major event}} in his reign, which began with the invasion of Thrace. Darius also conquered many cities of the northern Aegean, Paeonia, while Macedonia submitted voluntarily, after the demand of earth and water, becoming a vassal kingdom. He then left Megabyzus to conquer Thrace, returning to Sardis to spend the winter. The Greeks living in Asia Minor {{and some of the}} Greek islands had submitted to Persian rule already by 510 BCE. Nonetheless, there were certain Greeks who were pro-Persian, although these were largely based in Athens. To improve Greek-Persian relations, Darius opened his court and treasuries to those Greeks who wanted to serve him. These Greeks served as soldiers, artisans, statesmen and mariners for Darius. However, the increasing concerns amongst the Greeks over the strength of Darius's kingdom along with the constant interference by the Greeks in Ionia and Lydia were stepping stones towards the conflict that <b>was</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> come between Persia and certain of the leading Greek city states.|$|E
