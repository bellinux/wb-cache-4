5000|$|Foucault's {{argument}} is that discipline creates [...] "docile bodies", ideal for the new economics, politics and warfare of the modern industrial age - bodies that function in factories, ordered military regiments, and school classrooms. But, to construct docile bodies the disciplinary institutions {{must be able to}} (a) constantly observe and record the bodies they control and (b) ensure the internalization of the disciplinary individuality within the bodies being controlled. That is, discipline must come about <b>without</b> <b>excessive</b> <b>force</b> through careful observation, and molding of the bodies into the correct form through this observation. This requires a particular form of institution, exemplified, Foucault argues, by Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon. This architectural model, though it was never adopted by architects according to Bentham's exact blueprint, becomes an important conceptualization of power relations for prison reformers of the 19th Century, and its general principle is a recurring theme in modern prison construction.|$|E

State {{discusses}} Plummer, depicting it {{as saying}} that it applies to the situation where the arresting officer is using excessive force such that unless the arrestee defends himself or flees, {{he is likely to}} suffer great bodily harm or death.The Wilson court was careful to note that a person may not resist an unlawful arrest where the officer does not use unlawful force. Other cases citing Plummer likewise noted that while a person may defend himself against an officer's unlawful use of force, they may not resist an unlawful arrest being made peaceably and <b>without</b> <b>excessive</b> <b>force.</b> In 1995, the Seventh Circuit Court cited Plummer, noting that the privilege exists “not because its use is necessary to protect him from an unlawful arrest, but because {{it is the only way}} in which he can protect himself from death or serious bodily harm.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Flight 981, named TC-JAV or [...] "Ship 29", {{had been}} ordered from McDonnell-Douglas {{three months after the}} service {{bulletin}} was issued, and was delivered to Turkish Airlines three months later. Despite this, the changes required by the service bulletin (installation of a support plate for the handle linkage, preventing the bending of the linkage seen in the Flight 96 incident) had not been implemented. Through either oversight or deliberate fraud, the manufacturer construction logs however showed that this work had been carried out. In reality, an improper adjustment had been made to the locking pin and warning light mechanism, causing the locking pin travel to be reduced. This meant that the pins did not extend past the torque tube flanges, allowing the handle to be closed <b>without</b> <b>excessive</b> <b>force</b> (estimated by investigators to be around [...] ) despite the improperly engaged latches. These findings concurred with statements made by Mohammed Mahmoudi, the baggage handler who had closed the door on Flight 981; he noted that no particular amount of force was needed to close the locking handle. Changes had also been made to the warning light switch, so that it would turn off the cockpit warning light even if the handle was not fully closed.|$|E

40|$|Prosthetic voice {{restoration}} has considerably {{improved the}} results of vocal rehabilitation after total laryngectomy, and is presently the method of choice for many health-care providers treating laryngectomized patients. The Provox voice prosthesis, developed in the Netherlands Cancer Institute, is an indwelling device that has been applied in recent years with regular success. Its retrograde replacement method, using a disposable guide wire, assures reliable, atraumatic positioning of the prosthesis in the tracheoesophageal fistula. However, the method sometimes may be uncomfortable for the patient; therefore an adapted prosthesis and new replacement equipment were developed, which enable bidirectional insertion, i. e. {{not only in the}} traditional retrograde manner through the pharynx, but especially in an anterograde manner through the stoma. This second-generation voice prosthesis (Provox 2) was studied in a prospective clinical trial in 44 patients (33 experienced patients, seven first-time replacements and four primary insertions). The study demonstrated that the anterograde insertion with the Provox 2 system was applicable in all patients, making the voice prosthesis even easier to handle than with the traditional retrograde method. A stenosis of the pharyngoesophageal segment no longer interfered with the replacement. In addition, the patients judged the new method as being favourable, reporting significantly less discomfort during the replacement procedure (paired Student's t-test: p < 0. 0001). Furthermore, the adapted voice prosthesis could be removed from the tracheoesophageal fistula <b>without</b> <b>excessive</b> <b>force</b> (mean 7. 9 N, range 6. 0 - 14. 0 N), more easily than the original Provox (mean 20. 9 N, range 5. 5 - 25. 0 N). It can be concluded that this second-generation indwelling voice prosthesis (Provox 2) seems to be a further improvement in the application of this voice rehabilitation system, not only simplifying the replacement procedure, but also diminishing the discomfort for the patien...|$|E

Instrumentation necessary to the surgical procedure can inadvertently sever the tube either partially or completely necessitating one of several procedures to correct the situation. A case report is presented which describes {{a situation where the}} patient's endotracheal tube had been partially lacerated intraoperatively. Due to lack of patency in one nostril, a method for replacement was required that allowed the new tube to pass through the same nostril as the original tube <b>without</b> placing <b>excessive</b> <b>forces</b> on a surgically fractured maxilla.

40|$|Gravity, it {{eventually}} gets us all. The challenge for our bodies {{is to maintain}} stability and move efficiently {{against the forces of}} gravity. Disease, injury, environment, emotions, body type, kinesthetic sense and repetitive activities can lead to adverse movement patterns and further dysfunction. Identifying abnormal movement patterns and understanding the interplay between gravity, buoyancy and our bodies is essential for the aquatic therapist. Ideal alignment especially the curves of the spine are important in withstanding the forces of gravity. For a weight bearing joint to be stable the gravity line must fall through the joint’s axis of rotation. For example: in standing the gravity line should fall just anterior to the knee and posterior to the patella this allows the knee to remain straight and the person upright <b>without</b> <b>excessive</b> <b>forces</b> at the joint or excessive effort from the quadriceps. If the gravity line falls anterior to the patella the forces of gravity tend to push the knee into hyperextension causing increased stress to the soft tissue of the posterior knee. This position causes the ACL to be on slack and over time leads to weakness of the ligament and possibly increasing risk of ACL injury in young women who tend to have this alignment. The first step in postural assessment is evaluation of where the gravity line falls at each joint. Posture is often described based on static position, forward head, military style, sway back, kyphosis-lordosi...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Robots {{capable of}} {{assisting}} elderly {{people in their}} homes will become indispensable, since the world population is aging at an alarming rate. A crucial requirement for these robotic caregivers will be the ability to safely interact with humans, such as firmly grasping a human arm <b>without</b> applying <b>excessive</b> <b>force.</b> Minding this concern, we developed a reactive grasp that, using tactile sensors, monitors the pressure it exerts during manipulation. Our approach, inspired by human manipulation, employs an architecture based on different grasping phases that represent particular stages in a manipulation task. Within these phases, we implemented and composed simple components to interpret and react to the information obtained by the tactile sensors. Empirical results, using a Care-O-bot 3 R © with a Schunk Dexterous Hand (SDH- 2), show that considering tactile information can reduce the force exerted on the objects significantly...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMicromanipulation {{methods used}} for {{complicated}} {{tasks such as}} microrobot assembly and microvascular surgery often lack the force reflection and contact localization capability necessary to achieve robust grasps of micro-scale objects <b>without</b> applying <b>excessive</b> <b>forces.</b> This absence of haptic feedback is especially prohibitive in cases where visual evidence of force application, such as object surface deformation, is imperceptible and where unstructured, dynamically changing environments require force sensing and modulation for safe, atraumatic object manipulation. This paper describes the design, fabrication, and experimental validation of a soft tactile sensor array for sub-millimeter contact localization and contact force measurement during micromanipulation. The geometry and placement of conductive liquid embedded channels within the sensor array are optimized to provide adequate sensitivity for representative micro-manipulation tasks. Mechanical testing of the sensor demonstrates a sensitivity of less than 50 mN and contact localization resolution {{on the order of}} 10 ¶VRIPLFURQV I...|$|R

Aimed to create desired responses to open the door, a novel stiffness modulation method is proposed, incorporating a realtime optimization. As a preliminary experiment, a full door-opening scenario (approaching {{to the door and}} reaching, grasping, rotating and pulling the door handle) is demonstrated under a semi-autonomous operation with a pilot. The experimental result shows the effectiveness and efficacy of the proposed impedance control approach.
