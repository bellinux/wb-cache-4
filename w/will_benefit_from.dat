5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, {{and is expected to}} increase by several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments in the downtown area adding thousands of housing units which <b>will</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift in the other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|E

Students in the D.Min. concentration in Pastoral Care & Counseling / Pastoral Theology <b>will</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> advanced theological study and professional work specifically designed for those who desire to serve as chaplains, pastoral care specialists, pastoral counselors or congregational pastors. The program emphasizes the helping relationship, theological understandings of pastoral care, the multicultural contexts of pastoral care, psychotherapeutic theories and strategies for change, and various forms of pastoral care and counseling. A race, class, and gender analysis will be appropriated {{to the practice of}} care and counseling. Questions regarding the program may be directed to Danielle Hunter, Director, D. Min.

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{change to the}} district is the extension on the southeast, to the boundary of the city's Eighth Ward in 1870. Between Adams and Ferry streets, three blocks would be added, with the new boundary following {{the west side of}} St. Mary's Avenue, excluding a newer house at the northwest corner of the Washington Avenue intersection, and then rear property lines to Kennedy Lane and Hill Street just south of Adams. Two-story rowhouses predominate in this area, many built as worker housing during the 19th century, some as early as the Federal period. Some have intact storefronts. It also has the only significant industrial building in the proposed expanded district, the former Lusco Paper Works on the northwest corner of Fifth and Liberty streets. The area has begun to see some restoration efforts, such as some Greek Revival rowhouses on Liberty Street near Fourth, which <b>will</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> state tax credits should the area be added to the district.|$|E

25|$|Spanish {{wines are}} often labeled {{according}} {{to the amount of}} aging the wine has received.

Others <b>will</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> some time aging in the bottle. For the vintage year (vendimia or cosecha) to appear on the label, a minimum of 85% of the grapes must be from that year's harvest. The three most common aging designations on Spanish wine labels are Crianza, Reserva and Gran Reserva.|$|E
