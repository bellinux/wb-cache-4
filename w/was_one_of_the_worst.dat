However, fearing his ambitions even for the Arsacid throne, Orodes had Surena executed shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|It {{would be}} as great a farce of yesterday's {{election}} to designate it otherwise than a fraud. It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> ever yet perpetrated in the state.

5|$|The Giants {{had another}} losing season in 1996, {{finishing}} 6–10. Though Brown again started every {{game for the}} Giants, he turned {{in one of the}} worst seasons of any starting quarterback in the NFL, throwing for just 12 touchdowns against 20 interceptions. The Giants' offense <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> in the NFL and, unlike in previous years, the defense was unable to carry the team. After missing the playoffs for three consecutive seasons, Reeves was fired.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944 several British {{air attacks}} damaged the U-boat bases in Bergen.

The base was handed over to the Allies, along with the rest of occupied Norway, on 8 May 1945 when all German forces in Europe surrendered. As a result of the intensive bombing of the city in late 1944 and 1945, the Bergen area <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> damaged regions in the south of Norway at the conclusion of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{suffered}} through yet another poor season in 1996, finishing 6–10.

The Giants offense <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> in the NFL and, unlike in previous years, the defense was unable to keep the offense afloat.

5|$|There was {{extensive}} {{damage to buildings}} in Orkney and the surrounding areas, partly due to inadequate building construction vulnerable to earthquake damage. The Khuma township near Stilfontein <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> affected areas, with more than 600 homes damaged by the earthquake. An aftershock occurred in Khuma in the afternoon of 5August while residents were assessing the damage to their homes.

Two schools were damaged and some pupils were unable to attend classes as the classrooms were too badly damaged.|$|E
5|$|Cebu <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> {{impacted}} cities. At {{the local}} airport, an anemometer recorded sustained winds of 160km/h (100mph) early on December10, which remains {{a record for}} the city. Rainfall peaked at 195.3mm (7.69in); at the time this made the typhoon the wettest tropical cyclone in Cebu history. All buildings made of light construction materials were at least partially damaged, with many large structures sustaining roof or other damage. At least 29people {{were killed in the}} city, including the drownings of three due to the resultant flooding. The typhoon's effects caused the cessation of the city's power supply. Damage in Cebu totaled 560million Philippine pesos. At least a hundred other people in Cebu City were displaced. Offshore, 28ships capsized due to winds caused by Amy, including 7 inter-island vessels. This set a new record for vessels sunk by a typhoon in Cebu, and held until Typhoon Mike sunk 88ships in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Ami <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> {{cyclones}} ever {{to affect}} Fiji. Cyclone Ami developed from a low-pressure area east of Tuvalu on January 12. The storm moved slowly towards the southwest early in its existence. Influenced by an upper-level trough, Ami slowed down and began moving towards {{the south and}} then southeast. The cyclone attained severe tropical cyclone intensity on January 13. Ami made its first landfall at Vanua Levu, before subsequently making another landfall on Taveuni. Ami reached peak intensity as an equivalent Category3 cyclone on the Australian cyclone scale on January 14. Accelerating to the southeast, the cyclone began to cross over cool sea surface temperatures and encountered wind shear. Ami transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the day after.|$|E

5|$|The 1986 Tampa Bay Buccaneers {{season began}} with the team trying to improve on an 2–14 season. This <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> seasons in {{franchise}} history. There is some sentiment that the 1986 team was even worse than the winless team of 1976, and the 473 points conceded was not beaten by any NFL team until the 2001 Indianapolis Colts gave up 486. The Buccaneers selected Bo Jackson with the top pick in the draft, but were unable to convince him to join the team. Three weeks after the draft, Jackson signed a three-year baseball contract with the Kansas City Royals. Despite holding four of the first forty selections in the draft, {{and the presence of}} a great influx of fresh talent from defunct USFL teams, the Buccaneers were unable to find any impact players in either the draft or free agency. They entered the season with a roster nearly identical to the previous season's 2–14 team.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 Bangladesh cyclone (designated as Tropical Cyclone 04B by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center) <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> {{tropical}} cyclones in Bangladeshi history. Striking in November1988, {{the tropical}} system exacerbated the catastrophic damage {{from what was}} then considered the worst floods in Bangladesh's history. The tropical cyclone originated from a disturbance that developed within the Strait of Malacca on November21. Tracking slowly westward, the initial tropical depression reached tropical storm status in the Andaman Sea. On November26, the storm reached an intensity equivalent {{to that of a}} modern-day severe cyclonic storm and subsequently turned northward. Gradually intensifying as it had previously, the tropical cyclone reached peak intensity with winds of 125mph (200km/h) as it was making landfall near the Bangladesh-West Bengal border on November29. Although the storm retained strong winds well inland, it was last monitored over central Bangladesh as a moderate cyclonic storm-equivalent on November30.|$|E
5|$|Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was {{appointed}} as his replacement, initially {{on a temporary}} basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot {{on the final day}} of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.|$|E

5|$|The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal {{were hardly}} noticed by the fans when {{compared}} to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot {{on the final day of}} the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager.

5|$|The {{resulting}} inundation {{caused by}} Vera's storm surge submerged {{areas around the}} periphery of the bay for extended periods of time, with some low-lying areas remaining underwater in excess of four months. Due to the failure of multiple flood mitigation systems in quick succession, coupled with the narrow coverage of telecommunications exacerbated by Vera's strong winds, many persons in affected regions had very little time to evacuate. Nagoya <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> impacted cities by Vera, {{and as a result of}} the storm surge and wind, its harbor was put out of service in under three hours. The effects of the typhoon's storm surge there were further worsened by the destruction of lumber yards in Nagoya Harbor, which set loose large quantities of logs that caused considerable damage to structures. The release of logs also hampered relief efforts following the typhoon's passage. Citywide, 50,000homes were severely damaged by flood waters, and 1,800other residences were washed away off of their foundations. Total damage to crops was estimated at US$30million. Rice crops sustained heavy impacts, with 150,000tons (135,000tonnes) of rice lost. In addition to the crop damage, US$2.5million worth of fruits and US$4million worth of vegetables were lost. The collapse of a single apartment home in the city buried 84people under debris; a similar incident in Naka, Ibaraki buried roughly 300people. Beach houses were destroyed, and large swaths of nearby cropland were heavily damaged. In addition to the storm surge, Nagoya experienced sustained winds of about 145km/h (90mph), with gusts reaching as high as 260km/h (160mph), downing power lines and causing power outage. Southeast of Nagoya, in Handa, Aichi, around 300people were killed after Vera's waves engulfed more than 250homes. Casualties throughout Aichi totaled 3,168 and roughly 59,000people were injured, based on an enumeration conducted in March1960.|$|E
