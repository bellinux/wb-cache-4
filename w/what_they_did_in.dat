The Legacy sponsors campaign training schools, links candidates with volunteers and experts, collaborates with like-minded organizations and provides campaign grants to endorsed candidates. In 2007, she was named a Woman hero by The My Hero Project.|$|E

2500|$|Judaism posits a {{creation}} narrative [...] "In the beginning" [...] and a redeemed Olam Haba at the end, which means Judaism has a linear, not a cyclical concept of time, at least regarding the physical world. However, as the Creator is eternal and without beginning or end, things in time attain {{some form of}} eternal-ity through a relationship with Him. Additionally, the Midrash posits that historical events {{in the history of}} the Jewish people repeat themselves. [...] There is a spiritual repetition, too, and the influence is transmitted year after year, no matter the [...] "distance" [...] from the original event. As a result, the actions in a person's life directly affect their life in the next world, or after death, and are direct manifestations of the spiritual influences of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> this world (see the Kabbalah of the Ariza'l). There is also a perspective that time is composed of seven cycles, which repeat every seven thousand years (a view rejected by Isaac Luria). These concepts give human choices to do good deeds in Olam HaZeh — [...] "this world" [...] - some of what Nietzsche called the eternal recurrence's [...] "infinite weight".|$|E

I have now no idea <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> it, but as the story never came to a conclusion it does not greatly matter.

Wherefore, at last {{lighting}} under a little shelter, they sat down there until daybreak; but, being weary, they fell asleep. Now, there was, {{not far from the}} place where they lay, a castle, called Doubting Castle the owner whereof was Giant Despair, and it was in his grounds they now were sleeping; wherefore he, getting up in the morning early, and walking up and down in his fields, caught Christian and Hopeful asleep in his grounds. Then, with a grim and surly voice, he bid them awake, and asked them whence they were, and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> his grounds. They told him they were pilgrims, and that they had lost their way. Then said the giant, [...] "You have this night trespassed on me by trampling in and lying on my grounds, and therefore you must go along with me." [...] So they were forced to go, because he was stronger than they. They had also but little to say, for they knew themselves in fault. The giant, therefore, drove them before him, and put them into his castle, into a very dark dungeon, nasty and smelling vilely to the spirits of these two men. Here, then, they lay from Wednesday morning till Saturday night, without one bit of bread or drop of drink, or light, or any to ask how they did; they were, therefore, here in evil case, and were far from friends and people whom they knew. Now, in this place Christian had double sorrow, because it was through his thoughtless haste that they were brought into this distress.|$|E

Twice recently, as mentioned in these columns, the successor to an English property of some value was discovered, in the one case peddling oranges, and in the other digging a rancher's ditches, while now we have another instance in the Somasco valley. It appears that long ago there was a family quarrel at Carnaby, England, and though {{we do not know what}} it was all about, the owner of what we understand is an encumbered estate turned out his son, who had the good sense to come out to this country, where he did pretty well. He died and left a son, Mr. Henry Alton, well known in the Somasco district, who appears to be a credit to the country which took his father in. The owner of Carnaby dying later, left the ancestral property to him, and, as in this case there does not seem to be a wicked uncle, Mr. Deringham, the next of kin and a distinguished London financier who has, we believe, had some dealings in local mines, has come out to look for him. Mr. Alton of Somasco will probably stop right where he is if he is the sensible man his neighbours seem to think him." ...|$|E
