5|$|During auditions for {{the school}} play, a romantic tension builds between Sunny and Zeke and {{they are asked to}} play the lead roles. Sunny quits the play when she realises that she has to kiss Zeke. Sunny then finds out that Zeke is 'Lost Boy', but she forgives him. When she sees Donna Freedman practising the kissing scene with Zeke, Sunny becomes upset. Sunny and Zeke almost share a kiss one night when they are alone. However, they are {{interrupted}} by Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine). Due to rewrites of the play, Sunny's new character has to kiss Zeke too and Sunny grows uncomfortable again. During drama camp, Sunny and Zeke are locked in a cupboard during a game of truth or dare. They almost kiss again, but are interrupted <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is opened. Karl realises that Sunny and Zeke like each other and he tries to keep them apart. However, they eventually start a relationship.|$|E
5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} {{the doors and}} flashlight, albeit with slightly altered usage. The doors can only be closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the flashlight or close the door.|$|E
25|$|The north wall has {{a doorway}} with a well moulded, four-centred arched head and jambs of 15th century date (perhaps {{removed from the}} south {{transept}} wall <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> under the window was closed up and re-set here in 1828).|$|E

There is a wirework cage inside to prevent mail falling out <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is opened, a hinged letter chute to allow mail {{to fall into the}} collecting bag or sack and a serrated hand-guard to prevent unauthorised tampering with the mail through the aperture.|$|E
25|$|Photography is {{forbidden}} in these areas, {{both inside and}} outside, although some photos have {{found their way to}} a variety of web sites. Guests who attempt to explore backstage are warned and often escorted from the property. The boundary between on and off-stage is demarcated at every access point. Everything within guest view when a door or gateway is open is also considered on stage. It is from this point that characters start playing their part. That way, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is open, guests will not accidentally see a person out of character backstage.|$|E
25|$|John Bosco narrates how Dominic came to {{his room}} one day and urged him to {{accompany}} him. He led Bosco through many streets to a block of flats, rang the doorbell, and at once, went away. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> opened, John Bosco found that within, there was a dying man who was desperately asking for a priest to make his last confession. Later, John Bosco asked Dominic how he had known about that man. However, since the question made Dominic uncomfortable, John Bosco did not press the matter.|$|E

25|$|For example, a PID loop is used {{to control}} the {{temperature}} of an electric resistance furnace where the system has stabilized. Now <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is opened and something cold is put into the furnace the temperature drops below the setpoint. The integral function of the controller tends to compensate for error by introducing another error in the positive direction. This overshoot can be avoided by freezing of the integral function after {{the opening of the}} door for the time the control loop typically needs to reheat the furnace.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{devised a}} new test {{involving}} a cargo hold with {{conditions similar to}} the conditions of Flight 295; the plastic covers and extra pallets provided fuel for the fire, which would spread quickly before generating enough smoke to activate smoke alarms. The hotter flame achieved in the new test heated {{the air in the}} cargo hold. This heated air had a higher pressure than normal, and overcame the pressure differential between the cargo hold and the passenger cabin. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> between the passenger and cargo holds was open, smoke and gases therefore flowed into the passenger cabin.|$|E
25|$|In May 1972, two loyalist gunmen {{called to}} the MacBride family's door and Nora MacBride, who was {{carrying}} a baby at the time, went to answer the door. The men duped Mrs. MacBride into opening the door by stating {{that they were looking}} for Frank, a building contractor, and were seeking work. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was opened the gunmen then saw Frank coming down the narrow hallway to see who was at the door. They opened fire shooting Frank in the shoulder, hand and thighs, then Antoine came out from a side room to protect his father and was shot in the leg. Frank MacBride was hit by 12 bullets and never recovered from the attack, dying 17 months later.|$|E

25|$|The given probabilities {{depend on}} {{specific}} assumptions {{about how the}} host and contestant choose their doors. A key insight is that, under these standard conditions, there is more information about doors 2 and 3 that was not available {{at the beginning of}} the game, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> 1 was chosen by the player: the host's deliberate action adds value to the door he did not choose to eliminate, but not to the one chosen by the contestant originally. Another insight is that switching doors is a different action than choosing between the two remaining doors at random, as the first action uses the previous information and the latter does not. Other possible behaviors than the one described can reveal different additional information, or none at all, and yield different probabilities.|$|E

[...] The dog warns the snowman of an {{imminent}} change in the weather. A thaw descends, and, one morning, the snowman collapses. The dog finds a stove poker used to build the snowman within his remains, and then understands why the snowman longed for the stove, [...] "That's what moved inside him...Now he is over that, too!" [...] The girls in the house sing a springtime carol and the snowman is forgotten.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of September 24, Summerfield and Humphreys called Nixon at his Missoula hotel. After {{securing}} his agreement to fly to Wheeling if Eisenhower agreed to Chotiner's terms, the two reached Eisenhower and campaign leader New Hampshire Governor Sherman Adams in Portsmouth, Ohio, en route to Wheeling, and briefed them on the conversation with Nixon and on the flood of communications from the public. The general and governor agreed that Nixon could come to Wheeling with the assurance he would remain on the ticket. After making speeches in Missoula and at a stop in Denver, and after Eisenhower made his own speech announcing that his running mate had {{been the victim of}} an [...] "attempted smear", Nixon arrived in Wheeling late in the day on the 24th.

500|$|Dean {{considers}} that Jos√© {{is the central}} figure of the opera: [...] "It is his fate rather than Carmen's that interests us". The music characterizes his gradual decline, act by act, from honest soldier to deserter, vagabond and finally murderer. In act 1 he is a simple countryman aligned musically with Mica√´la; in act 2 he evinces a greater toughness, {{the result of his}} experiences as a prisoner, {{but it is clear that}} by the end of the act his infatuation with Carmen has driven his emotions beyond control. Dean describes him in act 3 as a trapped animal who refuses to leave his cage even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is opened for him, ravaged by a mix of conscience, jealousy and despair. In the final act his music assumes a grimness and purposefulness that reflects his new fatalism: [...] "He will make one more appeal; if Carmen refuses, he knows what to do".|$|E

The film ends with the entire cast dancing joyously to [...] "(I've Had) The Time of My Life".|$|E
500|$|The game's sound {{team was}} {{composed}} of Kemal Amarasingham, Damin Djawadi and audio director Eric Brosius. According to Brosius, {{each member of the}} audio department did [...] "everything", without clear demarcations between roles. Like Thief, Thief II features a sound engine that simulates propagation in real-time. To achieve this effect, each level's geometry was input both to the level editor and to a [...] "separate [...] database", which mapped how sound would realistically propagate based on [...] "the physical room characteristics [...] how all the different rooms and areas are connected together". For example, noise travels freely through an open door but is blocked <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is closed. The team used the new [...] "occlusion" [...] feature in EAX 2.0 to make Thief IIs sound environment more realistic and to allow the player to listen through doors. The game features more sound effects, music and speech than the original Thief. Thief IIs score, as with that of its predecessor, was designed to [...] "blur ambient [...] and music" [...] together. However, Brosius later stated that, while Thiefs soundtrack is composed of [...] "simple and hypnotic" [...] loops only a few seconds in length, Thief II features longer and [...] "more thoughtfully" [...] constructed pieces. He believed that this method had positive aspects, but that it resulted in a less immersive audio environment.|$|E
