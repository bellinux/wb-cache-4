40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted at the Langley aircraft landing loads and traction facility to study the braking and cornering response of a slip ratio controlled aircraft antiskid braking system with ground speed reference derived from an unbraked nose wheel. The investigation, conducted on dry and wet runway surfaces, utilized one main gear wheel, brake, and tire assembly of a DC- 9 series 10 airplane. During maximum braking, the average ratio of the drag force friction coefficient developed by the antiskid system to the maximum drag force friction coefficient available was higher on the dry surface than on damp and flooded surfaces, and was reduced with lighter vertical loads, higher yaw angles, and when new tire treads were replaced by <b>worn</b> <b>treads.</b> Similarly, the average ratio of side force friction coefficient developed by the tire under antiskid control to the maximum side force friction coefficient available to a freely rolling yawed tire decreased with increasing yaw angle, generally increased with ground speed, and decreased when tires with new treads were replaced by those with <b>worn</b> <b>treads...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Quasi-elastic {{contact method}} {{can be used}} to study the wheel-rail contact {{relationship}} of <b>worn</b> <b>tread.</b> In this paper, wheel-rail contact relationship of standard and worn LMA tread have been calculated under the condition of rigid contact and quasi-elastic contact. By comparing with rigid contact which produces sharp contact points with a large dispersion, quasi-elastic contact results in uniformly smooth contact points without jump, what’s more, it’s more content with the real wheel-rail contact conditions. And also quasi-elastic contact has a significant effect on the <b>worn</b> <b>tread</b> under different operation mileage. Wheel-rail contact point distribution under different mileage is calculated, and according to tread band, a new measurement of wheelset lateral displacement is developed, which provides a simple way to determine the wheel set lateral displacement only by observing and measuring the tread contact band under different operation mileage. The wheel-rail contact relationship calculation method has been used to the real worn wheel profile test process, where the theory analysis results agreed with the real experiment results well to some extent...|$|E

50|$|The tire {{contact patch}} is readily changed by both over- and underinflation. Overinflation may {{increase}} the wear on the center contact patch, and underinflation will cause a concave tread, resulting in less center contact, though the overall contact patch will still be larger. Most modern tires will wear evenly at high tire pressures, but will degrade prematurely if underinflated. An increased tire pressure may decrease rolling resistance, and may also result in shorter stopping distances If tire pressure is too low, the tire contact patch is greatly increased. This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and tire. Under-inflation can lead to tire overheating, premature <b>tread</b> <b>wear,</b> and <b>tread</b> separation in severe cases.|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> {{particles}} are investigated: <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> particles from a steel brush abrader (TrBP) and particles produced during a steering pad run (TrSP). A leaching experiment in water at pH = 7. 5 for 24 and 48 h {{was carried out}} on TrBP to simulate environmental degradation. Images of all materials were collected by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) together with element microanalytical (EDX) data. Surface morphology is described by a function of wave number (the “enhanced spectrum”) obtained from SEM image analysis and non-linear filtering. A surface roughness index, ρ, {{is derived from the}} enhanced spectrum. The innovative contribution of this work is the representation of morphology by means of ρ, which, together with EDX data, allows the quantitative characterization of the materials. In particular, the surface roughness of leached TrBP is shown to decay in time and is related to the corresponding microanalytical data for the first time. The morphology of steering pad TrSP, affected by included mineral particles, is shown to be more heterogeneous. Differences in morphology (enhanced spectra and ρ), elemental composition and surface chemistry of TrBP and TrSP are discussed.

50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{abnormal}} <b>tread</b> <b>wear.</b> Poor wheel alignment can cause excessive wear of the innermost or outermost ribs. Gravel roads, rocky terrain, and other rough terrain causes accelerated wear. Over-inflation above the sidewall maximum can cause excessive wear {{to the center of}} the tread. Modern tires have steel belts built in to prevent this. Under-inflation causes excessive wear to the outer ribs. Unbalanced wheels can cause uneven tire wear, as the rotation may not be perfectly circular. Tire manufacturers and car companies have mutually established standards for <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> testing that include measurement parameters for tread loss profile, lug count, and heel-toe wear.

40|$|When {{designing}} and optimizing a rail vehicle {{there is a}} contradiction between, on the one hand, stability on straight track at high speed and, on the other hand, reasonable wheel and rail wear in small- and medium radius curves. Higher speeds require to some extent stiffer wheelset guidance to avoid hunting and ensure stability. However, with stiffer wheelset guidance the risk of increased wheel and rail wear in curves is imminent. In this paper, {{the process of developing}} and optimizing a track-friendly bogie is described. A multi-body system (MBS) simulation model was used, taking due consideration to nonlinearities in suspension and wheel-rail contact, as well as realistic flexibilities in the track. Adequate and systematic consideration is taken {{to a wide range of}} possible non-linear wheel-rail combinations. Dynamic stability is investigated both on straight track and in wide curves at high speeds. The balance between flange <b>wear</b> and <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> is studied in order to maximize wheel life between re-profiling operations in the intended average operation. The result is a bogie with relatively soft wheelset guidance allowing passive radial self-steering, which in combination with appropriate yaw damping ensures stability on straight track at higher speeds.

40|$|Rolling {{resistance}} and <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> of tires do particularly influence the maintenance costs of commercial vehicles. Although tire labeling is established in Europe, it is meanwhile well-known that, {{due to the}} respective test procedures, these labels do not hold in realistic application scenarios in the field. This circumstance arises from the development phase of tires, where the respective performance properties are mainly evaluated in tire/wheel standalone scenarios in which {{the wide range of}} usage variability of commercial vehicles cannot be considered adequately. Within this article we address a method to predict indicators for rolling {{resistance and}} <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> of tires in realistic application scenarios considering application-based factors of influence like specific customers, operation circumstances, regional dependencies, fleet specific characteristics etc. Moreover, the prescribed methodology may also be transferred to the prediction of fuel consumption and pollutant emission. The basic framework of the overall procedure is based on a geo-referenced description of the world. This framework is realized in the software tool VMC® (Virtual Measurement Campaign) which allows a systematic analysis of the usage variability of commercial vehicles in the sense mentioned above. The basic idea for predicting rolling resistance and <b>tread</b> <b>wear</b> of tires is the decomposition of actual routes into a suitable set of load cases depending on curvature radius, longitudinal slope and velocity. The respective tire energy losses are computed for all load cases - by means of a simulation model of the vehicle equipped with a CDTire/ 3 D tire model - and are finally stored in a result catalogue. In order to predict the tire energy loss for a realistic application scenario one partitions actual routes into the predefined load cases and superposes the total energy loss from the result catalogue...|$|R
