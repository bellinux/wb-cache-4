40|$|As {{with all}} {{measurement}}s, {{the measurement of}} examinee ability, in terms of scores that the examinee obtains in a test, is also error-ridden. The quantification of such error or uncertainty in the test score data [...] or rather the complementary test reliability [...] is pursued within the paradigm of Classical Test Theory {{in a variety of}} ways, with no existing method of finding reliability, isomorphic to the theoretical definition that parametrises reliability as the ratio of the true score variance and observed (i. e. error-ridden) score variance. Thus, multiple reliability coefficients for the same test have been advanced. This paper describes a much needed method of obtaining reliability of a test as per its theoretical definition, via a single administration of the test, by using a new fast method of splitting of a given test into parallel halves, achieving near-coincident empirical distributions of the two halves. The method has the desirable property of achieving splitting on the basis of difficulty of the questions (or items) that constitute the test, thus allowing for fast computation of reliability even for very large test data sets, i. e. test data obtained by a very large examinee sample. An interval estimate for the true score is offered, given an examinee score, subsequent to the determination of the test reliability. This method of finding test reliability as per the classical definition can be extended to find reliability of a set or battery of tests; a method for determination of the weights implemented in the computation of the <b>weighted</b> <b>battery</b> score is discussed. We perform empirical illustration of our method on real and simulated tests, and on a real test battery comprising two constituent tests. Comment: 30 page...|$|E

Due to various constraints like scarcity of resources, excessive routing overhead etc, the cluster routing protocol in MANETs becomes less reliable. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for cluster formation and selection of optimal clusterhead and thus forming the optimal cluster taking <b>weighted</b> metrics like <b>battery</b> life, robustness, bandwidth and SNR. Further, our paper provides a realistic mobility model of the user, whose results are validated against simulations to adapt to the dynamic changes in network topology. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel algorithm for clustering of nodes by transmission range based clustering (TRBC). This algorithm does topology management by {{the usage of}} coverage area of each node and power management based on mean transmission power {{within the context of}} wireless ad-hoc networks. By reducing the transmission range of the nodes, energy consumed by each node is decreased and topology is formed. A new algorithm is formulated that helps in reducing the system power consumption and prolonging the battery life of mobile nodes. Formation of cluster and selection of optimal cluster head and thus forming the optimal cluster taking <b>weighted</b> metrics like <b>battery</b> life, distance, position and mobility is done based on the factors such as node density, coverage area, contention index, required and current node degree of the nodes in the clusters...|$|R
