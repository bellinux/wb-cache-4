5000|$|Historically, estates {{could be}} limited in time. Common {{temporal}} limitations include life estate, a land ownership that terminates upon the grantee's (or another person's) death {{even if the}} land had been granted to a third party, or a term of years, a lease for a specified term, such as in an estate for years. A fee also could be limited through the method of its inheritance, such as by an [...] "entailment", which created a fee tail. Traditionally, fee tail was created by <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>grant</b> such as [...] "to N. and the male heirs of his body", which would restrict those who could inherit the property. If no heirs could be found, then the property would revert to the original grantor's heirs. Most common law countries have abolished entailment by statute.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the opinion}} of film historians Harmon and Glut, Spy Smasher is the best serial in terms of special effects and stunts, {{and one of the}} best in general: [...] "Although lacking the beauty and {{imagination}} that appeals to a kind of racial unconscious in the Jungian sense that is found in Flash Gordon...Spy Smasher emerges in a class by itself, the foremost cliffhanger example of a whole school of Hollywood film-making in the 40s that gloried in matchless pure entertainment." [...] The script is consistently logical and well constructed with credible dialogue and good characterization. The cinematography is atmospheric and often artistic. [...] According to Cline, Spy Smasher had a [...] "very tight and fast-moving screenplay." [...] In the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grant</b> Tracey, writing on the Images Journal website, Spy Smasher is [...] "perhaps one of the best serials of all time because of its stunning cliffhangers and unique innovations to the serial form." ...|$|E

50|$|Bownmann and Garnsey {{have argued}} that Tymandus was {{actually}} a village, not a town and that the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> municipal status was unusual. They argue the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grant</b> is for the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> municipal status rather than being an actual city. Levick, however, argues that Tymandus had in the 2nd century been a mere village, {{but by the time}} <b>of</b> the municipal <b>grant</b> had grown significantly, so that the grant merely reflected a recognition of this change.|$|R
50|$|The Sedalia Public Library was {{the first}} Carnegie Grant awarded in Missouri. The Board <b>of</b> Trustees {{received}} <b>word</b> <b>of</b> the $50,000 <b>grant</b> {{in the fall of}} 1899. After securing the property on which to build, and having gained voter approval of a tax to support the library, the Board laid the cornerstone in 1900. The building was completed in July 1901. Dedicated in 1901, the library is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fee simple}} {{subject to a}} {{condition}} subsequent is created when the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> a <b>grant</b> support {{the conclusion that the}} grantor intends to convey a fee simple absolute but has attached a condition to the grant so that if a specified future event happens the grantor will get its fee simple absolute back, provided that the grantor exercises his right of entry (or power of termination). Thus, a fee simple subject to condition subsequent does not end automatically upon the happening of the condition. The future interest is called a [...] "right of reentry" [...] or [...] "right of entry," [...] and the property only reverts to the original grantor if he exercises this right.|$|R
2500|$|Despite these statements, restricting meat {{consumption}} was {{not made}} an explicit requirement for worthiness in the LDS Church as the standards for obedience to the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom were made increasingly central to LDS Church doctrine and practice in the early 20th century. The increased emphasis on the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom {{took place during the}} presidency <b>of</b> Heber J. <b>Grant,</b> a long-time enthusiastic promoter <b>of</b> the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom. Although <b>Grant</b> did not make restricting meat consumption an explicit part of the standard, he continued to interpret it as part of the counsel in the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom. In the 1937 General Conference, at 80 years old, Grant said he worked long hours [...] "without fatigue and without feeling the least injury". He attributed his excellent health, in part, to eating very little meat.|$|R

5000|$|IFCO was {{involved}} in a brief controversy in 2004 when its selection committee chose to grant $1000 to fund a film by Ken Takahashi. The film, to be entitled Last Night With Jesse, was to involve a sexual relationship between an adolescent boy and an older man. When <b>word</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grant</b> and the film subject got out following an article by Susannah Sears, a freelancer, who creates crossword puzzles for the Ottawa Citizen, there was quick criticism of public money funding a film [...] "promoting pedophilia". With city councillors threatening to withdraw city funding and Ontario's Minister of Culture saying that she was [...] "uncomfortable with government funding for any film that depicts a sexual relationship between an adult and a child", the IFCO's board quickly quashed the grant citing concerns about the legality of the film. The IFCO board stated that Takahashi couldn't confirm whether he planned to use a minor as an actor and therefore could contravene a bill, which became federal law July 20, 2005, [...] that eliminates artistic merit as a defense for those accused of making child pornography.|$|R
50|$|Her lands were {{inherited}} by {{her second}} cousin once removed, Hugh de Courtenay (1276-1340), feudal baron of Okehampton, the great-grandson of Mary de Redvers and Robert de Courtenay (d.1242) of Okehampton. He was summoned by writ to Parliament in 1299 as Hugo de Curtenay, whereby he is held {{to have become}} Baron Courtenay. However, forty-one years {{after the death of}} Isabel de Forz, letters patent were issued on 22 February 1335 declaring him Earl of Devon, and stating that he 'should assume such title and style as his ancestors, Earls of Devon, had wont to do', by which he was confirmed as Earl of Devon. Although some sources consider this a new <b>grant</b> the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grant</b> arguably indicates a confirmation and that he became thereby 9th Earl. Historic sources thus variously refer to him as either 1st Earl or 9th Earl, and the position cannot be decided either way due to the uncertainty of the surviving evidence. For the last years of his life he thus held two titles, 1st/9th Earl of Devon, by reason of the 1335 letters patent, and 1st Baron Courtenay, the title by which he had been summoned to Parliament in the years prior to the 1335 letters patent.|$|R

5000|$|Following {{efforts by}} Lamberto Scannabecchi (later Pope Honorius II) and the Diet of Würzburg (1121) in 1122, Pope Calistus II and Holy Roman Emperor Henry V entered into an {{agreement}} that effectively ended the Investiture Controversy. By {{the terms of the}} agreement, the election of bishops and abbots in Germany was to take place in the emperor's presence as judge between potentially disputing parties, free of bribes, thus retaining to the emperor a crucial role in choosing these great territorial magnates of the Empire. Beyond the borders of Germany, in Burgundy and Italy, the Emperor was to forward the symbols of authority within six months. Calixtus' reference to the feudal homage due the emperor on appointment is guarded: [...] "shall do unto thee for these what he rightfully should" [...] was the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the privilegium <b>granted</b> by Calixtus. The Emperor's right to a substantial imbursement on the election of a bishop or abbot was specifically denied.|$|R
40|$|In {{the spring}} of 2014 I {{received}} funding to hire two collaborative researchers {{to work with me}} on my ethnographic research into Celiac Disease. At that time, I intended to rehire one of the two students I’d hired the summer before and another, new research assistant. Both had asked early in spring semester for a position, and I was looking forward to working with them both. Unfortunately, by the time I received <b>word</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grant,</b> both had gotten anxious about not receiving word and had found other work. Because there was a shortage of available students who had been through our methods course and would be able to live and conduct research locally, I hired two other students to do literature reviews. Although disappointed not to do ethnographic fieldwork on the Celiac project that summer, the students’ work on literature reviews and annotated bibliographies related to planned writing projects has proven quite useful. They produced literature reviews on recent developments in metaphor theory in anthropology (Nicholas Coney) as well as the anthropology of the body (Mariel Pratz-Albert). I’ve drawn on both reviews for my spring 2015 American Ethnological Society (AES) paper, which examines the role of metaphor in the narratives of those with Celiac disease (particularly in how they discuss the rising popularity of the gluten-free diet for non-Celiacs). I also drew on the research for my senior capstone course in fall 2014 (Gender, Sexuality and the Body) and will use the other for my fall 2015 course Language and Culture...|$|R

40|$|Marketing {{executives}} often {{face the}} decision whether {{and for how}} long to grant exclusivity to distributors of their new products. Using an agent based model, we assess how <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth among customers and the competition among structurally equivalent distributors with partially-overlapping customer bases influence the profitability <b>of</b> <b>granting</b> exclusivity for new products. Our results show that the presence of communication spillovers among customers of different distributors can make exclusivity undesirable for the distributors and the industry overall. This reversal of the conventional wisdom occurs because, though exclusivity protects the favored distributor from market share losses to competitors, it also precludes him from benefiting from the positive <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth generated by customers of other distributors. The effect is magnified by both the level of cross-distributor communication among customers and the level of structural equivalence among distributors. The forces at work and the result we obtain apply not only to exclusivity in distribution but also to selling to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) ...|$|R
