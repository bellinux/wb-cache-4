5|$|Etty was {{a regular}} attender at the Royal Academy's life class {{throughout}} his career. Nyssia stands in a pose which Etty had sketched many times, that {{of a woman with}} her knee on a raised plinth and one arm raised holding a hanging rope. (Throughout his career Etty had difficulty painting arms, and generally showed his subjects holding their arms away from their body to expose as much of their torso as possible.) It is possible that Etty intentionally chose the obscure subject of the painting as a pretext to paint a <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> pose. As with many Etty works the female figure has a far better finish {{than the rest of the}} canvas, and it is likely Etty painted Nyssia directly from a life model, completing the rest of the composition later in a studio.|$|E

David Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only {{on the story of}} Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her figure out who she is. An ABC executive recalled, [...] "I remember the creepiness of this <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> horrible, horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her.

Sirtis described her character's relationship with Ziva as electric, explaining that she saw Orli as a counterfoil to Ziva's intensity and drive for vengeance. Their history, she believed, is [...] "kind of mind-blowing"; it provides an explanation for subplots introduced earlier in the episode. She clarified that Director Elbaz would not be a [...] "shrinking flower": [...] "She's kickass. She's strong. She's manipulative. She uses every weapon in her female arsenal.

500|$|During {{the first}} six days of the Kuttantavar festival, Aravan's head (cami) is [...] "danced" [...] around the streets of Kuvagam, with music and {{fireworks}} accompanying it. Each household offers a puja (a kind of devotional ceremony) to Aravan, with lamp-waving, coconut-offerings and other rituals. Traditionally, goats and chickens are sacrificed. On the 13thday, Aravan's [...] "soul" [...] is ritually transferred from his head to a pot, and the head is repainted. On {{the evening of the}} 14thday, a [...] high post is erected on a processional chariot. The post will support Aravan's head and body later in the festival. After the post-setting ceremony (kampam niruttatal), young and middle-aged men (farmers and traders from Koovagam and surrounding villages) who have vowed to marry Aravan purchase thalis—the traditional mark of a married <b>woman,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case a pendant with a piece of turmeric at its centre. The priest, representing Aravan, ties the thalis around their necks in the inner sanctum of the temple. Even married men and men afflicted with diseases, all dressed as women, are described as ritually [...] "marrying" [...] Aravan in the festival, to please the deity.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the season, Loeb said, [...] "When we first started talking about Daredevil, we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a {{psychological}} thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that’s a very powerful, emotional place to start from." [...] On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called [...] "lazy storytelling" [...] and often a way to [...] "spice up" [...] male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an [...] "issue" [...] for the season to tackle. When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity {{and the use of the}} word 'fuck' in the season. Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as [...] "issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [...] issues of consent" [...] while also exploring [...] "feminism and being a <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world", Rosenberg said, [...] "It was never our intention going in , and I think the minute you intend to do that, you’re stepping up on a soap box. If you’re digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you’re going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you’re also going to hit social issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film Being John Malkovich {{has many}} Shakespeare allusions, {{including}} {{a scene in}} which Malkovich is shown rehearsing Richard IIIs lines [...] "Was ever <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> humour woo'd? / Was ever <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> humour won?" [...] where Richard is boasting about using power, lies, and crime to seduce Lady Anne. As Visual Cultures professor Lynn Turner notes, this scene anticipates a parallel scene in which Craig uses deceit to seduce Maxine through Malkovich.
