2500|$|Wood burning {{creates more}} {{atmospheric}} CO2 than biodegradation of wood {{in a forest}} (in a given period of time) because {{by the time the}} bark of a dead tree has rotted, the log has already been occupied by other plants and micro-organisms which continue to sequester the CO2 by integrating the hydrocarbons of the wood into their own life cycle. <b>Wood</b> <b>harvesting</b> and transport operations produce varying degrees of greenhouse gas pollution. [...] Inefficient and incomplete combustion of wood can result in elevated levels of greenhouse gases other than [...] CO2, which may result in positive emissions where the byproducts have greater Carbon dioxide equivalent values. In an attempt to provide quantitative information about the relative output of CO2 to produce electricity of domestic heating, the United Kingdom Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has published a comprehensive model comparing the burning of wood (wood chip) and other fuels, based on 33 scenarios. The model's output is kilogram of CO2 produced per Megawatt hour of delivered energy. Scenario 33 for example, which concerns the production of heat from wood chips produced from UK small roundwood produced from bringing neglected broadleaf forests back into production, shows that burning oil releases 377kg of CO2 while burning woodchip releases 1501kg of CO2 per MW h delivered energy.|$|E

50|$|Latvia's {{legislation}} on forestry {{is among the}} strictest in Europe firmly regulating <b>wood</b> <b>harvesting.</b> Each year the forests produce 25 million cubic meters of timber, while only about 12 - 13 million cubic meters are felled, therefore the amount of mature and old forests continue to increase.|$|E
30|$|According to our {{optimization}} results, it is optimal {{to carry}} out the first thinning as an early energy <b>wood</b> <b>harvest</b> (Policy II) for initially dense stands. For sparse stands, it is optimal to follow conventional forest management regimes (Policy 0). In addition, we found that a constraint of profitable energy <b>wood</b> <b>harvest</b> (Policy I) is not rational and may lead to a very early timing and extremely low intensity of the first thinning. This was caused by a thinning strategy that aimed at minimizing the negative outcome of a conventional first thinning.|$|R

50|$|The rocky, steep valleys {{inhabited}} by S. atra pasubiensis are only marginally exploited for <b>wood</b> <b>harvesting</b> and cattle pasture, and are visited almost only by hikers and hunters.

50|$|All forests {{inhabited}} by S. atra aurorae are exploited for wood since centuries.

40|$|Covering 32 % of the planet, {{boreal forests}} {{are one of}} the last {{relatively}} intact terrestrial biomes, and are a critical carbon sink in global climate dynamics. Mature and old-growth boreal forests provide a large number of products that are culturally and economically important, from wood-based lumber, pulp, and fuel wood, to numerous nonwood products. Intensive <b>wood</b> <b>harvest</b> and conservation of naturally dynamic intact forests tend to be mutually exclusive; where biodiversity is highly valued, <b>wood</b> <b>harvests</b> are limited or banned outright. The authors of this Policy Forum advise that increasing domestic forest protection without decreasing demand for wood necessitates an increase in foreign imports, which introduces a negative impact on forest biodiversity elsewhere. In some cases, exporting impact across the border may cause negative impacts to boomerang back into the country's protected forests...|$|R

50|$|Lodge Bay was the {{accepted}} site of seasonal settlement {{for many of}} the same reasons the Labrador Inuit had practiced use of the area, the unrestricted abundance of resources. This transient lifestyle caused early settlers to reside at often two locations throughout the year. During summer until late autumn, families often lived at the distant outlying communities of Cape St. Charles, Henley Harbour or Battle Harbour. These summer stations were built strategically exposed to the Atlantic Ocean where fishermen could maximize profits of the lucrative fish trade. While conjointly, interior communities such as Lodge Bay and nearby Mary’s Harbour were established for a life during the occasionally treacherous winter and early spring seasons. Winter settlements were immensely focused on trapping, <b>wood</b> <b>harvesting,</b> boat repair and seal hunting.|$|E
50|$|The Māori, {{who were}} the first human {{settlers}} of New Zealand, introduced the kurī and the kiore, a Polynesian dog and rat. The kiore, along with mammals introduced later by Europeans, would cause a major significant adverse impact on indigenous species. One of the greatest negative ecological impacts of the early Māori people was the wholesale burning of forests, {{for the purpose of}} hunting and killing birds. Greater than the bird population decimations was the deforestation of vast tracts of land; approximately half of the native forests of New Zealand were lost within several hundreds of years following initial Māori settlement from the combination of <b>wood</b> <b>harvesting</b> and forest burning. Rāhui is a form of protection of natural resources that Maori implemented as a conservation measure as well as other reasons.|$|E

40|$|Pronounced {{increase}} in construction activities in Tanzania has a corresponding utilization of wood products. This {{adds to the}} already aggravated situation by <b>wood</b> <b>harvest</b> for fuel; manufacturing and forest clearance for agricultural purposes. In most cases exploitation of wood is done to fulfil the immediate social and economic gains while paying minimum attention to the extended environmental ramifications. Among other aspects, the industry is characterized by use of <b>wood</b> <b>harvested</b> from sensitive environments like mangrove forests, for temporary structures such as scaffolds and formworks. On the other hand, high quality timber is used for relatively undeserving joinery works. Worse still, when the temporary structures are demolished the wood end up in cooking stoves as fuel while they could be reused or recycled for construction purposes. This paper presents the observed shortcomings and highlights the applicable mitigations that are being explored in the ongoing research...|$|R
