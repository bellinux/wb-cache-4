Shortages compromise key {{services such as}} firefighting {{and can lead to}} a lack of water for hygiene, sanitation and drinking. Municipal authorities need to monitor and manage this <b>water</b> <b>demand</b> carefully, and may need to advise the public to utilise cleanup methods that do not use water (e.g., cleaning with brooms rather than hoses).|$|E
5|$|Providing an {{adequate}} water supply for Hong Kong {{has always been}} difficult because the region has few natural lakes and rivers, inadequate groundwater sources (inaccessible in most cases due to the hard granite bedrock found in most areas in the territory), a high population density, and extreme seasonable variations in rainfall. Thus about 70 percent of <b>water</b> <b>demand</b> is met by importing water from the Dongjiang River in neighbouring Guangdong province. In addition, freshwater demand is curtailed {{by the use of}} seawater for toilet flushing, using a separate distribution system.|$|E
5|$|Water {{security}} and food security are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four {{times greater than}} the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes, affected their water quality and {{had a significant impact on}} the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 <b>water</b> <b>demand</b> doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.|$|E
30|$|If the time-dependency of {{emissions}} factors {{is to be}} considered, then it is also necessary to consider the time-dependency of <b>water</b> <b>demands.</b> As <b>water</b> <b>demands</b> affect the timing and magnitude of water requirements placed on the WDS, they can directly affect the energy requirements of pumps and as such, affect the optimal use of pumps. Additionally, as the driver for the entire system, the accuracy of modeling a WDS {{is dependent on the}} modeling accuracy of <b>water</b> <b>demands.</b> As discussed in <b>Water</b> <b>demands,</b> while diurnal curves are now widely used to model the variation in <b>water</b> <b>demands</b> over the length of a day, other demand variations have not been widely considered within the reviewed literature. As GHG emissions are accumulated over the life of a WDS, longer term variations, such as seasonal and annual variations, should be modeled in order to accurately simulate the effect that changing <b>water</b> <b>demands</b> have on the amount of GHG emissions produced over the operational lifetime of a system.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} two models {{are set up}} in order to {{forecast}} hourly <b>water</b> <b>demands</b> up to 24 hours ahead and are contrasted to each other. The first model (hereinafter referred to as Patt model) {{is based on the}} representation of the periodical patterns that typically characterize <b>water</b> <b>demands,</b> such as seasonal and weekly patterns of daily <b>water</b> <b>demands</b> and daily patterns of hourly <b>water</b> <b>demands.</b> The second model is based on neural networks (hereinafter referred to as ANN model). Both the models have been applied to three case studies, representing water distribution systems managed by HERA S. p. A., characterized by very different number of users served, and consequently very different average <b>water</b> <b>demands,</b> ranging from 900 L/s for the first case study (CS 1) to about 8 L/s and 1. 5 L/s for the second (CS 2) and third (CS 3) case study, respectively. The results show that in general both the models, Patt and ANN, provide good accuracy for the CS 1. The performances of the both the models tend to decrease for CS 2 and, particularly, for CS 3. In particular, in the validation phase, Patt model is more accurate than ANN model for the CS 1; for the CS 2 the accuracy of the two models are very similar, and for the CS 3 the accuracy of the ANN model is slightly higher than that of the Patt model...|$|R
5|$|Scientists {{predict that}} glaciers will {{continue}} to recede and melt or, in some areas, disappear. It is also predicted that the Cuyo region could face a potential water crisis due {{to an increase in}} <b>water</b> <b>demand</b> caused by a reduction in river streamflows. In northern Patagonia, a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on fruit and vegetable growing owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers. In the north and central parts of the country, the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation, intensifying droughts and leading to desertification. Heat waves could become more frequent and intense, negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs. Intense precipitation could become more common, increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding, since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water (rivers, lakes and oceans). Climate change could extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards. Though most of the coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise, it is predicted that storm surges will become more frequent in coastal areas, affecting locations such as Buenos Aires.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} useful {{features}} of IWFM is the internal calculation of <b>water</b> <b>demands</b> for each land use type. IWFM simulates four land use classes: agricultural, urban, native vegetation, and riparian vegetation. Land use areas are delineated as a time series, with corresponding evapotranspiration rates and water management parameters. Each time step, the land use process applies precipitation, calculates infiltration and runoff, calculates <b>water</b> <b>demands,</b> and determines what portion of the demands are not met by soil moisture. For agricultural and urban land use classes, IWFM then applies surface water and groundwater at specified rates, and optionally adjusts surface water and groundwater to exactly meet <b>water</b> <b>demands.</b> This automatic adjustment feature is especially useful for calculating unmeasured flow components (such as groundwater withdrawals) or for simulating proposed future scenarios such as studying the impacts of potential climate change.|$|R

40|$|Water abstractions for {{irrigation}} purposes {{are higher than}} for any other pan-European water use sector and have a large influence on river runoff regimes. This modelling experiment assesses historic and current irrigation <b>water</b> <b>demands</b> for different crops in five arc minute spatial resolution for pan-Europe. Two different modelling frameworks have been applied in this study. First, soft-coupling the dynamic vegetation model LPJmL with the land use model LandSHIFT leads to overestimations of national irrigation <b>water</b> <b>demands,</b> which are rather high in the southern Mediterranean countries. This {{can be explained by}} unlimited water supply in the model structure and illegal or not gauged water abstractions in the reported data sets. The second modelling framework is WaterGAP 3, which has an integrated conceptual crop specific irrigation module. Irrigation water requirements as modelled with WaterGAP 3 feature a more realistic representation of pan-European water withdrawals. However, in colder humid regions, irrigation <b>water</b> <b>demands</b> are often underestimated. Additionally, a national database on crop-specific irrigated area and water withdrawal for all 42 countries within pan-Europe has been set up and integrated in both model frameworks...|$|R
50|$|Vulnerability {{to water}} stress is {{determined}} almost exclusively by population and development pressure (Vorosmarty, et al., 2000).

40|$|Worldwide {{studies have}} shown that the Mediterranean region is one of the most {{vulnerable}} areas to water crisis. The region is characterized by limited and unequally distributed water resources and increasing <b>water</b> <b>demands.</b> The Ebro catchment (85, 000 km(2), Spain) is representative of this context. Since the late 1970 s, a negative trend in river discharge has been observed, attributed to a decrease in mean precipitation, and a rise in mean temperature and in water consumption. Finally, over 230 storage dams regulate river discharge. In this context, an integrated water resources modeling framework was developed to evaluate the current and future capacity of water resources to meet domestic and agricultural <b>water</b> <b>demands</b> as well as environmental flow requirements. The approach was driven by a conceptual rainfall-runoff model generating water supplies and by a demand driven storage dam model. The approach defines current pressures on water resources and evaluates future changes in water allocation in the medium term under climatic and water use scenarios, considering changes in population and in irrigated areas. Currently, <b>water</b> <b>demands</b> in the Ebro catchment are satisfied. In 2050, water resources are projected to decrease by 15 - 35 % during spring and summer, leading to growing competition among users and severe water shortages for irrigated agriculture. This study provides an original approach to identify the most vulnerable regions to water use conflicts. It also highlights the interest of integrated modeling for complete analysis of the ability of water resources to meet <b>water</b> <b>demands</b> in complex change scenarios as a support for decision making...|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s it was {{proposed}} that the Craig-goch reservoir should be substantially increased in size with a new and higher downstream dam together with another dam to the north-west, impounding water that would otherwise have flowed down the Ystwyth valley. This scheme would have created a huge reservoir dwarfing all others in Mid Wales, and flooding miles of wild upland valleys.
