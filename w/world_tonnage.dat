50|$|In {{the years}} after World War I the Norwegian {{merchant}} fleet recouped its losses and expanded into new sectors, primarily tankers but also dry cargo vessels. The 1930s, in particular, were a growth period, {{in contrast to the}} other major shipping nations. By the end of 1938 some 7% of <b>world</b> <b>tonnage</b> was Norwegian and Norway was the fourth-largest shipping nation, behind the United Kingdom, the USA and Japan. Moreover, the expansion was based on new building, thus lowering the median age of Norwegian vessels. Most of the new vessels were powered by diesel motors; they accounted for some 62% of the fleet, while Japan had some 27%, and the UK 25%. Around 42% of the fleet was modern tankers, a total of 18% of the world tanker tonnage. Norwegian shipowners were innovative and willing to take risks in ordering new vessels during the depression.|$|E

The Baltic dry index (BDI), {{an indicator of the}} dry bulk business, hit more than 4, 000 in 2010 but has tumbled down to approximately 900 recently. The bulk shipping business is still suffering in a devastating situation. Many ship owners have forced to lay up their vessels to reduce the operating loss. It is believed that the poor profitability of the dry bulk shipping market is mainly caused by the over expansion in shipping capacity.

In this period neutral shipping accounted for about one third of British imports. In the final two years of the war a much stricter regime of freight control was introduced that resulted in the withdrawal of a large proportion of neutral shipowners from British and Allied trade. Together with the mounting losses of tonnage due to the German submarine campaign this created an acute shortage of carrying capacity and reduced imports.

40|$|There are 51 yachts with a 3000 GT or more. Within {{the yacht}} {{industry}} it’s common that ships choose {{to register with}} the British Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). The yacht industry is a relatively unexplored but on the rise segment in the shipping world. The study examines how bridge duties differs on yachts that are registered with the MCA and ships in the Swedish merchant fleet. As the Swedish merchant fleet is decreasing it’s more common that Swedish seafarers goes abroad to find employment. The issues {{brought up in the}} study revolves around comparing bridge routines and regulations on yachts versus Swedish merchant ships. The study has been done by first analyzing regulations and recommendations from specific authorities. Then there has been semi structured personal interviews conducted with five navigational officers from the different segments. The informants answered the studies questionnaire from their own experience and knowledge, to provide a truthful image of their normal workday. The interview results indicate that there are similarities within the bridge duties when comparing the yacht industry and the Swedish merchant fleet.

Furthermore the result show that there are occasions were, according to the informants, {{it can be difficult to}} comply with laws concerning work and rest. About 80 % of the <b>world</b> <b>tonnage</b> have implemented MLC, among them MCA and Transportstyrelsen. This means there are no differences when it comes to laws concerning work and rest hours, for the yachts that the study includes and Swedish flagged merchant ships.

40|$|Cast Iron, {{the first}} man – made composite, is at least 2500 year old. It remains the most {{important}} casting material, with over 70 % of the total <b>world</b> <b>tonnage.</b> The man for cast iron longevity are its wide range of mechanical and physical properties coupled with its competitive price. Ductile iron or popularly known as spherodized graphite iron (SGiron) is a special variety of cast iron having carbon content more than 3 % and has graphite present in compact, spherical shapes. These compact spheroid hamper {{the continuity of the}} matrix much less than graphite flakes which results in higher strength and toughness with a structure that resembles gray cast iron, thus imparting superior mechanical properties i. e. much higher than all other cast irons and which can be compared to steel. This unique property enables ductile iron to be used for numerous industrial applications. The excellent combination of mechanical properties obtained in S. G. iron can further be improved by the heat treatment. The most recent development in this regard is the production of Austempered Ductile Iron (ADI). It provides an excellent combination of high tensile strength, wear resistance along with good corrosion resistance and quite significant amount of ductility. Due to these factors, S. G. or ductile iron is austempered when a very favouurable combination of various properties is required. But this type of treatment is bit tricky, since it require controlled heating and isothermal holding of the material. So it is necessary to find some attractive methods for property development in S. G. iron. The present work is an attempt to study the properties enhancement of ductile iron by heat treatment. Normalizing, Austenitization, Quenching & Tempering, Austempering methods are applied to study the hardness, tensile strength, and impact strength of the material. The mechanical properties obtain by various technique have been compared to one another using two different grades of S. G. Iron (one with copper and another without copper).

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the European Union (EU) has become a global actor. The global or {{international}} context in which the EU has sought to define its identity, promote its interests and construct its policies, is increasingly seen as the stage on which the EU must act. Frank Hoffmeister indicates that, the EU has been actively involved in most of the significant international organizations, though many of these organizations have been less flexible regarding the full membership of the EU. The increasing effectiveness of the involvement of the EU in the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is a strategic goal of the EU. In 2010, the European Economic Area (EEA=EU, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) registered tonnage came to some 209 million gross tonnage on a total <b>world</b> <b>tonnage</b> of 916 million gross tonnage. Overall the EEA controls 41. 6 % of the global commercial fleet measured in gross tonnage. A large volume of EU legislation on maritime transport (e. g. Erika I, n, HI packages) has been adopted in the past decade. ' Nevertheless, the EU's role in the IMO is still very limited. Currently, the EU is not a member of the IMO, neither is the EU a contracting party to most international conventions adopted under the auspices of the IMO (IMO Conventions), e. g. International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) etc. The European Commission (the Commission) does, however, hold observer status in the IMO and has appointed a permanent representative to the MO. The Commission is not satisfied with this situation. For this reason, the Commission recommended to the Council of the European Union (the Council) in 2002 that the EU should accede to the IMO as a full member. This has received political support from the European Parliament (the Parliament), most notably in its Resolution on Improving Safety at Sea (2003 / 2235 (INI)). Liu Nengye and Frank Mae...|$|E
