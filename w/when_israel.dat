5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Israel</b> besieged Beirut in 1982, al-Wazir, {{disagreed}} with the PLO's leftist members and Salah Khalaf; he proposed that the PLO pull out of Beirut. Nevertheless, al-Wazir and his aide Abu al-Walid planned Beirut's defense and helped direct PLO forces against the IDF. PLO forces were eventually defeated and then expelled from Lebanon, {{with most of the}} leadership relocating to Tunis, although al-Wazir and 264 other PLO members were received by King Hussein of Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Al-Shifa Hospital ("the Cure") {{was founded}} in the Rimal District by the British Mandate {{government}} in the 1940s. Housed in an army barracks, it originally provided quarantine and treatment for febrile diseases. When Egypt administered Gaza, this original department was relocated and al-Shifa became the city's central hospital. <b>When</b> <b>Israel</b> withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved. He also ordered {{the establishment of a}} second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name. In 1957, the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named Nasser Hospital. Today, al-Shifa remains Gaza's largest medical complex.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, the British {{captured}} Palestine {{from the}} Ottomans, and in 192223 Tubas {{was incorporated into}} the British Mandate of Palestine. In 1947, the United Nations drew up a partition plan to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab states; Tubas and the surrounding villages and hamlets were {{to be included in}} the Arab state. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Fawzi al-Qawuqji led 750 Arab Liberation Army (ALA) soldiers to Tubas from Transjordan and set up base there; Tubas would serve as the ALA's headquarters in central Palestine throughout the war. Transjordan (became Jordan in April 1949) annexed the city along with the entire West Bank, after gaining control of it during the war. In 1955 the first girls' school was opened. Tubas was under their control until 1967, <b>when</b> <b>Israel</b> occupied the West Bank during the Six-Day War.|$|E
50|$|The {{seeds of}} change were sown in 1967, <b>when</b> <b>Israel's</b> victory in the Six-Day War spawned messianic trends among {{religious}} Israeli Jews that resulted in {{many members of the}} NRP moving further right.|$|R
50|$|Keshet {{was founded}} in 1993 <b>when</b> <b>Israel’s</b> Channel 2 was formed along with two other operators, Telad and Reshet. The company was started by Alex Gilady, the current {{president}} of Keshet and a former vice president at NBC International in London.|$|R

Those days also saw the formation of Israel's nuclear policy. Supporters of Israel's nuclear plan, headed by Ben-Gurion along with Shimon Peres and Ernst David Bergmann, acted {{behind the scenes to}} promote the program. Against them, Livneh and Leibowitz formed The Committee for Denuclearization of the Middle East. <b>When</b> <b>Israel's</b> nuclear activities were exposed in The New York Times in December 1960, he was joined by several members of the Nuclear Energy Committee, who resigned <b>when</b> <b>Israel's</b> cooperation with France made the Atomic project practical.|$|R
5|$|On October 6, 1973, an Arab {{coalition}} led by Egypt and Syria, supported {{with arms}} and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in the Yom Kippur War. Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking {{personal responsibility for}} any response by Arab nations. More than a week later, {{by the time the}} U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; <b>when</b> <b>Israel</b> gained the upper hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3, placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war. This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.|$|E
5|$|The Six-Day {{war began}} <b>when</b> <b>Israel</b> {{launched}} {{air strikes against}} Egypt's air force on 5 June 1967. The war ended in an Arab defeat and Israel's occupation of several Arab territories, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Although Nasser and his Arab allies had been defeated, Arafat and Fatah could claim a victory, in {{that the majority of}} Palestinians, who had up to that time tended to align and sympathize with individual Arab governments, now began to agree that a 'Palestinian' solution to their dilemma was indispensable. Many primarily Palestinian political parties, including George Habash's Arab Nationalist Movement, Hajj Amin al-Husseini's Arab Higher Committee, the Islamic Liberation Front and several Syrian-backed groups, virtually crumbled after their sponsor governments' defeat. Barely a week after the defeat, Arafat crossed the Jordan River in disguise and entered the West Bank, where he set up recruitment centers in Hebron, the Jerusalem area and Nablus, and began attracting both fighters and financiers for his cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} source mentioning {{this specific}} site {{as a place}} of worship is from the 16th century. The previous sites used by Jews for mourning the destruction of the Temple, during periods when access to the city was prohibited to them, lay to the east, on the Mount of Olives and in the Kidron Valley below it. From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence {{at the foot of the}} wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish quarter, and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, <b>when</b> <b>Israel</b> gained control of the site following the Six-Day War. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.|$|E
50|$|The {{photography}} {{department of}} the Government Press Office was established by David Ildan in 1948 in Tel Aviv.

50|$|Relations {{between the}} two were tied {{during the early years}} of Nazi hunting <b>when</b> <b>Israel's</b> Mossad kidnapped former-Nazi Adolf Eichmann despite Argentine protestations of a {{violation}} of its sovereignty.

50|$|The {{increasing}} urbanization around The Hague {{forced the}} painters of the Hague School to look further afield for their subjects. <b>When</b> <b>Israëls</b> told Neuhuys how picturesque Laren was, he moved, in 1883; two years later, Anton Mauve also moved there and, together with him, Neuhuys {{was regarded as}} {{the founder of the}} Laren School.

However, the court's ruling was not backed up by the Religious Services Ministry until 2012, <b>when</b> <b>Israel's</b> Chief Rabbinical Council ruled that women can deliver eulogies at funerals, but that {{it is up to the}} community rabbi to decide on a case-by-case basis.|$|R
5000|$|On 28 May 2012, <b>when</b> <b>Israel's</b> Habima theatre company {{performed}} at the London Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, the PSC and other BDS groups organised a protest outside the building.

5000|$|This crisis deepened, <b>when</b> <b>Israel's</b> Rabbinate {{called into}} {{question}} the validity of soldiers who had undergone conversion in the army, meaning a soldier killed in action could not be buried according to Jewish law.In 2010, the rabbinate created a further distrust in the conversion process when it began refusing to recognize orthodox converts from the United States as Jewish.
