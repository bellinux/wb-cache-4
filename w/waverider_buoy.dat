40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] buoys {{are widely used}} to collect routine ocean wave measurements. While accelerometer and tilt sensors {{have been used for}} decades to measure the wave-induced buoy displacements, alternative global positioning system (GPS) sensor packages have been introduced recently that are generally smaller, less expensive, and do not require calibration. In this study, the capabilities of several GPS sensors are evaluated with field observations in wind-sea and swell conditions off the California coast. The GPS buoys used in this study include Datawell Directional Waverider and Mini Directional <b>Waverider</b> <b>buoys</b> equipped with a specialized GPS Doppler shift sensor, and a low-cost experimental drifter equipped with an ‘‘off the shelf’’ GPS receiver for absolute position tracking. Various GPS position receivers were attached to the <b>Waverider</b> <b>buoys</b> to evaluate their potential use in low-cost wave-resolving drifters. Intercomparisons between the Datawell GPS-based buoys, the experimental GPS drifter, and a conventional Datawell buoy with an accelerometer–tilt–compass sensor package, show good agreement in estimates of wave frequency and direction spectra. Despite the limited (several meters) absolute accuracy of the GPS position receivers, the horizontal wave orbital displacements are accurately resolved, even in benign (significant wave height less than 1 m) swell conditions. Vertical sea surface displacements were not well resolved by the GPS position receivers with built-in or small patch antennas, but accurately measured when an external precision antenna was attached to the drifter. Overall, the field tests show excellent agreement between Datawell buoys using GPS and motion-sensor packages, and demonstrate the feasibility of observing ocean surface waves with lowcost GPS-tracked drifters.

The crest heights were almost perfectly Rayleigh distributed over the entire range of observation. The distribution of the wave heights is close to a Rayleigh distribution with scale factor 0. 88 (rather than 1 as in the conventional Rayleigh distribution), but it is better approximated with a Weibull distribution with a shape factor 2. 162 (rather than 2, as for a Rayleigh distribution).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Swell propagates across thousands of kilometers of ocean in almost unchanged parallel wave fronts. Within the nearshore region however, refraction causes wave fronts to turn toward shallow depths transforming the wave field. The Nearshore Canyon Experiment (NCEX) Pilot, conducted from October 10 to October 17, 2002, observed wave transformation across the Scripps and La Jolla canyon system near San Diego, CA. Four Datawell Directional <b>Waverider</b> <b>Buoys,</b> three Nortek Vector PUV recorders, and two pressure sensors were deployed in depths ranging from 10 to 300 m. Observed energy density spectra and mean propagation directions were examined for three case studies {{representative of the}} range of observed swell conditions. Observations were compared to predictions of a back-refraction model provided by Dr. William O'Reilly. Observations indicate that refraction causes the waves to propagate along the deep axes of the Scripps and La Jolla canyons. At the shallow canyon heads, the convergence and divergence of ray trajectories cause extreme (2 - 3 orders of magnitude!) spatial variations in wave energy. Considering the complexity of the canyon environment, predictions of wave transformation agree surprisingly well with observations. Ensign, United States Naval Reserv...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedAccurate predictions of nearshore wave conditions {{are critical to}} the success of military operations in the littoral environment. Although linear spectral-refraction theory is used by the main operational forecasting centers in the world for these predictions, owing to a lack of field studies its accuracy in regions of complex bathymetry such as steep shoals and submarine canyons is unknown. This study examines the accuracy of linear spectral-refraction theory in areas of complex nearshore bathymetry with three months of extensive wave data collected during the Nearshore Canyon Experiment (NCEX) held in the fall of 2003. The field site, off La Jolla California, is characterized by two submarine canyons that strongly affect the propagation of long period Pacific swell. Data from 7 directional <b>waverider</b> <b>buoys,</b> 17 bottom pressure recorders, and 12 pressure-velocity sensors, were examined and compared to predictions made by a high resolution spectral-refraction model. Analysis reveals large spatial variation in wave heights over the area especially in the vicinity of the canyon heads, where wave heights vary by as much as an order of magnitude over a few hundred meters. This extreme variation in wave conditions across the canyons is surprisingly well described by refraction theory with typical errors of nearshore wave height predictions of about 20 percent.

40|$|Extreme ” {{waves are}} {{commonly}} defined as extremely large waves {{compared to the}} background wave field and are often called “rogue ” waves. Wave buoy records off Canada’s west coast reveal strong spatial and temporal variability in the occurrence rate of rogue waves with differences up to a factor three over distances less than 100 km. Strong tidal currents interact with the wave field. On the continental shelf rogue waves occur, on average, twice as frequently during strong currents compared to slack tide. In Dixon Entrance rogue wave occurrence peaks during the weakest currents. The significant wave height, characterizing the background wave field, is also strongly affected by currents. Modulations of up to 2 m within one tidal cycle are observed. In coastal locations the wave field is modulated at the tidal semi-diurnal period, in deep water modulations occur at the inertial period. An important aspect, {{in addition to the}} large wave height, is the surprise effect of extreme waves. So-called “unexpected waves ” are waves which are twice as large as any wave during a quiescent period of at least a few minutes duration. Their occurrence rate has been modelled based on random linear superposition and extracted from surface elevation records from <b>waverider</b> <b>buoys</b> at about 50 locations along Canada’s east and west coast.

40|$|This review {{examines}} {{the influence of}} physical oceanographic processes on catchability of spanner crab (Ranina ranina) in northeast Australia. Physical oceanographic processes may affect crab catchability by influencing their activity levels and ability to detect bait. Bottom temperature, current velocity, and swell intensity appear to influence catches of spanner crab. At this stage, it appears warmer temperatures enhance catchability of spanner crab. Spanner crabs were more catchable in stronger currents, and crabs were observed to arrive from down-current of baited traps. However, a decline in catch was observed following periods of intense swell. Data derived from <b>Waverider</b> <b>buoys</b> suggest that occasionally these periods create strong wave-induced seabed current velocities, lead to at depths of 70 m. The oscillatory motion of wave-induced seabed velocities may cause higher suspended sediment concentrations. These observations corroborate the views of local fishermen that spanner crabs avoid ‘murky’ water. The effect of turbidity on catchability requires further research. Overall, we advocate that studies employ robust methodologies to measure physical oceanographic processes to accurately predict catchability. Moreover, large-scale physical oceanographic processes may also {{play an important role}} in catchability of spanner crab; including upwelling, eddies, and the East Australian Current. Integrating physical oceanography and fisheries interactions will considerably benefit commercial fishermen as well as provide valuable information for evidence-based management of these valuable resources.

This comparison suggests that specific processes are needed to manage the effect of noise and sensitivity on the partitioning method when looking at the different spectra. The research has focused on the Celtic sea region for the 2003 to 2005 period when the Pisces radar system was operational.

To this end, the 1 km 2, grid-connected zone is equipped with a comprehensive instruments network sensing met-ocean processes and especially waves, with two identical directional <b>Waverider</b> <b>buoys</b> deployed on the site since 2009. For the design of moored floating structures and, a fortiori, floating marine energy converters, the knowledge of the main wave resource – for regular operation – but also extreme conditions – for moorings and device survivability – has to be as precise as possible. Also, the consideration of the multiple wave systems (swell, wind sea) making up the sea state is a key asset for the support of developers before and during the testing phase. To this end, a spectral partitioning algorithm has been implemented which enables the individual characterisation of wave systems, in particular that of their spectral peakedness which is especially addressed in this work. Peakedness {{has been shown to be}} strongly related to the groupiness of large waves and is defined here as the standard JONSWAP’s peak enhancement factor γ.

Model nowcasts of frequency spectra and mean wave directions are compared to buoy measurements over a six-month period from 1 October 2000 to 31 March 2001. At the Pacific buoy locations, individual swell events were identified in the spectra from the three models and the buoy data. Predicted and observed swell frequencies and arrival directions are compared as well as the total energy transported past the buoy over the duration of each individual event. At all buoy locations, predicted and observed wave energy fluxes integrated over fixed frequency ranges are compared. All three models yield reliable nowcasts of swell arrivals at the buoy locations. In most cases, the models under-predict the energy measured by the buoys. WAVEWATCH III better resolves low-frequency swells than WAM, possibly owing to a superior numerical scheme.

40|$|Satellite {{altimetry}} is {{a valuable}} tool for the determination of instantaneous sea level or mean sea surface height. Beside these quantities, the returning waveform and the backscatter coefficient {{can be used for}} computing the significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed. Both values are only raw estimates and have to be calibrated properly for useful operational services, like weather forecasting, ship routing or storm warnings. The accuracy of the satellite derived wind speed and SWH is degraded due to insufficient in-situ data used for calibration or the large distance between the in-situ sensors and the measurements. Only a few locations worldwide, oil platforms or buoys, exist for calibrations. The limited geographical distribution causes problems due to the different sea state behavior in different regions. In some studies ECMWF wind fields are used for calibration, but the local wind may vary more rapidly than computed from the models. In addition, the wind speed retrieval algorithm as used today was developed for Geosat and has to be calibrated and inter-calibrated between different satellites, e. g. to ERS- 2 and TOPEX/Poseidon in order to get comparable values.

40|$|The Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH), {{with the}} {{assistance}} of Cardno (NSW/ACT) and Baird Australia, have developed the NSW Coastal Ocean Wave Model – a coupled WAVEWATCH III/SWAN modelling system that has been designed to simulate historical and potential future coastal wave climates. The purpose of the model is to investigate latitudinal and temporal variability in NSW deep-water wave climates, and alongshore variability in nearshore wave conditions. This paper describes the wave modelling facility, discusses the evaluation of model performance to date, and describes the proposed wave data products, which will be useful for assessing coastal hazard risks in NSW. Measured wave records in NSW are enviable by global standards, with <b>Waverider</b> <b>buoys</b> (WRBs) deployed along the coastline since the mid- 1970 s. However, wave modelling provides an opportunity to address some limitations of the existing measurement records, including: the sampling frequency of earlier instruments; instrument failure (particularly during storms); the relatively recent capability to measure wave directions; and deployment durations at different locations – e. g. prior to 2011, directional buoys were only deployed at Sydney (1992), Byron Bay (1999) and Batemans Bay (2001). As measurements are not available for particularly stormy periods experienced during the 1950 s, 1960 s and early 1970 s, extreme values derived from more recent data may under estimate storm-wave climates. Thus the directionality and extreme nature of NSW wave climates may not be fully resolved. Simulated wave climates generated by the NSW Coastal Ocean Wave Model have been evaluated against measurement records and other wave models. For example, comparison of CFSR-driven model predictions with WRB data for 1998 - 2009 suggest that predicted peak storm wave height and direction are overall very good, whilst mean wave period is typically under predicted. Although model-data agreement varies along the NSW coastline, the simulated wave climates are consistent with available measurement data, and improve on existing model data. Therefore the wave model products will address some limitations of WRB records, particularly wave directions and the definition of storm peaks. 18 page(s...|$|R

The track of these storms, generated near the North America east coast, is strongly influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). When the NAO is in its positive phase they normally track northeast and reach Western Europe well north of the Iberian Peninsula, in the British Islands or Scandinavia. However, in the negative NAO situation,the track of the storms is more zonal and south than usual, due to a weakened NAO. The characteristics of wave regime in Portugal are shown to be strongly related to the NAO phase and corresponding storm tracking. Positive NAO storms, tracking northeast towards the north of Europe, drive longer period swell from the northwest, whereas negative NAO storms have associated shorter period swell arriving to Portugal from a more westerly direction. The relation between the NAO phase and the storm tracks and {{the characteristics of the}} wave regime is investigated with ten year observations from four directional <b>waverider</b> coastal <b>buoys,</b> located off the coast of Portugal...|$|R
40|$|In coastal {{engineering}} waves often play a dominant role. To predict the wave behaviour in coastal regions numerical wave propagation {{models have been}} developed. This study deals with the verification of two models against measurements in the field, namely HISWA and SWAN. The second generation model HISWA has already proven to perform well for both engineering and research purposes. The third generation model SWAN is a new model, still under development. Also made by Delft University of Technology, SWAN {{is more or less}} the improved sequel to HISWA. Both models are based on the action density balance, which is made stationary to reduce the required computer capacity. They simulate wave growth and decay accounting for wind input, bottom friction, depth limited wave breaking, and whitecapping. The main differences between the models are the fact that SW AN is spectral both in frequencies and in directions, whilst in HISWA the frequencies are parametric. Secondly, the numerical scheme in SWAN for the wave propagation is unconditionally stable and encompasses waves from aU directions (360 °). In HISWA the directional sector wherein wave propagation is considered is limited to a maximum of 1200 to obtain stability. Furthermore - being third generation - SWAN allows the spectrum to develop without any a priori constraints. During the measuring campaign, which was carried out by the Coastal Research Station Norderney, in the winter of 1995 - 1996, nine <b>Waverider</b> <b>buoys</b> recorded wave data. These buoys were located in the Norderneyer Seegat, a Wadden Sea area. Two cases have been simulated with SW AN and HISWA: one during high tide and one during low tide. I varied several parameters to examine the influence on the wave heights. These variations concern wind input formulation, wind speed, nonlinear wave wave interactions, friction, breaking, whitecapping, water level and incoming wave height. With reference to these research runs a set of input parameters is composed with which the models perform best in the area of this research. Both models tum out to have a good performance indicator (> 90 %). It has been found that the wave heights are to a large extent determined by the wind and by breaking. The wave height of the incoming wave at the seaward boundary of the computational domain is of minor importance. In equal circumstances, SWAN tends to calculate higher wave heights than HISWA. It appeared from this study that SWAN performs slightly better than HISWA and is therefore a suitable tool for wave prediction in a Wadden Sea area.
