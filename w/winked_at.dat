While the passes were at best a dubious defence of his capture, British {{admiralty}} and vice-admiralty courts (especially in North America) heretofore had often <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> privateers' excesses into piracy, and Kidd may have been hoping that the passes would provide the legal fig leaf that would allow him to keep Quedagh Merchant and her cargo. Renaming the seized merchantman Adventure Prize, he set sail for Madagascar.|$|E

After his son left, he remained briefly in Manila, making final preparations and arming a galley of 28 benches, in which he was to sail. This galley he manned with good Chinese rowers, with pay. According to Antonio de Morga, in order to win the good will of the rowers, he would not allow them to be chained, and even <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> their carrying certain weapons.|$|E

During one of Michaels' matches televised on August 9, 1992, Martel came to ringside and <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> Sherri, who returned the gesture. At the SummerSlam Spectacular, Sherri {{came to the}} ring during one of Martel's matches and <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> him. Both Michaels and Martel were [...] "heel" [...] wrestlers who bragged about their good looks, and Sherri had them agree not to hit {{each other in the}} face during their SummerSlam match.|$|E

2500|$|She {{planned a}} lavish wedding, going first to Oshkosh, making {{arrangements}} {{for her family}} to attend the event, and purchasing clothing and jewelry for them. Her mother was proud that her daughter was marrying a wealthy man, and Baby Doe herself was quite happy. [...] At her wedding in Washington, she wore a white satin dress that cost $7,000 and the $90,000 necklace known as the [...] "Isabella" [...] necklace. [...] Two days after the wedding, the priest who had performed the ceremony refused to sign the marriage license {{when he learned that}} both the bride and the groom had previously divorced and that Baby Doe was a Roman Catholic. [...] Although Tabor’s contemporaries had <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> or ignored his dalliance with Baby Doe, Tabor’s divorce and quick remarriage created a scandal which prevented the couple from being accepted in polite society. Only a few months later, Horace's bid to be elected governor of Colorado ended in failure. Baby Doe's father died at around the same time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the episode was filmed in advance, and the whole episode was directed by Clive Arnold, who said, [...] "As the only drama asked {{to be involved with}} the Olympic Torch Relay, it is a huge honour for EastEnders and for everyone involved—a truly once in a lifetime opportunity. I was so excited and thrilled when I was asked {{to be part of the}} episode and I know that every member of cast and crew feel exactly the same way." [...] Fenwick revealed there were [...] "strict rules about haircuts and all that because of continuity", saying that because of the warm weather when they filmed the pre-recorded section, he and Harold were [...] "quite brown", so said they might have to use fake tan. The live scenes used 19 cameras, along with the 31 regular cast members, plus 11 child cast members and at least 450 extras. As the programme switched from pre-recorded to live scenes, Fenwick, in character, <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> the camera and said [...] "Here we go!" [...] Part of the relay was shown on BBC News.|$|E
2500|$|Pyarelal of the Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo {{quoted in}} an {{interview}} that [...] "Rajesh Khanna was lucky for us and we were lucky for him too. From the 1969 Do Raaste to the 1986 Amrit, we gave hits together both as films and as music scores.... When we went on our first overseas concert tour in 1984, he came and danced to three songs. He was very particular about his music and would take a tape home if he could not assess a song. He would then give his feedback after a day or two. But if he liked a song at the sitting, he would loudly shout [...] "Wah! Wah!" [...] in appreciation…. It was God’s blessing that we came up with such a vast range of hit songs for him, including in his home productions Roti and films like Chhailla Babu, Chakravyuha, Fiffty Fiffty, Amar Deep and Anurodh. Incidentally, he had a stake in Mehboob Ki Mehndi too. He had great interest in music and a terrific sense of melody too. His music is dominated by Pancham (R.D. Burman) and us and we accepted Shakti Samanta’s Anurodh only because Rajesh Khanna had some misunderstanding with Pancham then, {{and did not want to}} work with him." [...] Khanna would always request music directors to fit in Kishore Kumar wherever possible. In fact, Kishore was very reluctant to sing [...] "Waada Tera Waada" [...] in Dushman and suggested to Laxmikant-Pyarelal to get it sung by Rafi. Then Laxmikant made Kishore meet Rajesh Khanna and Khanna <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> Laxmikant and told Kishore that in that case the song should be scrapped. On hearing this, Kishore immediately agreed to sing it by himself for Khanna.|$|E
2500|$|Grandi followed, {{speaking}} for {{one and a}} half hours. He read out and explained his document, concluding his speech with Mussolini's citation of 1924 [...] "Let perish all the factions, so that the Nation can live". After Grandi spoke Farinacci, who explained that his criticism ran opposite to Grandi's: in fact, while Grandi contended that Mussolini had betrayed the constitution, the real victim of betrayal was Fascism. Farinacci continued saying that in order to win the war it was necessary to wipe out the democrats and liberals still nested in the Party, as well as the generals; to give back to the King the supreme command of the armed forces; to unify the war direction with the Germans; to strengthen the Party. At the end of his speech he read his proposed OdG, which summarized all these points. After some minor interventions spoke Bottai, the Fascist intellectual, who made a purely political speech, defending the OdG. Then came Ciano, who spoke boldly, summarizing the history of the alliance with the Germans, and declaring that the Italians were not the traitors, but the betrayed. At 23:30 Galbiati, the chief of the MVSN (the Fascist militia) <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> Scorza, who whispered something to Mussolini. The Duce announced that, due to the length of the meeting, some comrades had asked for a postponement to the next day. At this point, Grandi jumped from his chair crying that none could go out before they had voted on his OdG, and that it was shameful to go to sleep when Italian soldiers were dying for their fatherland. Mussolini stared at him, but unwillingly agreed. Never before in the 20-years long history of the assembly had anyone dared to ask for a vote: since fascism was strongly anti-parliamentary, in all previous meetings only discussions summarized by the Duce had taken place. At midnight the meeting was suspended for 10 minutes: while the others drank lemonade and coffee substitutes, Mussolini, who suffered from an ulcer, drank a cup of milk. In the meantime, Grandi collected the signatures to his OdG.|$|E
