40|$|Abstract: {{the study}} on {{dynamical}} model of <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail of high-speed train is a focus nowadays. In this paper, the dynamical model of <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail of high-speed train is constructed {{according to the}} damping force and the dry friction between <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail.

5000|$|The <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> axle can {{be viewed}} as a version of the lever, with a drive force applied {{tangentially}} to the perimeter of the <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> a load force applied to the axle, respectively, that are balanced around the hinge which is the fulcrum. The mechanical advantage of the <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> axle is the ratio of the distances from the fulcrum to the applied loads, or what is the same thing the ratio of the diameter of the <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> axle. [...] A major application is in wheeled vehicles, in which the <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> axle are used to reduce friction of the moving vehicle with the ground. Other examples of devices which use the <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> axle are capstans, belt drives and gears.|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} of <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear in the railway field is of {{fundamental}} importance to the safe and cost effective operation of the railways. Twin disc wear testing is used extensively for studying wear of <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail materials. The University of Huddersfield twin disc rig {{was used in this}} paper to examine the effect of surface conditions on <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear measurement under a range of wheel/rail contact conditions, with and without contaminants. This work focuses on an investigation of the effect of dry, wet, and lubricated conditions and the effect of contaminants such as sand on <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear. The <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear measurements were carried out by using a replica material and an optical profilometer that allows measurement of wear in difficult location with high accuracy. The results have demonstrated the rate at which both water <b>and</b> oil reduce <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear. Scratches and other damage were seen on the <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail surfaces after the addition of sand <b>and</b> consequently both <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear damage rates increased under these conditions. This work introduced the replica material and an optical instrument as effective tools to study the effect of surface conditions on <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear is a {{significant}} issue in railway systems. Accurate prediction of this wear can improve economy, ride comfort, prevention of derailment and planning of maintenance interventions. Poor prediction can result in failure and consequent delay and increased costs {{if it is not}} controlled in an effective way. However, prediction of <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear is still a great challenge for railway engineers and operators. The aim {{of this paper is to}} predict <b>wheel</b> wear <b>and</b> rail wear using an artificial neural network. Nonlinear Autoregressive models with exogenous input neural network (NARXNN) have been developed for <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear prediction. Testing with a twin disc rig, together with measurement of wear using replica material and a profilometer have been carried out for <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear under dry, wet and lubricated conditions and after sanding. Tests results from the twin disk rig have been used to train, validate, and test the neural network. <b>Wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail profiles plus load, speed, yaw angle, and first and second derivative of the <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail profiles were used as an inputs to the neural network, while the output of neural network was the <b>wheel</b> wear <b>and</b> rail wear. Accuracy of <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear prediction using the neural network was investigated and assessed in term of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results demonstrate that the neural network can be used efficiently to predict <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear. The methods of collecting wear data using the replica material and the profilometer have also proved effective for <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail wear measurements for training and validating the neural network. The laboratory tests have aimed to validate the wear predictions for realistic <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> rail profiles and materials but they necessarily cover only a limited set of conditions. The next steps for this work will be to test the methods for rail <b>and</b> <b>wheel</b> data from field tests...|$|R

5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{earliest}} evidence of chariot use are the burials of horse and chariot remains by the Andronovo (Sintashta-Petrovka) culture in modern Russia and Kazakhstan, dated to approximately 2000 BC.

The Hittites became well known throughout the ancient world for their prowess with the chariot. Widespread use of the chariot in warfare across most of Eurasia coincides approximately {{with the development of}} the composite bow, known from c.1600 BC.

5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the resistance to rolling contact fatigue of a-C:H:W and MoS 2 /Ti coated gears. The investigation of rolling contact fatigue was realised by means of a gear test rig using FZG PT C/ 10 / 90 pitting test. Four material combinations of gears were tested: <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> pinion uncoated, <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> pinion coated, <b>wheel</b> coated <b>and</b> pinion uncoated as well as <b>wheel</b> uncoated <b>and</b> pinion coated. The tests were performed using for lubrication mineral gear oil of API GL- 5 performance level and 80 W/ 90 viscosity grade. The results indicate that for the coated/coated pair (<b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> pinion coated) and uncoated/coated pair (uncoated <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> coated pinion) a significant decrease in the fatigue life compared to the uncoated gears was obtained. The best results were obtained in the case of the coated/uncoated pair (a-C:H:W coated <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> uncoated pinion) – even fourfold increase in the fatigue life was observed. This shows a very high potential of application of PVD coatings for gears...|$|R
