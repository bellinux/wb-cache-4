A remote and <b>wireless</b> <b>bearing</b> condition system allows the bearings to be inspected in remote or hazardous environments and increases the machine reliability. To minimize the transmission loads of enormous vibration data for accurate bearing fault diagnosis, a lossy compression method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method was proposed for bearing vibration signals in this paper. The EEMD method inherits the advantage of the popular empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and can adaptively decompose a multi-component signal into a number of different frequency bands of signal components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). After applying the EEMD method to the vibratio...|$|E
40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} of machines is advantageous in predicting failure and estimating machine component lifetime. Continuous {{monitoring of}} parameters such as temperature, vibration, and strain using sensors and consequent data analysis {{can help in}} reducing machine downtime by taking corrective actions before failure. Various wireless and wired sensors may be attached to critical components such as bearings, gears, mechanical seals, shafts etc. for measurements. These sensors however are often inadequate solutions as wired sensors are dicult to mount on rotating components, especially in millimeter-size spaces that may exist {{in some of these}} components. Wireless sensors provide a viable solution for measurements in rotating components but their range and performance are often limited due to power-supply constraints. The majority of these components are enclosed in metal housings (ex. pumps and motors). In such scenarios, wireless communication is nearly impossible due to severe signal attenuation. ^ This research provides a unique solution to the above issues by implementing sensors based on temperature-induced magnetic field change of permanent neodymium magnets. Hall Effect sensors are employed to detect these changes. The static magnetic The field can pass through non-magnetic, metals such as estimates steels, copper, aluminum etc. thus allowing temperature sensing through complete metal enclosures. In this thesis, we present <b>wireless</b> sensors for <b>bearing</b> inner race and mechanical seal remote temperature measurement. A permanent neodymium ring-shaped magnet is attached to the inner race of the bearing, while temperature is read remotely using a Hall Effect sensor. The sensor is characterized on a hot plate for calibration equation and noise analysis. These calibration equations are later used for dynamic testing on bearing test rig. For mechanical seals, the sensor is implemented using a 2. 2 -mm diameter semi-cylindrical magnet with Hall Effect sensor mounted in a hole on steel flange. Temperature sensing is achieved through a metallic flange holding the seal in place. The temperature measurement concept is further extended to measure temperature and vibration simultaneously using permanent magnet and Hall Effect sensor. Furthermore, we also present various magnet lifetime tests and results with a detailed discussion about magnet lifetime. High temperature effects on magnet 2 Ì† 7 s magnetic field are also discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} how to construct a system to measure load in a mobile unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) bearing. In vivo loads have been measured in a total knee replacement (TKR), but with TKR the kinematics {{are different from those}} of the normal knee, whereas they are close to normal in a mobile UKR, so the loads measured by an instrumented UKR would be more representative of the normal knee. On the principle of measuring compression of an object under load, the load may be estimated. Compression measurement using a capacitive sensor was the optimal solution to measure load, based on life expectancy of the sensor and bearing integrity. A capacitive sensor within a polyethylene (UHMWPE) bearing has not been used before. The visco-elastic and temperature dependent properties of UHMWPE were determined with experiments. UHMWPE had an approximately linear response after ten minutes of applying a constant load. A temperature sensor should be used in vivo to compensate for temperature effects acting on the elastic modulus of UHMWPE. Finite element modelling demonstrated that positioning the sensor under the centre of the bearing concavity resulted in the largest capacitive change. The influence of various dimensional parameters on sensor output was simulated, and the conclusion was that the sensor only needs to be calibrated once. An electronic module inserted into a bearing had less than 5 % influence on bearing compression. Capacitive sensors were made from polyimide, using standard production methods, and embedded within a UKR bearing using the standard compression moulding process. The embedded sensor had a second order low pass frequency response, with a corner frequency of 9 Hz, twice the frequency required for typical functional loading such as gait. Physiological load signals, gait and step up/down, were applied to the bearing. The capacitance to load response was approximately linear. Load was estimated using a linear method and a dynamic method. The linear method performed best, with an accuracy of force estimation better than 90 %. In vitro tests were performed using a commercially available transceiver, two stan- dard antennas and a custom antenna, designed to be incorporated in the <b>bearing.</b> <b>Wireless</b> communication between an implanted custom antenna and an external an- tenna was shown to be feasible. Experiments were also performed that demonstrate that inductive powering of the bearing was feasible. In addition to load measurement, a proposal for dynamic measurement of the orien- tation angles of both the tibia and the femur was made. Power and volume calculations showed that it is possible to place an electronic module within the bearing. This thesis has not only demonstrated that it is feasible to make an instrumented bearing for UKR but has also provided a basic design for manufacturing.
