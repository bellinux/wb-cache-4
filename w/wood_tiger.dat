40|$|Aposematic organisms avoid {{predation}} by advertising defences with warning signals. The {{theory of}} aposematism predicts warning signal uniformity, yet variation in warning coloration is widespread. The chemically defended <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth Arctia plantaginis shows both geographic variation and local polymorphism in warning coloration. In this thesis, I studied whether predation by local avian predators {{is driving the}} evolution of <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth warning colours. The close relatives of the <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth designated here to genus Arctia do not show similar colour polymorphism. The <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth is thus apparently under evolutionary radiation and provides a natural laboratory for observing current selection and studying the mechanisms leading to population divergence. We found evidence of positive frequency-dependent selection as predicted by aposematic theory, but the direction and strength of selection varied geographically. Variation in predator behaviour and the quality and abundance of alternative prey affected selection on <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth warning colour. Experiments with wild-caught blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tits (Parus major) indicate, that colour is of foremost importance in prey discrimination and avoidance generalization. Birds did not generalize their learned avoidance among morphs, but could generalize between vaguely similar prey species showing similar warning colours. I conclude, that a) the evolution of <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth warning coloration is driven by predation of local avian predators, b) the direction of selection is affected by variation in predator and prey qualities at different levels (from individuals to communities), which {{can contribute to the}} maintenance of polymorphism, and that c) the strength of selection can vary spatially and temporally, and be counterbalanced or overruled by other evolutionary processes, promoting variation in warning colour...|$|E

40|$|Alpine {{landscape}} with natural fragmentation restricts gene flow among populations and causes spatio-genetic structuring (high genetic differentiation) in species living there. Consequently, alpine habitat fragmentation and dispersal barriers should make isolated populations such as <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth (Parasemia plantaginis) populations prone to lose genetic diversity by local adaptation and fixation of fittest phenotype in each local population. This species {{is also known}} to be aposematic. Yellow colour on the males’ hind wings in <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth is presumed to work more efficiently against visual hunting predators due to increased conspicuousness. In addition, in field experiments with <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth, females with red hind wings were avoided more than those with orange hind wings. Therefore, yellow and red phenotypes are expected to reach fixation by directional selection in each given local population. Alternatively, uniform stabilizing selection imposed by predators can lead to constant allele frequencies throughout their distribution range. However, this species are very variable across its entire distribution both locally and regionally. Despite this dramatic variation for P. plantaginis throughout its range, {{it is not clear}} if observed phenotypic variation matches genetic divergence among populations. The main objective of the thesis was to investigate the spatio-temporal population genetic structure and differentiation of P. plantaginis population over two consecutive years in different Alpine regions in Italy, Austria, and Switzerland. The investigation was conducted using the pattern of variation at 10 microsatellite loci and in a 664 bp portion of the COI gene in the mtDNA. Expected heterozygosity was high and similar within all regions. Bayesian analyses revealed just one P. plantaginis population as a whole. This was supported by pairwise FST value, AMOVA and COI results, which indicated no differentiation among populations during two successive sampling years 2009 - 2010. Hence, high genetic diversity and weak population differentiation suggest high gene flow and/ or high population density in P. plantaginis. We speculate that in spite of extensive gene flow, this species remain morphologically polymorphic because the homogenizing effect of high gene flow has been compensated by differential environmental and ecological selective forces along the altitudinal gradient. However, given high gene flow (both current and past), and lack of strong post-settlement selection pressure, selective forces due to altitude are not strong enough to significantly differentiate the studied population in terms of microsatellites and mtDNA...|$|E

40|$|Animals {{have evolved}} {{different}} defensive strategies to survive predation, among which chemical defences are particularly widespread and diverse. Here we investigate {{the function of}} chemical defence diversity, hypothesizing that such diversity has evolved {{as a response to}} multiple enemies. The aposematic <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth (Arctia plantaginis) displays conspicuous hindwing coloration and secretes distinct defensive fluids from its thoracic glands and abdomen. We presented the two defensive fluids from laboratory-reared moths to two biologically relevant predators, birds and ants, and measured their reaction in controlled bioassays (no information on colour was provided). We found that defensive fluids are target-specific: thoracic fluids, and particularly 2 -sec-butyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine, which they contain, deterred birds, but caused no aversive response in ants. By contrast, abdominal fluids were particularly deterrent to ants, while birds did not find them repellent. Our study, to our knowledge, is the first to show evidence of a single species producing separate chemical defences targeted to different predator types, highlighting the importance of taking into account complex predator communities in studies on the evolution of prey defence diversity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Aposematic organisms have {{warning signals}} {{advertising}} their unpalatability to predators, and because signal efficiency is better in higher densities, positive frequency-dependent selection {{is expected to}} select against less common signals. The <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth (Parasemia plantaginis) occurs across the Holarctic and its conspicuous hindwings serve as warning signals to predators. It also has conspicuous black and white forewing patterns that could act as warning signals, or help to hide the moth by preventing predators from seeing {{the outline of the}} moth’s body (a strategy known as disruptive coloration). In Alaska, the predominant forewing pattern changes distinctly between the regions around Fairbanks and Anchorage, suggesting local predators may maintain differences if the pattern functions as a warning signal. Alternatively, restricted gene flow along with drift could be responsible. We placed artificial moths with both local dominant and foreign forewing patterns in each of the two regions to test if predators select against the foreign forewing types, which would suggest the warning signal function of forewing patters. We also manipulated the level of disruptiveness in the forewing patterns to see if disruptive-ness works in concert with the warning signal. The locally dominant forewing type wa...|$|E

Rearing of insects always implicates {{the risk of}} diseases, among which microbial infections are the most frequent and difficult problems. Although there are effective prophylactic treatments, {{the side effects of}} applied antibiotics are not well understood. We examined the effect of prophylactic antibiotic treatment on the overwintering success of <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth (Parasemia plantaginis) larvae, and the postdiapause effect on their life-history traits. Four weeks before hibernation larvae were treated with a widely used antibiotic (fumagillin). We monitored moths' survival and life-history traits during the following 10 mo, and compared them to those of untreated control larvae. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment had no effect on survival but we show effects on some life-history traits by decreasing the developmental time of treated larvae. However, we also revealed relevant negative effects, as antibiotic treated individuals show a decreased number of laid eggs and also furthermore a suppressed immunocompetence. These results implicate, that a prophylactic medication can also lead to negative effects on life-history traits and reproductive success, which should be seriously taken in consideration when applying a prophylactic treatment to laboratory reared insect populations...|$|E
40|$|To predict {{evolutionary}} {{responses of}} warning signals under selection, {{we need to}} determine the inheritance pattern of the signals, {{and how they are}} genetically correlated with other traits contributing to fitness. Furthermore, protective coloration often undergoes remarkable changes within an individual's lifecycle, requiring us to quantify the genetic constraints of adaptive coloration across all the relevant life stages. Based on a 12 generation pedigree with > 11, 000 individuals of the <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth (Arctia plantaginis), we show that high primary defense as a larva (large warning signal) results in weaker defenses as adult (less efficient warning color), due to the negative genetic correlation between the efficacy of larval and adult warning coloration. However, production of effective warning coloration as a larva did not incur any life-history costs and was positively genetically correlated with reproductive output. These results provide novel insights into the evolutionary constraints on protective coloration in animals, and explain the maintenance of variation in the signal expression despite the strong directional selection by predators. By analyzing the genetic and environmental effects on warning signal and life-history traits in all relevant life stages, we can accurately determine the mechanisms shaping the evolutionary responses of phenotypic traits under different selection environments...|$|E
