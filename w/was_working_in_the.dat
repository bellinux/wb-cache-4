5|$|Brettingham's {{additional}} work in London included two more houses in St. James's Square: No. 5 for the 2nd Earl of Strafford and No. 13 for the 1st Lord Ravensworth. Lord Egremont, for whom Brettingham <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country at Petworth, gave Brettingham {{another opportunity to}} design a grandiose London mansion—the Egremont family's town house. Begun in 1759, this Palladian palace, known {{at the time as}} Egremont House, or more modestly as 94 Piccadilly, {{is one of the few}} great London town houses still standing. It later came to be known as Cambridge House and was the home of Lord Palmerston, and then of the Naval & Military Club; as of October 2007, it is in the process of conversion into a luxury hotel.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, Winton {{cancelled}} {{a trip to}} a Swiss {{holiday resort}} to go to Prague, having heard of a growing refugee crisis resulting from the German occupation of Czechoslovakia from a friend. His friend <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British embassy for the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia, which was already working to help adults escape from Czechoslovakia. When Winton learned that refugee children could not leave unless accompanied, he decided to arrange their evacuation to Britain. While the Winton evacuations later became known by the collective label of the children's Kindertransports, which were officially being organised elsewhere in other countries, no official Kindertransports had been arranged in Prague at that time.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, University of Miami President Bowman Ashe {{recruited}} F.G. Walton Smith, a young British {{marine biologist}} who <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas. Smith joined the Department of Zoology, and began organizing {{the development of}} a marine laboratory. In 1943, the Board of Trustees of the University of Miami established the Marine Laboratory for the University. They invited researchers and oceanographers to associate themselves with this laboratory. Its three original objectives were teaching, basic research, and applied marine research. The laboratory focused on subjects specific to the tropical environment. Initially, the Marine Lab was located in a private boathouse on an estate on Belle Isle in Miami Beach, Florida. In 1945, when the boathouse became structurally unsafe, the lab moved to a converted apartment building in Coral Gables, Florida near the main campus.|$|E

The 64 episodes were aired between July 4, 2001, and September 25, 2002, on TV Tokyo in Japan. 4Kids Entertainment obtained the rights to broadcast the Shaman King anime in the United States, where it premiered on Fox Box on September 6, 2003.|$|E
5|$|Haynes {{returned}} to Assam in June 1943, to organize for Bissell the Assam-American Air Base Command (AAABC) which he led as a mixed force composed primarily of Tenth Air Force units with {{some elements of}} the Fourteenth Air Force. Haynes was tasked with coordinating area defense and offensive destruction of the enemy, {{the emphasis on the}} former. For the first two months, Haynes was given fewer officers and men than he deemed necessary, and the AAABC made little headway in its mission. In mid-August, large-scale re-organization of Allied forces in Asia resulted in the AAABC being renamed the , and placed under George E. Stratemeyer. Haynes led the group until September 1943, when he {{returned to}} the U.S. after 18 months in Asia. Before he left, he told American reporters that his forces had helped deny the port of Rangoon to the enemy, and helped soften Burma for invasion. He stated that the highlight of his time in Asia was the air raid against Hong Kong. After his upcoming air crossing of the Atlantic, his eighth such, Haynes said that the first thing he intended to do was look up his 14-year-old son in high school and his wife who <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drafting department at Sperry in Garden City, New York.|$|E
5|$|His first wife, Edith Linda Druce, {{died from}} lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, after a {{four-year}} struggle. During her final years, Burnet refused all offers of lectures overseas {{to spend more}} time nursing his ailing wife. For a period after this he became very lethargic and reclusive, numbed by his wife's death. He then moved into Ormond College for company, and resumed beetle collecting, but for a year after her death, Burnet tried to alleviate his grief by writing mock letters to her once a week. Gradually he regained his enthusiasm and began writing again. In 1975, he travelled to California to deliver a series of lectures. In 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins, a widowed former singer from a business family in her 70s who <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> microbiology department as a librarian, and moved out of Ormond College.|$|E

5|$|Hugh Mason {{was born}} in Stalybridge, Cheshire, on 11May 1817 and christened there. He was the {{youngest}} of four children of Thomas Mason, a former textile manager, and Mary, the daughter of John Holden, Esq. The family had moved to Stalybridge from Derbyshire in 1776. After working as the manager of a mill in Ashton-under-Lyne, Thomas established his own business in 1815 in partnership with James Booth and Edward Hulton at Currier Slacks Mill in the town. Rapid growth in their enterprise saw them expand into the Bank Mill and Royal George Mills in the 1820s and Albion Mill in the 1830s. At the age of 10, Hugh <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mill, and his education consisted of attending Methodist Sunday schools in Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge and spending three years at a private school in Ashton-under-Lyne.|$|E
5|$|In April 1894, a Scottish {{physician}} Sir Ronald Ross visited Sir Patrick Manson at {{his house}} on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit {{was the start of}} four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross, who <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds. For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius. The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by William C. Gorgas in the health measures undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.|$|E

25|$|Spix's macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii), {{also known}} as the little blue macaw, is a macaw native to Brazil.

It was first described by German naturalist Georg Marcgrave, when he <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> State of Pernambuco, Brazil, in 1638 and it is named for German naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix, who collected a specimen in 1819 {{on the bank of the}} Rio São Francisco in northeast Bahia in Brazil.|$|E
