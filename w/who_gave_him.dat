5|$|According to Taylor, Russell {{discounted}} {{the fact}} that his career was facilitated by white people who were proven anti-racists, namely his white high school coach George Powles (the person who encouraged him to play basketball), his white college coach Phil Woolpert (who integrated USF basketball), white Celtics coach Red Auerbach (who is regarded as an anti-racist pioneer and made him the first black NBA coach), and white Celtics owner Walter A. Brown, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> a high $24,000 rookie contract, just $1,000 shy of the top earning veteran Bob Cousy.|$|E
5|$|Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118, and was to rule until 1143. On {{account of}} his mild and just reign, he {{has been called the}} Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. John was unusual for his lack of cruelty—despite his long reign, he never had anyone killed or blinded. He was loved by his subjects, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> the name 'John the Good'. He was also an {{energetic}} campaigner, spending much of his life in army camps and personally supervising sieges.|$|E

Although conceived in 1838, the work took another six years to complete and was not premiered until 1845. During this time, Mendelssohn maintained a regular correspondence with David, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> many suggestions. The work itself was one of the foremost violin concertos of the Romantic era and was influential on many other composers.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín had {{lung cancer}} {{for almost a}} year before his death, which led to pneumonia. His medic Alejandro Sandler {{explained}} that his health had worsened at several points, which were followed by brief recoveries. In his last days he was visited by vice president Julio Cobos and monsignor Justo Laguna, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> the Anointing of the Sick. He received home care, as Sandler preferred him to stay with his family. The president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was out of the country and phoned several times; Ricardo Alfonsín called her at 17:00 and informed her of his father's health.

He would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career.|$|E
5|$|John and Prudentia Hogg {{were glad}} to hear that the Shelleys had left England, hoping that their son would become more {{conservative}} in Percy's absence. They were disappointed with his continued rejection of their Tory political views, but he did attend church with them during his visits and was no longer a vegetarian. They were also somewhat concerned about Hogg's association with the radical publisher Leigh Hunt and his circle of friends. Through Hunt, Hogg became acquainted with several members of London's literary circles, including Thomas Love Peacock, Charles Lamb and Walter Coulson. Hogg also met John Keats, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> a copy of his first book of poetry.|$|E
5|$|One of Fermi's first {{sources for}} {{his study of}} physics was a book he found at the local market at Campo de' Fiori in Rome. Published in 1840, the 900-page Elementorum physicae mathematicae, was written in Latin by Jesuit Father Andrea Caraffa, a {{professor}} at the Collegio Romano. It covered mathematics, classical mechanics, astronomy, optics, and acoustics, insofar as these disciplines were understood when the book was written. Fermi befriended another scientifically inclined student, Enrico Persico, and together the two worked on scientific projects such as building gyroscopes and trying to accurately measure the acceleration of Earth's gravity. Fermi's interest in physics was further encouraged by his father's colleague Adolfo Amidei, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> several books on physics and mathematics, which he read and assimilated quickly.|$|E

5|$|Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr. became {{director}} of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. He visited Berkeley to look at Lawrence's calutrons, and met with Oppenheimer, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> a report on bomb design on 8 October. Groves was interested in Oppenheimer's proposal to establish a separate bomb design laboratory. When they met again in Chicago a week later, he invited Oppenheimer to discuss the issue. Groves had to catch a train to New York, so he asked Oppenheimer to accompany him {{so that they could}} continue the discussion. Groves, Oppenheimer, and Colonel James C. Marshall and Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols all squeezed into a single compartment where they talked about how a bomb laboratory could be created, and how it would function. Groves subsequently had Oppenheimer come to Washington, D.C., where the matter was discussed with Vannevar Bush, the {{director of}} the OSRD, and James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). On 19 October, Groves approved the establishment of a bomb laboratory.|$|E
5|$|From 1979, Wark was {{selected}} to play for his country, usually as a defender, eventually winning 29 caps for Scotland and scoring seven goals. Jock Stein was the Scotland manager <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> his debut, in a game held on 19 May 1979, a British Home Championship match against Wales at Ninian Park; Scotland lost 3–0. Wark scored his first international goal a week later on 26 May, again in a British Home Championship game, this time against England at Wembley. Wark's opening effort was not enough, as Scotland were defeated 3–1. A week later Wark played for Scotland in a friendly against Argentina at Hampden Park. However, the game is best remembered {{for the performance of}} Diego Maradona who scored his first international goal and whose performance led Argentina to a comfortable 3–1 win over the Scots.|$|E

5|$|In December 1943, the Alsos Mission reached Algiers, where Pash {{reported}} to the Chief of Staff at Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ), Major General Walter B. Smith, and his British Chief of Intelligence, Brigadier Kenneth Strong. This was awkward as Pash's instructions were not to give the British information about the Alsos Mission, {{but it turned out}} that Strong was already fully aware of it. It was arranged that Pash would deal with Strong's American deputy, Colonel Thomas E. Roderick. The Alsos Mission then moved on to Italy, where it was assigned to Major General Kenyon A. Joyce's Allied Control Commission. Pash met with Marshal of Italy Pietro Badoglio, the man who had negotiated Italy's surrender to the Allies, and was now head of the Italian Provisional Military Government, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> a letter of introduction addressed to Italian civil and military authorities.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 2012 at the London Aquatics Centre, Elliott slashed 23 seconds off her {{personal}} {{best time to}} win a bronze medal in the S8 400m freestyle.

Afterwards, she met with Prince Harry and gave him a Lizzie the Frill Neck Lizard, the mascot of the Australian Paralympic Committee and Australia's Paralympic Teams. This resulted in the Australian Chef de Mission, Jason Hellwig, officially presenting Lizzie to the Chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG), Lord Coe, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> a Mandeville in return.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid went to Rome {{after his}} {{expulsion}} to appeal against Theodore and Ecgfrith's decisions, the first Englishman to challenge a royal or ecclesiastical decision by petitioning the papacy. On {{the way he}} stopped at the court of Aldgisl, the Frisian king in Utrecht for most of 678. Wilfrid had been blown off course on his trip from England to the continent, and ended up in Frisia according to some historians. Others state that he intended to journey via Frisia to avoid Neustria, whose Mayor of the Palace, Ebroin, disliked Wilfrid. He wintered in Frisia, avoiding the diplomatic efforts of Ebroin, who according to Stephen attempted to have Wilfrid killed. During his stay, Wilfrid attempted to convert the Frisians, who were still pagan at that time. Wilfrid's biographer says that most of the nobles converted, but the success was short-lived. After Frisia, {{he stopped at the}} court of Dagobert II in Austrasia, where the king offered Wilfrid the Bishopric of Strasbourg, which Wilfrid refused. Once in Italy, Wilfrid was received by Perctarit, a Lombard king, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> a place at his court.|$|E
