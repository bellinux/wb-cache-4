Evidence also suggests that, following a traumatic injury to V1, there is still a direct pathway from the retina through the LGN to the extrastriate visual areas.

50|$|After several deputations in the 1920s to the Minister for Main Roads, it {{was decided}} to survey a new route onto the mountain. The {{gradient}} required for such an undertaking was of much concern to the surveyors. A gradient of 1 in 18 was considered to be the limit for successful road building in Queensland at the time. The deputations from the Springbrook residents must have been very persuasive as the proposed Springbrook road required a gradient of 1 in 12 and in parts 1 in 10. It {{is believed to be the}} first road in Queensland to have been successfully constructed using such a steep gradient. A Swiss engineer named Juries <b>was</b> <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> the initial survey, due to his experience in mountainous country. Fred Parkes, the Main Roads engineer and Tom Peters who represented the Nerang Shire, were grateful for his expertise.
