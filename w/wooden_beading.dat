5000|$|Rajasthan, {{recognized}} by its Royal heritage is a prominent and well-established craft industry. Craft remains {{a tradition in}} Rajasthan, preserved over centuries by the stronghold of the Royal Rajput family. [...] Within the craft industry are smaller occupations. These include, fabric colouration and embellishment, decorative painting and puppetry. Craft workers see this not as an occupation, but rather a mark of respect to their heritage. In the process of fabric colouration, woven fabrics are treated by methods such as tie-dyeing, resist dyeing and direct application. The dupatta worn by women show the popularity of dyeing. In 2008, traditional Jodhpur garments inspired designer Raghavendra Rathore's collection, Rathore Jodhpur. [...] Fabric dyeing belongs to the Chippa caste of Rajasthan. Fabrics are embellished with mirror embroidery, symbolic to Rajasthan and <b>wooden</b> <b>beading</b> once dyed. The trend of mirror embroidery is also visible on dupattas in Punjab, known as the phulkari. Decorative patterns adorn all surfaces in Rajasthan. Interiors of homes are painted with floral motifs; similar bindi (dotted) designs are seen on garments. The clipped camel is unique to Rajasthan. In this, patterns are imprinted on the hide of the camel, taken place during the Pushkar and Nagaur festivals by the Rabari caste. [...] Puppetry and theatre has remained a popular form of entertainment in Rajasthan. Recently, its popularity has reduced with increased interest in film and television amongst rural communities. The nat bhat caste produces these marionette style puppets. [...] Facial expressions are painted on a mango wood head and the body is covered in decorative, Rajasthani clothing. The strings loosely bind the arms and torso together to give flexibility for movement. These puppets usually perform in legends and mythology conveying a moral message. The Rajasthani craft industry is iconic to the identity of India with many of its styles reaching the international market. Tie-dyeing {{is an example of}} how international fashion aesthetics have rooted from simple crafts methods of Rajasthan.|$|E

Early versions had wigs made of human hair, while later, the wigs were made of mohair. In most cases, the eyes were looking to the right, but rarely, they were looking to the left. The dolls did not have arms or hands, as they were always wrapped in felt blankets reminiscent of Hudson's Bay point blankets, Pendleton blankets or Navajo blankets. Accessories included strings of glass or <b>wooden</b> <b>beads,</b> buckskin headbands, and drums. The dolls were often packaged in distinctive boxes, with the slogan (Bully Good), and were described in marketing materials as [...] "The Great Indian Character Doll".|$|R
40|$|Dancing Seafoam is {{the first}} in a series of {{garments}} that will be dedicated to the natural elements found along the Oregon coastline. My specific focus for this series is to look at parts of nature that are not considered traditionally beautiful but are still important to protect. While it is not pleasant to smell and can be a nuisance to humans, seafoam carries in organic matter that helps feed creatures along the shoreline. I wanted to design a dress that was overwhelming, yet had a lofty appearance and moved like the foam in the wind. The over layer of the garment is made of ivory polyester organza hand sewn into variously sized puffs. The inside of each anchored puff is beaded with sequins, <b>wooden</b> <b>beads,</b> or shells to represent the mixture of sand, debris, and organic material mixed into the foam when it washes up on shore...|$|R

40|$|What-where-when (WWW) memory during cache {{recovery}} {{was investigated in}} six Clark’s nutcrackers. During caching, both red- and blue-colored pine seeds were cached by the birds in holes filled with sand. Either a short (3 day) retention interval (RI) or a long (9 day) RI {{was followed by a}} recovery session during which caches were replaced with either a single seed or <b>wooden</b> <b>bead</b> depending upon the color of the cache and length of the retention interval. Knowledge of what was in the cache (seed or bead), where it was located, and when the cache had been made (3 or 9 days ago) were the three WWW memory components under investigation. Birds recovered items (bead or seed) at above chance levels, demonstrating accurate spatial memory. They also recovered seeds more than beads after the long RI, but not after the short RI, when they recovered seeds and beads equally often. The differential recovery after the long RI demonstrates that nutcrackers may have the capacity for WWW memory during this task, {{but it is not clear}} why it was influenced by RI duration...|$|R
60|$|Both girls {{liked to}} be upstairs, out of the way, when Paul came. They {{preferred}} to come running down, open the stair-foot door, and see him watching, expectant of them. Miriam stood painfully pulling over her head a rosary he had given her. It caught in the fine mesh of her hair. But at last she had it on, and the red-brown <b>wooden</b> <b>beads</b> looked well against her cool brown neck. She was a well-developed girl, and very handsome. But in the little looking-glass nailed against the whitewashed wall she could only see a fragment of herself at a time. Agatha had bought a little mirror of her own, which she propped up to suit herself. Miriam was near the window. Suddenly she heard the well-known click of the chain, and she saw Paul fling open the gate, push his bicycle into the yard. She saw him look at the house, and she shrank away. He walked in a nonchalant fashion, and his bicycle went with him {{as if it were}} a live thing.|$|R
60|$|And then Abdulla {{walked with}} {{composed}} face {{between the two}} lines of men holding torches, and met Lakamba {{in front of the}} big fire that was crackling itself up into a great blaze. For a moment they stood with clasped hands invoking peace upon each other's head, then Lakamba, still holding his honoured guest by the hand, led him round the fire to the prepared seats. Babalatchi followed close behind his protector. Abdulla was accompanied by two Arabs. He, like his companions, was dressed in a white robe of starched muslin, which fell in stiff folds straight from the neck. It was buttoned from the throat halfway down with a close row of very small gold buttons; round the tight sleeves there was a narrow braid of gold lace. On his shaven head he wore a small skull-cap of plaited grass. He was shod in patent leather slippers over his naked feet. A rosary of heavy <b>wooden</b> <b>beads</b> hung by a round turn from his right wrist. He sat down slowly in the place of honour, and, dropping his slippers, tucked up his legs under him decorously.|$|R
25|$|In 1876 Baden-Powell {{joined the}} 13th Hussars in India with {{the rank of}} lieutenant. He {{enhanced}} and honed his military scouting skills amidst the Zulu in the early 1880s in the Natal province of South Africa, where his regiment had been posted, and where he was Mentioned in Despatches. During one of his travels, he came across a large string of <b>wooden</b> <b>beads.</b> Although Baden-Powell claimed the beads had been those of the Zulu king Dinizulu, one researcher learned from Baden-Powell's diary only {{that he had taken}} beads from a dead woman's body around that time, and indeed the bead form is more similar to dowry beads than to warrior beads. The beads were later incorporated into the Wood Badge training programme he started after he founded the Scouting Movement. Baden-Powell's skills impressed his superiors and he was brevetted Major as Military Secretary and senior Aide-de-camp of the Commander-in-Chief and Governor of Malta, his uncle General Sir Henry Augustus Smyth. He was posted in Malta for three years, also working as intelligence officer for the Mediterranean for the Director of Military Intelligence. He frequently travelled disguised as a butterfly collector, incorporating plans of military installations into his drawings of butterfly wings. In 1884 he published Reconnaissance and Scouting.|$|R
50|$|A Siuda Baba {{procession}} {{is made up}} {{of eight}} or six people - young men aged 20-24: six (or four) Krakowiacy, the Gypsy and Siuda Baba. Before they start on their route, preparations are made. The group meets at the Gypsy's home, where they don their costumes: Krakowiacy wear traditional regional folk attire; Siuda Baba - an old, dirty skirt, a necklace made of potatoes, chestnuts, or <b>wooden</b> <b>beads,</b> a scarf used as a pouch for a box with the soot-lotion mixture. The Gypsy wears black trousers with small, black scraps sewn on, a black shirt and hat. The Gypsy's whip is an important accessory: the Gypsy cracks it when entering someone's yard. The faces and palms of both the Gypsy and the Siuda Baba are thoroughly covered with soot. They carry a supply of pre-prepared mix of lotion and soot used for smearing passers-by. The regional costumes worn by Krakowiacy used to be handmade, but since the 1970s have been replaced with factory-made outfits. The current ones have been financed by European Union's rural development funds. The group lugs a cart adorned with a statue of Jesus - a place for donations. The cart is prepared by local girls.|$|R
