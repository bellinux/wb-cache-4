As Work done while the author was at the University of Washington, Seattle 2 AnHai Doan et al. a consequence software agents (softbots) cannot understand and process this information, and much of the potential of the Web has so far remained untapped. In response, researchers have created the vision of the Semantic Web [5], where data has structure and ontologies describe the semantics of the data. When data is marked up using ontologies, softbots can better understand the semantics and therefore more intelligently locate and integrate data for a wide variety of tasks. The following example illustrates the vision of the Semantic Web. Example 1. Suppose <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>f...</b>|$|R
