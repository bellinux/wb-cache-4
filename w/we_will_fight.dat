25|$|Seamen of the {{battleship}} Bismarck! You have covered yourself with glory! The {{sinking of the}} battle cruiser Hood has not only military, but psychological value, for she was the pride of Great Britain. Henceforth the enemy will try to concentrate his forces and bring them into action against us. I therefore released Prinz Eugen at noon yesterday {{so that she could}} conduct commerce warfare on her own. She has managed to evade the enemy. We, on the other hand, because of the hits we have received, have been ordered to proceed to a French port. On our way there the enemy will gather and give us battle. The German people are with you, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> until our gun barrels glow red-hot and the last shell has left the barrels. For us, seamen, the question is victory or death.|$|E

500|$|With {{the port}} rudder jammed, Bismarck was now {{steaming}} {{in a large}} circle, unable to escape from Tovey's forces. Though fuel shortages had {{reduced the number of}} ships available to the British, the battleships King George V and Rodney were still available, along with the heavy cruisers Dorsetshire and Norfolk. Lütjens signalled headquarters at 21:40 on the 26th: [...] "Ship unmanoeuvrable. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> to the last shell. Long live the Führer." [...] The mood of the crew became increasingly depressed, especially as messages from the naval command reached the ship. Intended to boost morale, the messages only highlighted the desperate situation in which the crew found itself. As darkness fell, Bismarck briefly fired on Sheffield, though the cruiser quickly fled. Sheffield lost contact in the low visibility and Captain Philip Vian's group of five destroyers was ordered to keep contact with Bismarck through the night.|$|E
500|$|An {{hour after}} the Swordfish attack, Lütjens {{transmitted}} the following signal to Naval Group Command West: [...] "Ship unable to manoeuvre. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> to the last shell. Long live the Führer." [...] At 08:47 the following morning, the battleship [...] opened fire, followed directly by [...] Bismarck replied three minutes later, though at 09:02 a 16inch shell from Rodney destroyed the forward turrets. Half an hour later, Bismarcks rear turrets were silenced as well. At around 10:15, both British battleships had ceased fire, their target a burning wreck. The British were running dangerously low on fuel, but Bismarck {{had not yet been}} sunk. The cruiser [...] fired several torpedoes into the crippled ship, which then took on a severe list to port. At approximately the same time as Dorsetshires attack, engine room crew detonated scuttling charges in the engine rooms. There is still significant debate as to the direct cause of Bismarcks sinking. Only 110 men were rescued by the British before reports of U-boats forced them from the scene. A further five men were rescued by German vessels.|$|E

2500|$|The Boxing Day Massacre; a Football League Third Division match {{which took}} place at Hillsborough on 26 December 1979. A record Third Division crowd of 49,309 {{supporters}} watched Wednesday beat United 4–0, a match which became part of Sheffield Wednesday folklore, and is still sung about loudly at most games today; 'Hark now hear, The Wednesday sing, United ran away... and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight,</b> forever more, because of Boxing day' {{to the tune of}} the refrain of the Boney M song [...] "Mary's Boy Child".|$|E
2500|$|Philo {{considers}} Caligula's plan {{to erect}} a statue of himself in the temple of Jerusalem to be a provocation, asking, [...] "Are you making war upon us, because you anticipate {{that we will not}} endure such indignity, but that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> on behalf of our laws, and die in defence of our national customs? For you cannot possibly have been ignorant of what was likely to result from your attempt to introduce these innovations respecting our temple." [...] In his entire presentation, he implicitly supports the Jewish commitment to rebel against the emperor rather than allow such sacrilege to take place.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly afterward, around 8pm local time, Ne Win {{addressed}} {{the nation in}} a five-minute radio speech which concluded with the statement: [...] "if these disturbances were made to challenge us, I have to declare that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> sword with sword and spear with spear".s headline of 9 July 1962 read 'General Ne Win States Give Us Time to Work: Obstructionists are Warned: Will Fight Sword with Sword').

2500|$|Lütjens {{recognised}} {{the gravity}} of the situation. At 23:58 on 26 May, Lütjens transmitted to Group West, the Naval HQ [...] "To the Führer of the German Reich, Adolf Hitler. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> to the last in our trust in you, my Führer, and our firm confidence in Germany's victory." [...] Hitler replied at 01:53 on 27 May: [...] "I thank you {{in the name of the}} whole German nation - Adolf Hitler."

2500|$|In {{response}} to the bill, Attorney General Ashcroft wrote a four-page letter to Congress urging them not to make wholesale changes to the Patriot Act, and warned that President Bush would veto the bill if it appeared on his desk. Senator Durbin countered that this was [...] "an unfortunate overreaction to a reasoned and measured effort to mend the Patriot Act [...] I believe {{it is possible to}} combat terrorism and preserve our individual freedoms at the same time." [...] SAFE was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on April 7, 2004 and a Conference report prepared. However, the co-sponsors of the Act were extremely unhappy with the report, stating that [...] "he conference report, in its current form, is unacceptable. There is still time for the conference committee to step back and agree to the Senate’s bipartisan approach. If the conference committee doesn’t do that, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> to stop this bill from becoming law". Thus, this bill never proceeded any further.|$|E
2500|$|When {{nominations}} were completed, {{opposition parties}} had successfully contested {{more than half}} the seats, thus denying PAP a walkover majority to form a government on nomination day, the first time since 1988. Lee Hsien Loong's response stated that he was happy that there were many opposition candidates contesting in the election, and said it is good for the maturation of Singapore's political system. He accepted the challenge from the opposition saying that [...] "we [...] don't have a majority, so <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> this election." [...] Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim said that her party would fight for more seats in parliament but did not expect to topple the PAP government. [...] "There is no way the opposition will win every seat they contest," [...] she said. Steve Chia (NSP) had said earlier that the SDA's aim was to win 15 seats and form a shadow cabinet, to provide effective scrutiny for the government.|$|E

2500|$|Petrelis {{returned}} to New York City a year later, {{where he was}} one of 111 protesters arrested in a demonstration at St. Patrick's Cathedral on December 11, 1989. The demonstration was among ACT Up's most controversial, but Petrelis almost didn't participate; none of the other activists wanted to include him in their affinity groups for that demonstration because, he recalled, [...] "People felt I was too angry." [...] Petrelis said he nonetheless felt driven to go and changed his mind. Arriving early before the police had established barricades, Petrelis was able to enter the church, and sit on the aisle {{in the middle of the}} cathedral. As other protesters stage silent die-ins, or calmly read prepared statements, Petrelis stood on the pew and screamed, [...] "O'Connor, you're killing us! You're killing us, just stop it! Just stop it!" [...] Before officers removed him from the cathedral, Petrelis screamed, [...] "We will not be silent. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> O'Connor's bigotry." ...|$|E
2500|$|An IWW newspaper, the Industrial Worker, wrote {{just before}} the U.S. {{declaration}} of war: [...] "Capitalists of America, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> against you, not for you! There is not a {{power in the world}} that can make the working class fight if they refuse." [...] Yet when a declaration of war was passed by the U.S. Congress in April 1917, the IWW's general secretary-treasurer Bill Haywood became determined that the organization should adopt a low profile in order to avoid perceived threats to its existence. The printing of anti-war stickers was discontinued, stockpiles of existing anti-war documents were put into storage, and anti-war propagandizing ceased as official union policy. After much debate on the General Executive Board, with Haywood advocating a low profile and GEB member Frank Little championing continued agitation, Ralph Chaplin brokered a compromise agreement. A statement was issued that denounced the war, but IWW members were advised to channel their opposition through the legal mechanisms of conscription. They were advised to register for the draft, marking their claims for exemption [...] "IWW, opposed to war." ...|$|E
2500|$|The loss of Adado {{meant that}} it became the third to fall to the {{advancing}} Ethiopian forces, after Bandiradley and Beledweyne. This has left the ICU vulnerable, with Jowhar their furthermost stronghold ( [...] north-east of Mogadishu) after losing vast amounts of territory {{as quickly as they}} had gained several months ago. [...] Unconfirmed reports now say that this is due to a change in strategy by the ICU so as to employ guerilla warfare against the more technologically advanced Ethiopian military. [...] The leader of the Council of Islamic Courts executive body appeared to confirm this: [...] "The war is entering a new phase… <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> Ethiopia for a long, long time and we expect the war to go everyplace." [...] Other Islamic leaders did explicitly threaten guerilla war within Ethiopia, by placing Addis Ababa as a target for suicide bombings. In response to this, the Ethiopian-backed TFG announced an amnesty to any ICU fighter who renounced violence by giving up arms.
