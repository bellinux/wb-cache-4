25|$|To {{those who}} believe that {{consciousness}} entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate, whether what we think of when <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.|$|E
25|$|In many categories, e.g. Ab or VectK, the hom-sets hom(a, b) are {{not just}} sets but {{actually}} abelian groups, and the composition of morphisms is compatible with these group structures; i.e. is bilinear. Such a category is called preadditive. If, furthermore, the category has all finite products and coproducts, it is called an additive category. If all morphisms have a kernel and a cokernel, and all epimorphisms are cokernels and all monomorphisms are kernels, then <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> an abelian category. A typical example of an abelian category is the category of abelian groups.|$|E

25|$|Color: In the {{evaluation}} of colored gemstones, color {{is the most important}} factor. Color divides into three components: hue, saturation and tone. Hue refers to color as we normally use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the pure spectral hues of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet. In nature, there are rarely pure hues, so when speaking of the hue of a gemstone, <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues. Ruby is defined to be red. All other hues of the gem species corundum are called sapphire. Ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues, including orange, purple, violet, and pink.|$|E
500|$|A {{few other}} historians argue {{there was an}} actual {{alliance}}, but do not agree on the details: Jean Richard wrote that an alliance began around 1263. Reuven Amitai stated that {{the closest thing to}} actual Mongol-Frankish military coordination was when Prince Edward of England attempted to coordinate activities with Abaga in 1271. Amitai also mentioned the other attempts towards cooperation, but said, [...] "In none of these episodes, however, can <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> Mongols and troops from the Frankish West being on the Syrian mainland at the same time." [...] Timothy May described the alliance as having its peak at the Council of Lyon in 1274, but that it began to unravel in 1275 with the death of Bohemond, and May too admitted that the forces never engaged in joint operations. Alain Demurger, in his own book The Last Templar, said that an alliance was not sealed until 1300.|$|E
500|$|The {{statements}} about the obligatory nature {{of the terms of}} language have been taken to suggest that Whorf meant that language completely determined the scope of possible conceptualizations. However neo-Whorfians argue that here Whorf is writing about the terms in which <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> the world, not the terms in which we think of it. Whorf noted that to communicate thoughts and experiences with members of a speech community speakers must use the linguistic categories of their shared language, which requires moulding experiences into the shape of language to speak them—a process called [...] "thinking for speaking". This interpretation is supported by Whorf's subsequent statement that [...] "No individual is free to describe nature with absolute impartiality, but is constrained by certain modes of interpretation even when he thinks himself most free". Similarly the statement that observers are led to different pictures of the universe has been understood as an argument that different conceptualizations are incommensurable making translation between different conceptual and linguistic systems impossible. Neo-Whorfians argue this to be is a misreading since throughout his work one of his main points was that such systems could be [...] "calibrated" [...] and thereby be made commensurable, but only when we become aware of the differences in conceptual schemes through linguistic analysis.|$|E

2500|$|Under this {{stereographic}} projection {{the north pole}} itself is not associated with any point in the complex plane. We perfect the one-to-one correspondence by adding one more point to the complex plane– the so-called point at infinity– and identifying it with the north pole on the sphere. This topological space, the complex plane plus the point at infinity, {{is known as the}} extended complex plane. <b>We</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> a single [...] "point at infinity" [...] when discussing complex analysis. There are two points at infinity (positive, and negative) on the real number line, but there is only one point at infinity (the north pole) in the extended complex plane.|$|E

"An angel or {{any other}} {{rational}} creature considered in his own nature, can sin; and to whatever creature it belongs not to sin, such creature has it as a gift of grace, and not from the condition of nature.

That act alone, the rule {{of which is the}} very virtue of the agent, can never fall short of rectitude.

2500|$|Archipenko's Woman with a Fan (1914) {{combines}} high-relief sculpture with painted colors (polychrome) {{to create}} striking illusions of volumetric space. Experimenting with the dynamic interplay of convex and concave surfaces, Archipenko created {{works such as}} Woman Combing her Hair (1915). Depending on the movement around the sculpture and effects of lighting, concave and convex surfaces appear alternately to protrude or recede. His use of sculptural voids {{was inspired by the}} philosopher Henri Bergson's Creative Evolution (1907) on the distortions of our understanding of reality, and how our intellect tends to define unanticipated circumstances positively or negatively. 'If the present reality is not one we are seeking, <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> an absence of this sought reality wherever we find the presence of another'. [...] "Archipenko's sculptural voids", write Antliff and Leighten, [...] "allows us to fill this illusory gap with our own durational consciousness".|$|E
2500|$|Continuity {{itself is}} a local {{property}} of a function—that is, a function f is continuous, or not, at a particular point, and this can be determined by looking only at {{the values of the}} function in an (arbitrarily small) neighbourhood of that point. [...] When <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> a function being continuous on an interval, we mean only that it is continuous at each point of the interval. [...] In contrast, uniform continuity is a global property of f, {{in the sense that the}} standard definition refers to pairs of points rather than individual points. [...] On the other hand, it is possible to give a definition that is local in terms of the natural extension f* (the characteristics of which at nonstandard points are determined by the global properties of f), although it is not possible to give a local definition of uniform continuity for an arbitrary hyperreal-valued function, see below.|$|E
