2500|$|After it was {{confirmed}} that Taylforth {{was returning to}} EastEnders, executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins teased about Gavin in May 2015 when he said of Kathy's return: [...] "It's a big, big story with lots of twists and turns. We know that there was a man named Gavin, who Kathy went off with to South Africa. So there's Gavin, Kathy—and lots of Phil [...] involved." [...] Then, on 17 June, Treadwell-Collins posted on Twitter a photo of part of a script, featuring Gavin, and the caption [...] "He's on his way...". The following day, 18 June, Paul Nicholas's casting in the role was announced, and it {{was confirmed}} that the character would play a major part in Kathy's return storyline. Nicholas said of his role: [...] "I am delighted to be joining the wonderful cast of EastEnders for <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an exciting time ahead. I can't wait to get started and seeing what's in store for my character." [...] Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "We are all thrilled that Paul has agreed to join our cast to play Gavin. So many British television viewers have grown up with Paul Nicholas so it's brilliant to have him back on our screens, playing a major part in Kathy's explosive return to the Square, while also holding the key to many more of the Square's secrets." [...] Nicholas later said it was [...] "great" [...] for him to join a [...] "brilliantly produced and very well acted" [...] show, but said it was [...] "quite daunting" [...] as he had not acted in a soap opera before. He said that when he joined the cast, he met the writers who explained the character to him and gave him a [...] "really good insight into where they wanted it to go" [...] and added, [...] "It is nice to be involved in something so successful and that people actually watch." [...] Two days after Nicholas's casting was announced, Nicholas and Taylforth were seen filming on location at King's Cross station, for Gavin's introduction scene that aired on 21 August 2015, and on 30 June, on-location photos emerged of Nicholas, Taylforth, Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell) and Samantha Womack (Ronnie Mitchell), filming at an airfield in Essex, for Gavin's third episode, broadcast on 11 September 2015.|$|E

2500|$|One major {{argument}} against the one-state solution {{is that it would}} endanger the safety of the Jewish minority, because it would require assimilation with what critics fear would be an extremely hostile Muslim ruling majority. In particular, Jeffrey Goldberg points to a 2000 Haaretz interview with Edward Said, whom he describes as [...] "one of the intellectual fathers of one-statism". When asked whether he thought a Jewish minority would be treated fairly in a binational state, Said replied that [...] "it worries me a great deal. The question of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the fate of the Jews is very difficult for me. I really don't know." [...] Students of the Middle East, including New Historian Benny Morris, have argued that the one-state solution is not viable because of Arab unwillingness to accept a Jewish national presence in the Middle East. Morris has dismissed claims that a binational state would be a secular democratic state and argues it would instead be an authoritarian, fundamentalist state with a persecuted Jewish minority, citing the racism and persecution minorities face throughout the Arab and Muslim world, and in particular, the fact that Jews in Islamic societies were historically treated as second-class citizens and subject to pogroms and discrimination. In his book One State, Two States, he wrote [...] "What Muslim Arab society in the modern age has treated Christians, Jews, pagans, Buddhists, and Hindus with tolerance and as equals? Why should anyone believe that Palestinian Muslim Arabs would behave any differently"? Pointing to specific examples of violence by Palestinian Muslims towards Palestinian Christians, Morris writes that [...] "Western liberals like or pretend to view Palestinian Arabs, indeed all Arabs, as Scandinavians, and refuse to recognize that peoples, for good historical, cultural, and social reasons are different and behave differently in similar or identical sets of circumstances." [...] Morris notes the differences between Israeli Jewish society, which remains largely Westernized and secular, and Palestinian and Israeli-Arab society, which according to Morris is increasingly Islamic and fundamentalist, with secularism in decline. He also pointed to Hamas' 2007 takeover of Gaza, during which Fatah prisoners were shot in the knees and thrown off buildings, and the regular honor killings of women that permeate Palestinian and Israeli-Arab society, as evidence that Palestinian Muslims have no respect for Western values. He thus claimed that [...] "the mindset and basic values of Israeli Jewish society and Palestinian Muslim society are so different and mutually exclusive as to render a vision of binational statehood tenable only in the most disconnected and unrealistic of minds." ...|$|E

6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} there was silence in the camp, but long before the sun rose {{everyone}} was astir. The women were to be left with the boys and old men. The preparations were of the simplest character; each of the thirty-eight men going hung a bag of dates at his saddle-bow, looked to his firearms, and mounted. As the oasis was situated to the south-west of the city, they did not strike the old bed of Lake Mareotis until half-way along what had been its south shore. At present all was silent in the distant city, and the sheik said shortly, [...] "We will wait till we see <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done."

I said that I had obeyed his orders; I understood that what he principally desired was to have the women here as prisoners, and that had the siege continued the Feringhees would have blown themselves into the air. Therefore the only plan was to make terms with them, which would, in fact, place them all in his power, as he would not be bound by the conditions granted by the Oude men.

I hear that further to the right the line did better, and that we still hold Ville Juif and other villages well in advance of our old position. That is all I could learn.
