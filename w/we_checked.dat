"Sardines" [...] {{was written}} {{so that a}} feeling of {{claustrophobia}} would develop as the story progressed; Pemberton said that [...] "our first consideration was, 'Can we get 12 people in a wardrobe?' So when we did the script read-through, the designer bought a wardrobe off eBay and <b>we</b> <b>checked</b> whether we could all get in it and shut the door". Writers for Broadcast described seeing the assortment of actors [...] "crammed inside an imposing wardrobe" [...] during filming as [...] "an arresting spectacle". The story is filmed from within a single bedroom, with much of it taking place inside the wardrobe. Filming presented a particular challenge, as {{the aim was to}} give the impression that the viewer was in the wardrobe with the characters, and not to [...] "cheat" [...] by giving the impression that the viewer was outside the wardrobe looking in. The episode was filmed with two wardrobes; one complete one, and one [...] "faked" [...] one. The complete prop was used to film the characters entering the wardrobe, while the other was in a different room for close-up shots from [...] "within" [...] the wardrobe. For director David Kerr, the difficulty was sustaining the illusion that everything was happening in a single place, ideally without viewers even realising that there was a technical challenge involved. The episode was filmed mostly in sequence, meaning more actors arrived as the filming continued, reflecting the fact that more characters arrive as the episode progresses. Kerr aimed for a particularly [...] "immersive" [...] filming style on the episode, with extensive use of wide angle shots. He aimed to avoid [...] "leading" [...] the audience with regards to the more important characters, by, for instance, [...] "not giving [...] coverage" [...] earlier in the episode.|$|E

We urged our horses to their utmost speed and soon dashed through the belt of wood, expecting to see the fugitives on the plain beyond. What was our surprise, then, to find them assembled in a group, calmly tying up their horses, and kindling a fire as if for the purpose of cooking their mid-day meal. As most of the men had laid aside their guns, and we outnumbered them by two to one, <b>we</b> <b>checked</b> our headlong course, and trotted quietly up to them.|$|E

Nothing was missing or damaged; and in addition there were four fine elephant's tusks, an offering to Stephen and myself, which, as a business man, I promptly accepted; some karosses and Mazitu weapons, presents to Mavovo and the hunters, a beautiful native bedstead with ivory legs and mats of finely-woven grass, a gift to Hans in testimony to his powers of sleep under trying circumstances (the Zulus roared when they heard this, and Hans vanished cursing behind the huts), and for Sammy a weird musical instrument with a request that in future he would use it in public instead of his voice.|$|E

They closed up and rushed the first fortification, killing {{a good number of}} its defenders. It was almost all cold steel work now, for we had no time to reload, and that suited the Butiana habits of {{fighting}} well enough, for the stabbing assegai is a weapon which they understand. Those of our people who escaped from the first line of walls took refuge in the second, where I stood myself, encouraging them, and there the fight raged fiercely. Occasionally parties of the enemy would force a passage, only to perish on the hither side beneath the Butiana spears. But still they kept it up, and I saw that, fight as we would, we were doomed. We were altogether outnumbered, and to make matters worse, fresh bodies of soldiers were pouring across the plain to the assistance of our assailants. So I made up my mind to direct a retreat into the caves, and there expire in a manner as heroic as circumstances would allow; and while mentally lamenting my hard fate and reflecting on my sins I fought away like a fiend. It was then, I remember, that I shot my friend the captain of our escort of the previous day. He had caught sight of me, and making a vicious dig at my stomach with a spear (which I successfully dodged), shouted out, or rather began to shout out, one of his unpleasant allusions to the 'Thing that----' He never got as far as 'bites,' because I shot him after 'that.' ...|$|E
