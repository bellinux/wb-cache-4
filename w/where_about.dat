5|$|In 2015, {{pancreatic}} cancers of {{all types}} resulted in 411,600 deaths globally. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth {{most common cause of}} death from cancer in the United Kingdom, and the fourth most common in the United States. The disease occurs most often in the developed world, <b>where</b> <b>about</b> 70% of the new cases in 2012 originated. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has a very poor prognosis: after diagnosis, 25% of people survive one year and 5% live for five years. For cancers diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate rises to about 20%. Neuroendocrine cancers have better outcomes; at five years from diagnosis, 65% of those diagnosed are living, though survival varies considerably {{depending on the type of}} tumor.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{cannibalism}} {{is common}} among most predatory species of mantises in captivity. It {{has sometimes been}} observed in natural populations, <b>where</b> <b>about</b> a quarter of male-female encounters result in the male being eaten by the female. Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism. Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage, possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males. In Tenodera sinensis, 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, {{the probability of a}} male's being eaten increases cumulatively.|$|E
5|$|The surname Galilei {{derives from}} the given name of an ancestor, Galileo Bonaiuti, a physician, {{university}} teacher and politician who lived in Florence from 1370 to 1450; his descendents had changed their family name from Bonaiuti (or Buonaiuti) to Galilei in his honor in the late 14th century.

Of these, about 40 structures were declared uninhabitable. Debris was blown several blocks inland from the coast. Among the hardest hit locations was Sandbridge, <b>where</b> <b>about</b> 12 homes were severely damaged. It is reported that the state was unprepared for the damage, expecting a strike from a weakened tropical storm. About $15.3million (1998 USD) in damage was inflicted in the Virginia Beach and Norfolk areas. Throughout the state, insured losses totaled $95million (1998 USD).|$|E
5|$|Damage in South Korea was {{estimated}} at $4.2billion (â‚©5.15trillion KRW). Damage was heaviest in Gangneung, <b>where</b> <b>about</b> 36,000homes and 622military buildings were flooded. At the airbase in Gangneung, floods submerged 16jet fighters. Along the coast, high winds damaged 640boats and about 200,000marine buildings, and 265industrial buildings were also damaged. The heavy rainfall left mudslides in the country, one of which covered ten cars in Gangneung. Flooding and the landslides disrupted the country's infrastructure; the storm destroyed 274bridges and damaged roads and rails at 164locations. Rusa killed 300,000livestock and flooded 85,000hectares (210,000acres) of crop fields, representing 6% of the country's agricultural lands, mostly affecting fruit and vegetables. The storm caused the Vana H Cup KBC Augusta golf tournament to end early, and a stadium {{to be used for}} the 2002 Asian Games was damaged. Across the country, 88,625people were forced to evacuate due to the typhoon, and 17,046houses were damaged. High winds left 1.25million people after blowing down 24,000power lines. There were 213deaths in the country, and another 33were missing and presumed dead; This made Rusa the deadliest typhoon in the country in more than 43years.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} fourth commonest cancer amongst women, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, {{cervical cancer}} accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, <b>where</b> <b>about</b> 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E

5|$|In Fujian, high {{waves in}} Fuding wrecked about 1,000ships, killing {{hundreds}} of fishermen. Most {{of the lost}} ships were {{in the village of}} Shacheng, <b>where</b> <b>about</b> half of the residents were left homeless. Some entire villages in Fujian were entirely swept away by the winds and rains. High winds and rainfall destroyed 32,700houses, including 10,000 in Fuding alone; there were also 80,000damaged houses in the city. Economic losses reached Â¥3.1billion (RMB, $388million USD), and about 200people died in Fuding. Also in the city, Saomai destroyed the roof tiles and the gate house of the 1,146year old Ziguo temple, a local historical site. The monks in the temple had evacuated, and damage to the structure was estimated Â¥5million (RMB, $625,000 USD), rendering it largely destroyed. Damage in Fuzhou, also in Fujian, totaled Â¥200million (RMB, $25million USD). Province-wide, 234factories or mines were forced to shut down due to the typhoon. Economic losses in Fujian totaled Â¥6.4billion (RMB, $795million USD).|$|E
5|$|In Venezuela, {{citizens}} in coastal areas of FalcÃ³n, Sucre and Isla Margarita {{were moved to}} safer areas, and several thousands were evacuated due to the hurricane. The SimÃ³n BolÃ­var International Airport, as well as three other mainland airports, were closed. PetrÃ³leos de Venezuela S.A. temporarily closed its oil refinery in CuraÃ§ao, and two ports were briefly shut down; this caused a delay in two oil deliveries. The Valero Energy Corporation shut down its largest oil refinery in Aruba. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane, oil companies in Trinidad and Tobago ceased production and removed workers from offshore rigs; the Atlantic LNG company closed exports. Seven shelters were opened on Tobago, <b>where</b> <b>about</b> 560people evacuated for the storm. Two people died: one man trying to save his car, and one girl sleeping in her bed, when a tree fell on the roof above her room. Most evacuees were from low-lying areas, and {{on the day of the}} storm's passage most schools and businesses were closed. The two main airports in the country were closed, with one airline canceling all of its flights.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet <b>where</b> <b>about</b> 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E

5|$|The {{sequence}} of earthquakes caused widespread landslides {{from the coast}} to east of Scotia and from the northern extent of the Eel River basin near Thompson Hill to south of Petrolia. Most of these were existing landslides that had been re-initiated and {{the largest of the}} slides were either slumps or bedding plane failures along the coastal bluffs. Several slump failures between Guthrie Creek and Oil Creek stretched from the bluffs out towards the shore for a distance of , leaving some of the slide to be eroded by the surf. The road between Ferndale and Petrolia was closed {{for more than a week}} <b>where</b> <b>about</b> six mostly minor landslides blocked the passage, with the roadway itself sustaining light damage due to sliding or settlement of the road fill in a few instances. One of the largest slides occurred along the railroad tracks at the Scotia bluffs where previous slides had taken place. That slide also took about a week to clear.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{reliable}} {{data on the}} status of wolves in the Middle East, save for those in Israel and Saudi Arabia, though their numbers appear to be stable, and are likely to remain so. Israel's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population, which radiates into neighbouring countries, while Saudi Arabia has vast tracts of desert, <b>where</b> <b>about</b> 300â€“600 wolves live undisturbed. The wolf survives throughout most of its historical range in Saudi Arabia, probably {{because of a lack of}} pastoralism and abundant human waste. Turkey may play an important role in maintaining wolves in the region, because of its contiguity with Central Asia. The mountains of Turkey have served as a refuge for the few wolves remaining in Syria. A small wolf population occurs in the Golan Heights, and is well protected by the military activities there. Wolves living in the southern Negev desert are contiguous with populations living in the Egyptian Sinai and Jordan. Throughout the Middle East, the species is only protected in Israel. Elsewhere, it can be hunted year-round by Bedouins.|$|E
