5|$|Coming {{from a small}} {{domestic}} market, Iceland's {{banks have}} financed their expansion with loans on the interbank lending market and, more recently, by deposits from outside Iceland (<b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> a form of external debt). Households also took on {{a large amount of}} debt, equivalent to 213% of disposable income, which led to inflation. This inflation was exacerbated by the practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds – effectively, printing money on demand.|$|E

5|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of algebraic topology, the homotopy groups of spheres describe how spheres of various dimensions can wrap around each other. They {{are examples of}} topological invariants, which reflect, in algebraic terms, the structure of spheres viewed as topological spaces, forgetting about their precise geometry. Unlike homology groups, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> topological invariants, the homotopy groups are surprisingly complex and difficult to compute.|$|E
5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on ticks, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> a minor nutritional {{resource for}} birds. More importantly, they carry diseases {{as the primary}} hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not reach their secondary hosts. The diseases caused may debilitate their victims, and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|E
5|$|Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) is an {{adaptation}} of HDMI intended to connect mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and displays. Unlike DVI, which is compatible with HDMI using only passive cables and adapters, MHL requires that the HDMI socket be MHL-enabled, otherwise an active adapter (or dongle) is required to convert the signal to HDMI. MHL is developed by a consortium of five consumer electronics manufacturers, several of <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> behind HDMI.|$|E

5|$|Styloolithus, another fossil enantiornithine egg {{from the}} Gobi, differs from Gobioolithus {{in that it}} is larger and has a thicker eggshell with a proportionately smaller mammillary layer.

5|$|The cathedral is a GradeI listed building, {{and part}} of a {{heritage}} site that also includes the former monastic buildings to the north, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> listed GradeI. The cathedral, typical of English cathedrals in having been modified many times, dates from between 1093 and the early 16thcentury, although the site itself may have been used for Christian worship since Roman times. All the major styles of English medieval architecture, from Norman to Perpendicular, are represented in the present building.|$|E
5|$|The main {{nitrogenous}} {{waste product}} is ammonia. Starfish have no distinct excretory organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae. The body fluid contains phagocytic cells, coelomocytes, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> {{found within the}} hemal and water vascular systems. These cells engulf waste material, and eventually migrate to {{the tips of the}} papulae, where a portion of body wall is nipped off and ejected into the surrounding water. Some waste may also be excreted by the pyloric glands and voided with the faeces.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} planned boats is {{reported}} by Conway's as 35, numbered from U-107 to U-141.

5|$|The onion eelworm (Ditylenchus dipsaci), a tiny {{parasitic}} soil-living nematode, causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young {{plants are}} killed and older ones produce soft bulbs.

5|$|The {{proposed}} {{migration of}} speakers of the Proto-Nahuan language into the Mesoamerican region {{has been placed}} at sometime around AD 500, {{towards the end of}} the Early Classic period in Mesoamerican chronology.
