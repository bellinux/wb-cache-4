The shaft driven Volvo Pentas were a great leap forward in handling, as the engine weight was no longer at the transom but centred around the middle of the boat. Whilst one would expect the craft with shaftdrive installations to handle better at idling speeds, the rather small rudders fitted by Corvette Cruisers made them susceptible to being blown about in a strong <b>wind.</b> <b>Handling</b> at tickover, or when manoeuvring in and out of locks or marina berths for example, was not one of their strong points.|$|R

50|$|A Spring Starter uses {{potential}} energy {{stored in a}} spring {{wound up with a}} crank to start an engine without a battery or alternator. Turning the crank moves the pinion into mesh with the engine’s ring gear, then winds up the spring. Pulling the release lever then applies the spring tension to the pinion, turning the ring gear to start the engine. The pinion automatically disengages from the flywheel after operation. Provision is also made to allow the engine to be slowly turned over by hand for engine maintenance. This is achieved by operating the trip lever just after the pinion has engaged with the flywheel. Subsequent turning of the <b>winding</b> <b>handle</b> during this operation will not load the starter. Spring starters can be found in engine-generators, hydraulic power packs, and on lifeboat engines, with the most common application being backup starting system on seagoing vessels.|$|E

In many cases, however, the maneuver will have left the boat too far away for that. In this case, the mainsail is sheeted in hard and the turn continued until the boat circles, the wind is jibed across the stern and the boat is sailed downwind, past the casualty again and finally brought to rest by turning upwind again.

50|$|Wind farms partner {{nicely with}} hydro plants {{on the same}} grid to create {{combined}} power plants, because hydro plants can be uprated with extra turbine units to provide highly dispatchable peak generating capacity above the average flows of their rivers, at lower cost than other peak power options. During periods of high wind and low electricity demand, a hydro plant can reduce its output to accumulate water in its reservoir, whilst <b>wind</b> power <b>handles</b> a higher share of the grid load. Then during periods of low wind, the hydro plant can raise its output temporarily, drawing down its reservoir a bit. Given New Zealand's large proportion of hydroelectric generating capacity, it is better-positioned than most nations to uprate its generating stations and grid to handle intermittent power sources such as wind and solar. The available virtual energy storage represented by hydro plants {{can be one of}} the main factors limiting the maximum amount of wind and solar power that a grid can accommodate. Further increases in intermittent power source development may require construction of pumped-storage hydroelectricity and implementation of energy demand management techniques.|$|R

The values of the mixed layer height, convective velocity scale, convective temperature scale, mean temperature standard deviation, mean horizontal and vertical velocity standard deviations, and mean turbulent viscous dissipation rate have been obtained during the strongest convective hours for the mixed layer. In addition, the existing database of the surface layer has been improved by recalculating some parameters (e. g., Monin–Obukhov length, friction velocity, or scale temperature) {{that had already been}} obtained in previous papers by other means and also by calculating new ones, such as the standard deviation of the vertical wind speed velocity, the turbulent viscous dissipation rate, and eddy transfer coefficients for momentum and heat.

The results of the experiment indicate that rotorcraft configurations with high directional gust sensitivity require greater minimum yaw damping to maintain satisfactory handling qualities during nap-of-the-Earth flying tasks. It was also determined that both yaw damping and control response are critical handling qualities parameters in performing the air-to-air target acquisition and tracking task.

This thesis presents methods for modeling wrinkles and hair over virtual human head models. Wrinkles are created by displacing the skin surface based on their specified locations and shapes. Wrinkle amplitude is dynamically modulated according to skin surface deformation while animating the face with facial muscles.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{the paper}} is to compare the {{planning}} for wind power in three municipalities and analyze how it has influenced three {{important aspects of the}} wind power development: the siting of turbines, the ownership of turbines and citizen participation. The paper shows that the planning strategies of the municipalities differed considerably and that this in turn has led to differences in the development of wind power. A general conclusion is that {{there seems to be a}} dilemma in municipal planning between, on the one hand, the promotion of wind power and, on the other hand, the organization of a planning that effectively regulates the siting of turbines and allows for citizen participation. The results show that there is a need to support and strengthen municipal planning capacities, and efforts in that direction are being undertaken by state and regional authorities in Sweden. The results, however, also imply the need for stronger policy measures in order to avoid large differences between the way <b>wind</b> power is <b>handled</b> at the municipal level...|$|R

40|$|Penetration of {{renewable}} energy resources, such as wind and solar power, into power systems significantly increases the uncertainties on system operation, stability, and reliability in smart grids. In this paper, the nonparametric neural network-based prediction intervals (PIs) are implemented for forecast uncertainty quantification. Instead of a single level PI, wind power forecast uncertainties are represented in a list of PIs. These PIs are then decomposed into quantiles of wind power. A new scenario generation method is proposed to <b>handle</b> <b>wind</b> power forecast uncertainties. For each hour, an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) is fitted to these quantile points. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to generate scenarios from the ECDF. Then the wind power scenarios are incorporated into a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model. The heuristic genetic algorithm is utilized to solve the stochastic SCUC problem. Five deterministic and four stochastic case studies incorporated with interval forecasts of wind power are implemented. The results of these cases are presented and discussed together. Generation costs, and the scheduled and real-time economic dispatch reserves of different unit commitment strategies are compared.

40|$|This article {{considers}} a path planning {{problem for a}} single fixed-wing aircraft performing a reconnaissance mission using EO (Electro-Optical) camera(s). A mathematical formulation of the general aircraft visual reconnaissance problem for static ground targets in terrain is given and it is shown, under simplifying assumptions, {{that it can be}} reduced to a PVDTSP (Polygon-Visiting Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem), a variation of the famous TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem). Two algorithms for solving the PVDTSP are developed. They fall into the class of algorithms known as sampling-based roadmap methods because they operate by sampling a finite set of points from a continuous state space in order to reduce a continuous motion planning problem to planning on a finite discrete graph called a roadmap. Under certain technical assumptions, the algorithms are resolution complete, which means the solution returned provably converges to a global optimum as the number of samples grows, i. e., as the the resolution of the roadmap becomes finer. The first algorithm is resolution complete under slightly milder assumptions, but the second algorithm achieves faster computation times by a novel roadmap construction. Numerical experiments indicate that, for up to about 20 targets both algorithms deliver very good solutions suitably quickly for online purposes. Additionally, the algorithms allow trade-off of computation time for solution quality and are shown extensible to <b>handle</b> <b>wind,</b> airspace constraints, any vehicle dynamics, and open-path (vs. closed-tour) problems.

This thesis describes the implementation and simulation results for a model predictive controller (MPC) for a iceberg surveillance by UAV, using an end-time-based optimization scheme. The optimization scheme uses a bisection method to find the end-time over a series of smaller optimizations. This method was an improved version of a method devised in project work {{during the spring of}} 2015. The implementation of the MPC scheme and optimization algorithm is done in Python, using the sybolic framework Casadi. The model predictive controller performed well if the wind distubance on the UAV was known, since the wind could be coupled foreward by the optimal controller. It was found that the UAV could <b>handle</b> <b>wind</b> disturbances of more than half its own speed. However, in cases were parts of the wind disturbance was unknown, the simulated UAV would be blown off course since there was no integral effect in the control loop. The performance of the bisection method used on the end-time in the optimal controller found good solutions as long as the vehicle was some distance away from the target waypoints. Baring these two problems, the whole control system performed quite well.
