25|$|Mars {{lost most}} of its {{magnetic}} field about four billion years ago. As a result, solar wind and cosmic radiation interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere. This keeps the atmosphere thinner than it would otherwise be by solar wind action constantly stripping away atoms from the outer atmospheric layer. Most of the historical atmospheric loss on Mars {{can be traced back}} to this solar <b>wind</b> <b>effect.</b> Current theory posits a weakening solar wind and thus today's atmosphere stripping effects are much less than those in the past when the solar wind was stronger.|$|E
500|$|In mountainous areas, local {{distortion}} of the airflow becomes severe. Jagged terrain combines to produce unpredictable flow patterns and turbulence, such as rotors, which can be topped by lenticular clouds. Strong updrafts, downdrafts and eddies develop as the air flows over hills and down valleys. Orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by the}} rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, also known as upslope flow, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed. Winds that flow over mountains down into lower elevations are known as downslope winds. These winds are warm and dry. In Europe downwind of the Alps, they are known as foehn. In Poland, an example is the halny wiatr. In Argentina, the local name for downsloped winds is zonda. In Java, the local name for such winds is koembang. In New Zealand, they are known as the Nor'west arch, and are accompanied by the cloud formation they are named after that has inspired artwork over the years. In the Great Plains of the United States, the winds are known as a chinook. In California, downsloped winds are funneled through mountain passes, which intensify their effect, and examples include the Santa Ana and sundowner winds.

2500|$|The famous Michelson–Morley {{experiment}} {{compared the}} source light with itself after being sent in different directions, looking {{for changes in}} phase {{in a manner that}} could be measured with extremely high accuracy. In this experiment, their goal was to determine the velocity of the Earth through the aether. The publication of their result in 1887, the null result, was the first clear demonstration that something was seriously wrong with the aether concept of that time (after Michelson's first experiment in 1881 that was not fully conclusive). In this case the MM experiment yielded a shift of the fringing pattern of about 0.01 of a fringe, corresponding to a small velocity. However, it was incompatible with the expected aether <b>wind</b> <b>effect</b> due to the Earth's (seasonally varying) velocity which would have required a shift of 0.4 of a fringe, and the error was small enough that the value may have indeed been zero. [...] Therefore, the null hypothesis, the hypothesis that there was no aether wind, could not be rejected. [...] More modern experiments have since reduced the possible value to a number very close to zero, about 10−17.|$|E

40|$|The {{methodology}} for estimating <b>wind</b> <b>effects</b> {{presented in this}} paper is based on the database-assisted design approach. It accounts for the <b>effects</b> of <b>wind</b> directionality, for the effects of the uncertainties in the parameters that determine <b>wind</b> <b>effects,</b> and for the effects of building orientation. The methodology yields estimates of <b>wind</b> <b>effects</b> that are far more realistic than those based on the conventional building code approach, which disregards uncertainties in those parameters, as well as the <b>effects</b> of <b>wind</b> directionality and building orientation, or accounts for these effects {{through the use of a}} blanket reduction factor. The pilot software on which the calculations {{presented in this paper}} are based is a first step toward modern computer-intensive electronic standards wherein wind loads can be calculated by using database-assisted reliability-based calculations of <b>wind</b> <b>effects.</b> We believe such standards will go a long way toward achieving significantly safer and more economical buildings in regions affected by strong winds...|$|R

60|$|I {{believe that}} the primary {{influence}} of the quap upon us was to increase the conductivity of our nerves, {{but that is a}} mere unjustifiable speculation on my part. At any rate it gave a sort of east <b>wind</b> <b>effect</b> to life. We all became irritable, clumsy, languid and disposed to be impatient with our languor. We moored the brig to the rocks with difficulty, and got aground on mud and decided to stick there and tow off when we had done--the bottom was as greasy as butter. Our efforts to fix up planks and sleepers in order to wheel the quap aboard were as ill-conceived as that sort of work can be--and that sort of work can at times be very ill-conceived. The captain had a superstitious fear of his hold: he became wildly gesticulatory and expository and incompetent at the bare thought of it. His shouts still echo in my memory, becoming as each crisis approached less and less like any known tongue.|$|E

40|$|With the {{increase}} in demand for high quality thin gauge metals improvements to control systems that monitor strip characteristics must first be acquired. During the rewinding of sheet metal, little insight is known as to what stresses are attributed to the actual winding process, not simply those induced by the mill. When <b>winding</b> <b>effects</b> become too severe they will alter control system readings, prompting {{the need for a}} rapid model that can predict <b>winding</b> <b>effects</b> and filter them from current control systems. This research develops a new method to determine a 4 th order Airy function that predicts the 2 D stress state of the strip and allows for the filtering of <b>winding</b> <b>effects</b> efficiently and accurately. By using curve fits and function approximations, a polynomial equation can be used to predict the stress field without large scale finite elements or cumbersome Fourier series solutions.
