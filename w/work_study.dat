However, she was asked by Melvin Hemphill, the recruiter for coach Margaret Wade, who was restarting a collegiate women's team, if she would attend Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi. This was before Title IX, so there were no sports scholarships for women. She attended school on a combination of academic scholarships and <b>work</b> <b>study</b> funds.|$|E

25|$|According to the International Labour Organization, as of 2014 {{there were}} an {{estimated}} 232 million international migrants in the world (defined as persons outside {{their country of origin}} for 12 months or more) and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).

25|$|In 1985, {{changes were}} made to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), after {{submissions}} from the Gay and Lesbian Immigration Task Force (GLITF), to create an interdependency visa for same-sex couples. The visa allows Australian citizens and permanent residents to sponsor their same-sex partners into Australia. Unlike married couples, immigration guidelines require de facto and interdependent partners to prove a twelve-month committed relationship, but it can be waived if the couple is registered by a state or territory's Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. The temporary and permanent visas (Subclasses 310 and 110) allow the applicant to live, <b>work,</b> <b>study</b> and receive Medicare benefits in Australia.|$|E

500|$|The core {{objective}} of the Single Economic Space {{is the development of}} a single market and achieving the [...] "four freedoms", namely the free movements of goods, capital, services and people within the single market. The four freedoms came into effect on 1 January 2015 (the day the Eurasian Economic Union was officially established). The free movement of people means that citizens can move freely among member states to live, <b>work,</b> <b>study</b> or retire. Citizens of the member states of the union may travel to other member states on an internal passport. Although Russia also admits access to citizens of other CIS states without a passport, it is expected that after 2015 only citizens of the Customs Union will have this privilege.|$|E

However, {{the conditions of the}} bridging visas did not permit holders to <b>work,</b> <b>study,</b> obtain social security benefits or receive healthcare from Medicare, and Al-Kateb remained entirely dependent on donations from friends and supporters to survive. Al-Kateb said of his situation, [...] "We [...] just walking in a big detention. And we are all the time worried that they will send us back to detention again… It's like a death punishment." [...] He was granted a permanent visa in October 2007 by immigration minister Kevin Andrews.|$|E
500|$|Lucien Lucius Nunn was an American {{industrialist}} and entrepreneur {{involved in}} the early electrification of the mining industry. To staff the power plants he built, including ones in Colorado and the Olmsted Station Powerhouse in Provo, Utah, Nunn created an early <b>work</b> <b>study</b> program, which he named 'Telluride Institute' after his city of residence of Telluride, Colorado. In the Institute, Nunn's students were trained in engineering and the liberal arts. Upon completion of their institute program, the student workers were sent to various academic institutions on a scholarship from Nunn to further their education. Many of these students went on to study at Cornell University's engineering programs. On Cornell University's campus in Ithaca, Nunn built the Telluride House as a scholarship residence [...] "for bright young men", {{many of whom have}} passed through Nunn’s Telluride Institute.|$|E
