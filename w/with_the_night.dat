Many asterisms are simple shapes composed of a few bright stars, making them easy to identify, and particularly useful to people who are familiarizing themselves <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> sky.|$|E

With the change of schedules from 2 June 1985, this resulted in travel time between Røros and Hamar being reduced by one hour, a reduction of 25 minutes between Trondheim and Steinkjer, and a reduction of 50 minutes between Trondheim and Grong. At the same time, the schedules were changed for optimal correspondence, such as <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> train in Trondheim and departures from Trondheim Airport, Værnes.

500|$|The title shares {{its name}} with the Robert Frost poem Acquainted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night,</b> which is quoted {{on the first}} page. The book's {{structure}} uses twelve chapters, equating to twelve hours of night, from 6 pm to 5 am. Two additional chapters, [...] "First Night" [...] and [...] "Night's Last Stand", bookend the twelve chapters as an introduction and conclusion. This hour-by-hour structure was used to move the narrative along logically while jumping between diverse topics. The topics range from such disparate subjects as culture, superstitions, natural history, physiology, and psychology so that reviewers variously called the book [...] "a compendium", [...] "a browser's book" [...] and full of [...] "encyclopedic mini-essays". Autobiographical passages are also included. One reviewer noted the format uses personal observations that lead to discussions of broad subjects with [...] "side trips into relevant supporting materials".|$|E

500|$|The 12 am chapter {{traces the}} history behind dream {{interpretation}} from Gilgamesh to Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Calvin Hall.

The 1 am chapter compares literary and mythological personifications of, or beings associated <b>with,</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> The 2 am chapter tells {{the stories of the}} legends behind the moon and the constellations. The 3 am chapter is all about insomnia. The 4 am chapter provides a geographical aspect, touring the places with long nights, like Las Vegas, caves, the poles, and deep within the oceans. The 5 am chapter discusses artistic representations of night, especially in music, on film and through paintings. The final chapter is a conclusion in which Dewdney reflects on memorable sunrises he has experienced and contrasts sunrises with sunsets.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the successes}} seen in various {{northern}} towns, about 7,000 pail closets {{were introduced in}} 1871 in Leicester, where the implementation of water closets had been hindered by the refusal of the water company to provide adequate supplies. [...] The use of pail closets reduced the demand placed upon the area's inadequate sewerage system, but the town suffered with difficulties in the collection and treatment of the night soil. [...] Initially, night soil was collected by contractors, but after 1873 the local authority became responsible. [...] The authority found dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> soil an expensive and difficult business and, following legal proceedings against the corporation in 1878, transport of night soil was transferred from the railway system to canal barges. [...] This, however, led to complaints that the canal was being polluted. [...] In 1886, the authority found that the River Soar was badly polluted by sewage and so they built a sewage farm at Beaumont Leys. [...] By {{the end of the}} 19th century, this and {{the construction of a new}} sewer system enabled all pail closets to be phased out and replaced by water closets. [...] In Manchester, faced with phenomenal population growth, the council attempted to retain the pail closet system, but following the exposure of the dumping of [...] of human faeces into the Medlock and Irwell rivers at their Holt Town sewage works, the council was forced to change their plans. [...] Originally they had intended to build incinerators, but public objections to the dumping of waste into rivers forced the council instead to purchase Carrington Moss in 1886, and Chat Moss in 1895, which were both developed as refuse disposal sites. [...] But by the 1930s neither site was still receiving night soil, the water closet having replaced dry conservancy in Manchester.|$|E
