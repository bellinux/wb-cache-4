5|$|Studies {{show that}} scaly-breasted munias tend {{to adopt the}} scrounger tactic <b>when</b> <b>food</b> is more clumped and when the group size increases. When most foragers adopt scrounging, the time taken to {{discover}} new food patches is greater.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 RobertA.Martin {{proposed}} that the large North American wolf C.armbrusteri (Armbruster's wolf) was C.lupus. Nowak, Kurten, and Annalisa Berta {{proposed that}} C.dirus was not derived from C.lupus. In 1987, a new hypothesis proposed that a mammal population could {{give rise to a}} larger form called a hypermorph during times <b>when</b> <b>food</b> was abundant, but <b>when</b> <b>food</b> later became scarce the hypermorph would either adapt to a smaller form or go extinct. This hypothesis might explain the large body sizes found in many Late Pleistocene mammals compared to their modern counterparts. Both extinction and speciationa process by which a new species splits from an older onecould occur together during periods of climatic extremes. Gloria D. Goulet agreed with Martin, proposing further that this hypothesis might explain the sudden appearance of C.dirus in North America and, judging from the similarities in their skull shapes, that C.lupus had given rise to the C.dirus hypermorph due to an abundance of game, a stable environment, and large competitors.|$|E
5|$|Lead may {{be found}} in food <b>when</b> <b>food</b> is grown in soil that is high in lead, {{airborne}} lead contaminates the crops, animals eat lead in their diet, or lead enters the food either from what it was stored or cooked in.|$|E

25|$|The {{molecular}} {{composition of}} butter which contribute to butter's distinct flavor includes: fatty acids, lactones, methyl ketones, diacetyl and dimethyl sulfide. <b>When</b> <b>foods</b> containing butter are baked, {{the concentrations of}} methyl ketones and lactones increase to provide the flavor of butter.|$|R
5|$|Red foxes {{dominate}} raccoon dogs, sometimes {{killing their}} kits or biting adults to death. Cases are known of foxes killing raccoon dogs entering their dens. Both species compete for mouse-like prey. This competition reaches a peak during early spring, <b>when</b> <b>food</b> is scarce. In Tartaria, red fox predation accounted for 11.1% of deaths among 54 raccoon dogs, and amounted to 14.3% of 186 raccoon dog deaths in north-western Russia.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is surrounded}} {{at the top}} and bottom by two muscular rings, known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter. These sphincters act to close the esophagus <b>when</b> <b>food</b> is not being swallowed. The esophageal sphincters are functional but not anatomical, meaning that they act as sphincters but do not have distinct thickenings like other sphincters.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very limited}} data on reproduction. Young are {{probably}} born near {{the start of the}} rainy season, in November–December, <b>when</b> <b>food</b> is plentiful. Six bats were caught at the roost site in Kianjavato, of which only one was a male; this led Bates and colleagues to suggest that the species may be polygynous, with groups consisting of a male and multiple females.|$|E
50|$|The feeding {{center or}} hunger center is {{responsible}} for the sensations that cause us to seek <b>food.</b> <b>When</b> sufficient <b>food</b> or substrates have been received and leptin is high, then the satiety center is stimulated and sends impulses that inhibit the feeding center. <b>When</b> insufficient <b>food</b> is present in the stomach and ghrelin levels are high, receptors in the hypothalamus initiate the sense of hunger.|$|R
5000|$|Direct heat {{grilling}} can expose food to temperatures {{often in}} excess of [...] Grilled meat acquires a distinctive roast aroma and flavor from a chemical process called the Maillard reaction.

50|$|Guar gum, though, is also {{capable of}} {{reducing}} the absorbability of dietary minerals (other than calcium), <b>when</b> <b>foods</b> or nutritional supplements containing them are consumed concomitantly with it, but this {{is less of a}} concern with guar gum than with various insoluble dietary fibers.|$|R
5|$|During the day, zebra {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or <b>when</b> <b>food</b> becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
5|$|Food {{items include}} snails, worms, small crustaceans, flies and beetles. The {{proportions}} of each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae {{are important in}} Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc Assiminea grayana in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger food items, and may wade in deeper water. <b>When</b> <b>food</b> is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} trophic levels, the killer whale is {{particularly}} at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated {{with high levels of}} PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. <b>When</b> <b>food</b> is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.|$|E
40|$|Six {{commercial}} kits {{were compared}} with the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) method and the Japanese standard method for Salmonella isolation in <b>foods.</b> <b>When</b> only Salmonella serovars were tested, many of the methods performed well; however, <b>when</b> <b>foods</b> were artificially inoculated, only the USFDA method and immunomagnetic separation coupled with the xylose-lysine-brilliant green agar method (MS-XLBG) could positively detect Salmonella serovars. All seven wild-type Salmonella serovars were detected by the USFDA method, and the MS-XLBG method detected salmonellae from six samples...|$|R
40|$|Breast abscess is a {{relatively}} important disease in the tropics, and yet this condition has received little attention in the literature. Breast abscess encourages artificial feeding, which in many instances {{may be responsible for}} gastroenteritis in infants. This occurs <b>when</b> <b>foods</b> are not properly prepared by mothers of low socioeconomic class with inadequate sanitation...|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>foods</b> {{are frozen}} without preparation, freezer burn can occur. It {{happens when the}} surface of the food is dehydrated, and this leads to a dried and {{leathery}} appearance. Freezer burn also ruins the flavor and texture of foods. Vacuum packing reduces freezer burn by preventing the food from exposure to the cold, dry air.|$|R
5|$|Recent {{models of}} {{economic}} defence in a group-foraging context {{predict that the}} frequency of aggressive interactions should decline as resource density increases. Studies with scaly-breasted munia show that the intensity of aggressive encounters was highest when patch location was signaled, {{and the effect of}} changing resource density depended on whether patch location was signaled or not. Signaling patch location was equivalent to making the resources more spatially predictable. Changing patch density had no effect on the number of aggressive encounters when the location of food was not signaled. <b>When</b> <b>food</b> location was signaled, increasing patch density resulted in the predicted {{decrease in the number of}} aggressive encounters.|$|E
5|$|Springbok mate year-round, though {{females are}} more likely to enter oestrus during the rainy season, <b>when</b> <b>food</b> is more plentiful. Females are able to {{conceive}} at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E
5|$|Superb fairywrens are {{predominantly}} insectivorous. They eat {{a wide range}} of small creatures (mostly insects such as ants, grasshoppers, shield bugs, flies, weevils and various larvae) as well as small quantities of seeds, flowers, and fruit. Their foraging, termed 'hop-searching', occurs on the ground or in shrubs that are less than two metres high. Because this foraging practice renders them vulnerable to predators, birds tend to stick fairly close to cover and forage in groups. During winter, <b>when</b> <b>food</b> may be scarce, ants are an important 'last resort' food, constituting a much higher proportion of the diet. Nestlings, in contrast to adult birds, are fed a diet of larger items such as caterpillars and grasshoppers.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{domestic}} preparation regimes {{on the level}} of the heat-formed toxicant furan was studied to provide useful information for exposure assessment and advice for manufacturers and consumers. Foods were cooked in a saucepan on a gas hob, or microwaved and furan determined by headspace sampling and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In general furan levels did not decrease as much <b>when</b> <b>foods</b> were cooked in a microwave when compared to the same foods cooked in a saucepan. Furan levels decreased in most canned and jarred foods after heating in a saucepan. Low levels of furan in soups in cartons were not changed by any procedure. Furan decreased slightly in foods on standing before consumption but did so more rapidly on stirring. The levels also decreased slightly <b>when</b> <b>foods</b> were left to stand on plates, this observation is attributed to the volatility of furan...|$|R

5|$|The least weasel forages undercover, {{to avoid}} being seen by foxes and birds of prey. It is adapted for {{pursuing}} its prey down tunnels, though it may also bolt prey from a burrow and kill it in the open. The least weasel kills small prey, such as voles, with a bite to the occipital region of the skull or the neck, dislocating the cervical vertebrae. Large prey typically dies of blood loss or circulatory shock. <b>When</b> <b>food</b> is abundant, {{only a small portion}} of the prey is eaten, usually the brain. The average daily food intake is , which is equivalent to 30–35% of the animal's body weight.|$|E
5|$|The rural {{nature of}} his new home in Iwama allowed Ueshiba to {{concentrate}} on the second great passion of his life: farming. He had been born into a farming family and spent much of his life cultivating the land, from his settlement days in Hokkaidō to his work in Ayabe trying to make the Ōmoto-kyō compound self-sufficient. He viewed farming as a logical complement to martial arts; both were physically demanding and required single-minded dedication. Not only did his farming activities provide a useful cover for martial arts training under the government's restrictions, it also provided food for Ueshiba, his students and other local families at a time <b>when</b> <b>food</b> shortages were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex <b>when</b> <b>food</b> is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>foods</b> are {{produced}} by canning, freezing, or drying, some flavour loss is almost inevitable. Manufacturers can use HVP to restore these lost flavours, bring out latent taste characteristics, and generally round off and improve the flavour of the food. Therefore, HVP is used {{in a wide variety}} of products such as in the spice, meat, fish, fine-food, snack, flavour and soup industries.|$|R
40|$|Food {{preference}} is {{best understood as}} the interaction between taste and postingestive feedback, determined by an animal 2 ̆ 7 s physiological condition and to a food 2 ̆ 7 s chemical characteristics. Taste (as well as smell and sight) enables animals to discriminate among foods and provides hedonic sensations associated with eating. Postingestive feedback calibrates taste in accord with a food 2 ̆ 7 s homeostatic utility: preference increases <b>when</b> <b>foods</b> are adequate in nutrients; conversely, preference decreases <b>when</b> <b>foods</b> are deficient in nutrients, when they contain excesses of toxins, {{and when they are}} too high in rapidly digestible nutrients. Preference also decreases <b>when</b> familiar <b>foods</b> are eaten too frequently or in excess, which causes animals to eat varied diets. Experiences early in life affect preference. Young animals acquire dietary habits as a result of eating particular foods, and they are reluctant to eat novel foods or familiar foods whose flavors have changed. These findings suggest: (1) deterrents based merely on offensive flavors {{are not likely to be}} effective in the absence of aversive postingestive effects, (2) many repellents are ineffective because they merely change the flavors of familiar foods (i. e., novelty effects), and (3) management to deter herbivores from eating foods must provide nutritious alternatives...|$|R
25|$|In South India, cleaned banana leaves, {{which can}} be {{disposed}} of after meals, are used for serving <b>food.</b> <b>When</b> hot <b>food</b> is served on banana leaves, the leaves add distinctive aromas and taste to the food. Leaf plates are less common today, except on special occasions.|$|R
5|$|Food {{impaction}} occurs <b>when</b> <b>food</b> debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped {{between two}} teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E
5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. <b>When</b> <b>food</b> is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{conserve}} {{energy and water}} in their highly seasonal environment, mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs exhibit seasonal behavioral cycles of dormancy where the metabolic rate and body temperature are lowered. They are the only primates known to do so. They accumulate fat reserves in their hind legs and the base of their tail before the dry winter season, <b>when</b> <b>food</b> and water are scarce, and can exhibit daily and prolonged torpor during the dry season. Daily torpor constitutes less than 24 hours of dormancy, whereas prolonged torpor averages two weeks in duration and signals hibernation. Mouse lemurs have been observed experiencing torpor that lasts for several consecutive days, but dwarf lemurs are known to hibernate for six to eight months every year, particularly {{on the west coast}} of Madagascar.|$|E
