Layers of porous and permeable limestone create <b>water-bearing</b> rock and soil that affect the climate, weather, and hydrology of South Florida.|$|E
5|$|A station {{here was}} part of the {{abandoned}} phase two expansion of the Fleet line (now Jubilee line). It had originally been planned in 1943, and was revived as a major transport plan in 1965. London Transport spent £10m (now £m) in 1972 safeguarding the route underneath Cannon Street and building reinforcements for laying a tube in the <b>water-bearing</b> ground around the station. The plan was abandoned in the early 1980s in favour of the current extension further south.|$|E
5|$|The two armies {{stayed in}} their {{respective}} locations for two days. During the second day (August 1) Hannibal, aware that Varro would be in command the following day, left his camp and offered battle, but Paullus refused. When his request was rejected, Hannibal, recognizing the importance {{of water from the}} Aufidus to the Roman troops, sent his cavalry to the smaller Roman camp to harass <b>water-bearing</b> soldiers that were found outside the camp fortifications. According to Polybius, Hannibal's cavalry boldly rode up {{to the edge of the}} Roman encampment, causing havoc and thoroughly disrupting the supply of water to the Roman camp.|$|E
25|$|The {{volume of}} {{groundwater}} in an aquifer {{can be estimated}} by measuring water levels in local wells and by examining geologic records from well-drilling to determine the extent, depth and thickness of <b>water-bearing</b> sediments and rocks. Before an investment is made in production wells, test wells may be drilled to measure the depths at which water is encountered and collect samples of soils, rock and water for laboratory analyses. Pumping tests can be performed in test wells to determine flow characteristics of the aquifer.|$|E
25|$|From the 1950s on, {{many areas}} of the Great Plains have become {{productive}} crop-growing areas because of extensive irrigation on large landholdings. The United States is a major exporter of agricultural products. The southern portion of the Great Plains lies over the Ogallala Aquifer, a huge underground layer of <b>water-bearing</b> strata dating from the last ice age. Center pivot irrigation is used extensively in drier sections of the Great Plains, resulting in aquifer depletion at a rate that is greater than the ground's ability to recharge.|$|E
25|$|An aquifer is an {{underground}} layer of <b>water-bearing</b> permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt) from which groundwater can be extracted using a water well. The study of water flow in aquifers and {{the characterization of}} aquifers is called hydrogeology. Related terms include aquitard, which is a bed of low permeability along an aquifer, and aquiclude (or aquifuge), which is a solid, impermeable area underlying or overlying an aquifer. If the impermeable area overlies the aquifer, pressure could cause it to become a confined aquifer.|$|E
25|$|The {{deposition}} of aquifer material dates back {{two to six}} million years, from the late Miocene to early Pliocene ages when the southern Rocky Mountains were still tectonically active. From the uplands to the west, rivers and streams cut channels in a generally west to east or southeast direction. Erosion of the Rockies provided alluvial and aeolian sediment that filled the ancient channels and eventually covered the entire area of the present-day aquifer, forming the <b>water-bearing</b> Ogallala Formation. In that respect, the process is similar to those currently prevailing in other modern rivers of the area, such as the Kansas River and its tributaries. The major differences are time and depth.|$|E
25|$|M3 {{detected}} absorption features near 2.8–3.0µm on {{the surface}} of the Moon. For silicate bodies, such features are typically attributed to hydroxyl- and/or <b>water-bearing</b> materials. On the Moon, the feature is seen as a widely distributed absorption that appears strongest at cooler high latitudes and at several fresh feldspathic craters. The general lack of correlation of this feature in sunlit M3 data with neutron spectrometer H abundance data suggests that the formation and retention of OH and H2O is an ongoing surficial process. OH/H2O production processes may feed polar cold traps and make the lunar regolith a candidate source of volatiles for human exploration.|$|E
25|$|Artificial landscapes often mimicked sacred landscapes. Doorways of temples {{were seen}} as the cave entrances to mountains. Sometimes these doorways were witz monster mouths. The same was true for the Aztecs, who at Utatlán {{designed}} an artificial cave that ends under the central plaza and is designed according to the mythical seven-chamber cave of emergence, Chicomoztoc (this is also seen at Teotihuacan, though somewhat different). and at Muklebal Tzul it appears that an artificial well underneath a massive platform was made to appear like a <b>water-bearing</b> cave. In the Yucatán many Late Postclassic temples had Spanish churches built {{on top of them}} after the conquest and so caves and cenotes can still be found near these places today.|$|E
25|$|To {{the west}} of the region through which the river flows, the {{underlying}} geology is an extensive <b>water-bearing</b> porous rock structure called the Magnesian Limestone aquifer. Magnesian limestone is so named because if contains quantities of the mineral Dolomite, which is rich in Magnesium. Further to the east, this rock is covered by another layer of porous rock called the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer, which is the major geological component of the area. Continuing eastwards, both are then covered by a layer of Mercia mudstone. Where these aquifers reach the surface, they often supply water to the river system, but can also take water from it. This is affected by the extraction of groundwater, particularly for public water supply, and by fracturing of the aquifers as a result of subsidence caused by deep coal mining.|$|E
25|$|The region {{through which}} the river flows is underlaid by an {{extensive}} <b>water-bearing</b> porous rock structure called the Magnesian Limestone aquifer, which is near the surface {{in the west and}} dips downwards to the east. Magnesian Limestone is so called because it contains quantities of the mineral Dolomite, which is rich in Magnesium. The Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer is another porous rock layer which covers this to the east, and is the major geological component of the area. Further east, they are both covered by a layer of Mercia Mudstone. Where these aquifers reach the surface, they often supply water to the river system, but can also take water from it.

25|$|The {{source of}} the Poulter is {{in a region where}} the {{underlying}} geology is an extensive <b>water-bearing</b> porous rock structure called the Magnesian Limestone aquifer. Magnesian limestone is named because if contains quantities of the mineral Dolomite, which is rich in Magnesium. Where this rock reaches the surface, springs often occur, and the Poulter starts at such a spring. Further to the east, the Magnesian Limestone is covered by a layer of porous rock called the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer, which is the major geological component of the area. Continuing eastwards, both are covered by a layer of Mercia mudstone. The groundwater levels in these aquifers affect whether they supply water to the river system, or take water from it, and levels are lower than they have historically been, {{as a result of the}} extraction of groundwater, particularly for public water supply, and by fracturing of the aquifers as a result of subsidence caused by deep coal mining.|$|E
25|$|The tunnel was {{constructed}} using a TBM, originating from the Strawberry Portal and mining at a slight downhill gradient of approximately 18 feet per 100 linear feet (0.25%). Much like the West Tunnel, the TBM {{in the east}} tunnel encountered <b>water-bearing</b> strata of metamorphic and granitic rock. The presence of water, coupled with {{the depth of the}} tunnel below the surface, up to 2,100 feet underground, forced the tunneling team to deal with water pressures in the tunnel heading in excess of 200 pounds per square inch. Also, much like the West tunnel mining efforts, the TBM had to traverse branches of the San Andreas fault, and on one occasion in late 2006, the TBM became stuck as mining efforts approached some particularly difficult ground. Hand-mining efforts above the TBM shield were eventually employed to free the stuck machine. The tunnel was completed in May 2008 with the installation of pipeline being completed in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The TBM faced many {{challenges}} during the tunneling. Much of the tunneling {{took place in}} <b>water-bearing</b> strata of metamorphic and granitic rock. The presence of water, coupled with {{the depth of the}} tunnel, up to 1,100 feet underground, forced the tunneling team to deal with water pressures in excess of 150 pounds per square inch. Additionally, the tunnel alignment crossed or traversed near several significant faults and shear zones, including branches of the San Andreas and Arrowhead Springs Faults. In these faulted areas, the massive blocks of rock were broken into fine debris that were treated with grout before tunneling could safely cross through these zones. A particularly challenging reach of the tunnel alignment was encountered in the last 1,500 feet of the tunneling work as the TBM crossed five significant fault and shear zones along the tunnel alignment on its way to completion at the Devil Canyon Portal. While tunneling in this zone in mid-2008, the TBM began dipping as it encountered a 40-foot-wide fault zone of completely crushed, weak rock. Concrete and steel foundation pads were constructed in front of the cutter head to stabilize the TBM and correct the alignment of the machine as it crossed the weak ground within the fault zone. The tunnel was completed in August 2008, with installation of pipeline being completed in 2009.|$|E
500|$|A Surtseyan {{eruption}} (or hydrovolcanic) {{is a type}} {{of volcanic}} eruption caused by shallow-water interactions between water and lava, named so after its most famous example, the eruption and formation of the island of Surtsey off the coast of Iceland in 1963. Surtseyan eruptions are the [...] "wet" [...] equivalent of ground-based Strombolian eruptions, but because of where they are taking place they are much more explosive. This is because as water is heated by lava, it flashes in steam and expands violently, fragmenting the magma it is in contact with into fine-grained ash. Surtseyan eruptions are the hallmark of shallow-water volcanic oceanic islands, however they are not specifically confined to them. Surtseyan eruptions can happen on land as well, and are caused by rising magma that comes into contact with an aquifer (<b>water-bearing</b> rock formation) at shallow levels under the volcano. The products of Surtseyan eruptions are generally oxidized palagonite basalts (though andesitic eruptions do occur, albeit rarely), and like Strombolian eruptions Surtseyan eruptions are generally continuous or otherwise rhythmic.|$|E

2500|$|Meteorite markets {{came into}} {{existence}} in the late 1990s, especially in Morocco. This trade was driven by Western commercialization and {{an increasing number of}} collectors. The meteorites were supplied by nomads and local people who combed the deserts looking for specimens to sell. Many thousands of meteorites have been distributed in this way, most of which lack any information about how, when, or where they were discovered. These are the so-called [...] "Northwest Africa" [...] meteorites. When they get classified, they are named [...] "Northwest Africa" [...] (abbreviated NWA) followed by a number. It is generally accepted that NWA meteorites originate in Morocco, Algeria, Western Sahara, Mali, and possibly even further afield. Nearly all of these meteorites leave Africa through Morocco. Scores of important meteorites, including Lunar and Martian ones, have been discovered and made available to science via this route. A few of the more notable meteorites recovered include Tissint and Northwest Africa 7034. Tissint was the first witnessed Martian meteorite fall in over fifty years; NWA 7034 is the oldest meteorite known to come from Mars, and is a unique <b>water-bearing</b> regolith breccia.|$|E
6000|$|But {{how does}} this theory explain the perfect purity of the coal? I think Sir C. Lyell answers that {{question}} fully in p. 383 of his [...] "Student's Elements of Geology." [...] He {{tells us that the}} dense growths of reeds and herbage which encompass the margins of forest-covered swamps in the valley and delta of the Mississippi, in passing through them, are filtered and made to clear themselves entirely before they reach the areas in which vegetable matter may accumulate for centuries, forming coal if the climate be favourable; and that in the cypress-swamps of that region no sediment mingles with the vegetable matter accumulated from the decay of trees and semi-aquatic plants; so that when, in a very dry season, the swamp is set on fire, pits are burnt into the ground many feet deep, or as far as the fire can go down without reaching water, and scarcely any earthy residuum is left; just as when the soil of the English fens catches fire, red-hot holes are eaten down through pure peat till the <b>water-bearing</b> clay below is reached. But the purity of the water in peaty lagoons is observable elsewhere than in the delta of the Mississippi. What can be more transparent than many a pool surrounded by quaking bogs, fringed, as they are in Ireland, with a ring of white water-lilies, which you dare not stoop to pick, lest the peat, bending inward, slide you down into that clear dark gulf some twenty feet in depth, bottomed and walled with yielding ooze, from which there is no escape? Most transparent, likewise, is the water of the West Indian swamps. Though it is of the colour of coffee, or rather of dark beer, and so impregnated with gases that it produces fever or cholera when drunk, yet it is--at least when it does not mingle with the salt water--so clear, that one might see every marking on a boa- constrictor or alligator, if he glided along the bottom under the canoe.|$|E

5000|$|CI chondrites contain between 17 and 22 weight % water. Their high {{porosity}} (of up to 30%) {{seems to}} be correlated to that fact. The water is not occurring freely, but is rather tied up in <b>water-bearing</b> silicates.
