5|$|Skirting {{the outer}} edge of the {{asteroid}} belt is the Cybele group, orbiting between 3.3 and 3.5AU.

Here the two families of Trojan asteroids can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1km, are approximately as numerous as the asteroids of the asteroid belt.|$|E

5|$|Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 (formally {{designated}} D/1993F2) was a comet {{that broke}} apart in July 1992 and collided <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter</b> in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects. This generated {{a large amount}} of coverage in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its possible role in reducing space debris in the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Earth and its {{neighbor}} planets may have formed from fragments of planets after collisions <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter</b> destroyed those super-Earths near the Sun. As Jupiter came toward the inner Solar System, in what theorists call the Grand Tack Hypothesis, gravitational tugs and pulls occurred causing {{a series of}} collisions between the super-Earths as their orbits began to overlap.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{religions}} were tolerated {{insofar as}} they did not interfere with public order, or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion. The worship of Egyptian deities in particular flourished under the Flavian dynasty, to an extent not seen again until the reign of Commodus. Veneration of Serapis and Isis, who were identified <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter</b> and Minerva respectively, was especially prominent.|$|E

5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter</b> in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still pose a threat to life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Most short-period comets {{belong to}} the Jupiter family—defined as comets with semi-major axes smaller than Jupiter's. Jupiter family comets are thought to form in the Kuiper belt outside the orbit of Neptune. During close {{encounters}} <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter</b> their orbits are perturbed into a smaller period and then circularized by regular gravitational interaction with the Sun and Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Some comets meet a more {{spectacular}} end – either {{falling into the}} Sun or smashing into a planet or other body. Collisions between comets and planets or moons were common in the early Solar System: {{some of the many}} craters on the Moon, for example, may have been caused by comets. A recent collision of a comet with a planet occurred in July 1994 when Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 broke up into pieces and collided <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter.</b>|$|E
50|$|The SuperWASP project {{announced}} an extrasolar planet, WASP-7b, orbiting this star in 2008. The planet {{appears to be}} another hot Jupiter, a dense planet <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter's</b> mass orbiting very close to a hot star and thus emitting enough heat to shine.|$|R
50|$|During its orbit, Io’s {{ionosphere}} interacts <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter’s</b> magnetosphere, {{to create}} a frictional current that causes radio wave emissions. These are called “Io-controlled decametric emissions” and the researchers believe finding similar emissions near known exoplanets could be key to predicting where other moons exist.|$|R

The colors also vary significantly, from red to grey, {{which might be}} the result of {{multiple}} collisions. Sinope, sometimes included in the Pasiphae group, is red and, given the difference in inclination, it could have been captured independently; Pasiphae and Sinope are also trapped in secular resonances <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{component of the}} Solar System is the Sun, a G2 main-sequence star that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally. The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the remaining mass, <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter</b> and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.|$|E
5|$|A basic {{sub-division}} is a {{grouping of}} the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and {{are thought to have}} formed <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter.</b> The remainder of the moons consist of an unknown number of small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.|$|E

5|$|Batygin and Brown {{suggested}} Planet Nine was a primordial giant planet core {{that was}} ejected from its initial orbit by an encounter <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter</b> during the nebular epoch of the Solar System {{and was later}} perturbed into a stable orbit by a distant encounter with a passing star or by the solar nebula. Others have proposed that it was captured {{in a similar manner}} from another star, or that it formed on a very distant circular orbit and was perturbed into its current eccentric orbit during a distant encounter with another star.|$|E
5|$|Constantine ignored {{those parts}} of Diocletian's rule that did not suit him. Diocletian's policy of {{preserving}} a stable silver coinage was abandoned, and the gold solidus became the empire's primary currency instead. Diocletian's persecution of Christians was repudiated and changed to a policy of toleration and then favoritism. Christianity eventually became the official religion in 380. Constantine would claim {{to have the same}} close relationship with the Christian God as Diocletian claimed to have <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter.</b> Most importantly, Diocletian's tax system and administrative reforms lasted, with some modifications, until the advent of the Muslims in the 630s. The combination of state autocracy and state religion was instilled in much of Europe, particularly in the lands which adopted Orthodox Christianity.|$|E
5|$|During an {{encounter}} <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter</b> in 1992, the Ulysses spacecraft detected {{a stream of}} dust-sized particles being ejected from the Jovian system. The dust in these discrete streams travels away from Jupiter at speeds upwards of several hundred kilometres per second, has an average particle size of 10μm, and consists primarily of sodium chloride. Dust measurements by Galileo showed that these dust streams originate from Io, but exactly how these form, whether from Io's volcanic activity or material removed from the surface, is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Hale–Bopp {{may have}} had a near {{collision}} <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter</b> in early June 2215BC, which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit, and 2215BC may have been its first passage through the inner Solar System. The comet's current orbit is almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, so further close approaches to planets will be rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within 0.77AU of Jupiter, close enough for its orbit to be measurably affected by the planet's gravity. The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2,533years, and it will next return to the inner Solar System around the year 4385. Its greatest distance from the Sun (aphelion) will be about 370AU, reduced from about 525AU.|$|E

So close was the action that the British ships found themselves at risk of firing into one another in the high seas, heavy rain and poor visibility. The Dutch centre, consisting of the ships of the line Brutus, Leijden and the fifth rate razee Mars, pulled away from the engagement behind them under Rear-Admiral Johan Bloys van Treslong, coming under only distant fire from the ships of Onslow's division. Isolated, the Dutch rearguard were rapidly overwhelmed, <b>with</b> <b>Jupiter,</b> Haarlem, Alkmaar and Delft all surrendering to Onslow's attack before 13:45, while the battered Monnikkendam was seized by the frigate Beaulieu.|$|E
