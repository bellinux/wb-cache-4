5|$|An inquest in April 2008 {{found that}} Jones had sped over a {{pedestrian}} crossing on the <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road, {{leading to a}} head-on collision. His death was recorded as an accident, but {{it was confirmed that}} had he survived, he would have been facing two charges of death by dangerous driving.|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, on the <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle, {{facing away from}} the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching {{down to the ground}} and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E
5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely run-down with trash on the streets, and total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from the <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then {{a whole bunch of}} copycat wankers after us.|$|E

5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was on the <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Allen's {{exploits}} {{in those}} years {{introduced him to the}} <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> justice system, which would become a recurring feature of his life. In one incident, he and his brother Heman went to the farm of a neighbor, some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages. He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox, a procedure that at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.|$|E
5|$|At Green Beach to the west, {{part of the}} South Saskatchewan Regiment was {{landed on}} the <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scie River, necessitating an assault over the machine gun swept bridge there so they could assault the cliffs on the west. The village of Pourville was {{captured}} but the eastern cliffs proved impossible to capture so blocking their assault on an artillery battery and a radar station. The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders were landed {{with the objective of}} moving south to attack an airfield and a divisional HQ. Neither battalion was able to achieve their objectives. As with the other three beaches, casualties among the Canadians were high with 160 fatalities.|$|E

5|$|Franklin's three-year {{exploration}} of the northern coast of Canada {{in search of the}} Northwest Passage had ended in disaster amid accusations of murder and cannibalism, with 11 of the 20members of the group killed and the survivors reduced to eating lichen, their own boots, and the remains of rotten carcasses abandoned by wolves. The party had become stranded on the <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Coppermine River after their boats had been destroyed in a storm; John Richardson had attempted to swim to safety and suffered severe hypothermia. A single member of the party had fashioned a small canoe from canvas and willow, and the survivors had been obliged to cross the river one at a time using the makeshift canoe.|$|E
5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly {{joined the}} losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, {{he felt he had}} to join a faction as a hired gun, although it put him on the <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November 2003, {{near his}} home in the Warwickshire village of Meriden, West Midlands, Hughes lost control of his Mercedes CL55 AMG and went onto the <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road before colliding with a Renault Scénic. A {{passenger}} in the Renault, Douglas Graham, was killed in the incident, whilst his wife Maureen and the driver Albert Frisby were severely injured. Hughes and passenger Adrian Smith left the scene, before turning themselves in to the police 36 hours later. He was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He denied the charge, though later pleaded guilty to charges of failing to stop and failing to report an accident.|$|E

5|$|Slalom is a single-player game {{in which}} players race {{downhill}} {{in a series of}} slalom races. There are 24downhill runs total that are evenly spread across three mountains. Before the game starts, players choose their mountain based on difficulty: Snowy Hill for beginners, Steep Peak for intermediate players, and Mount Nasty for experts. The goal for each run is to reach the finish line within the allotted time. Players must dodge obstacles including trees, flags, snowmen, sledders, and other skiers on their way downhill, or else they will tumble and lose time. With enough momentum, players can jump over these obstacles. Players must ski around flags to maintain their speed. If they ski on the <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flag, the racer will snowplow and slow down.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War necessitated a new aerodrome for the Royal Flying Corps. The Corps had received the Royal Warrant on 13 April 1912, whereupon Major Sefton Brancker of the War Office conducted aerial surveys in 1914 of Glebe Farm in Ickenham, and Hundred Acres Farm and Down Barnes Farm in Ruislip, looking for the most effective operating base for new squadrons. He settled on a site near Northolt Junction railway station {{but it was not}} until January 1915 that the British government officially requisitioned the land. It is rumoured that the government official tasked with acquiring the land arrived at the site with his map upside down, leading to the government requisitioning and developing land on the <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway line, including the old Hill Farm.|$|E
5|$|During {{the third}} attempt to relieve Mantua, Vukassovich {{participated in the}} Tyrol Corps' {{victories}} at Cembra on 2 November and the Battle of Calliano on 6–7 November. On the 17th, his troops battled {{their way out of}} the Adige River gorge to link up with Joseph Ocskay von Ocsko's column on the heights. Together they routed the French at Rivoli Veronese. After Bonaparte won the Battle of Arcole, the French army commander drove the Tyrol Corps back to Trento. During the fourth attempt to relieve Mantua, Jozsef Alvinczi directed Vukassovich to lead his 6th Column down the east bank of the Adige River. His artillery supported the attack of Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen on the west bank of the river, but he exerted little other influence on the disastrous result of the Battle of Rivoli because his troops were on the <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the open}} battle never took place. The 1,200-strong English landing force under Major John Walley, Phips' second-in-command, never got across the Saint Charles. Frontenac had sent strong {{detachments}} of Canadian militiamen under Jacques Le Moyne de Sainte-Hélène, {{along with some}} Indians, into the wooded areas east of the river. When the English landed on 18 October, they were immediately harassed by Canadian militia, while the ships' boats mistakenly landed the field guns on the <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saint Charles. Meanwhile, Phips's four large ships, quite contrary to the plan, anchored before Quebec and began bombarding the city until 19 October, {{at which point the}} English had shot away most of their ammunition. The French shore batteries had also proved to be much more than a match, and the ships were pounded until the rigging and hulls were badly damaged; the ensign of Phips' flagship the Six Friends was cut down and fell into the river, and under a hail of musket shots, a daring group of Canadians paddled a canoe up to the ships to capture it. They triumphantly brought the ensign back to the Governor unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Negron, in a {{flashback}} tells of his war {{experiences as a}} young corporal of the segregated 92nd Infantry Division in Italy in 1944. A disastrous attack ensues on German positions across the Serchio River. An officer, Captain Nokes, calls down artillery on the 92nd's own position, refusing to believe their reports of how far they have advanced. Many American soldiers are killed, leaving Negron stranded on the <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river with three men: Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps, Sergeant Bishop Cummings, and Private Sam Train. Sam carries the Head of the Primavera that he found in Florence, which he believes to carry magical powers. Sam and Bishop rescue an Italian boy named Angelo from a collapsing building. While traveling through the mountains of Tuscany, the soldiers enter a small village, where they form a bond with the residents. Sam grows especially fond of Angelo, becoming the boy's father figure. One Italian villager, Renata, soon becomes entangled in a love triangle with Stamps and Bishop, which creates conflict.|$|E

50|$|The {{cab forward}} design was widely {{used by the}} Southern Pacific Railroad, which {{developed}} it to deal with <b>the</b> peculiar problems <b>of</b> its routes. <b>The</b> 39 long tunnels and nearly 40 mi of snow sheds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sierra Nevada Mountains could funnel dangerous exhaust fumes back into <b>the</b> crew compartment <b>of</b> a conventional locomotive. After a number of crews nearly asphyxiated, the locomotive was run in reverse. This meant that the tender was leading the train, which introduced new problems. The tender blocked the view ahead and put crewmen on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cab for seeing signals. The tenders were not designed to be pushed at <b>the</b> lead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train, which limited speeds. Southern Pacific commissioned Baldwin Locomotive Works to build a prototype cab-forward locomotive, then ordered more units before the prototype had even arrived.|$|R
