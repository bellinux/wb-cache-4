The auditions held in late 2012 were filmed {{and turned into}} a documentary style cinematic release, Some Kind of Wonderful, which premiered exclusively through Hoyts Cinemas in Australia from March. This line-up were branded as a [...] "new generation" [...] of the group by press. Of the film, Nicholson said, [...] "I'm proud of how diligent <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> finding wholesome new talent, people with a great energy and who are genuinely lovely people." [...] A new television series entitled Hi-5 House was filmed in Singapore and premiered on pay-TV channel Nick Jr. in Australia in November 2013.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton's first {{choices for}} the boat's crew were Worsley and Tom Crean—the latter, he said, [...] "begged to go". Crean was a shipmate from the Discovery Expedition, 1901–04, and had also been with Scott's Terra Nova Expedition in 1910–13, where he had {{distinguished}} himself on the fatal polar march. Shackleton was confident that Crean would persevere to the bitter end, and had great faith in Worsley's skills as a navigator, especially his ability to work out positions in difficult circumstances. Worsley later wrote: [...] "We {{knew it would be}} the hardest thing we had ever undertaken, for the Antarctic winter had set in, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> to cross one of the worst seas in the world".|$|E

2500|$|Arendt {{was born}} into a secular family of German Jews in Linden (now a part of Hanover), the {{daughter}} of Martha (born Cohn) and Paul Arendt. She grew up in [...] (renamed Kaliningrad when it was annexed to the Soviet Union in 1946) and Berlin. Arendt's family was thoroughly assimilated and she later remembered: [...] "With us from Germany, the word 'assimilation' received a 'deep' philosophical meaning. You can hardly realize how serious <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Duterte stated at a {{rally in}} April 2016 that he shot a fellow student who had bullied him about his Visayan origin as well as other {{students}} of the same ethnicity, while at San Beda law college. He said [...] "But the truth is, I'm used to shooting people. When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> to graduate from San Beda, I shot a person." [...] Duterte said that he shot the student in a corridor at the college when the said student called him names again. He later told a reporter that the student survived, but refused to answer any further questions about the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{excellent}} review, {{giving it a}} A-. In her recap, she gave the performances high marks: [...] "Y’know, when I get so frustrated with OUAT, it’s because it sets a high bar up against itself. Like this episode, for example. It takes a classic myth, perfectly twists it into the show’s own purposes, and manages to be jaw-dropping in a single hour. I didn’t realize <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> to get so much out of “Nimue,” but I should have guessed once {{we found out that}} it was penned by Jane Espenson, who writes most of OUAT’s best episodes." ...|$|E

2500|$|I'd {{learned to}} read Butler's body {{language}} and he was getting a little nervous as we flew {{deeper and deeper into}} Iraqi territory. The reality of what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> to do had begun to hit him. Duelfer teased him about how the Iraqis could solve everything if they just shot us out of the sky. Butler was not amused. He kept asking probing questions, reassuring himself that these inspection targets were of a legitimate disarmament character. [...] "What makes us go to that site?" [...] he asked. How do I explain it to the Iraqis?...How do I explain this site to the Security Council?...What do we expect to find at this one?...What happens if the Iraqis stop us from entering?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{working class}} {{teenagers}} from Stourbridge created the band in 1976. Brian Tatler & Duncan Scott formed the band with a biscuit tin drum kit and borrowed guitar in Brian's bedroom. They auditioned several school {{friends for a}} singer until finding Sean Harris. [...] "It was {{the last year of}} school, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> to leave to get jobs or go to college" [...] said Brian Tatler, The name 'Diamond Head' came from a 1975 Phil Manzanera album that Tatler had a poster of in his room. The band played their first gig at High Park school hall (10 February 1977) and sold 151 tickets for a forty-minute set of their own original material. Bassist Colin Kimberley, a friend of Tatler's from primary school, joined the band in 1978 as their fourth bassist.|$|E
2500|$|The four soon took in Eric Dill, {{a high-school}} friend of Zehr from when they both lived in Indianapolis. Zehr {{has said that}} they began playing seriously because [...] "hen we started the band our senior year, it was {{basically}} our last-ditch effort, because we all knew <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> {{to be done with}} school and have to enter the real world". They were all in their very early-20s. According to Zehr, the group would play several shows a week that were booked under different band names to get around local clubs' rules preventing artists from playing that close to each other. Their playing then got the attention of Mike Denneen, Boston-based producer of Fountains of Wayne, who agreed to help them produce a 2-song demo record. Denneen also introduced them to Kiss guitarist Paul Stanley, who was strongly supportive.|$|E

2500|$|Horthy also renewed peace feelers to the Allies {{and began}} {{considering}} strategies for surrendering to the Allied force he distrusted the most: the Red Army. [...] As bitterly anti-Communist as Horthy was, {{his dealings with}} the Nazis led him {{to conclude that the}} Communists were the far lesser evil. [...] Working through his trustworthy General Béla Miklós, who was in contact with Soviet forces in eastern Hungary, Horthy sought to surrender to the Soviets while preserving the Hungarian government's autonomy. The Soviets willingly promised this, and on 11 October Horthy and the Soviets finally agreed to surrender terms. [...] On 15 October 1944, Horthy told his government ministers that Hungary had signed an armistice with the Soviet Union. He said, [...] "It is clear today that Germany has lost the war... Hungary has accordingly concluded a preliminary armistice with Russia, and will cease all hostilities against her." [...] Horthy [...] "...informed a representative of the German Reich that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> to conclude a military armistice with our former enemies and to cease all hostilities against them." ...|$|E
2500|$|No {{conceptual}} {{music videos}} {{ended up being}} made to promote Invitation to the Dance, {{in part due to}} issues with the band's troubled label London-Sire. Despite being one of the heavier songs on the album, [...] "Falling Down" [...] received moderate airplay, leading to it initially being considered. Max Illidge stated in 2002 [...] "We could have made a video for it and maybe if the video was shocking enough it would have given us a bigger push, but London-Sire just decided to scrap [...] "Falling Down" [...] and go with [...] "Wither Away" [...] for the video. I mean we were literally going to leave in like a few days to shoot the video for ‘Wither Away" [...] — en route to LA — we had the plane tickets and the actresses schedules and just all that, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>about</b> three days away from the day of shooting and we got the phone call that we weren’t doing it {{and they were going to}} wait until early next year, but we knew that they were folding.
