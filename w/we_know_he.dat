5|$|By far {{the most}} {{detailed}} and reliable source for the battle, and Julian's Gallic campaign (355–60) generally, is the Res Gestae (Histories) of Ammianus Marcellinus, a contemporary historian. Ammianus was a Greek career soldier who joined the army before 350 and served until at least 363. Enlisted as a protector (cadet senior officer), {{he served as a}} staff officer under magister equitum Ursicinus and then under Julian himself in the latter's Persian campaign. Although he was not present at Strasbourg, he had experience of the Gallic front as he was involved in the suppression of the revolt of Claudius Silvanus, the magister equitum (commander-in-chief) in Gaul (355). However, his narrative reveals a passionate admiration of Julian and occasionally descends to the level of eulogy. Furthermore, as he was writing some 40 years after the event, it is likely that Ammianus relied heavily, if not exclusively, on Julian's own memoir of the Strasbourg campaign (which <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> published, but has been lost). Thus Ammianus' account probably reflects Julian's own propaganda. In addition, Ammianus' account is of uneven quality, with many gaps and some contradictory elements.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} about Paulus' life. He lived in Alexandria, {{one of the most}} {{scholarly}} cities of the Roman world, where astrology was also at its most sophisticated. In his lifetime, Rome's power was declining and the capital of the Roman Empire had been moved to Constantinople. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> was regarded as a considerable authority because we have the record of a series of lectures given on his work by the respected Neo-Platonist philosopher Olympiodorus some two centuries later (in 564 AD), in Alexandria. These lectures were preserved in a Commentary and both Paulus' Introduction and Olympiodorus' Commentary have been translated together, giving a view of the development of astrological technique and contemporary attitudes towards astrology from the tumultuous late Empire through the even more unstable early Byzantine Empire.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 13th century, in the year 1202, Richard de Morins, a canon of Merton, became prior of Dunstable, and with his election the priory entered upon the most interesting period of its history. From 1210 he took over as Dunstable's chronicler. He was evidently a man of very varied interests, and considerable capacity for affairs. Before he had been prior a year he was dispatched on the king's business to Rome; and it was probably owing to his influence that the lordship of Houghton Regis, with other gifts, were confirmed to the priory in 1203. So far as <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> only went abroad once again, when he attended the Lateran council of 1215, and remained afterwards in Paris for a year to study at the University; but the annals show that he maintained all through his life a keen interest in the affairs of Europe and the East. In 1206 he was made a visitor for all the religious houses of the diocese of Lincoln (except those of the exempt orders), by the authority of the papal legate; in 1212 he was appointed by the pope to preach the cross in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Huntingdonshire, and in the same year was commissioned to make an estimate of the losses suffered by the clergy and the religious in the diocese through the exactions of King John. In 1223 and 1228 he was made visitor to his own order, first in the province of York, and afterwards in the dioceses of Lincoln and Coventry; and last of all, in 1239, when he must have been quite an old man, he helped to draw up and submit to the pope an account of the difficulties between the Archbishop of Canterbury and his suffragans on the subject of visitation. During his term of office, in the year 1219, he secured the right of holding a court at Dunstable for all pleas of the Crown, and of sitting beside the justices itinerant at their visits to the town: a privilege which brought him into less happy relations with the townsmen, and may have helped to hasten their revolt against his authority in 1228. He also successfully established the right of his house to Harlington church in 1223. The priory was twice visited by Henry III. during the time of Richard de Morins: once after the siege of Bedford Castle, and again {{in the midst of the}} troubles connected with the burgesses, whom he attempted to pacify, at the prior's earnest request.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} Gregory's {{belief in the}} infinity of God is his belief that God, as limitless, is essentially incomprehensible to the limited minds of created beings. In Life of Moses, Gregory writes: [...] "...every concept that comes from some comprehensible image, by an approximate understanding and by guessing at the Divine nature, constitutes a idol of God and does not proclaim God." [...] Gregory's theology was thus apophatic: he proposed that God should be {{defined in terms of}} what <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>He</b> is not rather than what we might speculate Him to be.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1890 season, Dunlap engaged in {{protracted}} salary negotiations with President Nimick of the Alleghenies. In late March 1890, the Pittsburg Dispatch reported that the two sides had reached a resolution, [...] "and it now seems certain that Dunlap will play his old position in the Pittsburg league club." [...] Nimick said at the time: [...] "I had a long talk with Mr. Dunlap, and we agreed to terms for him to play with us this season. [...] Of course the terms were below those of last year, that is, he will play for much less than $5,000. [...] He did not sign a contract, for reasons that were quite satisfactory to me ... <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> is a good player and he is quite willing to remain with us." ...|$|E

[...] The Arsenal manager claimed that Rooney told his players that he felt no contact, but the referee {{made the decision to}} give Manchester United a penalty which he called the turning point of the match. Wenger used statistics to question Riley's impartiality – of the referee's last eight matches at Old Trafford, he awarded eight penalties to the home team. Wenger was not surprised at United's rough treatment of Reyes – [...] "That's what they always try against us when they're in a difficult situation" [...] and accused Van Nistelrooy of being a cheat in his post-match television interview. Vieira, like his manager, was disappointed in Riley's handling of the match, but sought positives: [...] "We're still eight points clear of United and two points clear of Chelsea. We're in a really good position and all the other teams would want to be in our position." ...|$|E
500|$|... "East to West" [...] is a {{contemporary}} Christian song lasting four minutes and 26 seconds. It {{was written in}} common time in the key of F minor at a tempo of 73 beats per minute. The vocal range in the song ranges from the low note of D4 to the high note of F5. Lyrically, [...] "East to West" [...] deals {{with the concept of}} forgiveness, and the doubt that God forgives and forgets all sin. Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall explained that: [...] "We have a hard time with the concept of forgiveness. We cut ourselves and it heals, but the scar remains. Sometimes we think God treats sin like we would if we were God, and that he handles forgiveness like we would. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> forgives, but we can't accept that God chooses to forget and relinquishes his right to avenge. That's what we're singing about in 'East To West'". In a separate interview, Hall elaborated on that theme, commenting that: [...] "I see forgiveness as God giving away His right to revenge in my life. He loved me so much that He’s choosing to remember that against me no more, all because of Jesus".|$|E
500|$|Hundreds of extras {{were brought}} in to shoot the picture, and some 300 pilots were {{involved}} in the filming. Because the aerial battles required ideal weather to shoot, the production team had to wait on one occasion for 18 consecutive days for proper conditions in San Antonio. If possible, Wellman attempted to capture footage in the air in contrast to clouds in the background, above or in front of cloud banks to generate a sense of velocity and danger. Wellman later explained, [...] "motion on the screen is a relative thing. A horse runs on the ground or leaps over fencers or streams. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> is going rapidly because of his relation to the immobile ground". Against the clouds, Wellman enabled the planes to [...] "dart at each other", and to [...] "swoop down and disappear in the clouds", and to give the audience the sense of the disabled planes plummeting. During the delay in the aerial shooting, Wellman extensively rehearsed the scenes for the Battle of Saint-Mihiel over ten days with some 3500 infantrymen. A large battlefield with trenches and barbed wire was created on location for the filming. Wellman took responsibility for the meticulously-planned explosions himself, detonating them at the right time from his control panel. According to Peter Hopkinson, at least 20 young men, including cameraman William Clothier, were given hand-held cameras to film [...] "anything and everything" [...] during the filming.|$|E

Finally, Kennedy warned of the risks of [...] "a subsequent assimilation within the Conservative fold", adding: [...] "David Cameron has been here often before: from the early days of his leadership he was happy to describe himself as a 'liberal Conservative'.

2500|$|According to Alfred Kazin, {{who knew}} him, Weldon Kees’s {{ambition}} {{as a poet}} knew no bounds.

Since all Hansen had to go on was the word of David Stanley and his mother, he could not have known for sure if there really had been money in the envelope. In fact, Hansen never {{actually}} mentioned money when he produced the envelopes, only asking {{whether or not there was}} any correspondence between the AD's office and the Stanley family. By refusing to acknowledge that he had, in fact, sent something to Stanley's family and then backtracking when confronted with evidence that contradicted his statement, Hansen knew Parker was hiding something. Hansen also admitted that Parker could've just lied about the contents of the envelopes and his investigation would've been stopped cold. As Hansen said years after the incident, [...] "That was the defining moment. All (Parker) had to say was, 'I'm glad you asked, I sent him an insurance form,' and we would've had to start all over, because every dot that we connected started from the premise that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> sent something." ...|$|E

[...] Similarly the same theme was mentioned by the Citizen newspaper in Johannesburg saying [...] "Now <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> was correct in that assessment of South Africa's ability to stage the greatest show on earth." [...] Mbeki always believed that Africans are capable of hosting the World Cup. President Mbeki worked to bring the 2010 World Cup to the African continent for the first time. He personally asked favours to some world leaders to support his World Cup bid. Among these leaders is the then-president of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Mbeki said [...] "With your distinguished football record, the International Football Federation (FIFA) can hardly refuse if Brazil says the cup must go to South Africa".|$|E
