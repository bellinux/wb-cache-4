5000|$|The {{scene in}} Beauty and the Beast {{during which the}} song is heard is the moment when Belle and the Beasts true {{feelings}} for each other are finally established. Set in the ballroom of the Beasts castle, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] is performed by the character Mrs. Potts, an enchanted teapot, midway through the film as she explains the feeling of love to her young teacup son Chip, referring to the emotion as [...] "a tale as old as time". According to Armen Karaoghlanian of Interiors, [...] "Belle familiarizes the Beast with the waltz and as soon he feels comfortable, he gracefully moves her across the floor". Afterwards, the song continues to play instrumentally as Belle and the Beast retire to the balcony for a romantic candlelit dinner. Believed to be the [...] "centerpiece that brings Beauty and her Beast together," [...] the sequence offers an insight into both characters psyches. From the Beasts perspective, it is the moment he realizes {{that he wants to}} confess his true feelings for Belle to her and [...] "decides he wants to tell Belle he is in love with her." [...] Meanwhile, Belle begins {{to fall in love with}} her captor. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Jennie Punter reviewed it as the scene in which [...] "romance finally blossoms." [...] Film critic Ellison Estefan, writing for Estefan Films, believes that the sequence is responsible for [...] "adding another dimension to the characters as they continue to fall deeply in love with each other." [...] Explaining the songs role in the film, director Kirk Wise described the scene as [...] "the culmination of their relationship," [...] while producer Don Hahn pegged it as [...] "the bonding moment of the film when the two main characters finally get together." [...] The scene had long been envisioned as having a more live-action feel to it than the rest of the film, an idea that originated from story artists Brenda Chapman and Roger Allers, who were the first to suggest that the ballroom be built using computers. As the films executive producer, former Head of Disneys film division Jeffrey Katzenberg recalled that he began working on Beauty and the Beast deciding what its [...] "wowie" [...] moment would be, defining this as [...] "the moment in the movie where you see whats on the screen and go, Wow-IEE"; this ultimately became the films ballroom sequence. According to Hahn, the scene was conceived out of the filmmakers desire to manipulate the camera in order to [...] "sweep" [...] the audience away. Allers and Chapman conceived the ballroom in order to provide the characters with an area in which they could linger, and were surprised by the amount of artistic freedom with which they were provided by the animators, who agreed to adjust to the changes in perspective that would result from the moving camera. While Allers decided to raise the camera in order to view the dancing couple from the overhead chandelier, Chapman decided to rotate the camera around Belles skirt as the couple danced past it. In their dance together, Belle and the Beast move toward the camera, as <b>we</b> <b>pan</b> up and into the 3D chandelier. In the next shot, the camera slowly drops from the ceiling as we once again move alongside the 3D chandelier. This adds depth to the scene, as the chandelier is placed at the forefront of the image and Belle and the Beast are in the distance. This shot continues as we move down below and gracefully move around them. The Beast then sways Belle around and near the camera, once again providing us with an illusion that a camera is following these characters around in an actual ballroom. In a wide shot of Belle and the Beast dancing, the camera begins dollying back as Mrs. Potts and Chip appear in the frame. These beautiful compositions and camera movements show us how space functions within an animated feature film. Armen Karaoghlanian of Interiors ...|$|E

40|$|Academics {{focusing}} on China, like other area specialists, tend {{to place a}} high value on formal training in the language and culture of the place we’ve devoted ourselves to teaching and writing about. We think (and I’m no exception) that most of the best scholarly work on Chinese issues has been done by people with this kind of training. And the people outside of the academy that we pay the closest attention to—journalists, free-lance writers, business commentators, policy analysts, etc. —tend to be those who have had some training in Chinese studies, or know the language and have demonstrated a primary interest in China. This is an understandable position. And it is likely, and I believe defensible, that most of the publications on China to which contributors to this blog will draw attention (positive attention, at least–what <b>we</b> <b>pan</b> may be another story) will end up being by people who fall into the categories just described. Still, there’s always a danger of a guild mentality setting in. So, it is important for us to acknowledge from time to time just how valuable a different sort of perspective can be, whether it is offered by Chinese writers who are not China specialists or by non-Chinese scholars and journalists who have a recent or just passing interest in Chinese topics. Sometimes a journalist just posted to China, without much background on the place, will come up with fresh insights, noticing something to which others were blind. And within the world of scholarship, I can think of several people based outside of Chinese studies who have made major contributions to topics that interest when they’ve turned their attention, even if briefly, to China. Judith Stacey’s work on gender in China, Saskia Sassen and John Logan’s comments on Chinese cities, and Barrington Moore and Eric Wolf’s studies of comparative revolutions—these are just a few “outsiders” with insights who come to mind. This explains the reason for the list below, which points readers to five worthy short works by non-China specialists who have contributed to debates on fairly recent (I go back as far as an insightful eyewitness account of Tiananmen by a sociologist, Craig Calhoun, who admitted at the time to having a very limited knowledge of Chinese) topics within the purview of China Beat. Some have a serious ongoing interest in China (manifested in going there regularly, writing more than occasionally about, in one or two cases even taking lessons in the language), but part of what they bring to the subject that is useful is an immersion in the history and present dilemmas of other parts of the world...|$|E

As described for isolating serum TgPOAb, <b>we</b> <b>panned</b> the phage display library by alternating from Tg- to TPO-coated ELISA wells.

Antibody from a single clone, encoded by a non-Tg, non-TPO Ig heavy chain gene, bound both Tg and TPO (TgPO activity). However, this antibody also bound equally well to nonthyroid antigens. In conclusion, enrichment for Tg- and TPO-binding phage was largely attributable to phage specific for either Tg or TPO. This finding, albeit from a single patient, questions previous observations of serum TgPOAb prepared by affinity chromatography.

40|$|Screening {{combinatorial}} libraries of conformation-ally constrained peptides against macromolecular targets is {{utilized in}} identifying novel drug leads and in developing new reagents for chemical bio-logy. In {{methods such as}} phage-display selections, biotinylated macromolecular targets are often immobilized on avidin- and streptavidin-functional-ized supports. Thus, the characterization of pep-tides that bind avidin and streptavidin is necessary for accurate interpretation of screening and selection results. Toward this goal, <b>we</b> <b>panned</b> a phage-displayed cyclic peptide library against NeutrAvidin, a chemically deglycosylated version of avidin. The selection produced a highly homol-ogous consensus motif (Asp-Arg/Leu-Ala-Ser/Thr-Pro-Tyr/Trp). Two of these cyclic peptides, CDRATPYC and CDRASPYC, bound both NeutrAvi-din and avidin with low-micromolar dissociation constants, whereas their acyclic counterparts had negligible affinity (< 80 -fold). Moreover, these cyc-lic peptides were very specific for their targets and did not bind the structurally and functionally similar protein, streptavidin.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) is an {{important}} atmospheric species due to its role in global transport of reactive nitrogen oxides, NOx (= ·NO₂ + ·NO). Peroxyacetyl nitrate is formed by reactions involving hydrocarbons and ·NO₂ in polluted regions and can be transported into the Arctic. To understand the role of PAN as a transporter of NOx to the Arctic, we need to quantify its decomposition pathways which include: thermal decomposition, photolysis, and reaction with the hydroxyl radical (·OH). In colder regions, such as the Arctic, the most rapid decomposition pathway is photolysis. Several photolytic pathways are possible for <b>PAN.</b> <b>We</b> photolyzed <b>PAN</b> in the laboratory using a frequency-doubled tunable dye laser. A highly sensitive technique called cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) probed the ·NO₃ produced in the photolysis reaction and we quantified the quantum yield for production of ·NO₃.

Endowing PaN with the right to determine the threshold of the TDR, we propose multicast schemes based on TDMA and multihop routing for the two networks respectively and derive their achievable multicast throughput depending on the given threshold. Specially, <b>we</b> show when <b>PaN</b> has sparser density than SaN, to be specific, n = o(m/(log m) (2)), and if PaN only cares about the order of its throughput, SaN can simultaneously achieve the same order of the aggregated multicast throughput as it were a stand-alone network in absence of PaN...|$|R

Following our {{previous}} experience at PAN 2012 and CLINSS 2012, we decided {{to put together the}} approaches we used in previous year to face the new challenges of PAN 2013. This year competition added new way of plagiarism obfuscation via text summarization. This particular feature required represents a wide variety of typical cases of plagiarism in the wild and thus attracted our scientific interest. At this year <b>PAN</b> <b>we</b> put forward two main goals: 1) to develop a unified approach {{that will allow us to}} merge results obtained by different analysis methods and then run a unified clusterization algorithm to tackle the problem of granularity and produce clean clusters of suspected plagiarism 2) develop a new method of detecting summarization within the suspected documents. As a starting point at <b>PAN</b> 2013 <b>we</b> utilized the prototype application <b>we</b> developed for <b>PAN</b> 2012 and another application developed for FIRE 2012 (CLINSS task). Two basic approaches are- fingerprinting via 5 gramm hashes with variable step as our main method and sliding window TF-IDF weighting score for similarity detection of pre-processed summarization via custom text summarizer. Euclidian distance based clusterization with additional custom filters method was used as our cluster merging technique. During the training stage <b>we</b> used the <b>PAN</b> 20122013 provided data and performance measures scripts incorporated with genetic algorithm for best parameter tuning and overall performance. Hardware used (training development) : 6 -core Intel i 7990 Ex with 6 GB RAM PC, Vertex 3 SSD...|$|R
