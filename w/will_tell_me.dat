500|$|Michael Giacchino, Abrams' most {{frequent}} collaborator, composed {{the music for}} Star Trek. He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, which Abrams said symbolized {{the momentum of the}} crew coming together. Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as [...] "I grew up listening to all of that great [...] music, and that's part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing [...] You just go in scared. You just hope you do your best. It's {{one of those things where}} the film <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what to do." [...] Scoring took place at the Sony Scoring Stage with a 107-piece orchestra and 40-person choir. An erhu, performed by Karen Han, was used for the Vulcan themes. A distorted recording was used for the Romulans. Varèse Sarabande, the record label responsible for releasing albums of Giacchino's previous scores for Alias, Lost, , and Speed Racer, released the soundtrack for the film on May 5. The music for the theatrical trailers were composed by Two Steps from Hell.|$|E

"I {{have had}} quite a few young Jewish boys who <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that I am their {{favorite}} player, or they love watching me play or they feel like baseball is {{a good fit for}} them because it worked for me, or it worked for Shawn Green or other Jewish players at the Major League level", said Ausmus. [...] "It has been a sense of pride. If you can {{have a positive impact on}} a kid, I'm all for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ausmus' {{mother is}} Jewish, {{but he was}} not raised in the Jewish religion. Nonetheless, he still takes pride in his heritage. Ausmus stated in an {{interview}} with the Jewish Journal: [...] "I wasn't raised with the Jewish religion, so in that sense I don't really have much feeling toward it. But, however, in the last 10 or so years, I have had quite a few young Jewish boys who <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that I am their favorite player or they love watching me play or they feel like baseball is a good fit for them because it worked for me or it worked for Shawn Green or other Jewish players at the major league level. It has been a sense of pride. If you can have a positive impact on a kid, I'm all for it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then <b>will</b> you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> this?" [...] he demanded. [...] "The {{young lady}} is {{confident}} that she locked Craig up in the coach-house and that the key was {{on the outside of}} the door, a fact which would prevent the lock being picked from inside, even if such a thing were possible. The window is small, and up almost in the roof. <b>Will</b> you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> how Craig escaped from the coach-house in order to carry out this abduction--all within a few minutes, mind, of his having been left there? <b>Will</b> you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that, Mr. Sanford Quest?" [...] the Professor concluded, with a note of triumph in his tone.|$|R

2500|$|The song is of a 1990s dance-pop {{style with}} a strong beat, {{featuring}} a lot of bass. It has a large range in dynamics, a style commonly used in many Rouvas songs. Lyrically, the song sees Rouvas asking his lover [...] "Do you want to or not? You <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> tonight" [...] and asking if she has any room in her heart for him or if she just simply likes the chase. The pre-chorus states [...] "However, at this moment, bruised egos ask with a voice". He is asking that she decide because he has grown tired of her games and of worrying at nights. He commands that she [...] "cut the mystery", saying that he has gone through with the love adventure, and her insanity, only {{to fall in love}} with her and has become frustrated.|$|E
2500|$|The first voices seeking {{compromise}} {{have started}} {{to be heard in}} Skopje. The president of the republic, Branko Crvenkovski, announced: [...] "If during the ongoing talks we can reach a rational compromise, which from the one side will defend our ethnic identity, and from the other will enable us to receive the NATO invitation, {{while at the same time}} canceling our further EU accession obstacles, then I think that this is something that must be supported, and I personally side with the supporters. Some accuse me that with my stance I am undermining the negotiating position of the Republic of Macedonia, yet I do not agree, because we are not in the beginning, but in the final phase of the negotiations. The one who <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that the price is high, is obliged to address the public opinion and announce an alternative scenario on how Macedonia will develop in the next ten to fifteen years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nilsen {{was adamant}} he was {{uncertain}} {{as to why}} he had killed, simply saying [...] "I'm hoping you <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that" [...] when asked his motive for the murders. He was adamant the decision to kill was not made until moments before the actual act of murder. Most victims had been killed by strangulation, although on several occasions, he had drowned the victims once they had been strangled into unconsciousness. Once the victim had been killed, he would typically bathe the victim's body, shave any hair from the torso to conform the body to his physical ideal, then apply makeup to any obvious blemishes upon the skin. The body would usually be dressed in socks and underpants, before Nilsen would drape the victims' arms around him as he talked to the corpse. With most victims, Nilsen would masturbate as he stood alongside or knelt above the body, and although Nilsen confessed to having occasionally engaged in intercrural sex with his victims' bodies, he repeatedly stressed to investigators he had never penetrated his victims — harking that his victims were [...] "too perfect and beautiful for the pathetic ritual of commonplace sex".|$|E
