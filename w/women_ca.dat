40|$|The {{specificity}} of tumour markers in cancer is poor. Indeed, {{a number of}} pathophysiological occurrences can induce significant variations of tumour marker plasma concentrations (Touitou & Bogdan, 1988 a,b). The situations resulting in false positive determination have thus {{to be kept in}} mind to avoid any misinterpretation in the follow-up of the patients. It has been recently reported that in <b>women,</b> <b>CA</b> 125 plasma concentrations increased during pregnancy (Niloff et al., 1984) and menstruation (Haga et al., 1986; Jager et al., 1988). Although infrequent, pregnancy does occur in women with a cancer. Therefore, we have documented the serum concentrations of a set of routinely determined tumour markers (CEA, CA- 125, CA- 19. 9, CA- 15. 3 and SCC) in healthy pregnant women taking into account the stage of pregnancy and in young women at two stages of their menstrual cycle. A transverse study was carried out on 100 unselected pregnant women. Blood samples were obtained at the time of routine examinations during pregnancy.

40|$|Orientation: Most CEOs in South Africa are {{chartered}} accountants (<b>CAs).</b> Retaining <b>women</b> <b>CAs</b> might therefore lead to {{an increase}} in women in leadership. The Job Demands-Resources model presents a framework to investigate organisational job-related factors that promote or deter voluntary turnover of <b>women</b> <b>CAs.</b> Research purpose: The primary objective was to investigate which organisational factors promote or reduce the risk of turnover intentions for South African <b>women</b> <b>CAs.</b> The secondary objective was to investigate the moderating potential of job resources on the relationship between job demands and turnover intentions. Motivation for the study: There is a fair amount of research on the problems associated with the retention of <b>women</b> <b>CAs</b> in public practice but very little is known about how those problems interact with each other, and whether there are factors that could buffer them. Research design, approach, and method: The study consisted of a sample (n = 851) of <b>women</b> <b>CAs</b> in public practice firms nationally in South Africa. We used structural equation modelling together with moderated regression analysis. Main findings: Job demands promote turnover intentions, whereas job resources {{have a negative effect on}} turnover intentions. Counter-intuitively a negative direct effect was found between job insecurity and turnover intentions. Statistical support was found for the moderating role of all job resources, except financial advancement, on the relationship between work–family conflict and turnover intentions; and growth opportunities, on the relationship between job insecurity and turnover intentions. Practical/managerial implications: No job resource measured could buffer the impact of job overload on turnover intentions. Contribution: This is the first study to investigate factors that may retain <b>women</b> <b>CAs</b> in public practice audit, tax, and advisory firms (Big Four Accountancy Firms) using the JD-R model. Few studies have investigated the buffering effect of job resources on the relationship between job demands and turnover intentions in general.

40|$|Women with {{a family}} history of ovarian cancer {{represent}} a high-risk group for the development of epithelial ovarian cancer. From July 1990 through December 1992, 386 women with a first-degree or multiple second-degree relatives with confirmed ovarian cancer were enrolled in a study to assess the utility of screening with transvaginal sonography, color flow doppler, and CA 125. The mean age of the group was 41; 85 % were premenopausal and 89 / 384 (23 %) had 2 or more relatives with ovarian cancer. An initial ultrasound examination was abnormal in 89 / 384 (23 %), 89 % of whom were premenopausal. A persistent ovarian mass was detected in 15 patients and all were surgically proven to be benign. Mean CA 125 levels were significantly higher and more variable in pre- vs postmenopausal <b>women.</b> <b>CA</b> 125 was ≥ 35 U/ml in 42 / 386 (11 %) (36 - 232 U/ml). All but one of these women were premenopausal and 50 % subsequently normalized. Two patients who were surgically explored for a rising CA 125 had normal ovaries.

40|$|The {{number of}} women in the Chartered Accounting (CA) {{profession}} has continued to rise since the 1970 s; women now make up one-third of working CAs in Canada (Tabone, 2007). Yet, the {{number of women}} in the upper levels of the profession remains very low. The main purpose of this dissertation is to understand how <b>women</b> <b>CAs</b> experience and talk about the CA profession and to explore the implications of the CA context for the development and maintenance of friendship among <b>women</b> <b>CAs.</b> The ways in which power and agency are exercised in the micro-politics of the everyday lives of <b>women</b> <b>CAs</b> and the nexus of relations through which individuals develop and enact their identities is explored through open-ended interviews and discussion groups with Western Canadian <b>women</b> <b>CAs.</b> 	The dominant ideology of professionalism constructs both individual and collective identities while structuring workplace relations. The findings of this study demonstrate that female CAs believe strongly in elements of professionalism such as meritocracy, excellence, client service, and commitment but that their understanding is gender-neutral and differs from the dominant masculinist interpretations and practices. The participants’ narratives reveal a particular pattern of engagement with the profession characterized by stages of early optimism, disillusionment and the glass ceiling, negotiation and the glass box, resignation, and justification. All participants encountered a glass ceiling, or invisible barriers to advancement, {{as a result of the}} conflicting meanings of the ideals of professionalism. As the women attempted to negotiate solutions to the constraints imposed by the profession’s elite, masculinist discourses were mobilized by those in power in new ways resulting in further constraints upon the women, containing them within a “glass box” that limited their career mobility in all directions and may contribute to gender segmentation in the profession. Masculinist discursive practices have a significant impact not only on the participants’ career aspirations, but also on their friendship relationships, which are, in part, constituted by their relationship to the profession, their need for support against masculinist strategies, and their choice of gender identity strategy. Friendships do not increase activism as the participants’ feel powerless to create change and fear reprisals...|$|R

40|$|This {{analysis}} of five exemplary domestic plays—the anonymous Arden of Faversham and A Warning for Fair Women (1590 s), Thomas Heywood’s A Woman Killed with Kindness (1607), Thomas Middleton’s Women Beware <b>Women</b> (<b>ca.</b> 1613), and Walter Mountfort’s The Launching of the Mary, or The Seaman’s Honest Wife (1632) —offers {{a new approach}} to the emerging ideology of the private and public, or what Ann C. Christensen terms “the tragedy of the separate spheres. ” Feminist scholarship has identified the fruitful gaps between theories and practices of household government in early modern Europe, while work on the global Renaissance attends to commercial expansion, cross-cultural encounters, and colonial settlements. Separation Scenes brings these critical concerns together to expose the intimate and disruptive relationships between the domestic culture and business culture of early modern England. Separation Scenes argues that domestic plays make the absence of husbands for business the subject of tragedy by focusing not on where men traveled but on whom and what they left behind. Elements that critics have rightly associated with domestic tragedy—adultery, sensational murders, and the lavishly articulated operations of domestic life—define this world, which, Christensen argues, was equally shaped by the absence of husbands. Her interpretations of these domestic plays invite us to historicize and further complicate the seemingly universal binary between a feminine “private sphere” and a masculine “public sphere. ” Separation Scenes demonstrates how domestic drama played an active, dynamic, and critical role in deliberating the costs of commercial travel as it disrupted domestic conduct and prompted realignments within the home...|$|E

In the present study, we investigated correlation between the serum parathormone level (PTH) of hemodialysis men and women with calcium (Ca), phosphorus (Pi) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). We studied 30 chronic renal failure hemodialysis patients 16 men and 14 women, aged 22 - 66 years old (average 44 years old) with dialysis duration of 5 months to 14 years. We measured the serum Ca., Pi and ALP in intervals of 3 months and serum PTH levels was measured in 3 month. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software. Our results showed that serum PTH and ALP levels were higher in women than in men (90 % versus 70 %), but abnormal range of serum Ca and Pi levels were higher in men then <b>women</b> (<b>Ca</b> : 8 % versus 2 %, Pi : 58 % versus 50 %). Hemodialysis patients showed correlation between PTH and ALP (p< 0. 05), but the correlation of PTH with Ca and Pi levels was not statistically significant. No correlation was observed between PTH and ALP and Pi in men, however it was significant between PTH and Ca (p< 0. 08, r = - 0. 63).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{present an}} update of the European Group on Tumor Markers {{guidelines}} for serum markers in epithelial ovarian cancer. METHODS: Systematic literature survey from 2008 to 2013. The articles {{were evaluated by}} level of evidence and strength of recommendation. RESULTS: Because of its low sensitivity (50 - 62 % for early stage epithelial ovarian cancer) and limited specificity (94 - 98. 5 %), cancer antigen (CA) 125 (CA 125) is not recommended as a screening test in asymptomatic women. The Risk of Malignancy Index, which includes CA 125, transvaginal ultrasound, and menopausal status, is recommended for the differential diagnosis of a pelvic mass. Because human epididymis protein 4 {{has been reported to}} have superior specificity to CA 125, especially in premenopausal women, it may be considered either alone or as part of the risk of ovarian malignancy algorithm, in the differential diagnosis of pelvic masses, especially in such <b>women.</b> <b>CA</b> 125 should be used to monitor response to first-line chemotherapy using the previously published criteria of the Gynecological Cancer Intergroup, that is, at least a 50 % reduction of a pretreatment sample of 70 kU/L or greater. The value of CA 125 in posttherapy surveillance is less clear. Although a prospective randomized trial concluded that early administration of chemotherapy based on increasing CA 125 levels had no effect on survival, European Group on Tumor Markers state that monitoring with CA 125 in this situation should occur, especially if the patient is a candidate for secondary cytoreductive surgery. CONCLUSIONS: At present, CA 125 remains the most important biomarker for epithelial ovarian cancer, excluding tumors of mucinous origi...|$|E

Design A cross-sectional study of African American and Caucasian women aged 40 – 53 years (N= 829) in Southeast Michigan used the Kellgren and Lawrence Atlas of Standard Radiographs of Arthritis to characterize radiographs of both knee joints (weight bearing) and self-report of knee pain. Results Current pain was a significantly more sensitive predictor of radiographic OAK among AA women (Se= 0. 51) compared to <b>CA</b> <b>women</b> (Se= 0. 35). Specificity was similar between AA women (Sp= 0. 77) and <b>CA</b> <b>women</b> (Sp= 0. 82). Positive predictive value was significantly greater for AA compared with <b>CA</b> <b>women</b> (PV+= 0. 40 and PV+= 0. 15, respectively).

The Danish Monica (Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease) study is a prospective observational study from 1982 - 83 to 1993 - 94. The study population included 1602 adults (30 - 60 y) with information on dietary Ca intake and number of teeth and a subset of 511 participants with information on tooth loss from 1987 - 88 to 1993 - 94. Ca intake less than the recommendations, estimated by a 7 -d food record or a diet history interview in 1982 - 83, was more frequent among females (55 %) than males (45 %; P < 0. 001). Low Ca intake was associated with low number of teeth (1 - 25 vs. 26 - 32 teeth) in males [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 57 (95 % CI = 1. 10 - 2. 29) ] and females [OR = 1. 44 (95 % CI = 1. 10 - 2. 05) ] after adjustment for age, education, smoking, alcohol and sucrose consumption, subjective oral dryness, and time since last dental care visit. The reference group (26 - 32 teeth) and edentulous participants did not significantly differ. A Ca intake below recommendations was significantly associated with increased risk of subsequent tooth loss in males [incidence-rate ratio = 1. 70 (95 % CI = 1. 15 - 2. 48) ]. There was no association in <b>women.</b> <b>Ca</b> intake below recommendations was significantly associated with fewer teeth in both sexes.

40|$|Background: Ovarian cancer early {{detection}} markers CA 125, CA 15. 3, HE 4, and CA 72. 4 vary between healthy women, limiting their utility for screening. Methods: We evaluated cross-sectional relationships between lifestyle and reproductive factors and these markers among controls (n = 1910) from a nested case-control {{study in the}} European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Improvements in discrimination of prediction models adjusting for correlates of the markers were evaluated among postmenopausal women in the nested case-control study (n = 590 cases). Generalized linear models were used to calculate geometric means of CA 125, CA 15. 3, and HE 4. CA 72. 4 above vs. below limit of detection was evaluated using logistic regression. Early detection prediction was modeled using conditional logistic regression. Results: CA 125 concentrations were lower, and CA 15. 3 higher, in post- vs. premenopausal women (p ≤ 0. 02). Among postmenopausal <b>women,</b> <b>CA</b> 125 was higher among women with higher parity and older age at menopause (ptrend ≤ 0. 02), but lower among women reporting oophorectomy, hysterectomy, ever use of estrogen-only hormone therapy, or current smoking (p < 0. 01). CA 15. 3 concentrations were higher among heavier women and in former smokers (p ≤ 0. 03). HE 4 was higher with older age at blood collection and in current smokers, and inversely associated with OC use duration, parity, and older age at menopause (≤ 0. 02). No associations were observed with CA 72. 4. Adjusting for correlates of the markers in prediction models did not improve the discrimination. Conclusions: This study provides insights into sources of variation in ovarian cancer {{early detection}} markers in healthy women and informs about the utility of individualizing marker cutpoints based on epidemiologic factors...|$|E
40|$|Although {{abnormalities}} in {{course and}} geometry (tor-tuosity, kinking, and coiling) {{of the internal}} carotid arteries (ICA) are commonly identified, their etiology and relationship with stroke and stroke risk factors remain unclear. This study assessed the clinical and ultrasonographic features of the patients with abnor-malities in course and geometry of the ICA. Carotid color duplex ultrasound studies of 345 con-secutive patients referred to the Neuroultrasound Lab were prospectively evaluated. Abnormalities in direction and course of the ICA were classified according to the criteria of Weibel-Fields and Metz modified by the authors. Kinking was categorized as mild (> 60 °), moderate (30 °- 60 °), and severe (< 30 °). Carotid abnormalities (CA) were found in 85 / 345 (24. 6 %), 60 / 85 (70. 6 %) were female. More CA were seen in females older than 60 y/o (p < 0. 001), {{but there was no}} gender difference in patients 60 y/o or younger. CA were bilateral in 41 patients (48 %), but in those with unilateral CA, most were on the left. The most common CA was kinking (71 arteries, 56 %), followed by tortuos-ity (48 arteries, 38 %), and coiling (7 arteries, 6 %). None of the atherosclerotic vascular diseases or risk factors was associated with CA. Mild atheromatous plaques predominated in patients with CA, but moderate and large plaques were more common in the others (p = 0. 001). Maximal systolic velocity at the level of CA was higher in patients with kinking or coiling com-pared with tortuosity (p = 0. 001). Lumen diameter at the level of CA was inversely correlated to the severity of CA (p < 0. 001). However, carotid stenosis was equally present in all groups. This study suggests that CA have no clear importance as a stroke risk factor or marker of atherosclerotic vas-cular disease. Our results suggest that CA do not devel-op as a consequence of vascular risk factors or athero-sclerotic lesions, and they are not related to ischemic stroke, TIA or the presence of carotid stenosis. In <b>women,</b> <b>CA</b> was related with advanced age. It appears that CA frequently identified by color duplex sonogra-phy are more of curiosity than a clinically significant finding...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{increased}} use of dietary pattern methods in nutritional epidemiology, {{there have been few}} direct comparisons of methods. Older adults are a particularly understudied population in the dietary pattern literature. This study aimed to compare dietary patterns derived by principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) in older adults and to examine their associations with socio-demographic and health behaviours. METHODS: Men (n =  1888) and women (n =  2071) aged 55 - 65 years completed a 111 -item food frequency questionnaire in 2010. Food items were collapsed into 52 food groups and dietary patterns were determined by PCA and CA. Associations between dietary patterns and participant characteristics were examined using Chi-square analysis. The standardised PCA-derived dietary patterns were compared across the clusters using one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: PCA identified four dietary patterns in men and two dietary patterns in <b>women.</b> <b>CA</b> identified three dietary patterns in both men and women. Men in cluster 1 (fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, fish and poultry) scored higher on PCA factor 1 (vegetable dishes, fruit, fish and poultry) and factor 4 (vegetables) compared to factor 2 (spreads, biscuits, cakes and confectionery) and factor 3 (red meat, processed meat, white-bread and hot chips) (mean, 95  % CI; 0. 92, 0. 82 - 1. 02 vs. 0. 74, 0. 63 - 0. 84 vs. - 0. 43, - 0. 50 - - 0. 35 vs. 0. 60 0. 46 - 0. 74, respectively). Women in cluster 1 (fruit, vegetables and fish) scored highest on PCA factor 1 (fruit, vegetables and fish) compared to factor 2 (processed meat, hot chips cakes and confectionery) (1. 05, 0. 97 - 1. 14 vs. - 0. 14, - 0. 21 - - 0. 07, respectively). Cluster 3 (small eaters) in both men and women had negative factor scores for all the identified PCA dietary patterns. Those with dietary patterns characterised by higher consumption of red and processed meat and refined grains {{were more likely to be}} Australian-born, have a lower level of education, a higher BMI, smoke and did not meet physical activity recommendations (all P <  0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: PCA and CA identified comparable dietary patterns within older Australians. However, PCA may provide some advantages compared to CA with respect to interpretability of the resulting dietary patterns. Older adults with poor dietary patterns also displayed other negative lifestyle behaviours. Food-based dietary pattern methods may inform dietary advice that is understood by the community...|$|E

Design: Retrospective trans-sectional study. Patients: 1002 premenopausal women with the diagnoses hirsutism or PCOS were divided according to ethnicity: Caucasian (CA, n= 784), Middle East (ME, n= 190), Asian (n= 14), other (n= 14). Measurements: Clinical evaluation (hirsutism, BMI, waist, blood pressure), hormone analyses (testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, prolactin, lipids, insulin, glucose), and transvaginal ultrasound. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) (n = 499) and ACTH tests (n = 434) were performed in a subgroup of patients. Results (<b>CA</b> vs. ME <b>women)</b> : <b>CA</b> <b>women</b> were older [32 (25 - 37) vs. 25 (18 - 32) years, median (quartiles) ] and had increased BMI compared to ME women.
