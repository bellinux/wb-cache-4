40|$|Deviated {{and deep}} wells {{introduce}} new challenges, and necessitates focus on <b>well</b> <b>casing</b> design.

The nature of this project is to investigate the effects on burst and collapse capacity caused by eccentricity, by evaluating numerous analytical solutions providing comparisons to a finite element analysis (FEA) created with ABAQUS.

50|$|Hydraulic fracturing, {{also known}} as fracking, is a process used to extract {{oil and natural gas}}. The process to extract oil and natural gas begins with {{thousands}} of gallons of water, mixed with a slurry of chemicals, some of which are undisclosed. This liquid mixture is then forced into <b>well</b> <b>casings</b> under high pressure, and then is horizontally injected into bedrock to create cracks or fissures. The forced change in geologic structure allows gas molecules to escape, therefore allowing the natural gas to be harvested.|$|E

While contaminants were lost from solution as a result of diffusion into polymers, contaminant losses were also observed when solutions came into contact with certain metals, and these losses were not consistent with a diffusion process. Reductive dechlorination was considered the most likely cause. This was confirmed by tests that showed several transitional metals had the ability to degrade many chlorinated aliphatic compounds.|$|E

40|$|Geophysical {{measurements}} {{within a}} borehole are typically {{affected by the}} presence of the borehole. The focus of the current study is to quantify the effect of borehole design on broadband electrical impedance tomography (EIT) measurements within boreholes. Previous studies have shown that effects on the real part of the electrical resistivity are largest for boreholes with large diameters and for materials with a large formation factor. However, these studies have not considered the effect of the <b>well</b> <b>casing</b> and the filter gravel on the measurement of the real part of the electrical resistivity. In addition, the effect of borehole design on the imaginary part of the electrical resistivity has not been investigated yet. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of borehole design on the complex electrical resistivity using laboratory measurements and numerical simulations. In order to do so, we developed a high resolution two dimensional axisymmetric finite element model (FE) that enables us to simulate the effects of several key borehole design parameters (e. g. borehole diameter, thickness of PVC <b>well</b> <b>casing)</b> on the measurement process. For the material surrounding the borehole, realistic values for complex resistivity were obtained from a database of laboratory measurements of complex resistivity from the test site Krauthausen (Germany). The slotted PVC <b>well</b> <b>casing</b> is represented by an effective resistivity calculated from the water-filled slot volume and the PVC volume. Measurements with and without PVC <b>well</b> <b>casing</b> were made with a four-electrode EIT logging tool in a water-filled rain barrel. The initial comparison for the case that the logging tool was inserted in the PVC <b>well</b> <b>casing</b> showed a considerable mismatch between measured and modeled values. It was required to consider a complete electrode model instead of point electrodes to remove this mismatch. This validated model was used to investigate in detail how complex resistivity measurements with different electrode configurations are affected by borehole design.

50|$|A well cluster, also {{referred}} to as a monitoring well cluster, consists of multiple co-located monitoring wells that are constructed with intakes (well screens) at different depths in the subsurface. The purpose of a well cluster is to provide groundwater samples from discrete depths at approximately the same location. Also, water levels can be measured in each individual monitoring well, providing vertical profiles of groundwater pressure (hydraulic head). Well clusters are different from nested wells in that each monitoring well is constructed in a separate borehole, as opposed to multiple <b>well</b> <b>casings</b> in a single borehole which is the case with nested wells). A key advantage of a well cluster over a nested well is that there is less potential for vertical leakage and hydraulic short-circuiting because reliable annular seals are installed in each separate borehole in the cluster. However, well clusters require drilling multiple boreholes, which results in higher construction costs compared to nested wells. Economical alternatives to well clusters are multilevel groundwater monitoring systems, {{also referred}} to as engineered nested wells.|$|E
50|$|By December 6, 2013, Bertha had {{tunneled}} 1019 ft, or 11%, of {{the total}} 9270 ft length of the tunnel, stopping about 60 ft below ground between South Jackson Street and South Main Street. The machine's progress was halted on that day by an unexpected impediment. After a month's investigation, WSDOT announced that the machine's cutting blades had encountered an 8 in, 119 ft steel pipe, one of several <b>well</b> <b>casings</b> left over from a previous 2002 drilling project that had assessed groundwater conditions and soil stability {{in the area in}} case of another earthquake, such as the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, which led to a need for the replacing of the Alaskan Way Viaduct in the first place. Because the machine cannot cut through metal, the pipe damaged several of Bertha's cutting blades, necessitating blade replacement before the machine could proceed. The pipes' locations were known to WSDOT and the agency thought they had been removed. It is unclear whether the state agency or one of its contractors is responsible for the left-behind pipes, as well as who is responsible for allowing the tunneling to proceed without their removal.|$|E

30|$|The liquid layer {{outside a}} <b>well</b> <b>casing</b> {{develops}} from flaws along the cement–casing interface, {{which have been}} identified as leakage pathways in wellbores. The thickness of the liquid layer is one of the important parameters for determining cement bond quality. However, it is difficult to accurately determine the thickness of the liquid layer outside a <b>well</b> <b>casing</b> pipe with the traditional ultrasonic pulse echo method. To address this problem, we propose a novel inversion method for determining the thickness of the liquid layer between the casing and the cement sheath. According to test specimens, multi-layered structures are modeled to determine the overall reflected wave at the mud–casing interface. An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to simultaneously inverse the thicknesses of the liquid layer, the casing, and the annular space between the casing and formation. Using synthetic data, this algorithm is more robust and stable when compared with standard particle swarm optimization inversion procedures. In addition, the influences of noise in the reflected wave and deviations of medium parameters on the inversion results of the liquid layer thickness are discussed. Finally, the method was used to determine the thicknesses of the liquid layer in test specimens. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm provides an effective approach to accurately determine the thickness of the liquid layer outside a <b>well</b> <b>casing</b> pipe.|$|R

Electrical methods are well suited for monitoring processes involving fluids, as electrical properties are sensitive to the presence and nature of the formation fluids. High resolution tomographs of electrical properties are now possible using a 3 D technique called electrical resistance tomography (ERT). Surveys are commonly conducted utilizing vertical arrays of point electrodes in a cross-well configuration. Recent field results obtained using steel <b>well</b> <b>casings</b> as electrodes are promising. When 3 D ERT imaging can be performed using existing <b>well</b> <b>casings</b> as long electrodes, the need for additional drilling of observation wells is minimized. Using a model patterned after an oil field undergoing CO 2 flood, forward and inverse simulations of ERT surveys have been run to test the sensitivity of the method to changes resulting from CO 2 migration. Factors considered include resistivity contrast, anomaly proximity to electrodes, anomaly size and shape, measurement noise, and the electrode configuration used to perform the measurements. Field data suggest that CO 2 migration changes the resistivity of a layer, producing an anomalous region. In our numerical study, the anomalous region’s resistivity ranges from 0. 2 to 10 times that of the initial value.
