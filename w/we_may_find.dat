5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{works of}} art that exhibit traces {{of the influence of}} the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth “parking up” a horse exactly in the manner of figure W25 on the frieze. While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer {{to the end of the}} century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.|$|E

There is a Vergilian quality in the lines, haunting indeed, a pathos not mentioned {{because it is the}} whole of the story. I suppose that in Satan determining to destroy the innocent happiness of Eden, for the highest political motives, without hatred, not without tears, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> some echo of the Elizabethan fulness of life that Milton as a poet abandoned, and as a Puritan helped to destroy.|$|E
25|$|Mashrab (1640-1711) — an {{influential}} Sufi poet. Boborahim Mashrab {{was born in}} 1657. He went to Qashqar and increased his knowledge under supervision of Ofoq Hoja. From 1673 {{up to the end}} of his life he lived as a tramp. In 1711 he was murdered by hokim of Balh Mahmud Taragay. In M. Namangoniy`s “ Tazkiratul-avliyo”, I. Bogistoniy`s “Tazkirai-qalandaron”, M. Samarqandiy`s “Muzakkiri – ashob”, Hakimhon`s “Muhtabat – tavorih”, M. Olim`s “Ansobus-Salotin” <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> some information about his life and works. The Russian scientists N.I. Veselovskiy, N.S. Likoshin, V.L. Vyatkin expressed important ideas about Mashrab`s creative works in 19th and 20th centuries. Also some specialists in Uzbek literature such as I. Sulton, V. Zohidov, I. Muminov, G. Gulom, A.Hayitmetov, A. Abdugafurov, E. Shodiyev, V. Abdullayev expressed their own opinion about Mashrab’s life and creative activity. More detailed information we find in “Qissai Mashrab” by Pirmat Setoriy. This work has many manuscripts and copies.|$|E

25|$|Eclecticism is {{not open}} to the {{superficial}} objection of proceeding without a system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to objection, assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached all the possible elements in humanity and in history, and all their combinations. It may be asked, Can history have that which {{is not in the}} individual consciousness? In a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is there, and we ought not at once to impose that analysis or any formula on history. History is as likely to reveal to us in the first place true and original elements, and combinations of elements in man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order, whereas this may not at all be the case; but <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> at any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or co-operative, as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further, the question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up in the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be nonexistent or impossible.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics have}} been more skeptical {{of the concept of}} {{identifying}} the dreamer of the book's narrative.

Speculation about the 'real person' behind the guises of the dream-surrogates or about the function of the dream in relation to the unresolved stresses of this hypothetical mind is fruitless, for the tensions and psychological problems in Finnegans Wake concern the dream-figures living within the book itself." ...|$|E

[...] The party then met with three, ultimately critical, difficulties: the non-appearance of the dog teams, a large unexpected drop in temperature, [...] and a shortage of fuel in the depots. The low temperatures caused poor surfaces which Scott likened to [...] "pulling over desert sand"; he described the surface as [...] "coated with a thin layer of woolly crystals, formed by radiation no doubt. These are too firmly fixed to be removed by the wind and cause impossible friction on the [...] runners." [...] The low temperatures were accompanied by an absence of wind, something Scott had expected to assist them on their northern journey.|$|E

[...] By 10 March the temperature had dropped unexpectedly to below , and it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble." [...] With 400miles (670km) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward. In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated 16 March, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, whose toes had become frostbitten, voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E

In particular, if the curve is a plane projective algebraic curve, defined by a single homogeneous polynomial equation f(x,y,z)= 0, then the singular points are precisely the points P where the rank of the 1×(n+1) matrix is zero, that is, where ...|$|E

Although the vocal score gives not a hint of the uncanny brilliance of the orchestration, it demonstrates the sure footholds by which the music in a round dozen bars finds its way from D minor to A flat major and back and the shattering impact of the fortissimo chorus entry at an interrupted cadence on the chord of B flat major. The progressions that follow look to be unusual, but if we study them carefully we realise that here Sullivan is not feeling his way in unfamiliar territory.

2500|$|The Army of Tennessee {{continued}} withdrawing {{until it}} had crossed the last major water barrier before Atlanta, the Chattahoochee River. During this time, Hood had been sending the government in Richmond letters very critical of Johnston's conduct, bypassing official communication channels. The issue {{came to a head}} when Gen. Braxton Bragg was ordered by President Davis to travel to Atlanta to personally interview Johnston. After meeting with Johnston, he interviewed Hood and another subordinate, Joseph Wheeler, who told him that they had repeatedly urged Johnston to attack. Hood presented a letter that branded Johnston as being both ineffective and weak-willed. He told Bragg, [...] "I have, General, so often urged that we should force the enemy to give us battle as to almost be regarded reckless by the officers high in rank in this army , since their views have been so directly opposite." [...] Johnston's biographer, Craig L. Symonds, judges that Hood's letter [...] "stepped over the line from unprofessional to outright subversive." [...] Civil War historian Steven E. Woodworth wrote that Hood was [...] "letting his ambition get the better of his honesty" [...] because [...] "the truth was that Hood, more often than Hardee, had counseled Johnston to retreat." [...] However, Hood was not alone in his criticism of Johnston's timidity. In William Hardee's June 22, 1864, letter to General Bragg, he stated, [...] "If the present system continues <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> ourselves at Atlanta before a serious battle is fought."
