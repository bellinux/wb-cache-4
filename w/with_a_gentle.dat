5|$|Viewed {{from the}} top, the parietal {{increases}} in width at the back; {{the increase is}} small in K. langenbergensis, such that the bone is overall rectangular, but the difference is larger in K. guimarotae. The back of the bone bears a small notch in K. langenbergensis and a general concavity in K. guimarotae that slightly exposes the underlying supraoccipital. The postorbital bears two branches that join <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentle</b> curve, separated by an angle of 130° in K. langenbergensis. The supratemporal fenestra is roughly square in K. guimarotae but has a thinner back end in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the maximum distance between the supratemporal fenestrae is {{about a third of}} the total width of the top of the skull. The trapezoidal infratemporal fenestra is 1.5 times as long as it is wide in K. langenbergensis.|$|E

25|$|Frying pans, frypans or skillets {{provide a}} large flat heating surface and shallow sides, and {{are best for}} pan frying. Frypans <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentle,</b> rolling slope are {{sometimes}} called omelette pans. Grill pans are frypans that are ribbed, to let fat drain away from the food being cooked. Frypans and grill pans are generally sized by diameter (20–30cm).|$|E

25|$|Error {{diffusion}} {{tries to}} ensure the error on average is minimized. When dealing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentle</b> slope from one to zero the output would be zero {{for the first few}} terms until the sum of the error and the current value becomes greater than 0.5, in which case a 1 is output and the difference subtracted from the error so far. Floyd–Steinberg dithering is a popular error diffusion procedure when digitising images.|$|E
25|$|The {{main source}} of income for the studio however {{remained}} its studio work, in which Josef Jindřich excelled: despite the provincial location of the studio, his works were comparable with those of the best Czech portrait studios. His work is influenced by photographic pictorialism.

His skilful use of light and contrast with shadows achieved stunning visual effects.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} shield volcanoes {{can be found}} in {{selected}} locations on the lunar surface, such as on Mons Rümker. These are believed to be formed by relatively viscous, possibly silica-rich lava, erupting from localized vents. The resulting lunar domes are wide, rounded, circular features <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentle</b> slope rising in elevation a few hundred meters to the midpoint. They are typically 8–12km in diameter, but can be up to 20km across. Some of the domes contain a small pit at their peak.|$|E

25|$|A {{wrought iron}} fence {{runs along the}} south and east sides. At the three main entrances, and the {{southeast}} and northeast corners, are two limestone pillars topped with stone orbs. The southern third of the cemetery is generally flat, with axial roads radiating outward from the Woodward mausoleum near the southeast entrance. In the northern and central portions, the landscape becomes hillier, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentle</b> descent to the creek. The roads there curve with the landscape. Throughout, the cemetery is planted with mature trees and shrubs from a variety of species.|$|E
25|$|The general {{appearance}} of the Sheltie {{is that of a}} miniature Rough Collie. They are a small, double coated, working dog, agile and sturdy. Blue merle Shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye, but all others have dark colored eyes. Their expression should be that of alertness <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentle</b> and sometimes reserved nature. They are often very good with children. They carry their tail down low, only lifted when alert and never carried over the back. They are an intensely loyal breed, sometimes reserved with strangers but should not be shy or showing timidness as per the AKC breed standard.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{topography}} {{of the city}} {{could be described as}} rolling to very steep. There are some flat lands, mostly narrow strips along the east coast. The urban center is mostly flat <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentle</b> slope to the interior, ranging from 0 to 3%. The highest registered elevation is 1,200 metres. In terms of slope, a large portion of Zamboanga City, about 38,000 hectares, have slopes ranging from 18 to 30%. Another 26,000 hectares have been described as having slopes pf less than 3% while about 37% of the area or a total of 52,000 hectares have slopes ranging from 30% to more than 50%.|$|E

25|$|The English Springer Spaniel is a {{medium-sized}} compact dog. Its coat is moderately long with feathering on {{the legs and}} tail. It is a well proportioned, balanced dog <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentle</b> expression and a friendly wagging tail. This breed represents perhaps the greatest divergence between working and show lines of any breed of dog. A field-bred dog and a show-bred dog appear to be different breeds, but are registered together. In fact, the gene pools are almost completely segregated and have been for at least 70 years. A field-bred dog would not be competitive in a modern dog show, while a show dog {{would not have the}} speed or stamina to succeed in a field trial.|$|E
25|$|He would {{frequently}} visit faculties of Hamdard University including student events.7,8 He personally {{greeted the}} first and second year medical students of Hamdard College of Medicine and Dentistry and presented them with a document bag and a stethoscope, along-with his personal letter. Shaheed Hakim Mohammed Said's last public appearance at an HCMD function was on 23 September 1998 at Pearl Continental Hotel, Karachi. He enjoyed the show and mingled with students, parents and guests at a round table dinner.9 Shaheed Hakim Mohammed Said's speeches at such occasional were concise, interesting, educational and to the point. At one point in the function, students requested him to grant them the following day off, since the hour was getting late. As the chant from some 600 attendees gathered rhythm, he approved <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentle</b> nod. His favorite topics at some of the student events included healthy diet, medical ethics, contentment, self-control, benefits of fasting and hard work.|$|E
25|$|Like the harpsichord, the virginals has {{its origins}} in the medieval psaltery to which a {{keyboard}} was applied, probably in the 15th century. The first mention of the word is in Paulus Paulirinus of Prague's (1413–1471) Tractatus de musica of around 1460 where he writes: The virginal is an instrument {{in the shape of}} a clavichord, having metal strings which give it the timbre of a clavicembalo. It has 32 courses of strings set in motion by striking the fingers on projecting keys, giving a dulcet tone in both whole and half steps. It is called a virginal because, like a virgin, it sounds <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentle</b> and undisturbed voice. The OED records its first mention in English in 1530, when King Henry VIII purchased five instruments so named. Small early virginals were played either in the lap, or more commonly, rested on a table, but nearly all later examples were provided with their own stands.|$|E

Climb {{first to the}} secondary summit, An Coileach (The Cockerel), then follow the whaleback ridge to the primary summit, Sgurr Mhairi (Mary's Peak). Once An Coileach is reached at 673 m, the more-or-less level ridge allows some respite from the gradient, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentler</b> ascent of the final 102 m to Sgurr Mhairi.|$|R
25|$|The {{valley floor}} is {{an expanse of}} plains crossed {{by a number of}} small rivers, streams and arroyos, with the most {{significant}} being the Atoyac River. The Atoyac River has its beginning in the runoff of both the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatepetl volcanoes. The area has an average altitude of 2,190masl, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentle</b> descent from northwest to southeast along the Atoyac River. There are two main elevations: the Zapotecas Mountain, which rises about 200 meters over the valley and the Tecajetes, which rises 210 meters. There is mountain biking and motocross on the Zapotecas Mountain as well as parasailing at the San Bernardino Chalchilhuapan Mountain. Each year, there is a mountain biking event just north of the city in March in three categories: beginners, advanced and expert. The race begins from the main plaza of Cholula and extends for 50km through a number of small communities. The Zapotecas Mountain is important culturally as well, figuring in a number of local myths and legends, including one about a man who made a pact with a demon in order to obtain money to sponsor a religious festival.|$|E
