50|$|Three main strains are recognised: Antiqua, <b>which</b> <b>caused</b> {{a plague}} {{pandemic}} in the 6th century; Medievalis, <b>which</b> <b>caused</b> the Black Death and subsequent epidemics {{during the second}} pandemic wave; and Orientalis, {{which is responsible for}} the current plague outbreaks.|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{found that}} the pitot heads had ice damage <b>which</b> <b>caused</b> the crew to receive {{incorrect}} airspeed readings. The crew, believing the readings were true, pulled back on the control column and raised the nose, <b>which</b> <b>caused</b> the aircraft to stall.|$|R
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} can manifest {{similarly to}} other diseases, {{which must be}} ruled out when making a diagnosis. These include tuberous sclerosis, <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically and pneumothorax and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care.|$|E

50|$|As the Ice sheets {{began to}} {{increase}} the weathering of the basaltic and silicate rocks decreased, <b>which</b> <b>caused</b> CO2 levels to rise again, this in turned helped push deglaciation. This deglaciation cause the basaltic weathering to start back up <b>which</b> <b>caused</b> glaciation to occur again.|$|R
5|$|Most {{destruction}} {{was due to}} Isidore, <b>which</b> <b>caused</b> about $970million (2002USD, $ USD) {{in damage}} and killed seven people in the Yucatán Peninsula and later the United States, and Hurricane Lili, <b>which</b> <b>caused</b> $860million (2002USD) in damage and 15 deaths when it made landfall in Louisiana.|$|R

5|$|Agnew {{suffers from}} Dupuytren's contracture, a medical {{condition}} that affects the connective tissue in his hands. He has had numerous operations to address the progressive condition, <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> the hands to contract into a claw-like position.|$|E
5|$|An anti-mutant {{politician}} {{who wishes to}} ban mutant children from schools using a Mutant Registration Act. He is kidnapped by Magneto in a test of his mutation machine, <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> his body {{to turn into a}} liquid-like substance. He dies before Jean could save him.|$|E

5|$|At {{the next}} soccer game, Brendon's team plays poorly, and an {{opposing}} player injures Brendon, <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> McGuirk {{to yell at}} the referee.

5|$|August 17, 1994– While {{crossing}} the western {{portion of the}} state, Tropical Depression Beryl spawns nine tornadoes and drops heavy rainfall, peaking at 13.8inches (351mm) in Transylvania County <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> some flooding.|$|E
5|$|August 17, 1995– Hurricane Felix {{makes its}} closest point of {{approach}} to the state, <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> high surf and rip currents; three people are killed from the surf, and severe beach erosion is reported.|$|E

In addition, State Route 7 was closed for several hours due to flooding.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently {{with these}} processes, the {{activity}} of mitochondria may be reduced, <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> cells to rely on anaerobic metabolism to produce energy, increasing levels of the byproduct lactate.|$|E
5|$|Cytotoxic drugs {{inhibit the}} immune {{response}} by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells. However, the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected, <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> toxic side effects. Immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} cyclosporin prevent T cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways.|$|E

5|$|Heart {{conditions}} such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which {{is a type of}} abnormal heart beating <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a recessive gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing the dog to have extremely low energy and be unable to exercise. The gene <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{found that}} the flightcrew had not {{activated}} the pitot head heaters and the pitot tubes had become blocked with ice <b>which</b> <b>caused</b> the crew to receive incorrect airspeed readings.
