6000|$|It was the entrans of Parrowdice {{to me and}} master: and as {{we entered}} the calm water, and saw the comfrabble lights gleaming in the houses, and felt the roal of the vessel degreasing, never was two mortials gladder, I warrant, than we were. At length our capting drew up at the key, and our journey was down. But such a bustle and clatter, such jabbering, such shrieking and swaring, such <b>wollies</b> of oafs and axicrations as saluted us on landing, I never knew! We were boarded, in the fust place, by custom-house {{officers}} in cock-hats, who seased our luggitch, and called for our passpots: then a crowd of inn-waiters came, tumbling and screaming on deck--"Dis way, sare," [...] cries one; [...] "Hotel Meurice," [...] says another; [...] "Hotel de Bang," [...] screeches another chap--the tower of Babyle was nothink to it. The fust thing that struck me on landing was a big fellow with ear-rings, who very nigh knock me down, in wrenching master's carpet-bag out of my hand, as I was carrying it to the hotell. But we got to it safe at last; and, for the fust time in my life, I slep in a foring country.|$|R
2500|$|Burke herself {{described}} the song as [...] "reggae meets R." [...] According to the singer, {{the song was}} inspired by her British Jamaican background and new convertible. Burke told The Sun, [...] "I really {{wanted to have a}} tune I could take down my roof to, drive along and be proud of. I didn't really want to do a ballad. I love the summer and this is the perfect track to dance to." [...] "Start Without You" [...] is an uptempo R song which draws from reggae fusion and dancehall influences, with a length of three minutes and thirty-three seconds, penned by RedOne, Bilal Hajji, Savan Kotecha, and Julian Bunetta. It is infused with power pop melodies in the chorus. Many critics have noted the song's resemblance to a nursery rhyme, that is Polly <b>Wolly</b> Doodle, but the mood reminds of Boney M's Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday.|$|E

6000|$|... "Anne dearie, {{they had}} a CONCERT IN THE GRAVEYARD last Thursday evening, while the Methodist prayer meeting was going on. There they sat, on Hezekiah Pollock's tombstone, and sang for a solid hour. Of course, I {{understand}} it was mostly hymns they sang, and it wouldn't have been quite so bad if they'd done nothing else. But I'm told they finished up with Polly <b>Wolly</b> Doodle at full length--and that just when Deacon Baxter was praying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} found that Methodism was catching," [...] {{retorted}} Susan stiffly. [...] "And, as I {{was going to}} say when I was interrupted, badly as I felt, I did NOT give in to the Methodists. When Mrs. Deacon Baxter said, as we came out, 'What a disgraceful exhibition!' I said, looking her fairly in the eye, 'They are all beautiful singers, and none of YOUR choir, Mrs. Baxter, ever bother themselves coming out to your prayer meeting, it seems. Their voices appear to be in tune only on Sundays!' She was quite meek and I felt that I had snubbed her properly. But I could have done it much more thoroughly, Mrs. Dr. dear, if only they had left out Polly <b>Wolly</b> Doodle. It is truly terrible to think of that being sung in a graveyard." ...|$|E
