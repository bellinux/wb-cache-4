500|$|Gauguin's figure {{seems to}} invoke the Polynesian goddess Hina, {{depicted}} by Morice as a Diana-like deity clutching a wolf cub, [...] "monstrous and majestic, drunk with pride, rage and sorrow". He titled an 1894 self-portrait in plaster as Oviri. The original is lost {{but a number of}} bronze casts survive. He used double mirrors to capture his familiar Inca profile, the result reprising his Jug in the Form of a Head, Self-Portrait. This was one of the earliest occasions Gauguin applied the term Oviri to himself. [...] "Gauguin sometimes also referred to himself as Oviri, the savage...", writes Merete Bodelsen. The Stuttgart version of his 1892 oil painting E haere oe i hia (<b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Going?)</b> depicts a woman clutching a wolf cub. Pollitt remarks that this stocky, sculptural and androgynous figure gives a first glimpse of Oviri.|$|E

2500|$|Hikari was {{a strong}} {{influence}} on Father, <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>Going?,</b> Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness, and The Day He Himself Shall Wipe My Tears Away, three novels which rework the same premise—the father of a disabled son attempts to recreate the life of his own father, who shut himself away and died.
