5|$|Once the {{recording}} sessions {{got off the}} ground, Priestess encountered another problem – {{this time with the}} law. The band were working in a house in a neighborhood, and the close proximity to other houses meant that they had to keep the amount of noise generated to a minimum. They had been assured that the house had not previously been served with noise violations of any kind, but after they had finished recording drums and many of the guitar parts, they learned that they had the volume set too high when working on the bass guitar tracks; law enforcement came to the door and forced them to take their work elsewhere because they <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> neighboring houses with the noise they were generating. The band did so with no objection, quickly moving their equipment to another studio, although they recalled the incident rather humorously later. Schiffman was able to arrange for the group to use another facility as early as the following day, and the band moved production to that new location the night of the incident. The sessions were completed in November 2008.|$|E

500|$|Two new sets {{of parents}} are {{introduced}} during the episode. Emma's parents, Rose and Rusty Pillsbury, are played by Valerie Mahaffey and Don Most. Mays {{was very excited}} when she learned Most, who played Ralph Malph on the 1970s sitcom Happy Days, had been cast, and exclaimed, [...] "What? He's my father?!" [...] Both Most and Mahaffey were so funny during the shooting of their sequence {{that she had to}} apologize for causing a portion to have to be reshot, telling them, [...] "I'm so sorry, the back of my shoulders <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> because I was laughing so hard." ...|$|E

Back in the Top Gear studio, co-presenter Jeremy Clarkson commented that most supercars felt like they <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> apart at their top speed, and asked May {{if that was the}} case with the Veyron at [...] May responded that the Veyron was very controlled, and only wobbled slightly when the air brake deployed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{magazine}} hired Robert Capa, {{the distinguished}} war photographer. A veteran of Collier's magazine, Capa accompanied {{the first wave}} of the D-Day invasion in Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944. A mishap at the Life photography darkroom ruined dozens of Capa's photos which he had taken during the beach landing. [...] The magazine wrote in the captions that the photos were fuzzy because Capa's hands <b>were</b> <b>shaking.</b> He denied it, and later poked fun at Life by titling his war memoir Slightly Out of Focus (1947). In 1954, Capa was killed after stepping on a landmine, while working for the magazine covering the First Indochina War. Life photographer Bob Landry also went in with the first wave at D-Day, [...] "but all of Landry's film was lost, and his shoes to boot." ...|$|E

2500|$|All {{three were}} {{fired by the}} ideals of liberty {{and the rights of}} man. Rambling across the countryside, they talked of poetry, philosophy, and the {{political}} movements that <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> up the old order. This unity of spirit was not to last: Hazlitt himself would recall disagreeing with Wordsworth on the philosophical underpinnings of his projected poem The Recluse, just as he had earlier been amazed that Coleridge could dismiss David Hume, {{regarded as one of the}} greatest philosophers of that century, as a charlatan. Nonetheless, the experience impressed on the young Hazlitt, at 20, the sense that not only philosophy, to which he had devoted himself, but also poetry warranted appreciation for what it could teach, and the three-week visit stimulated him to pursue his own thinking and writing. Coleridge, on his part, using an archery metaphor, later revealed that he had been highly impressed by Hazlitt's promise as a thinker: [...] "He sends well-headed and well-feathered Thoughts straight forwards to the mark with a Twang of the Bow-string." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2003, EastEnders made {{headlines}} in the UK press after they screened a kiss between Kelly and Zoe. The storyline was featured in a New Year's Eve episode that was filmed on-location in Scotland. In the storyline, a group of teenagers travel from London to Scotland for New Year's Eve, but their minibus crashes, leaving them stranded and injured on the freezing cold Scottish moors. While stranded, Kelly cares for an injured Zoe, they become over-emotional, and kiss. Kinsella explained the reasons behind the kiss: [...] "They're stuck in the hills, thinking they're going to die—it's {{a way of saying}} goodbye and also of showing how much they love each other as friends. Which is quite sweet really." [...] She claimed that the kiss was made easier {{due to the fact that}} she was kissing her off-screen best friend: [...] "That made it so much easier. We thought we were just going to be laughing and giggling the whole way through, but we were very professional. It was so cold that we just wanted to get it over with. We <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> from cold—not from nerves—and it was raining, so we just thought, 'Let's do it and get it done with'. [...] We laugh about it now. When it came down to it, the truth was that it was just like any other screen kiss." [...] The episode featuring their kiss attracted [...] 9.5million viewers, and the precise moment that they kissed was watched by 44% of the available viewing audience.|$|E
