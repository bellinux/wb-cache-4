5|$|Another taxon that Czerkas {{assigned}} to the pterosauria and named Utahdactylus was reviewed by Dr. Chris Bennett. Bennett found multiple misidentifications of bones and inconsistencies between Czerkas' diagrams and the actual fossils. Bennett found the specimen to be an indeterminate diapsid and criticized the previous authors for publishing a species name <b>when</b> <b>no</b> diagnostic characters below the class level could be verified. He made Utahdactylus a nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the {{dreadnought}} design had {{not been}} fully validated, despite {{the success of the}} British namesake; for example, there were still concerns that the Minas Geraes class' superfiring turret arrangement—which {{had not been}} utilized on the original Dreadnought, but was also being installed on the American —would cause blast to hurt the crew in the lower turret. Any immediate concerns, however, were mitigated during the firing tests <b>when</b> <b>no</b> ill effects were observed, though the Times (London) reported that there were still concerns registered during São Paulos gun trials in June 1910.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{election}} polling, Shumlin's large financial advantage and the state's strong Democratic lean, Shumlin {{was expected to}} win easily, but he received only a plurality, not a majority, of the vote and polled only 2,434 votes more than Milne out of 193,087 cast. The Constitution of Vermont requires that the 180-member Vermont General Assembly choose the winner <b>when</b> <b>no</b> candidate receives over 50% of the popular vote. On January 8, 2015, the Assembly chose Shumlin over Milne {{by a vote of}} 110 to 69, with one abstention.|$|E

These locomotives cost an average of £10,659 for the first five and £10,838 each for the second five. The names of the cities in this batch were in strict alphabetical order.

5|$|In 1823, Wickliffe {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives and served five {{consecutive}} terms. Again he succeeded his cousin and friend, Ben Hardin.

5|$|In {{the thirteenth}} {{stage of the}} 1967 Tour de France, Simpson {{collapsed}} and died during the ascent of Mont Ventoux. He was 29 years old. The post-mortem examination found that he had mixed amphetamines and alcohol; this diuretic combination proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and a stomach complaint. A memorial near where he died has become a place of pilgrimage for many cyclists. Simpson was known to have taken performance-enhancing drugs during his career, <b>when</b> <b>no</b> doping controls existed.

5|$|The Eretrian {{strategy}} was to defend their walls, and undergo a siege.
