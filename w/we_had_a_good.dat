He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E

We wanted to rekindle that relationship," [...] and [...] "pranks are a big element of the Caltech culture.... We’re just a small institution, but we feel that our impact is really bigger than our size. We do cool stuff because we can." ...|$|E
500|$|The orchestra's {{principal}} flute player, Donald Peck, {{commented that}} the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: [...] "some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> match with Solti and he with us." [...] Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, [...] "Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse. He is very tense at rehearsals, which makes us concentrate, but relaxed during the performance, which is a great asset to the orchestra." [...] Peck recalled Solti's constant efforts to improve his own technique and interpretations, at one point experimentally dispensing with a baton, drawing a [...] "darker and deeper, much more relaxed" [...] tone from the players.|$|E

It's a great idea, well executed. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> cast; Tony Todd was wonderful" [...] and {{saying it was}} [...] "beautifully {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. Entertainment Weekly rated [...] "Sleepless" [...] with a B+, considering that Tony Todd's performance [...] "elevates a just-good story into a great one." [...] John Keegan Critical Myth gave the episode 7 out of 10, saying it was best remembered for its introduction of Alex Krycek. The web site further stated that the episode was decent and was a [...] "fairly standard exploration" [...] for the early season episodes. Dave Golder from SFX named the episode one of the [...] "20 TV Sci-Fi Gamechangers" [...] due to its introduction of Krycek.|$|E
500|$|Daft Punk {{produced}} the tracks included in Homework without {{a plan to}} release an album. Bangalter stated, [...] "It {{was supposed to be}} just a load of singles. But we did so many tracks over a period of five months that we realized that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> album." [...] The duo set the order of the tracks to cover the four sides of a two-disc vinyl LP. De Homem-Christo remarked, [...] "There was no intended theme because all the tracks were recorded before we arranged the sequence of the album. The idea was to make the songs better by arranging them the way we did; to make it more even as an album." [...] The name Homework, Bangalter explained, relates to [...] "the fact that we made the record at home, very cheaply, very quickly, and spontaneously, trying to do cool stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1935, {{at the age}} of 18, Anderson {{left her}} Brisbane home to live in Sydney. Despite the fact that she spent her {{childhood}} in Queensland, she stated in interviews that she felt more affinity with Sydney, the city where she was to spend the bulk of her adult life. There she subsisted on wages from a number of sources, including a slide-painting job, and a job designing electric signs, where she was able to make use of her art school training, and later from work in shops and factories. She and her friends lived at Potts Point in [...] "big seedy decaying mansions with gardens running right down to the harbour." [...] In a city still recovering from the ravages of The Great Depression, life for Anderson was not altogether easy: [...] "Times were very hard," [...] she recalled; [...] "People were poor, but very free. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> life." ...|$|E

(The record stood until major league seasons were {{lengthened}} to 162 games, {{and it has}} been surpassed twice since then.) Lemon was named Cleveland's starter for game one of the 1954 World Series. After nine innings, the Indians and Giants were tied 2–2. Lemon stayed in the game to pitch the tenth and final inning, but he surrendered a three-run home run to pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes and the Indians lost, 5–2. Indians manager Al López went with Lemon again in the fourth game after only two days rest. [...] "He hasn't worked that close together all year because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> bunch of other pitchers, but a year ago, he and Wynn and Garcia pitched every third day for practically a month. Bob will be all right", Lopez said. Lemon and the Indians lost the game, 7–4, as the Giants swept the Series four games to none. In his two appearances, he went 0–2 with a 6.75ERA, allowed eight walks and recorded 11 strikeouts.|$|E
500|$|McCready {{said that}} a lot of the songs were {{developed}} out of jam sessions, and said [...] "I think we kind of rushed it a little bit." [...] Ament said that the band members would bring in fragments of songs, and it would take hours before Vedder could have music to which he could add vocals. He added that [...] "Ed's typically the guy who finishes off the songs...But by the end of No Code, he was so burnt, it was so much work for him." [...] The band's mood had gotten better by the time the album was finished, and the bandmembers gave credit for this to Irons. Regarding Irons, O'Brien stated that [...] "everybody was on their best musical behavior around him." [...] McCready said that Irons urged the band members to discuss their problems, and called him [...] "a big spiritual influence, if not the biggest." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Making No Code was all about gaining perspective." [...] Commenting upon the sessions as a whole, O'Brien said, [...] "It was really a transitional record. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time making it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel Powell and {{directed}} by Aaron Augenblick. Series creator Devin Clark said that they planned on giving it a summer theme since they knew it would air in the summer. Clark further elaborated on the decision to incorporate summer and Harry Potter themes into the episode, stating: [...] "We went, 'alright, those are two little nuggets of ideas we can incorporate into that.' We can't be as relevant to pop culture as some other shows, but it just means {{we have a little}} more of a challenge of making jokes that are a little more evergreen and poking fun of the genre in a much broader spectrum." [...] Screenwriter Powell explained that it is difficult for the series to do [...] "topical stuff" [...] as it takes up to nine months to complete an episode, but they were {{aware of the fact that}} the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 would premiere shortly after the episode was set to air. [...] "So it would seem like we were hyper-topical, even though <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> nine months advance notice", he said. Powell said that they included famous wizards from many other sources, including The Lord of the Rings and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In an interview with Charles Webb of MTV, Clark elaborated: [...] "We make it a hodgepodge of the wizard references and obviously the main one is, and the most prominent one and the one that's most relevant to pop culture is the Harry Potter spoof that we've thrown in there.|$|E

2500|$|Lea also {{revealed}} in a 1976 fan club interview: [...] "We {{just got a}} terrific buzz when {{we were working on}} the album. We were more relaxed than we've ever been, more willing and able to be more experimental in the studios, and we took it easy and relaxed. Certainly we felt <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> product in the making, so it seemed right to put everything we had into it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mitchel {{claimed that}} {{slaves in the}} {{southern}} United States were better cared for and fed than Irish cottiers, or industrial workers in English cities like Manchester. He was explicitly racist, saying negroes were [...] "an innately inferior people" [...] and opining [...] "We deny {{that it is a}} crime, or a wrong, or even a peccadillo to hold slaves, to buy slaves, to keep slaves to their work by flogging or other needful correction. We wish <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> plantation well-stocked with healthy negroes in Alabama." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{thing that}} makes it {{resemble}} our earlier records, especially our first record, is that it's really personal. A couple of us have gone through some pretty serious life changes. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> friend of ours pass away since the last record. There's a song on the record, [...] "Dorothy", that was really influenced by the film Blue Velvet but it's a metaphor for someone and something else. Everything on the record is stuff that definitely hits close to home for us {{and we tried to}} communicate that in the songs.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Nas {{announced}} that he would release collaboration albums with Mobb Deep, Common, and a third with DJ Premier. Common said of the project in a 2011 interview, [...] "At some point, we will do that. We'd talked about it and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea to call it Nas.Com. That was actually going to be a mixtape at one point. But we decided that we should make it an album." [...] Life is Good would be nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards.|$|E
2500|$|I was twenty-four. We did {{not give}} too much thought {{to the people who}} were not given the opportunities. In {{hindsight}} we certainly could have done much more in trying to get change to Southern Africa. [...] <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> series against Australia in '67 and we probably had our best side ever. [...] Poor old Barry (Richards) played just four Tests, Mike Procter seven. But at the same time [...] got it absolutely right that the way to bring about change in South Africa was in sport. It was difficult for twenty-two years ... but in hindsight it was needed and I'm delighted it did achieve change in South Africa.|$|E

We went to our friends and told them we had been fired on by the soldiers, and they surrounded the train and we had a fight with them. I do not know how many we killed of the soldiers, but they killed four of us. After that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> many battles, but I did not take any scalps for a good while. I cannot tell how many I killed when a young man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sussex lawyer John Baker, {{a regular}} spectator at Georgian matches, {{described}} {{some of them}} in his diary. One is the All-England v Hampshire game in July 1772 which Baker attended with his parson friend, John Woodward. He writes that Hambledon was already batting when they arrived. It was a cheerful scene and [...] "the Basin on Merrow Down" [...] was ringed by a big crowd of spectators, most of them standing. Indeed, contemporary paintings of matches show no sign of seating accommodation for the ordinary folk. The local publicans were doing good business in their booths, some of them rented by the local nobility and thus the equivalent of the present-day sponsors’ tents or boxes. As in our own times, the occupants were often more interested in the food and drink than in the cricket. Guildford had fixed up a small grandstand [...] "with benches above one another over his booth below", but it was already full. Baker then talks about [...] "finding a small booth where <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> cold dinner and good cider and ale". He says this was better and cheaper than the one they had on the following day in the White Hart booth.|$|E
2500|$|After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, John Sayer, {{a member}} St Peter's {{congregation}} was appointed chief cook to King Charles II. Sayer was {{a wealthy man}} and lived in Berkhamsted Place and benefactor of the town. He was known to Samuel Pepys, who wrote of him in his Diary. In 1661, Pepys wrote [...] "...I went with Captain Morrice at his desire into the King's Privy Kitchen to Mr. Sayres, the Master Cook, and there <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> slice of beef or two to our breakfast, and from thence he took us into the wine cellar where, by my troth, we were very merry, and I drank too much wine, and all along had great and particular kindness from Mr. Sayres, but I drank so much wine that I was not fit for business." [...] Upon his death in 1682, John Sayer left £1000 in his will {{for the construction of}} a row of almshouses on Berkhamsted High Street, containing twelve rooms for the habitation of six poor widows. The endowment also provided for a weekly allowance of two shillings and a fuel allowance for each widow. The almshouses, which are still in existence today, were completed in 1684 and bear an inscription on the front, [...] "A gift of John Sayer, 1684". Sayer's elaborate marble tomb stands in the Lady chapel of St Peter's.|$|E
