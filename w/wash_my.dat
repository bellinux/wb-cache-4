500|$|The primary filming {{location}} {{was an early}} 1900s farmhouse located on Quick Hill Road near Round Rock, Texas, where the La Frontera development is now located. The small budget and concerns over high-cost equipment rentals meant the crew filmed seven days a week, up to 16 hours a day. The environment was humid and {{the cast and crew}} found conditions tough; temperatures peaked at 110°F (43°C) on July 26. Hansen later recalled, [...] "It was 95, 100 degrees every day during filming. They wouldn't <b>wash</b> <b>my</b> costume because they were worried that the laundry might lose it, or that it would change color. They didn't have enough money for a second costume.

500|$|The {{definite}} singular {{form of a}} noun {{is created}} by adding a suffix (-en, -n, -et or -t), depending on its gender and if the noun ends in a vowel or not. The definite articles den, det, and de are used for variations to the definitiveness of a noun. They can double as demonstrative pronouns or demonstrative determiners when used with adverbs such as här ("here") or där ("there") to form den/det här (can also be [...] "denna/detta") ("this"), de här (can also be [...] "dessa") ("these"), den/det där ("that"), and de där ("those"). For example, den där fisken means [...] "that fish" [...] and refers to a specific fish; den fisken is less definite and means [...] "that fish" [...] in a more abstract sense, such as that set of fish; while fisken means [...] "the fish". In certain cases, the definite form indicates possession, e.g., jag måste tvätta håret ("I must <b>wash</b> <b>my</b> hair").|$|E

2500|$|Making {{a circuit}} around the bimah on Sukkot while each person holds the four species {{in his hands}} has its origin in the Temple service, as {{recorded}} in the Mishnah: [...] "It was customary to make one procession around the altar on each day of Sukkot, and seven on the seventh day" [...] (Sukkah 4:5). The priests carried the palm branches or willows in their hands. The entire ceremony is to demonstrate rejoicing and gratitude for a blessed and fruitful year. Moreover, it serves {{to tear down the}} iron wall that separates us from our Father in Heaven, as the wall of Jericho was encompassed [...] "and the wall fell down flat" [...] (Joshua 6:20). Furthermore, the seven circuits correspond to the seven words in the verse Erhatz benikayon kappay, va'asovevah et mizbahakha Hashem - [...] "I <b>wash</b> <b>my</b> hands in purity and circle around Your altar, O Lord" [...] (Psalms 26:6).|$|E
2500|$|Habib {{was raised}} in a female environment, his {{brothers}} being in Tunis and his father being old. Therefore, he spent his days with his mother, grandmother and sisters, Aïsha and Nejia, which permitted him to witness the household chores of women and the gender inequality with men. Bourguiba recounted his childhood in these words: [...] "I was the youngest of all. As such, I was responsible for all chores. I was, in short, a domestic. I was responsible for keeping the jug and pour water on the hands of my elders, after meals. But I was the elder of nobody, and I had to manage all by own with the hudge container in order to <b>wash</b> <b>my</b> hands". Another fact also marked the childhood of Habib Bourguiba: Being the youngest of the family, he had to address his elders, including his brothers with the word [...] "Sidi" [...] (ser). However, the designation of his sisters was a problem of protocol. Even though they were older, their female gender did not give them a right of presence on young Habib. His father Ali, soon found {{a solution to the problem}} arguing that they had to call themselves with their respective first name, [...] "no other difference hallmark". The young Habib soon noticed the low status of women in the beginning of the century.|$|E
