We were punks and heavy metal was alien to our upbringing. And other bands we heard like Venom, Slaughter and Metallica.

[...] This was disproved in Cruft's memoirs, published posthumously in Charles Cruft's Dog Book in 1952, where Cruft explained that he had lived in households which had Alsatians and Borzois. He went on to make particular reference {{to the fact that he}} and his wife Emma had owned at least one Saint Bernard; the same breed of dog he had used in his creation of the Crufts logo.|$|E
500|$|Visual Effects Supervisor Tim Burke {{said that}} [...] "It {{was such a}} major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, {{and we had to}} do it in {{different}} stages of production.

So, <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "It's taken two years– getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas." ...|$|E

Instead, Lopez filmed her close-up shots in Los Angeles, while a body double was used for the car scenes through The Bronx. Fiat and Lopez were slammed for false advertising Lopez's return to The Bronx. Fiat released a statement stating: [...] "Both commercials featuring Jennifer Lopez were indeed filmed in the Bronx as well as outside locations. As you may know, in today's world, people are increasingly mobile and their work takes them to a variety of locations. As a result, <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to film wherever Ms. Lopez was working at the time to accommodate her schedule.

[...] He refused to discuss the suspension of Matić, dismissing it with [...] "If I speak to you about that, I promise you I will be in big trouble". Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names.

Sylvester Stallone was also {{revealed to be}} in the film, with his role later revealed as Stakar Ogord. Gunn also introduced multiple actors who were playing Ravager characters, since the Ravagers have a larger presence in the film. On the decision to reveal Russell as Ego and Quill's father when he did, Gunn felt that since [...] "people were going to figure it out eventually… it was better that <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> reins in our own hands" [...] and make the reveal. Gunn also felt that this would move the focus of audiences from wanting to discov er who Quill's father is to [...] "the story and the relationship that these characters have". In August 2016, Gunn confirmed the film would feature a post-credits scene, later stating there would be five in total, with four mid-credits scenes and one post-credits. Gunn also planned a sixth scene, where the Ravager Gef is found [...] "mortally wounded" [...] on the ship, but [...] "it ended up being a little confusing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Their third single, [...] "Everybody Needs Love", {{became the}} group's first American charted single in two years, {{reaching}} number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number three R after its release in 1967.

[...] In Knight's autobiography, Between Each Line of Pain and Glory: My Life Story, she stated that Diana Ross had the group removed from being The Supremes' opening act on a 1968 tour for, according to Knight, being too good. The group finally scored a career breakthrough with their fourth Motown single, [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine", which reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and {{number one on the}} R charts. The group's recording became Motown's best-selling single ever to that point, selling over 2.5 million copies. Marvin Gaye's version of the song, released in 1968, outsold the group's version, selling four million copies and reaching number one on the Hot 100.

2500|$|Prior to {{the role}} of Edward being cast for the 2008 Twilight film, Meyer opined that, {{although}} Edward was [...] "Indisputably the most difficult character to cast, [...] is also the one that I'm most passionately decided upon. The only actor I've ever seen who I think could come close to pulling off Edward Cullen is....(drumroll)....Henry Cavill." [...] When the film was optioned by Summit Entertainment in July 2007, Meyer stated that; [...] "The most disappointing thing for me is losing my perfect Edward", as Cavill was by then 24 years old, and thus too old to realistically fill the role. Meyer reported on her website that the four most popular fan suggestions for actors to play Edward were Hayden Christensen, Robert Pattinson, Orlando Bloom and Gerard Way. On 11 December 2007, it was announced that Pattinson, known for his portrayal of Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter films, had been cast in the role. Erik Feig, Summit Entertainment’s President of Production, stated: [...] "It is always a challenge to find the right actor for a part that has lived so vividly in the imaginations of readers but <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> responsibility seriously and are confident, with Rob Pattinson, that we have found the perfect Edward for our Bella in Twilight." [...] Meyer stated that; [...] "I am ecstatic with Summit's choice for Edward. There are very few actors who can look both dangerous and beautiful at the same time, and even fewer who I can picture in my head as Edward. Robert Pattinson is going to be amazing." ...|$|E
