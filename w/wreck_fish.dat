The first includes conventional multiplex PCR in which electrophoretic migration of different sizes of bands allowed identification of the fish species. The second approach, involving real-time PCR, produced a single amplicon from each species that showed different Tm values allowing the fish groups to be directly identified. Real-time PCR allows the quick differential diagnosis {{of the three groups}} of species and high-throughput screening of multiple samples. Neither PCR system cross-reacted with DNA samples from 41 common marketed fish species, thus conforming to standards for species validation. The use of these two PCR-based methods makes it now possible to discriminate grouper from substitute fish species...|$|E

50|$|In the 1910s, Nogami {{submitted}} {{poems and}} short stories {{to the mainstream}} literary journal Chuo Koron, Shincho, and to the feminist magazine Seito, and gained a substantial following with fans of the proletarian literature movement. She maintained a correspondence with fellow female writers Yuasa Yoshiko and Miyamoto Yuriko, with whom she shared the sentiment that literature must serve a purpose towards increasing morality and social activism. In 1922, she published Kaijin maru ("The Neptune", tr. 1957), a shocking semi-factual account of four men in the crew of a <b>wrecked</b> <b>fishing</b> boat who must struggle with the choice of starvation or cannibalism.

500|$|Another {{cultural}} {{association is}} reflected in the scattering of shipwrecks named [...] "Black Swan". Tasmania has a wrecked schooner (1830) off Prime Seal Island in the Bass Strait and a <b>wrecked</b> <b>fishing</b> boat (1950) off Swansea on the east coast. New South Wales has two wrecks off its northern coast: a cutter near Newcastle (1852) and a paddle steamer (1868) near the Manning River. The name [...] "Black Swan" [...] probably refers to the aquatic characteristics of black swans such as buoyancy and a graceful style, even though the shipwreck record suggests the hope in the name association was not always well founded.

50|$|The story starts {{outside the}} Baghdad Zoo {{immediately}} after the Battle of Baghdad (2003). After being decimated during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the floodgates have been opened for the smuggling of hundreds of exotic birds, mammals, and reptiles to Western nations. However, this crime hides a deeper secret. Years later, a Louisiana state veterinarian, Lorna Polk, is flown to a <b>wrecked</b> <b>fishing</b> trawler in the Mississippi River delta basin by the United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The crew is missing, but the boat holds a live cargo: a caged group of exotic animals. Initially, Polk assumes {{it is part of}} a black market smuggling racket. Then she discovers disturbing deformities that make no sense. Also, the animals all share disturbingly heightened intelligence. To uncover the truth about the origin of this strange cargo and the threat it poses, Polk must team up with a man who shares a dark and bloody past with her, now an agent with the CBP.|$|R

Eight people were left missing and feared dead. The cyclone was accompanied with a storm surge as made landfall that flooded areas up to 330 feet (100 m) inland. While crossing the country, the cyclone dropped between 4 and 8 inches (100 to 200 mm) of precipitation, compounding the effects of severe monsoonal flooding from the previous month. Wind gusts from the cyclone reached 110 mph (175 km/h) near where it made landfall.|$|R
50|$|The Vũng Tàu {{shipwreck}} is a shipwreck {{that was}} found in the South China Sea off the islands of Côn Đảo about 100 miles from Vũng Tàu, Vietnam. The wreck was of a lorcha boat—a Chinese vessel with Portuguese influences that has been dated to about 1690. It was found by a fisherman who had picked up numerous pieces of porcelain from the <b>wreck</b> while <b>fishing.</b> Sverker Hallstrom identified the wreck and its cargo in 1990. Australian diver Michael Flecker took charge of the archaeological aspect of the excavation. An analysis of its cargo deduced that the ship was bound from China to Jakarta, Indonesia, where the porcelain would have been purchased by the Dutch East India Company for trans-shipment to Holland.|$|R
50|$|The strongest {{storm to}} {{threaten}} Sri Lanka since 1992, the cyclone produced estimated wind gusts of 175 km/h (110 mph) near where it moved ashore. About 500,000 people were left homeless, after the winds destroyed {{the roofs of}} many houses. One entire fishing village was destroyed, and about 20,000 ha of rice fields were wrecked. While crossing the country, the cyclone dropped between 4 and 8 inches (100 to 200 mm) of precipitation, compounding the effects of severe monsoonal flooding from the previous month. There were nine deaths in the country. Later, the storm brought heavy rainfall to southern India, with a peak 24&#8209;hour total of 180 mm in Nagapattinam.
