5|$|Breathing air is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that {{is little more than}} wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for <b>weeks</b> <b>without</b> water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen). Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of <b>weeks.</b> <b>Without</b> treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death.|$|E
5|$|The 1917 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured nine known tropical cyclones, four of which made landfall. The first system appeared on July6 {{east of the}} Windward Islands. After crossing the islands and traversing the Caribbean Sea, the storm struck Honduras, Belize, and Mexico, before dissipating on July14. After more than three <b>weeks</b> <b>without</b> tropical cyclogenesis, another tropical storm developed west of Bermuda. As the storm brushed eastern New England, four ships sank near Nantucket, causing 41fatalities. The same cyclone brought damaging winds to Nova Scotia before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August10.|$|E

5|$|Thurman Tucker {{was born}} on September 26, 1917, and raised in Gordon, Texas. In high school, he was a three-sport athlete, playing {{baseball}} (where he was a second baseman), basketball, and track and field. After graduating in 1935, he played semi-professional baseball and enrolled in a baseball school located in Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 1936, at age 18, Tucker signed as a professional with the Fayetteville Bears of the Arkansas–Missouri League, but left the team after only two <b>weeks,</b> <b>without</b> playing a game. Soon after, he was signed by the Siloam Springs Travelers of the same league, where he began his professional career.|$|E
5|$|A spin-off, The Colbert Report, was {{announced}} in early May 2005. The show starred former correspondent Stephen Colbert, and served as Comedy Central's answer to the programs of media pundits such as Bill O'Reilly. Colbert, Stewart, and Ben Karlin developed {{the idea for the}} show based on a series of faux television commercials that had been created for an earlier Daily Show segment. They pitched the concept to Comedy Central chief Doug Herzog, who agreed to run the show for eight <b>weeks</b> <b>without</b> first creating a pilot. The Colbert Report premiered on October 17, 2005 and aired following The Daily Show for nine years. Initial ratings satisfied Comedy Central and less than three weeks after its debut the show was renewed for a year. The Colbert Report was produced by Jon Stewart's production company, Busboy Productions.|$|E
5|$|On May 5, 1974 {{author and}} {{journalist}} Arthur Koestler published {{a letter from}} reader Nigel Parker in The Sunday Times of a striking coincidence between a scene in Poe's novel and an actual event that happened decades later: In 1884, the yacht Mignonette sank, with four men cast adrift. After <b>weeks</b> <b>without</b> food, they decided {{that one of them}} should be sacrificed as food for the other three, just as in Poe's novel. The loser was a young cabin boy named Richard Parker, coincidentally the same name as Poe's fictional character. Parker's shipmates, Tom Dudley and Edwin Stephens, were later tried for murder in a precedent-setting common law trial, the renowned R v Dudley and Stephens.|$|E

5|$|Some misguided Hollywood {{press agent}} sought to alter Como's life story by {{changing}} his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming {{it would make}} for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Perry gave him a shave and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related {{the story of his}} first film role experience in Something for the Boys. He sat ready to work in his dressing room for two <b>weeks</b> <b>without</b> being called. Perry spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. It was five weeks before he was actually called to the set, despite the studio's initial urgent report for work notice. When Como finally appeared, the director had no idea who he was.|$|E
5|$|The Astros {{promoted}} Robertson in 1998 to the class-A advanced affiliate Kissimmee Cobras of the Florida State League. In 28 {{games with}} the Cobras, Robertson pitched 175 total innings. He also had a 10–10 record, a 3.71 ERA, and 131 strikeouts. He was again promoted the following year to the Jackson Generals of the Texas League. At one point during the season, he went six <b>weeks</b> <b>without</b> earning a victory. He rebounded from the drought and finished {{the season with a}} 15–7 record and a 3.06 ERA; his 15 wins led all pitchers in the league. After the season ended, the Houston Astros purchased his contract, effectively placing him on the 40-man roster.|$|E
5|$|Whitetip reef sharks hunt {{primarily}} at night, when many fishes are asleep and easily taken. After dusk, groups of sharks methodically scour the reef, often breaking off pieces of coral in their vigorous pursuit of prey. Multiple sharks may target the same prey item, covering every exit route {{from a particular}} coral head. Each shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group. Unlike blacktip reef sharks and grey reef sharks, whitetip reef sharks do not become more excited when feeding in groups and {{are unlikely to be}} stirred into a feeding frenzy. Despite their nocturnal habits, whitetip reef sharks will hunt opportunistically in daytime. Off Borneo, this species gathers around reef drop-offs to feed on food brought up by the rising current. Off Hawaii, they follow Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi) and attempt to steal their catches. A whitetip reef shark can survive for six <b>weeks</b> <b>without</b> food.|$|E

He made his debut for Gillingham in the club's League Cup first round 1–0 home defeat against Colchester United on 12 August 2008. Four days later, Julian {{made his first}} league start for Gillingham, playing the whole match in a 1–0 home loss to Luton Town. He did not make another first-team appearance until November 2008, when he kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 away win at Macclesfield Town.

After six <b>weeks</b> <b>without</b> a first-team appearance, Julian played in Gillingham's 2–0 away loss at Dagenham & Redbridge. His next first-team appearance was five months later, playing in a 1–0 away victory at Rochdale, with Gillingham having already secured a play-off place.
