5|$|The Toy Story {{films and}} {{characters}} will always hold {{a very special}} place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. With Toy Story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody and the gang from Andy's room, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be great to let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way.|$|E
5|$|<b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> fit {{to commend}} these things most fully to your care {{that you may}} {{know that we have}} given to those Christians free and {{unrestricted}} opportunity of religious worship. When you see that this has been granted to them by us, your Worship will know that we have also conceded to other religions the right of open and free observance of their worship {{for the sake of the}} peace of our times, that each one may have the free opportunity to worship as he pleases; this regulation is made that we may not seem to detract from any dignity or any religion.|$|E
5|$|With Twitter, it wasn't {{clear what}} it was. They {{called it a}} social network, they called it microblogging, {{but it was hard}} to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E

25|$|In {{an article}} in The Globe and Mail written by Andre Picard on January 9, 1990, she is quoted as saying, “it was morbid and horrible what {{happened}} to Édouard. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was about time someone showed a little respect for his body – and his soul.” Lesperance felt the same and began plans to have the body returned to Willow Bunch {{the same year as}} his visit to the university. This first attempt failed because university officials claimed that the court would have to decide who had the right to the body. Although Lesperance gained power of attorney to act on behalf of the family, he did not proceed with any legal action at that time.|$|E
500|$|We'd {{just got}} {{ourselves}} a sampler, {{and we went}} sample-crazy. We just ... went through my whole collection of records, sampling tons of stuff and putting it all together, and it ... was a real rush of excitement, when we were doing it.... When we put that record out, we knew {{what we were doing}} was illegal, but <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear about it. So the first thing that shocked us is that British rock papers gave a big review.|$|E

We knew the constitution was not perfect; {{it had to be a}} compromise with all the faults of a compromise... But, in spite of the unforeseen [...] strains and stresses, the constitution has worked, on the whole, much as <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would. I think it now needs revision, to meet the needs of a changed world. But no-one could wish the work undone, who tries to imagine, what, in these stormy days, would have been the plight of six disunited Australian colonies." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2014, when Jean {{announced}} {{the title of}} the episode at the Television Critics Association summer tour, several news outlets suspected that Krusty the Clown would be killed off. Jean later told of his surprise at this theory, saying [...] "I was like, 'What? [...] "In the dumps" [...] doesn't mean you're dead. It means you're sad.' I thought it was so obvious. I would be nuts to kill Krusty. Everybody loves that character". [...] He said of the episode, [...] "It turned out bigger than <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was going to be. It's not going to be this blood bath where they all get murdered." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{scientists}} now {{consider that the}} effects of global dimming have masked the effect of global warming to some extent and that resolving global dimming may therefore lead to increases in predictions of future temperature rise. According to Beate Liepert, [...] "We lived in a global warming plus a global dimming world and now we are taking out global dimming. So we end up with the global warming world, which will be much worse than <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> will be, much hotter." [...] The magnitude of this masking effect is one of the central problems in climate change with significant implications for future climate changes and policy responses to global warming.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, both Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were {{converted}} to 3-D for a two-week limited theatrical re-release, which was extended due to its success. Lasseter said, [...] "The Toy Story films and characters will always hold a very special place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way, thanks to the latest in 3-D technology.

500|$|On June 22, 1998 Pusztai {{revealed}} his research findings {{during an interview}} on Granada Television's current affairs programme World in Action titled [...] "Eat up your genes". He was given permission to do the interview by Rowett Institute Director Philip James. Rowett's press officer {{was present at the}} start of filming. During the interview Pusztai said he had [...] "concerns that some of the testing techniques are not up to what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was necessary to do, and therefore we should have more testing." [...] When asked why he felt concerned, he said [...] "it was because we had done some experiments which made us feel concerned" [...] and discussed his results in general terms.|$|E
500|$|Ryder's next {{role was}} in the Generation X drama Reality Bites (1994), {{directed}} by Ben Stiller, in which she played a young woman searching for direction in her life. Her performance received acclaim and the studio hoped the film would gross {{a substantial amount of}} money, yet it did not make as much money as expected. Bruce Feldman, Universal Pictures' Vice-President of Marketing said: [...] "The media labeled it as a Generation X picture, while <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a comedy with broad appeal." [...] The studio placed TV ads during programs chosen for their appeal to 12- to 34-year-olds and in interviews Stiller was careful not to mention the phrase [...] "Generation X." ...|$|E
500|$|Hed PE {{signed with}} Jive Records, {{releasing}} their self-titled debut album in 1997. In {{his review of}} the album, Allmusic's Steve Huey wrote [...] "There are some slow and/or unfocused moments [...] but overall, its aggression will probably play well with late-'90s metal and punk fans." [...] Due to the label's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album, the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by Jive. Gomes {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "We had these romantic visions of the music industry, and <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be cool to be a punk band on a rap label. So we fulfilled that dream, but it was also probably {{the worst thing that could}} have happened. [...] We've had offers from Sony and others that we can't take because we owe Jive so much money." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Vig, the {{inspiration}} for the song was a newspaper article about a woman who had gone back to get revenge on an abusive husband, [...] "so <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be cool to get a bit of retribution in there." [...] Vig also said he noted violence could also come from psychological stand point by seeing the story of a sado-masochistic couple who could not keep away from each other. Lyrically, Manson claimed [...] "'Vow' is about having feelings [...] You have to face your feelings of revenge and work out why you feel that way. It's about that conundrum when you're really angry but in reality you're in a pitiful state. Angry, twisted, but deep down, vulnerable." [...] During promotion for the song, Garbage joked to journalists that [...] "Vow" [...] was about John and Lorena Bobbitt.|$|E
500|$|The {{script was}} given to Maurice Hurley to rewrite. He took six weeks for the rewrite, and his initial version was {{received}} poorly by TNG executives. Hurley later said, [...] "they absolutely hated it, I think they wanted to fire me, {{and they would have}} if I didn't have a guaranteed contract". He rewrote the script, and this version was filmed. Hurley was pleased with the result, saying that [...] "everything about that episode worked". The final version differed significantly from the original Reaves-Duane script; Duane later said that only two scenes remained: where Picard sees his mother, and where he nearly falls out of the turbolift into space. Reaves later said that the episode [...] "came together much better on the screen than <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would when we read the script. We were lucky, because it was out of our hands".|$|E
500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something {{we were going to}} do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least we gave it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us." ...|$|E
30|$|So <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> {{would be}} {{interesting}} to produce nanofluids by a one-step physical method with no surfactant, perform measurement uncertainty analysis, and measure the thermal conductivity of the nanofluids using very accurate thermal conductivity apparatuses.|$|R

500|$|Writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, who had {{previously}} co-written and starred in The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from [...] "David and Maureen", episode 4 of the first series of Psychoville, which was in turn inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. [...] "David and Maureen" [...] took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a [...] "reaction" [...] to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying that [...] "we'd been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{would be nice to}} do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you might not like this story, but you've got a different one next week." [...] As an anthology series with horror themes, Inside No. 9 also pays homage to Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents.|$|E
500|$|The Industrial Records website {{explains}} that the musicians wanted to re-invent rock music, and that their uncensored records were about {{their relationship with the}} world. They go on to say that they wanted their music to be an awakening for listeners so that they would begin to think for themselves and question the world around them. [...] Industrial Records intended the term industrial to evoke the idea of music created for a new generation, with previous music being more agricultural: P-Orridge stated that [...] "there's an irony in the word 'industrial' because there's the music industry. And then there's the joke we often used to make in interviews about churning out our records like motorcars —that sense of industrial. And ... up till then the music had been kind of based on the blues and slavery, and <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was time to update it to at least Victorian times—you know, the Industrial Revolution".|$|E
500|$|In 1967 {{during a}} meeting with Alejo Carpentier, Julio Cortázar, and Miguel Otero Silva, the Mexican author Carlos Fuentes {{launched}} a project consisting {{of a series of}} biographies depicting Latin American dictators, which was to be called Los Padres de la Patria (The Fathers of the Fatherland). After reading Edmund Wilson's portraits of the American Civil War in Patriotic Gore, Fuentes recounts, [...] "Sitting in a pub in Hampstead, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{would be a good idea}} to have a comparable book on Latin America. An imaginary portrait gallery immediately stepped forward, demanding incarnation: the Latin American dictators." [...] Vargas Llosa was to write about Manuel A. Odría, Jorge Edwards about José Manuel Balmaceda, José Donoso about Mariano Melgarejo, and Julio Cortázar about Eva Perón. As M. Mar Langa Pizarro observes, the project was never completed, but it helped inspire a series of novels written by important authors during the Latin American literary boom, such as Alejo Carpentier, Augusto Roa Bastos, Gabriel García Márquez, and Mario Vargas Llosa.|$|E
