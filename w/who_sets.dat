Finally, an enraged Kalmashapada hits Shakti with his whip. In turn, the sage curses the king to wander the forest for 16 years. The sage Vishwamitra, the arch-enemy of Vashishtha who desires to have Kalmashapada as his disciple, sends a rakshasa to possess the king's body. Vishwamitra plots to destroy his enemy's family {{with the help of}} the king.

True, she learns something about the animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the goffered pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child. Having not learned something new about herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot.|$|E

When he is sent to meet the captain, Mulder tries to explain that the Queen Anne vanished in the Bermuda Triangle in 1939, and claims that it has reappeared in 1998.

5|$|The {{number of}} {{supporting}} characters was kept low to emphasize their individuality, and their personalities were left ambiguous {{to reinforce the}} desire for player immersion. The heroine Yuko Takao {{was intended to be}} a different type of character to previous main heroines, being a non-playable character from the beginning of story development. She was the only major non-playable character not to have her own Reason. The character of Lucifer designed was not a standard villain, but rather as a gentlemanly observer <b>who</b> <b>sets</b> tests for the player. To reflect his omnipotent status as God's opposite, he is portrayed in a number of forms, including a child and an old man. Alongside this, the staff wanted to portray demons not only as enemies but as characters the player could relate to and grow attached to when inviting them to their party. One of the key elements for demon designs recycled from earlier games was bringing them into the game and making them as true as possible to the original design while fitting into the game's art style.|$|E

As he reviews the game's footage, Detective Lieutenant Mark Hoffman is called to the scene by FBI Agent Dan Erickson, who has found Peter Strahm's fingerprints. Also present is Lindsey Perez, whose survival was covered up by Erickson for her protection. They learn from Dr. Adam Heffner, the coroner who performed all of the autopsies for the case thus far, that the knife used to cut the jigsaw piece from Eddie's flesh was only used once before, on Seth Baxter.

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Ventus is the {{apprentice}} of Master Xehanort, who trains him to complete the legendary χ-blade. However, due to Ventus' reluctance to use darkness, Xehanort extracted it from his heart, resulting in the creation of Vanitas, but also leaving his heart incomplete and on the verge of collapse. Xehanort brings Ventus to Destiny Islands, where his heart merges with that of the newborn Sora to keep it safe. Having lost his memories, Ventus is placed in the care of Master Eraqus as his youngest Keyblade apprentice alongside Terra and Aqua. At the game's beginning, Vanitas taunts Ventus into following Terra <b>who</b> <b>sets</b> out to find Xehanort. Ventus travels through various worlds, fighting mysterious creatures called the Unversed and meeting various people. Vanitas attacks Ventus during his journey to test his strength, but he is defeated when Keyblade apprentice Mickey aids Ventus. Upon meeting Xehanort, Ventus is forced to remember his purpose as being used to create the χ-blade. Ventus refuses to battle Vanitas and create it, but is forced to after Vanitas threatens to kill Terra and Aqua if he does refuse. They battle within the Keyblade Graveyard, where Vanitas merges with Ventus and obtains the χ-blade. However, the fusion is incomplete, which allows Ventus to destroy Vanitas within his heart and Aqua to destroy the χ-blade. As a result, Ventus loses his heart and his body is placed within Castle Oblivion by Aqua until he awakens. Ventus' wandering heart is able to find its way back to the young Sora, who accepts Ventus' heart into his body. In the game's secret ending, he is seen in the Land of Departure with Terra, and the two utter Sora's name with newfound hope.|$|E
