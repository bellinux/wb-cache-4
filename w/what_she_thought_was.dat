The species was first {{described}} by New Zealand mycologist Greta Stevenson in 1962; in the same publication Stevenson also described <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a unique species, Limacella macrospora, but over 30 years later this was reduced to synonymy with A.australis.|$|E

In 1983 he published London: City of the Romans, in which he updated his account of Londinium with information obtained over the previous decade and a half. His book The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic appeared in 1987, and was written to combat what Merrifield identified as a widespread neglect of ritual aspects in the archaeological record. Concurring with Merrifield's assessment about this neglect, the later archaeologist Roberta Gilchrist described the book as a [...] "rare contribution" [...] to the discipline. The historian of religion Hilda Ellis Davidson praised the [...] "cautious and balanced arguments" [...] of Merrifield's work, opining that it should be read by every archaeologist as a corrective to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> their widespread ignorance of folklore.|$|E
500|$|Food critic Katharine Shilcutt of the Houston Press {{criticized the}} episode for giving <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> an {{inaccurate}} depiction of foodies, as {{people that are}} [...] "tacky, snotty, slightly racist, hoarders of food experiences that you gather like rare gems and patronizingly hold over other people's heads." [...] Shilcutt added that she found it upsetting that what she believes to be {{the moral of the}} episode is that [...] "Educated, passionate people are elitists. It reduces all the hard work that people put into creating good, honest food into a joke, and not a terribly funny one. There was no balance in the episode between smug, arrogant, obnoxious foodies and those who have a genuine, guileless interest in food and all its important permutations in our lives." ...|$|E

I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I {{want to do is}} just say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down of all of these things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because I remembered {{for the first time since}} I hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E

In 2004, the 25-city tour Throne Room with the group Anointed featured free admission and was followed with a DVD release of the concert recorded in Tennessee near CeCe's place of residence.

2500|$|... 1986 heralded the {{beginning}} of a storyline that Colin Brake has described as one of the soap's most complicated, convoluted, confusing and mind-boggling: The paternity of Simon Wicks. As part of the original storyline, Wicksy's mother, Pat (Pam St Clement), was introduced as a major antagonist for the Beale family, when she announced that her former husband, Pete, was not Simon's biological father, as had previously been claimed. So began a long-running storyline played out throughout the year and continuing into 1988, which included other characters being implemented as the potential father of Simon, including Pete's older brother Kenny Beale (Michael Attwell). In the on-screen events, Simon was shown to bond with Kenny, despite Pat's admitting that she did not know which of the Beale brothers had fathered Wicksy. A final plot twist in mid-1988 saw Pat finally reveal <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> the truth, that Simon's real father was Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield), Pat's second husband and Wicksy's adoptive father.|$|E

Deployed {{as part of}} a {{screening}} force several miles ahead of the main force of the Grand Fleet, Black Prince had lost contact in the darkness and took a position near <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> the British line. The Germans soon identified the new addition to its line and opened fire. Overwhelmed by point-blank gunfire, Black Prince blew up, (857 officers and men – all hands – were lost), as her squadron leader Defence had done hours earlier. Lost in the darkness, the battlecruisers [...] and [...] had similar point-blank encounters with the British battle line and were recognised, but were spared the fate of Black Prince when the captains of the British ships, again, declined to open fire, reluctant to reveal their fleet's position.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, {{after several}} years of tense relations, Abramović and Ulay decided to make a spiritual journey which would end their relationship. They each walked the Great Wall of China, in a piece called Lovers, {{starting}} from the two opposite ends and meeting in the middle. As Abramović described it: [...] "That walk became a complete personal drama. Ulay started from the Gobi Desert and I from the Yellow Sea. After each of us walked 2500km, we met in the middle and said good-bye." [...] She has said that she conceived this walk in a dream, and it provided <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> an appropriate, romantic ending to a relationship full of mysticism, energy, and attraction. She later described the process: [...] "We needed a certain form of ending, after this huge distance walking towards each other. It is very human. It is in a way more dramatic, more like a film ending... Because in the end you are really alone, whatever you do." [...] She reported that during her walk she was reinterpreting her connection to the physical world and to nature. She felt that the metals in the ground influenced her mood and state of being; she also pondered the Chinese myths in which the Great Wall {{has been described as a}} [...] "dragon of energy." [...] It took the couple eight years to acquire permission from the Chinese government to perform the work, by the time of which their relationship had completely dissolved.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable storylines {{featuring}} Pete revolved around the paternity of his alleged son, Simon Wicks (Nick Berry). Pete was shell-shocked to discover that Simon, was not really his child, {{and that he was}} possibly the son of his brother Kenny (Michael Attwell). The storyline spanned several years, since the arrival of Pete's first wife Pat (Pam St. Clement) in 1986, until the long-awaited showdown between Pete, Pat and Kenny in February 1988. The episode written by Tony McHale contained shocking revelations that would affect several relationships on the Square for years to come. In the on-screen events, Simon was shown to bond with Kenny, despite Pat admitting that she did not know which of the Beale brothers had fathered Wicksy. A final plot twist mid-1988 saw Pat finally reveal <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> the truth, that Simon's real father was Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield), Pat's second husband and Wicksy's adoptive father. Despite this revelation on-screen, writer Colin Brake stated in an official EastEnders book in 1994 that the true parentage of Simon was still uncertain {{in the minds of the}} producers. He stated, [...] "At various times over the years the story has been amended, until the only certainty is that we will never be certain about the actual facts." [...] He added that, at the time of writing the book for EastEnders 10th anniversary in 1994, [...] "the current producers believe that Pete was the father of [...] David and may have been the father of Simon." ...|$|E

However, it was later discovered that the labels had been exchanged between the tubes in which specimen of this species and of Pseudemathis trifida were kept, and a corrected description was published in 2005.

The mother admits giving her diazepam for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> “moods”.
