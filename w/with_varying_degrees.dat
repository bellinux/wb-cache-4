5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders.

This strategy was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> <b>degrees</b> of success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa.

5|$|Historians see {{the growing}} Roman {{influence}} over the east, as with the west, as {{not a matter of}} intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies. With some major exceptions of outright military rule, the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (<b>with</b> <b>varying</b> <b>degrees</b> of independence, both de jure and de facto) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire. It was not until the time of the Roman Empire that the entire Roman world was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control.|$|E

Others, however, unashamedly paid homage to 1990s arcade gameplay, even embracing a somewhat parodic style. Light guns are not compatible with modern high-definition televisions, leading developers to experiment with hybrid controllers, particularly with the Wii Remote for the Wii, as well as the PlayStation 3's GunCon 3 peripheral used with Time Crisis 4.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the time-dependent buckling behaviour of continuous composite steelconcrete T-section beams <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> <b>degree</b> of shear connection. Creep and shrinkage effects in composite steel-concrete structures may cause a redistribution of internal actions within a member, which increases significantly the compression within the steel component, and that may lead to erosion of the buckling resistance of the steel member. In this paper, models for the in-plane analysis of continuous composite beams <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> <b>degree</b> of shear connection stiffness and subjected to creep and shrinkage of the slab, and the out-of-plane buckling analysis capable of predicting local, distortional and lateral buckling modes are combined to study the time-dependent buckling behaviour of continuous composite beams. A parametric study is then undertaken to evaluate the effects of shear connection stiffness and geometric beam properties on the long-term elastic buckling capacities of these beams, and some conclusions are drawn. Paper presented at the Fifth International Conference on Advances in Steel Structures, 5 - 7 December, 2007, Singapor...|$|R

5|$|Thorium is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} and electropositive metal. With a standard reduction potential of −1.90V for the Th4+/Th couple, it is somewhat more electropositive than zirconium or aluminium. Finely divided thorium metal can exhibit pyrophoricity, spontaneously igniting in air. When heated in air, thorium turnings ignite and burn with a brilliant white light to produce the dioxide. In bulk, the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow, although corrosion may eventually occur after several months; most thorium samples are contaminated <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> <b>degrees</b> of the dioxide, which greatly accelerates corrosion. Such samples slowly tarnish in air, becoming grey and finally black at the surface.|$|E
5|$|Only a few shark {{attacks of}} {{uncertain}} provenance {{have been attributed}} to the porbeagle. It is well regarded as a game fish by recreational anglers. The meat and fins of the porbeagle are highly valued, which has led to a long history of intense human exploitation. However, this species cannot sustain heavy fishing pressure due to its low reproductive capacity. Direct commercial fishing for the porbeagle, principally by Norwegian longliners, led to stock collapses in the eastern North Atlantic in the 1950s, and the western North Atlantic in the 1960s. The porbeagle continues to be caught throughout its range, both intentionally and as bycatch, <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> <b>degrees</b> of monitoring and management. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the porbeagle as Vulnerable worldwide, and as either Endangered or Critically Endangered in different parts of its northern range.|$|E
