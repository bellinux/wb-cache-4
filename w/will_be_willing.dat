5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, {{a person in the}} desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E
25|$|The TenderCrisp {{sandwich}} {{is part of}} {{a series}} of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appeals to adults in the 24–36 years age bracket. Along with the TenderGrill and Angus sandwiches, these products are intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to spend more on the better quality products.|$|E
25|$|Providing {{water to}} rural {{residents}} {{is a considerable}} challenge as well. Lower population densities mean {{that the cost of}} water provision in rural areas is often higher than in urban areas, while lower incomes in many rural areas make it difficult for some customers to meet the full cost of high quality services. This decreases the likelihood that the private sector <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to engage into the rural water sector.|$|E

25|$|Just {{like the}} supply curves reflect {{marginal}} cost curves, demand curves {{are determined by}} marginal utility curves. Consumers <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to buy a given quantity of a good, at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption {{is equal to the}} opportunity cost determined by the price, that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product in a given frame of time.|$|E

25|$|Banks {{with more}} {{reserves}} {{than they need}} <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to lend to banks with a reserve shortage on the interbank lending market. The surplus banks will want to earn {{a higher rate than}} the support rate that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit banks will want to pay a lower interest rate than the discount rate the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank lending rate will be in between the support rate and the discount rate.|$|E

25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1970s, {{international}} fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. The hope is that the customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.|$|E
500|$|Given {{that the}} Second Polish Republic was a {{multicultural}} state, German policies and propaganda {{also sought to}} create and encourage conflicts between ethnic groups, fueling tension between Poles and Jews, and between Poles and Ukrainians. In Łódź, the Germans forced Jews to help destroy a monument to a Polish hero, Tadeusz Kościuszko, and filmed them committing the act. Soon afterward, the Germans set fire to a Jewish synagogue and filmed Polish bystanders, portraying them in propaganda releases as a [...] "vengeful mob." [...] This divisive policy {{was reflected in the}} Germans' decision to destroy Polish education, while at the same time, showing relative tolerance toward the Ukrainian school system. As the high-ranking Nazi official Erich Koch explained, [...] "We must do everything possible so that when a Pole meets a Ukrainian, he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to kill the Ukrainian and conversely, the Ukrainian <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to kill the Pole." ...|$|E
500|$|Some animals may assess rivals through {{specific}} {{characteristics that}} are relevant to their fighting abilities; however, some animals, instead, use conventional characteristics to determine the competitive ability of their rivals. Conventional characteristics are signals that are indicative of the rival’s abilities but are not a reflection of the animal’s physiological or physical agonistic abilities. Polistes exclamans uses facial patterns as a conventional characteristic to determine the agonistic abilities of competitive rivals. Larger wasps have a greater amount of brown pigmented clypei. Wasps use these pigmented clypei to determine the viability of challenging a rival. The more pigmented the clypei or the larger the Polistes exclamans, the more likely the Polistes exclamans <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to challenge a rival. The less pigmented the clypei or the smaller the Polistes exclamans, the less willing it would be to challenge a rival. This assists in the minimization of the “costs of conflict during dominance competition among nest-founding queens.” ...|$|E

[...] To arouse {{the interest of the}} general public, Shackleton issued a detailed programme early in 1914. [...] The expedition was to consist of two parties and two ships.

Many of his ideas were regarded as unusual in his day: admission was not dependent on religious affiliation, he encouraged the “bodily health” of students, and he regarded modern languages as being as important as classical languages.

2500|$|As in {{the first}} game, the player {{must be aware of}} [...] "heat" [...] at all times. Shooting rival family members in public, killing {{innocent}} people, or attacking police officers will all raise heat levels. If the level gets too high, police will fire upon the player on sight. To avoid this, the player can bribe police to ignore them for a while. The game also introduces witnesses. When the player commits a crime, a yellow circle appears on the mini-map. This is the crime scene, and police will soon arrive to investigate. On occasion, a member of the public <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to identify the player to the police. If this happens when the player is still within the yellow circle, the police will attack. To avoid this, the player can either intimidate or bribe witnesses into not talking before the police arrive on the scene.|$|E

A 2007 article by Bruce Bawer published in City Journal magazine and a subsequent article in February 2009 by Barbara Kay in the National Post criticised some of Galtung's statements. Both authors criticized Galtung's opinion that while Communist China was [...] "repressive in a certain liberal sense", Mao Zedong was [...] "endlessly liberating when seen from many other perspectives that liberal theory has never understood" [...] because China showed that [...] "the whole theory about what an 'open society' is must be rewritten, probably also the theory of 'democracy'—and it {{will take a long time}} before the West <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to view China as a master teacher in such subjects." [...] The authors also criticized Galtung's opposition to Hungarian resistance against the Soviet invasion in 1956 and his description in 1974 of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov as [...] "persecuted elite personages".|$|E
