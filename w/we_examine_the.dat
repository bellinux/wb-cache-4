25|$|In physics, {{conservation}} laws {{state that}} certain particular measurable properties of an isolated physical system {{do not change}} as the system evolves over time. In 1915, Emmy Noether discovered that underlying each conservation law is a fundamental symmetry of nature. The fact that physical processes don't care where in space they take place (space translation symmetry) yields conservation of momentum, {{the fact that such}} processes don't care when they take place (time translation symmetry) yields conservation of energy, and so on. In this section, <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> Newtonian views of conservation of mass, momentum and energy from a relativistic perspective.|$|E

30|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the system as}} an assessment method {{of the effect of}} footwear intervention. Considering the typical intervention by footwear, <b>we</b> <b>examined</b> whether subjects with callus could reduce the pressure and shear by changing their footwear.

60|$|In the {{passages}} here produced {{as proof of}} Mannhardt's conversion, he is not investigating a myth at all, or a name which occurs in mythology. He is trying to discover {{the meaning of the}} practices of the Lupercalia at Rome. In February, says Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the Romans held a popular festival, and lads ran round naked, save for skins of victims, whipping the spectators. Mannhardt, in his usual way, collects all the facts first, and then analyses the name Luperci. This does not make him a philological mythologist. To take a case in point, at Selkirk and Queensferry the bounds are ridden, or walked, by 'Burleymen' or 'Burrymen.' {48} After examining the facts <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> words, and ask, 'Why Burley or Burry men?' At Queensferry, by a folk etymology, one of the lads wears a coat stuck over with burrs. But 'Borough-men' seems the probable etymology. As <b>we</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> names Burley, or Burry men, so Mannhardt examines the name Luperci; and if a true etymology can be discovered, it will illustrate the original intention of the Lupercalia (p. 86).|$|E

60|$|What {{does all}} this mean? It means that the {{activity}} of the lower psyche and lower body is polarized by the upper body. Eyes and ears want to gather sexual activity and knowledge.

It is his own sex which obsesses him.|$|E
60|$|On the whole, the {{accounts}} of the gods and of their nature present in Aryan mythology the inconsistent anthropomorphism, and the mixture of incongruous and often magical and childish ideas, which mark all other mythological systems.
