The lifetime of the exciton formed by an electron of the lowest subband and a heavy hole of the second subband is determined as 130 ± 20 ps, in agreement with theoretical estimations of intersubband scattering based on acoustic phonon emission. The exciton lifetime in the second heavy-hole subband is considerably longer than reported values of the recombination time in the lowest exciton state at k= 0. These findings lead to novel intersubband laser concepts based on excitons...|$|R

5|$|The season {{produced}} fourteen tropical cyclones {{and nine}} named storms, which was <b>well</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> average of sixteen named storms per season; this was {{largely due to}} a strong La Niña taking {{over much of the}} Pacific.

Although it remained offshore, Hurricane Adrian caused 6deaths from flooding and rough surf in Mexico. Hurricane Dora was a long-lived and intense cyclone, which had the second longest track of a Pacific hurricane on record.

This season was part of a decade-long absence of major hurricanes; from 1950–56, no major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale) were reported in the Eastern Pacific basin. However, it is possible that some storms were missed due to the lack of satellite coverage in the region in addition to the lack of Hurricane Hunter data, which did not become available until the following year.|$|E
