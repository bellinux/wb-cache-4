40|$|Dormancy {{caused by}} the tegument's {{impermeability}} to water is a feature of Schizolobium parahyba seeds. So that the best methodology for overcoming the species's dormancy may be determined, the seeds were submitted to mechanical scarification treatments, using sandpaper and scissors, {{on the opposite side}} of the hilum. Chemical scarification was also undertaken with sulfuric (H 2 SO 4) and hydrochloric (HCl) acids for 30 minutes. Seeds were distributed in groups of 25 units in four petri plates. The experiment was undertaken in a BOD germination chamber at 25 °C and 120 μmol. m - 2. s - 1. Data were used to calculate the germination capacity (G%), the Germination Velocity Index (IVG) and Mean Germination Time (TM). Imbibation curve was also calculated to analyze the dormancy type of the seeds by using the three-phase model where phase FI was completed in 6 hours and FIII was initiated after 12 hours <b>of</b> <b>imbibation.</b> Results show that whereas pre-germinative treatments trigger S. parahyba germination, mechanical scarification is the most effective method to overcome the species's dormancy...|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} the wetting {{of a range}} of low packing density (high porosity), porous, fibrous media by mineral oils. The fibrous media were suspended above a vessel of oil, and the rate <b>of</b> <b>imbibation</b> <b>of</b> oil was measured by means of a balance under the oil and a load cell above the media. It was found that the height of the oil column within the media over time generally resembled the classical capillary rise curve. Capillary rise models were fitted to the data to predict an equivalent capillary diameter, dynamic contact angle, and height of the liquid column as time approaches infinity, using the known filter and oil properties. Different capillary models were examined, and {{it was found that the}} modified Washburn equation was the simplest model to use and produced an acceptable agreement between theory and experiment. It was found that the adjustment phase of the curve from the fibrous media was generally more rapid than for a typical capillary, presumably since the fibrous media can be wetted not only from directly below (as with a capillary), but also through the meniscus at the sides of the media. It was found that a linear correlation existed between the effective capillary diameter of the media, and the packing density of the media divided by the fibre diameter. The results appear to be relatively independent of the material type. These results allow capillary diameters to be determined for fibrous media from easily measured parameters, without the requirement of conducting wetting experiments or 'bubble-point' tests.

40|$|AbstractThe earthy <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> Hamma and Negrine are {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} a very large quantity of calcium carbonate on surfaces of the domestic facilities and industrial during their circulation. This deposit has very serious technical consequences. The study <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> the two sources Hamma and Negrine showed that this water is furring and their hardness is about 59 °F for the <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Hamma and 56 °F for the <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Negrine. In this study we used the chronoamperometric method [1] for: to determine the furring capacity <b>of</b> raw <b>water</b> <b>of</b> each source (Hamma and Negrine) which is characterized by the time of scaling and the residual current. to evaluate the influence of the temperature on the furring capacity <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Hamma and the <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Negrine. to study the effect of the chemical inhibitor (HEDP) on the furring capacity <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Hamma and Negrine. The application of the chronoamperometric method to the temperature of 30 °C on raw <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Hamma gave a time of scaling of 9. 7 min for the <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Hamma and 13. 5 min for the <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Negrine. These values increase with: -the reduction in the temperature <b>of</b> raw <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> Hamma and Negrine. the addition of the inhibitor: HEDP with weak concentrations.
