The gills {{are the most}} luminescent part of the fungus, emitting a greenish light that fades with age. Although {{the intensity of the}} luminescence is variable, William Henry Harvey once reported that it was bright enough to read a <b>watch</b> <b>face</b> by. It is not known if the mycelium is also luminescent.|$|E
500|$|The Zenbook {{name was}} {{proposed}} by Asus chairman Jonney Shih {{to reflect the}} [...] "zen philosophy" [...] applied to the design. The chief designer, Loewy Chen, had wanted to incorporate design elements from luxury watches into his products for a long time. Zenbooks were the first opportunity to put this into practice, the crossover being achieved, he said, by [...] "the unfolding of the laptop from the side recalling the elegance of minute and hour hand movements". The reference to watches is also reflected in the marketing of Zenbooks; Asus published design sketches overlaying an open Zenbook on a <b>watch</b> <b>face,</b> and video advertisements feature similar imagery. The concentric circles on the lid of [...] were intended to look like ripples in water and to reflect [...] "philosophical ideas such as the infinite nature of Zen thinking and self-improvement".|$|E
500|$|The {{invention}} of the mainspring in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the balance spring {{was added to the}} balance wheel in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist Robert Hooke (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens was the actual inventor of the balance spring. Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral balance spring, the form used in virtually all watches to the present day. [...] The addition of the balance spring made the balance wheel a harmonic oscillator like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed resonant frequency and resisted oscillating at other rates. [...] This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day, resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the <b>watch</b> <b>face</b> around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France.|$|E
