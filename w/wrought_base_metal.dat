The mixed powder consisted of a mixture of a powdered Ni base filler (GNi- 3) and powdered <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> (GTD- 111). The range of the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> powder was 40 to 70 wt%. Bonding was performed at a temperature of 1463 K, using various holding time. In {{the case of a}} lower 50 wt%, the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> powders completely melted and <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> mating at the interface dissolved at an early time, and extent of dissolution of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> decreased with increasing mixing ratio.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present three {{papers on the}} Economics of the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry. The thesis studies production, trading, and {{investment}} in the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry, and thus explains some phenomena of the industry in an international context. Using {{the features of the}} <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry such as the practices in production and trading, physical properties, geology of the deposits and so on, we build theoretical models to simulate the behavior of the industry. In Chapter One, we study the determinants and the trend of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices over time by an equilibrium model of supply and demand. Because the different types of natural resources exhibit different patterns of price changes in history, we particularly simulate the long run equilibrium to study the impacts of the determinants for <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices. The Cobb-Douglass production function on the supply side allows substitution among production factors. The demand function for <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> from the economy is also derived. In the long run, equilibrium of aggregate supply and demand determines the systematic price trend. We show how trends of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices depend on technological progress, resource scarcity, natural resource tax, and the interest rate. Assuming constant returns to scale in <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> production, the price elasticity of the supply of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> is relatively small. Interestingly, a high natural resource tax leads to a high price but low rate of price change over time. On the supply side, the decline of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> relative prices can thus be explained by the inverse supply functions. On the demand side, the relative price is also declining over time as we see the implications of the inverse demand functions and our numerical illustrations. By solving the equilibrium condition, we show that the economic rent of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> minerals in reserve may decline over time, or even not be valuable in future. The price elasticities of supply and demand are calculated and decomposed into specific effects. These are systematic components of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> price changes in the world market. Chapter Two deals with the fluctuations in the prices of <b>base</b> <b>metals.</b> We consider the price in the short run as an equilibrium of trade. If the long run equilibrium regulates the prices and sets them in a stabilization, then the fluctuations in price are caused by the trade and speculative activities. By simulating speculative activities and optimizing the utility of agents in international exchanges, we show that the price fluctuations are the response to risk preferences of agents and the scale of international exchanges. We find out the critical point of production investment, which depends on the market demand, profitability of the metal industry, and the distribution of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> minerals in nature. In the specific case of the industry versus the market condition when the uncertain production is above the critical point, the price of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> fluctuates more or less according to the number of producer offers in <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> exchanges, the speculative activities, and risk preferences of agents. In contrast, if the investment level of the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry in uncertain production is below the critical point, the effects of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> exchanges scale to the price are in the reverse direction. The comparative statics inequalities are derived to clarify the responses of the price to the risk preferences of agents and scale of the international exchanges. Hence, the non-systematic changes of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices in international exchanges are explained. Chapter Three studies the impact of the industrial and commercial processes on investment decisions in the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry. The investment decisions of investors in the primary capital market and the stock price in the secondary capital market reflect properties of the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry in capital markets. We present a model of investments, which is a two stage game that incorporates Hall-Jorgenson neoclassical investment analysis and properties of the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry. The paper presents a set of explanatory parameters for the properties of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> stocks and analyzes the investment decisions. We define the industry factor and explain the empirical observations on the beta coefficient of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> stocks. The relationships between stock prices and <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices are clarified using the geology of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> deposits. The results show that there is a strong impact of the industry factor on the volatility of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> stock prices. Economies of scale in the mining industry lead to different effects of tax policy and output prices on investment decisions. We support conclusions of the model by evidence in the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry. There are policy implications that are derived from the equations of the optimal investment.

40|$|AbstractThe new {{fabrication}} {{method to}} fabricate porous aluminum alloys with aligned unidirectional pores {{was invented by}} dipping pipes into semi-solid slurry. Pure aluminum pipes were dipped into Al- 4 mass% Cu liquid and semi-solid slurry of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> in an electric furnace. The <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and dipped pipes were cooled and solidified together in the air. The pipes were bonded to the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and the original shape of the pipes was maintained by using the semi-solid slurry of the <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> However, pipes are usually ruptured and buried in the liquid <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> during the process. On the other hand, {{it is possible to}} avoid the rupturing of pipes by using the semi-solid slurry because thermal damage of pipes can be reduced by an increase in solid fraction of the <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> The analysis results of Electron Probe MicroAnalyser showed that Cu diffused into grain boundaries of pipes, which decreased the melting temperature of surface of pipes. As a result, the α phase melted partly and then the pipes were bonded with the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> metallurgically.

40|$|AbstractPlane {{bending fatigue}} tests were {{conducted}} using DLC-coated magnesium alloy AZ 61 with two different film elastic moduli in order to investigate the effect of film elastic modulus on fatigue behaviour. Fatigue strength was improved by DLC film where DLC film with larger elastic modulus was more effective to improve fatigue strength. Delaminations of DLC film from <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> were observed near crack initiation sites. The number of small cracks and delaminations was larger as film elastic moduluswas larger. By DLC film, stress near the boundary between <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and DLC film is redistributed in a specimen compared with parent material without DLC film. Stress is reduced at <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> but large stress occurs at DLC film due to the differenceof elastic moduli of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and DLC film. Stress at <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and DLC film near the boundary is calculated by FEM (Finite Element Method) analysis. FEM analysis showed that stress decreases at <b>base</b> <b>metal,</b> stress increases at DLC film and that the difference of stresses at <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and DLC film becomes larger when film elastic modulus is larger. It is considered that firmrestraint of slip deformation in <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> by DLC film is effective to improve fatigue strength and that large stress in DLC film would not give negative effect on fatigue strength...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} coated metal powders and to dispersions of such powders in liquid vehicles forming screenable, sinterable pastes {{for use in}} forming electrodes on photovoltaic devices. The primary nickel or copper metal particles are provided with a carrier of lower melting sintering metals such as 1 - 20 % by weight, of a non-oxidizing metal such as lead or tin. The powdered metal systems operate {{on the basis of}} fusing together by way of eutectic alloying. As the paste is heated during firing the organic binder is first vaporized. An eutectic of the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> (copper) and coating (tin) forms at the intersections of the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> grains. This eutectic dissolves the grains and as the temperature is raised above the eutectic temperature, more of the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> is dissolved. While the temperature is held at the higher value, the much smaller amount of sintering metal disappears as the eutectic dissolves and diffuses into the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> until the composition of the eutectic is so enriched with <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> that it no longer has the eutectic properties and it solidifies. In this high temperature solidification, the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> grains became thoroughly alloyed together and will not separate at the eutectic temperature (a lower temperature than their solidification by diffusion) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the peculiarities of}} the production technology of reinforcing <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> Al - Ti(Zr) - C, Al - B - C and possibilities of their application for hardening of commercial-purity aluminium A 6 and wrought alloys AD 31 (A- 31). Technical aluminium (purity {{is not less than}} 99. 6 % (wt.)) was used as metallic basis for <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> obtaining. Thermostable nano - and microdimensional particles TiC, ZrC, C 2 Al 3 B 48 (almost insoluble with standard melting and casting temperatures) were synthesized in this aluminium at the temperature of 1000 - 1100 °C. For the purpose of estimation of crystallization rate on reinforcing <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> structure, the melt was poured into steel and copper water cooling form, and into water during granulated <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> obtaining. Chemical and phase composition of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> and microstructure of cast samples were investigated. Structure of all <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> includes three phases: aluminium solid solution (Alα); nano- and microdimensional particles ZrC, TiC, C 2 Al 3 B 48, regularly distributed in metallic matrix; titanium, zirconium and boron aluminides with needle-shaped or lamellar morphology. New composite alloys on the basis of aluminium and wrought alloy Al - Mg - Si were obtained with application of developed reinforcing <b>base</b> <b>metals.</b> There was found the influence of structure, cooling rate and alloy crystallization interval on microstructure and physical-mechanical properties of composite material. Increase of alloy cooling rate from 10 to 100 °C/s leads to crushing of structural components of <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> by 5 - 10 times. Thermal analysis data tell that alloy crystallization interval is decreased in the following range: (Al - Ti - C) → (Al - B - C) → (Al - Zr - C). Grain size is decreased in the same sequence, and alloy durability is increased...|$|R
