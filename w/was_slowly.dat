Neoclassicism came initially from France but <b>was</b> <b>slowly</b> adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style.

His alliance with the Persians resulted in the recovery of the Holy Sponge which fastened to the True Cross in an elaborate ceremony on 14 September 629. The ceremonial parade went toward the Hagia Sophia. There, the True Cross <b>was</b> <b>slowly</b> raised up until it vertically towered over the high altar.

5|$|Because {{it is both}} one of {{the first}} dinosaurs {{described}} and one of the best-known dinosaurs, Iguanodon has been well-placed as a barometer of changing public and scientific perceptions on dinosaurs. Its reconstructions have gone through three stages: the elephantine quadrupedal horn-snouted reptile satisfied the Victorians, then a bipedal but still fundamentally reptilian animal using its tail to prop itself up dominated the early 20th century, but <b>was</b> <b>slowly</b> overturned during the 1960s by its current, more agile and dynamic representation, able to shift from two legs to all fours.|$|E

The C.sativus clone <b>was</b> <b>slowly</b> propagated throughout much of Eurasia, later reaching parts of North Africa, North America, and Oceania.

5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it <b>was</b> <b>slowly</b> braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused {{the expansion of the}} universe to slowly begin to accelerate.|$|E

It {{had been a}} catastrophe for the network: of the 76 trams in circulation in 1939, 24 had been destroyed and 25 damaged; track and overhead lines had been mutilated; the Trianon depot had been bombed several times Still, service <b>was</b> <b>slowly</b> restored, thanks to the staff's hard work and above all passengers' help in shunting trailing cars. In 1945, 38 locomotives and 14 trailing cars were operational, but, despite restoration of service across the Seine on 20 April 1946, the war had struck a fatal blow. Rouen was full of out-of-date equipment and so trams were progressively replaced by buses and trolleybuses.|$|E

Jonas <b>was</b> <b>slowly</b> integrated into the story in a prolonged transition stage over {{the first half of}} season6. Nemec was open to continue playing Jonas Quinn after season6, but a new contract was reached with Michael Shanks for Daniel to return in season7.

5|$|The {{conquest of}} Amorium {{was not only}} a major {{military}} disaster and a heavy personal blow for Theophilos, but also a traumatic event for the Byzantines, its impact resonating in later literature. The sack did not ultimately alter the balance of power, which <b>was</b> <b>slowly</b> shifting in Byzantium's favour, but it thoroughly discredited the theological doctrine of Iconoclasm, ardently supported by Theophilos. As Iconoclasm relied heavily on military success for its legitimization, the fall of Amorium contributed decisively to its abandonment shortly after Theophilos's death in 842.|$|E

On 13 December 1945, the battalion's remaining personnel sailed for Australia, eventually returning to Puckapunyal. As the battalion's personnel were slowly demobilised or transferred out to other units its strength decreased rapidly until it was finally disbanded on 18 February 1946. Those personnel who were not discharged were transferred to other units for further service.|$|E
