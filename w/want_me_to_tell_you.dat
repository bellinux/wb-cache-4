500|$|Once {{the second}} race was over, Burton drove to victory lane {{after winning the}} race. In the next press conference, he said, [...] "It’s great to be in Victory Lane but we’ve got {{to keep it in}} {{perspective}} that this wasn’t the Daytona 500. You <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what’s going to happen on Sunday? We’re going to have 400 miles of some stuff happening, but then 100 miles of a lot of things happening. We’re going to have six or seven cautions in the last 100 laps, it’s going to be a short race to [...] chequered [...] and that’s what’s going to happen." [...] The second event took one hour, five minutes and 54 seconds to complete and the margin of victory was 0.005 seconds. A crowd of 80,000 people attended the races. The races had a television audience of 3.303 million people.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009, Clinton {{embarked}} on her longest trip yet, {{to a number}} of stops in Africa. On August 10, 2009, at a public event in Kinshasa, a Congolese student asked her what her husband, [...] "Mr Clinton", thought of a Chinese trade deal with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Clinton looked irritated at the question and replied, [...] "Wait, you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. So you ask my opinion, I will tell you my opinion. I am not going to be channeling my husband." [...] The incident was played in newsrooms around the world. Clinton aides suggested {{there might have been a}} mistranslation, but that was not the case; however the student had later apologized to her, saying he had meant to ask what [...] "Mr Obama" [...] thought.|$|E

6000|$|LADY CHILTERN. [Looking at {{him with}} amazement that is almost terror.] You <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Robert that the woman you {{expected}} was not Mrs. Cheveley, but myself? That it was I whom you thought was concealed in a room in your house, at half-past ten o’clock at night? You <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him that? ...|$|R

5000|$|English: He {{will arrive}} this evening. What do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{him when he}} comes? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all I {{think of}} you, and that isn't good for you, dad--not too often. It would be you {{who would have}} swelled head then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that you}} were irresistible? How could I have sent you away? But you! What made {{you come back to}} me with your very heart on your lips?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now then," [...] {{said the}} doctor, {{as the young}} man grasped his hand, [...] "you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> why your eyes are bloodshot, why your cheeks burn, and your hand is dry and hot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{felt that}} you would <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them. Shall we go now at once?" [...] said Deronda, much {{relieved}} by this unwavering compliance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry, Aunt Barbara," [...] she said; [...] "I {{was very}} self-willed; I {{ought not to}} have fancied things, nor said you used <b>me</b> ill, and <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> stories." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you?” I pursued with interest. “It {{would be}} utterly {{impossible}} to an American girl—I mean unperverted, and that’s the whole point—to talk as you’re talking <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... [With a smile.] Did you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that {{in so many}} words? I admire you, and I trust you. I {{should be}} very happy if George could grow into so brave and honest a man as you.|$|E
6000|$|... "That--I {{beg your}} pardon. I've {{no right to}} call him names." [...] The young fellow halted, {{and looked at her}} downcast face. [...] "Well, do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> to take him? That is too much. I {{did n't know you were}} cruel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will have}} to marry some day," [...] she said dreamily--"both of us. We have so much money {{that we will not}} be allowed to {{disappoint}} the public. Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the kind of a man I could love, Sis?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well." [...] She put {{her hand}} on his arm and he felt it tremble there, while she palpitated, [...] "We are all so glad you could go on to Rotterdam. My mother <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Everybody {{wonders why}} I {{continue}} working at this stage. I keep working because there's always new stories.... And {{as long as}} people <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them, I'll be there doing them. Eastwood, reflecting on his later career ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Simple things," [...] complained Jessie to her mother, [...] "that I {{used to do}} when I was {{no bigger}} than Essie, and yet she is always teasing one about how and why! She <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> why I carried one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you?</b> How I went {{twice a week}} to eat free dinners! How I took charity! How I was hungry! There was a rich {{cousin of}} my mother's--I {{used to go to}} him. I didn't like it. But if you're {{starving}} in the winter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She has {{got such}} an {{artificial}} mind," [...] said Mrs. Almond, who always enjoyed {{an opportunity to}} discuss Lavinia's peculiarities with her brother. [...] "She didn't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that she had asked me about Mr. Townsend; but I told her I would. She always wants to conceal everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never forget}} it," [...] she answered, {{and for the}} first time her change to a more natural tone helped him to believe in himself and his own judgment. [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how {{grateful}} I am, I might try, but it would be a very hard task." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a lady's secret? But {{in such a}} case as {{this the}} truth is always the best. She does wish it, with all her heart,--as much as any woman ever wished for anything. You need have no doubt about her loving you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, say," [...] {{she broke}} off suddenly, [...] "pa {{wants to see you}} about something. He <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>to</b> come down to-night." [...] She was dusting the floor at the moment, while he was moving the furniture. [...] "I wonder what he wants?" [...] she asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I disturb you, uncle?" [...] she asked; she did {{not call}} him great-uncle, because that, she rightly said, was ridiculous; and now, {{as part of the}} informality, she went on without waiting for him to answer, [...] "Because, you know, you <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you what I thought of your last story; and I've just read it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that's very well. A girl can be {{a hypocrite}} if she pleases, and perhaps she ought. Of course I shall be a hypocrite to all the world except you. I {{tell you what it}} is, Patty;--you make me tell you everything, and say that of course you and I are to tell everything,--and then you scold me. Don't you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> everything?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said; [...] "I {{suppose you}} know your business. You don't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that a decent excuse for having a row with this old Johnny is about {{the best thing that}} could happen to you. He's a bit too near the borders of {{civilisation}} to be a decent savage. Sooner or later some one will have to take him under their protection. If you don't do it, the French will. They're hanging round now looking out for an opportunity. Listen!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Candidates," [...] murmured Sunday, [...] "are only {{required}} to answer {{eight out of}} the seventeen questions on the paper. As far as I can make out, you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what I am, and what you are, and what this table is, and what this Council is, and what this world is for all I know. Well, I will {{go so far as}} to rend the veil of one mystery. If you want to know what you are, you are a set of highly well-intentioned young jackasses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My mother <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you," [...] she said, [...] "that {{she hopes}} you have begun your poem. She says every one ought to write poetry.... All my {{relations}} write poetry," [...] she went on. [...] "I can't bear {{to think of}} it sometimes--because, of course, it's none of it any good. But then one needn't read it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not long since, I {{was coming}} home in the dark when I found Lance talking to Tom Shanks in the wood. Lance said he had caught the fellow poaching, and I thought it strange they should talk quietly. I {{suspected}} he <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Jim, but I did not. His grudge against Jim had been getting worse." ...|$|R
60|$|She now <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{her where}} I {{had really been}} and what had {{happened}} <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I gave her a sketch of my adventures. Of course I could not enter deeply into particulars, for that would make too long a story, but I told her where I had stopped, and my accounts of the bear and the horse were deeply interesting.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll tempt me to {{more than}} that," [...] he cried passionately. [...] "Do you think it's for your help that I've thought of you? Do you think it's because you're an angel to me, because you've comforted me in my darkest, most miserable hours that I've dreamed of you and craved for you? There's more than that in my thoughts, dear. It's because you are you, yourself, that I've longed for you through the aching hours of the night, that I've sat and written like a man beside himself just for the joy of {{thinking}} that the words I wrote would be spoken by you. Oh! if you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what I feel--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are they not?" [...] he said, quite {{unaware that}} he hadn't named any. [...] "There {{he was with}} every symptom, heart so and so, eyes so and so, pulse this--I looked at him {{right in the eye}} and I said--'Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the truth?' 'Yes,' he said. 'Very good,' I answered, 'I will. You've got so and so.' He fell back as if shot. 'So and so!' he repeated, dazed. I went to the {{sideboard}} and poured him out a drink of such and such. 'Drink this,' I said. He drank it. 'Now,' I said, 'listen to what I say: You've got so and so. There's only one chance,' I said, 'you must limit your eating and drinking to such and such, you must sleep such and such, avoid every form of such and such--I'll give you a cordial, so many drops every so long, but mind you, unless you do so and so, it won't help you.' 'All right, very good.' Fellow promised. Off he went." ...|$|E
60|$|EVE. Of {{the coming}} true {{of your dreams}} and mine. Of newly created things. Of better things. My sons and my son's sons are not all diggers and fighters. Some of them will neither dig nor fight: they are more useless than either of you: they are weaklings and cowards: they are vain; yet they are dirty and will not take the trouble to cut their hair. They borrow and never pay; but one gives them what they want, because they tell {{beautiful}} lies in beautiful words. They can remember their dreams. They can dream without sleeping. They have not will enough to create instead of dreaming; but the serpent said that every dream could be willed into creation by those strong enough to believe in it. There are others who cut reeds of different lengths and blow through them, making lovely patterns of sound in the air; {{and some of them}} can weave the patterns together, sounding three reeds at the same time, and raising my soul to things for which I have no words. And others make little mammoths out of clay, or make faces appear on flat stones, and ask me to create women for them with such faces. I have watched those faces and willed; and then I have made a woman-child that has grown up quite like them. And others think of numbers without having to count on their fingers, and watch the sky at night, and give names to the stars, and can foretell when the sun will be covered with a black saucepan lid. And there is Tubal, who made this wheel for me which has saved me so much labor. And there is Enoch, who walks on the hills, and hears the Voice continually, and has given up his will to do the will of the Voice, and has some of the Voice's greatness. When they come, there is always some new wonder, or some new hope: something to live for. They never want to die, because they are always learning and always creating either things or wisdom, or at least dreaming of them. And then you, Cain, come to me with your stupid fighting and destroying, and your foolish boasting; and you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that it is all splendid, and that you are heroic, and that nothing but death or the dread of death makes life worth living. Away with you, naughty child; and do you, Adam, go on with your work and not waste your time listening to him.|$|E
60|$|Having {{got over}} my {{difficulties}} with the ladies, I found more difficulties {{waiting for me}} when I {{went back to my}} own room. In came Penelope--with the natural sweetness of women--to kiss and make it up again; and--with the natural curiosity of women--to ask another question. This time she only <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her what was the matter with our second housemaid, Rosanna Spearman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Appleby <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{you that}} that young feller, Ward Porton, ain't goin' {{to be with}} 'em no more," [...] {{announced}} Tad Rason to Dave. [...] "He says the young feller writ a letter sayin' {{that he was on}} the track of his parentage, and he guessed as how he'd have plenty of money of his own when he could prove who he was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Kate, half ashamed, but {{far more}} exultant, and hanging down her head; [...] "I came from London--I came by myself. My aunt <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story, and--and I have run away. O Charlie! take me home!" [...] and with a fresh access of alarm, she again threw her arms round him, as if to gain his {{protection}} from some enemy.|$|R
