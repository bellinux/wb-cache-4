25|$|On 4 April, the International Committee of the Red Cross {{called for}} a 24-hour ceasefire to deliver aid and {{supplies}} after the Saudi-led coalition blocked three aid shipments to Yemen. On 5 April, Reuters quoted a Houthi leader as saying the group would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down for peace talks if the airstrikes stopped and a neutral party acted as mediator. On 7 April, China added its support of a ceasefire in Yemen, following an appeal by the ICRC and Russia for a humanitarian pause.|$|E
25|$|On June 21, Johnson {{stated that}} he was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> out the Chiefs' {{training}} camp unless he and the Chiefs reach an agreement on a new contract. Johnson was absent {{at the start of}} training camp as contract talks were stalled. On July 25, reports surfaced of former starting running back Priest Holmes informing the team that he would arrive at training camp on the third day of practice (Saturday, July 28). Holmes was considered to be either acting as leverage to re-sign Johnson or even reclaim the starting position for himself if Johnson had decided to sit out. Holmes had not played since the middle of the 2005 season after suffering a severe neck injury against the San Diego Chargers, but remained on the team's payroll and roster.|$|E
500|$|The next {{objective}} of the forty-fifth was to fight German and Italian forces {{en route to the}} north coast of Sicily. The plan was to use Highway 124, one of Sicily's four major highways. This highway, originally in the American sector, had been usurped by Montgomery, with no word of the change of boundaries given to Middleton. [...] Word eventually came down from Alexander that the boundaries had been changed, which meant that when the forty-fifth reached the highway, they became frozen in place with no opportunity to advance. Middleton, not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> out the remainder of the battle, moved his division from the right of II Corps to the left, traveling ninety miles out of the way through back areas of the other American divisions, to get in position for the march north. [...] On 23 July the first elements of the forty-fifth reached the north coast of the island at Station Cerda, five miles east of Termini Imerese, taking thirteen days to move from south coast to north coast. The division then moved east along the coast, reaching its {{objective of}} Santo Stefano on 30 July. Here they were stormed by the Germans, but fought back, forcing the German rear guard out of the area by the following morning. This was the end of active fighting for the forty-fifth in Sicily, where the division endured 1,156 casualties while taking nearly 11,000 prisoners.|$|E

2500|$|On August 30, 2009, Crabtree {{became the}} very last holdout and {{unsigned}} draft pick from the 2009 NFL draft when Andre Smith, the 6th overall pick, signed with the Bengals. That day was also the 32nd day of Crabtree's holdout, and only 10 days short of the all-time long holdout for any 49ers rookie in the franchise's history. Beat reporter Matt Maiocco had reported rumors that the signing could have happened around Labor Day, {{but that did not}} occur as the sides remained at a complete impasse. Over Labor Day weekend Deion Sanders, an NFL reporter and Crabtree counselor, stated on the NFL Total Access show that Crabtree was indeed <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> out the entire season. Sanders also claimed that the rookie receiver was not in [...] "dire need" [...] of money at that time.|$|E
2500|$|Even as {{the film}} {{was in the first}} weeks of its 1989 {{theatrical}} release, rumors were circulating of a wave sequence missing from the film's end. As chronicled in the 1993 laserdisc Special Edition release and later in the 2000 DVD, the pressure to cut the film's running time stemmed from both distribution concerns and Industrial Light & Magic's then-inability to complete the required sequences. From the distributor's perspective, the looming three-hour length limited the number of times the film could be shown each day, assuming that audiences would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> through the entire film, though 1990's Dances with Wolves would shatter both industry-held notions. Further, test audience screenings revealed a surprisingly mixed reaction to the sequences as they appeared in their unfinished form; in post-screening surveys, they dominated both the [...] "Scenes I liked most" [...] and [...] "Scenes I liked least" [...] fields. Contrary to speculation, studio meddling was not the cause of the shortened length; Cameron held final cut as long {{as the film}} met a running time of roughly two hours and 15 minutes. He later noted, [...] "Ironically, the studio brass were horrified when I said I was cutting the wave." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 2008 {{presidential primary}} campaign, Romney had {{distinguished}} his prescription for {{the automotive industry}} from rival candidate John McCain's by calling for a five-fold increase, to $20 billion per year over five years, in federal funding {{for research and development}} in energy, fuel technology, materials science, and automotive technology. In a January 14 speech, he stated, “I’m not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> back and say, ‘… Too bad for the people who’ve lost their jobs. They’re gone forever.’" [...] As the automotive industry crisis of 2008 arose amidst the near collapse of the private-sector credit market and banking industry in late 2008, Romney argued against a bailout with direct government loans of the auto industry. He proposed that struggling auto manufacturers should undergo managed bankruptcy, after which they should seek loans from the private-sector credit market with government-backed loan guarantees. Writing in an op-ed article published in the New York Times in November 2008 (his original title had been [...] "The Way Forward for the Auto Industry" [...] but the editors published the article under the title [...] "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt"), Romney said, [...] "If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye." [...] In referring to his proposal for managed bankruptcy, he said [...] "t would permit the companies to shed excess labor, pension and real estate costs." [...] The Obama Administration ultimately implemented managed bankruptcy reorganizations of the General Motors and Chrysler corporations in combination with the direct government financing that Romney had opposed, after which Romney said that he deserved credit for the auto industry's recovery.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the WCW wrestlers' {{absences}} {{were out}} of the WWF's control. Many of WCW's top wrestlers had contracts with AOL Time Warner, WCW's parent company, and were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> at home rather than wrestle for less money; Booker T, the reigning WCW Champion at the time of WWF's purchase, was a notable exception, agreeing to a buyout of the remainder of his contract with AOL Time Warner in order to wrestle for the WWF immediately. McMahon had the option of taking on any contract he wanted with his purchase, but chose to let AOL Time Warner continue to pay out what were considered bad deals. Ric Flair and Rey Mysterio were not signed {{until the end of the}} Invasion because they were tied to their contracts, and therefore their absence was out of the WWF's control. In addition, Scott Steiner was recovering from an injury. Others, such as Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Goldberg, were not signed until well after the storyline finished. As for WCW's other top superstars, Sting was still under contract to AOL Time Warner, and did not join the now-WWE until late 2014, while Lex Luger and Randy Savage would never reappear in the company on TV (in May 2011, Luger rejoined WWE in a backstage role related to the company's Wellness Program, while Savage died of a sudden heart attack later the same month). Fans were confused by McMahon's decisions seeing as the WWF would make more than enough to cover all these wrestlers contracts in 2001. Because of this, the WWF's opponent allegedly lacked the strong identity of WCW. In correlation with WCW, ECW was also missing most of their key superstars such as The Sandman, Sabu, Balls Mahoney, Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke (all of whom would later join WWE's relaunched ECW). Other wrestlers such as Shane Douglas, Masato Tanaka, Terry Funk, New Jack, 2 Cold Scorpio and Mikey Whipwreck would also be missing from the storyline. The WWF itself would be missing some of its biggest stars, most notably Triple H, who tore his left quadriceps muscle just before the start of the storyline and wouldn't return until the 2002 Royal Rumble, well after the Invasion angle ended. Shawn Michaels, who was under a four-year retirement at the time, was on hiatus from WWF and also didn't appear during the Invasion storyline and Rikishi was inactive throughout the entire storyline with an injured shoulder. Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit who were former [...] WCW/ECW stars, working for WWF at the time, were also absent from the storyline. Benoit was hinted to defect to WCW before his injury in June 2001.|$|E

It was not an inn the year round; it became such only at certain seasons, of which the present was not one. It had the habit of putting up pilgrims {{on their way to the}} Dragon Peak; between the times of its pious offices it relapsed into a simple farmhouse.
