40|$|The {{utilisation}} of low-grade biomass {{requires an}} appropriate technology {{that meets the}} increased demands regarding emission reduction (e. g. NOx). Within this work a new burner for low calorific value (LCV) gas applying flameless oxidation (FLOX®) will be presented that replaces the conventional flame burner of a dual-chamber furnace. The integration of an adapted FLOX®-burner has shown several benefits. Different bio-residues were tested and a more stable combustion with enhanced burnout was achieved for all tested fuels. Furthermore, the burner can be operated in broader range of operation and closer to stoichiometric conditions. Due to the high power density of a FLOX®-burner the complete facility could be downsized in the future. Still, the tests {{have shown that the}} NOx reduction potential of a FLOX®-burner is limited for LCV gas combustion since the most NO emissions are related to fuel-bond nitrogen. In the LCV gases generated from <b>wheat</b> <b>pellets</b> and rape cake pellets high concentrations of NO-precursors (NH 3 and HCN) are measured that are subsequently be oxidized to NO in the FLOX®-burner. Therefore, an air-staged burner for N-rich LCV gases based on flameless combustion is proposed where NO-precursors can be reduced to N 2 in a first substoichiometric region. CFD simulations were applied to investigate an appropriate design of an air-staged FLOX®-burner. Special emphasis is placed on the creation of a sufficient internal recirculation of flue gases required for flameless combustion. First results of CFD simulations are presented. ...|$|E

It has been hypothesized that birds fed whole wheat have improved gizzard health and are able to self-select whole grain to better meet their individual nutritional needs. In 6 dietary treatments, the effect of diluting turkey diets with different amounts of whole and <b>pelleted</b> <b>wheat</b> was investigated. In the diets diluted with whole wheat, the whole wheat was blended with the other feed ingredients after they had been steam pelleted. In the diets diluted with <b>pelleted</b> <b>wheat,</b> the extra wheat used to dilute the rations was ground and then blended with the other ingredients prior to pelleting. The influence of adding extra synthetic amino acids to diluted diets was also studied. All diets were supplemented with a commercial feed enzyme. Dilution, without extra synthetic amino acid supplementation, resulted in large reductions in body weight, feed efficiency, and breast meat yield. At the highest level of dilution, where whole wheat dilution was 50 % of the diet, body weight and weight of breast meat per bird were reduced by 15 and 20 %, respectively. No advantage was observed in diluting with whole <b>wheat</b> compared with <b>pelleted</b> <b>wheat.</b> Addition of extra synthetic amino acids restored 66 % of the body weight and 56 % of the breast meat lost at the highest level of whole wheat dilution. These results suggest that reports of successful dilution of poultry rations are more likely due to formulation with excess nutrient levels of the undiluted diets rather than to a specific benefit to feeding whole grain...|$|R

A key concept in this hypothesis is aversion, the decrease in preference for food just eaten {{as a result of}} sensory input (taste, odor, texture, i. e., a food 2 ̆ 7 s flavor) and postingestive effects (of toxins and nutrients on chemo-, osmo-, and mechano-receptors) unique to each food. On the basis of this hypothesis, we predicted lambs would prefer familiar and novel foods that complemented the macronutrient composition of their basal diet. To assess the validity of this prediction, we fed 10 lambs in each of three treatments different levels of ground barley (high in energy) and alfalfa (high in protein) as a basal diet. We then offered them daily a meal of three ground foods differing in proportions of barley and alfalfa (familiar foods) or <b>wheat</b> and rabbit <b>pellets</b> (novel foods).

The user identifies a list of all available fuels which are compatible with their specific energy system. The ranking tool is suitable for users of any sized bioenergy system used for space heating, processing heating, or electricity generation. Through effective communication the engineer lists the user’s performance requirements. Requirements considered in this thesis are economic cost of fuels, required storage space, combustion equipment cleaning, and air pollutants emitted during biofuel combustion. Performance indicators corresponding to the user’s requirements are then selected or developed by the engineer. Data is then collected by the engineer to be used for the evaluation of these indicators. The indicators are then combined using weighting factors by the engineer to assign a single numerical score to each fuel. These scores allow the fuels to quickly and easily be ranked by the user according to how well they satisfy the user’s requirements. The ranking tool is demonstrated by applying it to a situation of a pellet stove user with 3 available fuel types.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringDonghai WangLignocellulosic biomass such as {{agricultural}} residues {{tends to}} be a sustainable feedstock for production of biofuels and biobased products in the long term due to its high availability and relative low cost. However, conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels faces significant technical challenges. One of the major challenges is biomass logistics. The agricultural residues are often harvested during a limited harvest season and stored as bales with low bulk density, making them difficult to handle, transport, store, and use in their natural forms. Densification of biomass by pelleting process could significantly improve the bulk density of biomass and thus improve handling efficiency and reduce transportation and handing costs. The main focus of this research was to better understand the impacts of pelleting process as well as pelleting conditions on physical properties, chemical compositions, biomass structure, and fermentable sugar yield of sorghum stalk, corn stover, wheat straw, and big bluestem. Results showed that pelleting process can increase biomass density up to 9 - 12 folds. Pelleting condition such as hammer mill screen size and ring-die pelleting mill die thickness had significant effects on bulk density, true density, and durability of biomass pellets. Although the pelleting process did not show significant effects on chemical composition of biomass before dilute-acid pretreatment process, glucan content of biomass pellets increased with the increase in ring-die pelleting mill die thickness and decreased with the increase in mill screen size after dilute-acid pretreatment. Opposite trend was observed for xylan content of biomass pellets as affected by pelleting conditions after dilute-acid pretreatment process. Biomass crystallinity increased after pelleting process, but not in a significant level. Softened surface region of biomass was removed after pelleting process, making the biomass more amendable to enzymatic attack. In this study, the optimum pelleting conditions were to grind the biomass feed using a 6. 5 -mm mill screen and to pellet biomass using a 44. 5 -mm ring-die pelleting mill die thickness. Under this optimum pelleting condition, the enzymatic conversion of cellulose of <b>wheat</b> straw <b>pellets</b> was the highest (94. 1 %), followed by corn stover pellet (93. 1 %), sorghum stalk pellet (92. 1 %), and big bluestem pellet (91. 1 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Biochar {{has been}} heralded as a {{promising}} technology for {{climate change mitigation}} that can also benefit soils. Biochar is a carbonaceous solid produced by pyrolysis of biomass – the thermal decomposition of plant and plant-derived matter {{in the absence of}} oxygen. When added to soils, biochar has the potential to increase crop yields and suppress soil emissions of greenhouse gases, whilst sequestering carbon in a stable form. In addition to biochar, biomass pyrolysis produces liquids and gases that can serve as biofuels. Biochar production systems that generate excess heat or power are particularly environmentally and economically attractive. Rotary kilns are the favoured process reactor in many industries, given their potential to handle a wide range of feedstocks and provide good process control. This thesis investigates the potential to coproduce biochar and excess biofuels by slow pyrolysis in a pilot-scale rotary kiln. The work attempts to progress towards the ultimate aim of scaling up the rotary kiln and optimising its operating conditions to produce biochar of good quality along with an excess of useful biofuels. Experimental work, involving the development and application of new methodologies, was used {{to gain a better understanding}} of the process. The data gathered were then used to support preliminary numerical simulation efforts towards the development of a comprehensive process model. Five biomass feedstocks were considered: softwood pellets, miscanthus straw <b>pellets,</b> <b>wheat</b> straw <b>pellets,</b> oilseed rape straw pellets and raw rice husks. The granular flow of biomass feedstocks was observed in a short closed drum faced with acrylic and resting on rollers. All pelletized feedstocks displayed similar angles of repose, validating the use of softwood pellets as a model biomass for these feedstocks. Bed mixing, which can improve product uniformity, was slow under typical operating conditions, requiring 5 min to complete at 4 rpm for softwood pellets. Mixing quickened considerably at higher rotation rates. A digital image analysis method was developed to measure the distribution of solid residence times inside the rotary kiln. The mean residence time of softwood pellets ranged from 19 to 37 min under typical operating conditions, decreasing with increases in kiln rotation rate, but mostly unaffected by feeding rates. These findings show that kiln rotation rates must be selected to balance the residence time of solids inside the kiln with bed mixing levels. Thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry were performed on samples of ground softwood pellets under five different heating profiles to study the kinetics and heat flows of the pyrolysis process. Both exothermic and endothermic regions were identified, with most reactions taking place between 250 °C and 500 °C. Results suggest that exothermic pyrolysis reactions can be promoted by altering the process heating rate, thereby improving net biofuel yield from the process. The thermogravimetric data collected was used to develop a distributed activation energy model (DAEM) of the kinetics of softwood pellet pyrolysis for integration into a comprehensive model of the process. The applicability of the kinetic model to large-scale processes was confirmed using a simplified process model developed to simulate biomass pyrolysis inside the pilot-scale rotary kiln. Although crude, the simplified process model produced sufficiently accurate estimates of char yield for preliminary design purposes. The simplified model also allowed important process parameters, such as kiln filling degree, solid residence time and heating rate, to be evaluated. A series of pyrolysis experiments was performed on the pilot-scale rotary kiln to evaluate the yields of biochar and biofuels and determine the temperature profile inside the kiln. This work required the design of a suspended thermocouple system that measures temperatures along the kiln, both in the gas phase and inside the solid bed. For most experiments at 550 °C, a region of high temperature gas and solids was observed, possibly indicative of exothermic reactions. Biochar yield varied from 18...|$|R

Each diet was fed ad libitum to eight pens of two male Ross 308 broilers from 10 to 24 days of age. Feeding pelleted diets improved (P 0. 05). Feeding different <b>wheat</b> types and <b>pelleting</b> did not (P> 0. 05) change the development of the gastrointestinal tract of the birds. The study showed that there were differences between four wheat samples when they were fed in pelleted complete feed, but no differences were observed when fed in mash form complete diets.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether {{the use of a}} judgement bias task with differential reinforcement was suitable to assess emotional states (positive or negative affect) in domestic hens. Six hens were trained to discriminate between a vertical and horizontal rectangle using an operant procedure with differential reinforcement to each stimulus in order to induce a positive or negative affect. Three ambiguous rectangles were introduced at intermediate angles and responses to these and the two learned rectangles were used to measure for judgement bias. Initial judgement bias probes measured response bias using three different foods as reinforcement; poultry <b>pellets,</b> <b>wheat</b> and puffed wheat in a one food magazine operant chamber. The chamber was then modified from a single food magazine to a double food magazine allowing six different food combinations with the three foods and differing reinforcement periods. Judgement bias probes measured response bias to the learned and ambiguous rectangles using combinations of each food type. Overall response latencies revealed a consistent pattern across all six hens with the fastest response times to the vertical (positive) stimulus and slowest response times to the horizontal (negative) stimulus. Results indicate that judgement bias was best measured and identified in the one food magazine chamber with four of the six hens consistently demonstrating positive affect and two hens demonstrating slight negative affect. It was found that results varied in the double magazine chamber revealing both response bias and food preference...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} {{performance of a}} 50 MW parabolic trough Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant hybridised with different fuels was determined using a Life Cycle Assessment methodology. Six different scenarios were investigated, half of which involved hybridisation with fossil fuels (natural gas, coal and fuel oil), {{and the other three}} involved hybridisation with renewable fuels (<b>wheat</b> straw, wood <b>pellets</b> and biogas). Each scenario was compared to a solar-only operation. Nine different environmental categories as well as the Cumulative Energy Demand and the Energy Payback Time (EPT) were evaluated using Simapro software for 1 MWh of electricity produced. The results indicate a worse {{environmental performance}} for a CSP plant producing 12 % of the electricity from fuel than in a solar-only operation for every indicator, except for the eutrophication and toxicity categories, whose results for the natural gas scenario are slightly better. In the climate change category, the results ranged between 26. 9 and 187 kg CO 2 eq/MWh, where a solar-only operation had the best results and coal hybridisation had the worst. Considering a weighted single score indicator, the environmental impact of the renewable fuels scenarios is approximately half of those considered in fossil fuels, with the straw scenario showing the best results, and the coal scenario the worstones. EPT for solar-only mode is 1. 44 years, while hybridisation scenarios EPT vary in a range of 1. 72 - 1. 83 years for straw and pellets respectively. The fuels with more embodied energy are biomethane and wood pellets...|$|R

40|$|Eight Holstein steers (216 ± 48 kg body weight) {{fitted with}} ruminal and {{duodenal}} cannulas {{were used to}} evaluate effects of wheat straw processing (ground vs pelleted) at two straw inclusion rates (7 % and 14 %; dry matter basis) in dry rolled or steam-flaked corn-based finishing diets on characteristics of digestion. The experimental design was a split plot consisting of two simultaneous 4 × 4 Latin squares. Increasing straw level reduced ruminal (p 0. 10) by wheat straw level. Likewise, straw level did not influence ruminal acetate and propionate molar proportions or estimated methane production (p> 0. 10). Pelleting straw did not affect (p≥ 0. 48) ruminal digestion of OM, NDF, and starch, or microbial efficiency. Ruminal feed N digestion was greater (7. 4 %; p = 0. 02) for ground than for <b>pelleted</b> <b>wheat</b> straw diets. Although ruminal starch digestion was not affected by straw processing, post-ruminal (p 0. 14) by corn processing. However, microbial N flow to the small intestine and ruminal N efficiency (non-ammonia N flow to the small intestine/N intake) were greater (p< 0. 01) for steam-flaked than for dry rolled corn-based diets. Ruminal pH and total VFA concentration were not affected (p≥ 0. 16) by corn processing method. Compared with dry rolled corn, steam-flaked corn-based diets resulted in decreased acetate:propionate molar ratio (p = 0. 02). It is concluded that at 7 % or 14 % straw inclusion rate, changes in physical characteristics of wheat straw brought about by pelleting negatively impact OM digestion of both steam-flaked and dry-rolled corn-based finishing diets. This effect is due to decreased post-ruminal starch digestion. Replacement of ground straw with pelleted straw also may decrease ruminal pH...|$|R
40|$|The {{aleurone}} layer {{is the major}} wheat bran component containing significant amounts of nutritionally important mate-rials (McMasters et al., 1964). However, its cells have such relatively heavy cell walls compared to endosperm cells that the question arises {{as to whether the}} nutrients in raw whole bran or shorts are completely available. Work by Rohrlich and Rasmus (1955) shows clearly that protein digesti-bility in aleurone cells depends on the ease with which enzymes can penetrate the cell wall structure. Cave et al. (1965 a, b) found that cer-tain wheat milling fractions gave relatively low metabolizable energy values and poor protein utilization when they constituted an important part of chick diets. They also showed that steam <b>pelleting</b> <b>wheat</b> bran in-creased its metabolizable energy (M. E.) in chick diets by as much as 30 percent over unpelleted mash. An increase of 17 percent was found for steam-pelleted wheat shorts over unpelleted material. Pelleting poul-try rations has been known for almost 40 years, but no adequate reasons have been developed to fully account for the obvious benefits derived from this processing treat-ment (Calet, 1965). To determine the cause of the observed energy increase, we fed hard red spring wheat bran mash and steam pellets to 8 -week-old chicks.

40|$|Starch {{from corn}} is less {{susceptible}} to equine small intestinal digestion than starch from oats, and starch that reaches the hindgut can be utilized by the microbiota. The objective {{of the current study}} was to examine the effects of starch source on equine fecal microbiota. Thirty horses were assigned to treatments: control (hay only), HC (high corn), HO (high oats), LC (low corn), LO (low oats), and LW (low <b>pelleted</b> <b>wheat</b> middlings). Horses received an all-forage diet (2 wk; d - 14 to d - 1) before the treatment diets (2 wk; d 1 to 14). Starch was introduced gradually so that horses received 50 % of the assigned starch amount (high = 2 g starch/kg BW; low = 1 g starch/kg BW) by d 4 and 100 % by d 11. Fecal samples were obtained at the end of the forage-only period (S 0; d - 2), and on d 6 (S 1) and d 13 (S 2) of the treatment period. Cellulolytics, lactobacilli, Group D Gram-positive cocci (GPC), lactate-utilizers and amylolytics were enumerated. Enumeration data were log transformed and analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. There were sample day × treatment interactions (P 0. 05). All treatments except LO resulted in increased amylolytics and decreased cellulolytics, but the changes were larger in horses fed corn and wheat middlings (P < 0. 05). Feeding oats resulted in increased lactobacilli and decreased GPC (P < 0. 05), while corn had the opposite effects. LW had increased lactobacilli and GPC (P < 0. 05). The predominant amylolytic isolates from HC, LC and LW on S 2 were identified by 16 S RNA gene sequencing as Enterococcus faecalis, but other species were found in oat fed horses. These results demonstrate that starch source can have a differential effect on the equine fecal microbiota...|$|R
40|$|DoktorgradsavhandlingThe {{government}} in Norway aims {{to double the}} bioenergy use from 14 TWh to 28 TWh between the year 2008 and 2020. This calls for {{major changes in the}} current energy practice and an increase in the biomass based energy applications in the total energy mix. One effort to this end is the replacement of existing space heating oil burners with heat from biomass combustion. However, this strategy alone could not be able to adequately meet the target of further bioenergy expansion. Neither will it help in achieving the Kyoto aim of reducing CO 2 emission. So an alternative such as gasification could {{be a part of the}} solution. Gasification offers many advantages, but a major concern towards this technology is the logistics. A highly efficient gasification process would mean very little to a technical viability if efficient biomass supply is not guaranteed. Thus maintaining a smooth biomass supply to the conversion plant is important in perspective of which local lignocellulosic biomass could be an interesting option. In terms of the availability of lignocellulosic biomass, Norway is strategically well placed due thanks to its abundant forest reserves. Norway and forest are the two sides of the same coin which makes this country ever attractive in developing and practicing local bioenergy research, which is partly why this study is conducted. The main objective of the present project was to utilize local forest crops birch, oak and spruce and energy crops like poplar and willow as feedstocks for labscale fixed bed downdraft gasification. Further to evaluate the gasification performance interaction with biomass characteristics and process parameters, experimental work consisted of series of gasification tests was optimized over a range of air equivalence ratio (ER) between 0. 19 and 0. 45. The key results in terms of gas lower heating value (LHV), gas yield, cold gas efficiency (CGE) and carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) indicated that the producer gas obtained from all types of woodchips species gasification exhibited a great potential to be utilized for further downstream applications. Besides wood, in many places of the world the lion’s share of the biomass is contributed from herbaceous biomass. Hence this research also focused on two local herbaceous biomasses, alfalfa and <b>wheat</b> straw (in <b>pellets)</b> from Spain and one local herbaceous biomass common reed (in briquettes) from Norway for investigating gasification via two fluidized bed configurations being pilot-scale and lab-scale, and one fixed-bed downdraft gasifier respectively. Pilot-scale 4. 7 kg/h air-blown gasification of sole alfalfa pellets was carried out at a variable ER between 0. 25 and 0. 30. The resulting bed temperature was ca 780 C and the maximum producer gas lower heating value (LHV) was ca 4. 2 MJ/Nm 3 which suits for combined heat and power application. Pilot-scale test also yielded producer gas composition rich in H 2 composition (around 13 % dry basis vol.), indicating the potential of this gas to be utilized for hydrogen production. In addition to the pilot-scale tests, a series of lab-scale fluidized bed gasification on alfalfa and <b>wheat</b> straw <b>pellets</b> were conducted for a wide range of ER (0. 20 - 0. 35) achieved by varying both fuel and air input. The optimized gasification performance attained for the two feedstocks differed in respect to the operational ER with a higher ER (0. 35) for alfalfa and a lower ER (0. 30) for wheat straw respectively. At the optimum condition, the gas produced from both the feedstocks exhibited a good LHV value above 4. 1 MJ/Nm 3 which can be recommended for engine or, turbine application. However, owing to the poor H 2 composition of 4 %, this technology may not suit downstream H 2 production. The fixed bed gasification on common reed briquettes on the other hand is a very recent addition to the current project which is not fully developed yet. Therefore the preliminary results obtained from a solitary test run were not representative. The measured parameters so far indicated that the gas LHV, bed temperature and ER range of 2. 9 MJ/Nm 3, 498 C and 0. 35 - 0. 86 respectively can be achieved. Last but not the least, a techno-economic modeling considering a producer gas generator in a 100 % renewable energy hybrid plant was performed for a standalone household in Grimstad by using HOMER (a commercial hybrid energy optimization tool). The results showed that producer gas generator together with the other renewable energy options is capable of fulfilling the annual electricity demand of a remote household with a constraint of a producer gas price less than 0. 1 $/Nm 3. This system also provided environmental gain worth ~ 22, 000 kg/year of CO 2 equivalent savings. All in all, the influence of diverse local biomass feedstock on diverse gasification techniques is proved to be feasible in aspects of technology, economy and sustainability...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the main cereal and feed form of the diet on performance and digestive tract traits was studied in 576 brown-egg laying pullets from 1 to 120 d of age. From 1 to 45 d of age, 4 diets arranged factorially with 2 cereals (corn vs. wheat) and 2 feed forms (mash vs. pellets) were used. Each treatment was replicated 6 times (24 pullets per replicate). From 46 to 120 d of age, all diets were offered in mash form and the only difference among diets was the cereal used. Cumulatively, pullets fed the corn diets had higher BW gain (P < 0. 05) but similar feed conversion ratio as pullets fed the wheat diets. From 1 to 45 d of age, pullets fed pellets consumed more feed (P < 0. 001) and had higher BW gain (P < 0. 001) than those fed mash. Most of the beneficial effects of pelleting on productive performance were still evident at 120 d of age. At 45 d of age, gizzard weight (g/kg of BW) was higher (P < 0. 01) in pullets fed corn than in pullets fed <b>wheat</b> diets. Feeding <b>pellets</b> reduced the relative weight of the digestive tract and the gizzard (P < 0. 001) {{as well as the}} length (cm/kg of BW) of the small intestine (P < 0. 01) at both ages. The pH of gizzard contents at 120 d of age was not affected by cereal but was lower in pullets that were fed mash from 1 to 45 d of age (P < 0. 01). We conclude that wheat can be used in substitution of corn in pullet diets with only a slight reduction in BW gain and that feeding pellets from 1 to 45 d of age increased BW gain and pH of the gizzard and reduced the relative weight of the gizzard and the length of the gastrointestinal tract at 120 d of age...|$|R
40|$|Six hens’ {{preferences}} between {{whole grain}} <b>wheat,</b> commercial laying <b>pellets</b> and puffed <b>wheat</b> were assessed using a free-access procedure. Wheat {{was found to}} be the preferred food of three hens, pellets were preferred by one, puffed wheat {{was found to be}} not preferred by four, and two hens had no preference for any food. The hens were then maintained at 80 % ± 10 % of their free-feeding body weights by one of the three foods while responding under a progressive ratio schedule in which the response requirement doubled after each reinforcer. A session terminated after a hen had ceased responding for 300 s. All three foods were used as reinforcers and then the maintenance food was changed. Thus all three foods served as reinforcers with each of the three maintenance diets. Response rates, post-reinforcement pauses and demand functions (i. e., the relation between estimated consumption rate and response requirement) under each response requirement were examined. Performance was not affected systematically across hens by diet or reinforcer type. There were no systematic relations between the individual hen’s food preferences and any of the performance measures. The same hens were then maintained at 80 % ± 10 % of their free-feeding body weight by pellets and responded under fixed ratio schedules with the response requirement doubling each session until a hen received no reinforcers in a session. Sessions terminated after 40 reinforcers or 40 min. Each of the three foods served as the reinforcer for two series of the increasing fixed ratio schedules. The resulting demand functions did not differ over reinforcer type and no relation found between the type of reinforcer and the individual hen’s preferences. Performance (including the shape of the demand functions) was found to be similar under both the progressive and fixed ratio schedules. It is suggested that the provision of post-feed outside of the experimental sessions and the hen’s low body weights could explain why {{there was no difference in}} demand between conditions with different maintenance diets and reinforcer types...|$|R
