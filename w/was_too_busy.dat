5|$|The singing hobo in {{the episode}} was voiced by Hank Azaria. He would {{originally}} be voiced by Jim Carrey, but {{he dropped out}} {{when he found out}} that he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to record his lines. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.8million viewers, finishing in 33rd place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its home video release, the episode received mixed reviews from critics.|$|E

5|$|In 2002 {{producers}} asked Barlow {{to return}} as Mavis, but she <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy.</b> In 2006 Barlow claimed {{that she had}} again been asked to return to Coronation Street, but had refused as she felt the storylines were {{not good enough for}} Mavis. Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return, because she would be unable to cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997. Executive producer Kim Crowther said in 2009 that she would have liked Mavis to return to the serial.|$|E
5|$|When Scott Rudin was {{adapting}} Wonder Boys for the screen, {{the author}} declined {{an offer to}} write the screenplay, saying he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> writing The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. Directed by Curtis Hanson and starring Michael Douglas, Wonder Boys was released in 2000 to critical acclaim and financial failure. Having bought the film rights to The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, Rudin then asked Chabon {{to work on that}} film's screenplay. Although Chabon spent 16 months in 2001 and 2002 working on the novel's film adaptation, the project has been mired in pre-production for years.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Ahmad Dhani {{threatened}} to disband the group if Maia did not cut back on her performance schedule; he felt she <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy,</b> {{to the point of}} forgetting their children. Dhani later withdrew his threat, but– after becoming manager– limited the group to one performance a week. He then fired the group's manager, Vita Ramona, who {{threatened to}} bring Dhani to court if he did not apologize for perceived defamation. This situation was exacerbated when Mulan publicly complained of not receiving her share of the band's money and a lack of transparency in the management. She resigned on 30 January 2007, after waiting ten days for her open letter to the management to receive a reply. Mulan then hired a lawyer and sued Dhani, resulting in her contract fee being returned.|$|E

5|$|Diệm's trip {{came after}} two years of American {{attempts}} to schedule a state visit. In 1955, Washington made two attempts to organise a trip while Diệm was still prime minister, but he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> quelling opposition groups and his grip on power was tenuous. Diệm took care of this by crushing the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate in the Battle for Saigon in May 1955, and then deposed Bảo Đại and proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam after his brother Ngô Đình Nhu rigged a referendum that made him head of state. Diệm was credited with 98.2% of the votes and 133% in the capital Saigon. The South Vietnamese leader's visit was organized after he indicated interest in February 1957 to US Ambassador to South Vietnam Frederick Reinhardt.|$|E
5|$|Within {{months of}} his {{admission}} to the bar, Benjamin argued his first case before the Supreme Court of Louisiana and won. Still, clients were slow to come in his first years in practice, and he had enough free time to compile and publish, with Thomas Slidell, the Digest of the Reported Decisions of the Superior Court of the Late Territory of Orleans and the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana in 1834, which required the analysis of 6,000 cases. The book was an immediate success and helped launch Benjamin's career. When Slidell published a revised edition in 1840, he did so alone, as Benjamin <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> trying cases {{to allow him to}} participate.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E

5|$|In 1723, the Commissioners of the Kent and Sussex Rother Levels {{employed}} the civil engineering contractor John Reynolds to make repairs to Scots Float Sluice, a timber {{lock on the}} lower river. He built a dovetailed sheet pile wall below the foundations, and the Commissioners offered him the job of maintaining the levels in 1725, for which he would be paid £65 per year. He moved to Iden and held the post for fourteen years. Silting of the river estuary caused mounting problems with the drainage of the levels during the 1720s. Reynolds carried out further work on the sluice in 1729, and in 1732 reconstructed it to provide an extra outlet. Several new channels were excavated through the levels in the early 1730s, {{so that all the}} runoff passed through Scots Float. Reynolds resigned his post in 1739 as he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> with other engineering projects.|$|E
5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with {{a failure of the}} hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The gunner responsible for closing and locking the breech failed to do so and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter. He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry firmly {{believed}} that throwaway clothes were {{the future of}} the industry, and this idea was incorporated into the costumes of The Motion Picture. William Ware Theiss, the designer who created the original television series costumes, <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to work on the film. Instead Robert Fletcher, considered one of American theater's most successful costume and scenic designers, was selected to design the new uniforms, suits, and robes for the production. Fletcher eschewed man-made synthetics for natural materials, finding that these fabrics sewed better and lasted longer. As times had changed, the Starfleet uniforms, with their bright reds, blues, greens, and golds, had to be revised: the miniskirts worn by females in the original series would now be considered sexist. Wise deemed the original multicolored uniforms too garish, and Fletcher {{believed that}} the brightness of these old designs would work against believability when seen on the wide screen—the designer's first task was to create new, less conspicuous uniforms.|$|E

5|$|Ziskin {{initially}} considered hiring Buck Henry {{to write}} the adaptation, finding Fight Club similar to the 1967 film The Graduate, which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered Peter Jackson the best choice, but Jackson <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> filming the 1996 film The Frighteners in New Zealand. Bryan Singer received the book but did not read it. Danny Boyle met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. David Fincher, who had read Fight Club and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film Alien 3 for the studio. To repair {{his relationship with the}} studio, he met with Ziskin and studio head Bill Mechanic. In August 1997, 20th Century Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of Fight Club.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{then headed}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes {{returned}} from injury, so Hassett {{returned to his}} customary position in the middle order. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, the tourists skittled Yardley’s men for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon. With the score at 1/10, Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston. Edrich failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around 10m. Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, diving sideways to get two hands to the ball. Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who waited for Compton to regain his bat and composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out. However, Compton only made four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April Cunningham was to {{have his}} most {{successful}} night, shooting down three bombers (victories no. 8–10). On patrol near the south coast he engaged a He 111 over Monmouthshire which he shot down with only 40 rounds. He returned to Middle Wallop only to be sent on patrol for a second sortie. He took off and headed south, towards Southampton. GCI <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to employ {{him and he was}} granted a request to investigate a searchlight cone towards Marlborough. Rawnsley directed him to attack and he duly shot down the He 111 which crashed into derelict houses in Southampton. He was sent by GCI after another enemy but lost the contact, appearing over Southampton again he spotted yet another He 111 in the moonlight. He closed to 80 yards and shot it down. It crashed in the area of Lymington. Cunningham's 9th victory was Werknummer 2857, code G1+ES, belonging to 8./KG 55. The Heinkel, piloted by Oberleutnant Günther von Seidlitz, crashed onto No. 10-12 Padwell Road, Southampton at 02:00. Seidlitz and Feldwebel Franz Hümmer were killed in action and Unteroffizier Horst Rosenberg and Herbert Sauer were taken prisoner of war. In April, having downed at least 10 enemy aircraft in night-fighting operations, Cunningham was decorated with his first Distinguished Service Order (DSO).|$|E
