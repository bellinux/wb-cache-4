25|$|For Gavin Langmuir, anti-Judaism is {{concerned}} with exaggerated accusations against Jews which nonetheless contain a particle of truth or evidence, whereas antisemitism reaches beyond unusual general inferences and {{is concerned}} with false suppositions. Thus Langmuir considers the labelling of Jews as 'Christ-killers' is anti-Judaic; accusations of <b>well-poisoning,</b> on the other hand, he regards as antisemitic. In his view, anti-Judaism and antisemitism have existed side by side from the 12th century onwards and have strengthened each other ever since. The blood libel {{is another example of}} antisemitism, though it is based in distorted notions of Judaism.|$|E

50|$|Not only Jews {{could be}} victims of mass {{hysteria}} on charges {{like that of}} poisoning wells. This particular charge, <b>well-poisoning,</b> {{was the basis for}} a large scale hunt of lepers in 1321 France. In the spring of 1321, in PÃ©rigueux, people became convinced that the local lepers had poisoned the wells, causing ill-health among the normal populace. The lepers were rounded up and burned alive. The action against the lepers didn't stay local, though, but had repercussions throughout France, not least because King Philip V issued an order to arrest all lepers, those found guilty to be burnt alive. Jews became tangentially included as well; at Chinon alone, 160 Jews were burnt alive. All in all, around 5000 lepers and Jews are recorded in one tradition to have been killed during the Lepers' Plot hysteria.|$|E
40|$|German {{language}} poetry recited by the Jewish {{community of}} Troppau in Silesia (Opava, Czech Republic) on Shabbath and Yom Kippur. digitizedScott Offen Fund {{in memory of}} Herbert Offen 15834 German language poetry recited by the Jewish community of Opava, Czechoslovakia on the High Holidays. Opava (Ger. Troppau), city in N. Silesia, Czech Republic. A tale about 27 Jews being executed for <b>well-poisoning</b> in Opava in 1163 is probably unreliable. A Jewish community is first mentioned in 1281. Although their expulsion is not documented it is recorded that in 1501 Jews were permitted to return and buy back their houses. Jews from Osoblaha (Hotzenplotz) traded in Opava. In 1737, 20 Jewish families lived in the duchy. Several Jewish families lived in Opava {{at the beginning of}} the 19 th century, and their number increased after the 1848 Revolution. At the end of the 19 th century Opava became a center of the Schoenerer brand of German nationalism, and the community suffered from anti-Semitic attacks. The community developed, inspired by its rabbi, Simon Friedmann, an ardent Zionist from his student days. In 1923 a progressive community statute was introduced. On the outskirts of Opava in the 1920 s the training farm, Komorau, was a center of the He-Halutz movement. The community numbered 134 in 1867, 1, 127 in 1921, and in 1931, 971 (2. 6 % of the total population), 502 of whom declared their nationality as Jewish. At the time of the Sudeten crisis the community dispersed. The synagogue was set on fire by the Nazis. [Source: EJ...|$|E
