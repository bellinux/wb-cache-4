5000|$|The use of VSI crushers {{in large}} scale {{operations}} allow {{the production of}} up to 125 tons per hour [...] of crushed glass cullet. VSI Crushers use a high speed rotor with wear-resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the glass against. The VSI crushers utilize velocity rather than surface force as the predominant force to break glass as this allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both {{across the surface of}} the material as well as through the mass of the material. In its shattered state, glass has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force (pressure) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubicle particles. As glass is 'thrown' by a VSI rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along fissures. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the glass is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI crushing is generally of a consistent cubicle shape which may optimize yield in consumptive applications such as the fabrication of fiberglass, ceramic ware, flux agents and abrasives. Due to the highly abrasive nature of the glass material, a VSI crushing process is generally preferred over Horizontal Shaft Impact and most other crushing methods with higher maintenance and lower <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> lives.|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of the Breakring vertical shaft impactor was investigated mathematically and experimentally. In particular, {{the performance of the}} crusher, the action of solids and air in the impeller and the mechanism responsible for the localised abrasion of the impeller wear parts were investigated. Computer programs were developed, which modelled the performance of the Breakring for impellers having simple, idealised <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> profiles. Contour plots were produced, which illustrated the dependence of impeller power, absolute particle exit speed and anvil angle for normal impact on the <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> sweep angle and the coefficient of friction between the feed material and the <b>wear</b> <b>part.</b> The significance of the contours was investigated. A computer program was developed, which modelled the action of a single particle in the Breakring impeller for wear parts having various complex profiles. The results indicated that the cause of the localised <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> abrasion was the reattachment of feed material to the <b>wear</b> <b>part,</b> following separation at the downstream end of the depression caused by action of material after entry to the impeller. The accuracy of the results was confirmed by the profiles of abraded wear parts and various other factors. A full-scale model impeller was constructed. The flow of air in the model and, following failure of the model, the flow of air and solids in a prototype impeller were investigated by a surface flow visualisation technique and high speed cinematography. The results neither verified the wear-mechanism outlined above nor indicated any other wear-mechanism.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} wear parts {{with respect to the}} different heat treatments applied have been investigated. Two different alloys and a total of nine different heat treatment procedures were tested. Alloy 35 M 13 B have been tested with respect to tempering temperature and represents one <b>wear</b> <b>part.</b> The other <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> 30 M 12 CB have been tested with respect to both tempering temperatures and effect of direct hardening. The main goal of this work has been to improve the understanding of how the steel alloys used for the wear parts responds to different tempering temperatures and heat treatments. During this work both alloys were tested using the following test methods; charpy impact testing, tensile testing and Vickers hardness testing. From production, <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> 30 M 12 CB as currently produced and when directly hardened was to be investigated for its mechanical properties, thus alloy 30 M 12 CB was heat treated at different temperatures with the aim to find two heat treatments that would match the wear parts pulled from production. The two chosen temperatures for 30 M 12 CB were 850 *C representing the current production and 1100 *C representing direct hardening. Then, wear parts 30 M 12 CB and 35 M 13 B was heat treated accordingly and tempered. The current tempering temperature of 220 *C was compared with 180 *C and no tempering. Charpy test specimens and tensile test specimens for 35 M 13 B and 30 M 12 CB were then tested with three parallels. The results recorded was then compared with respect to mechanical properties for the different tempering temperatures and heat treatments. For all parts the strength increased slightly by lowering tempering temperature from 220 *C to 180 *C. No tempering did not affect the ductility of 35 M 13 B and improved the strength and hardness for this alloy, in contrast no tempering left 30 M 12 CB- 850 very brittle. Directly hardening <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> 30 M 12 CB will result in a slight reduction in quality, however the difference in quality will likely be slightly greater than the results from this work indicates. It is reasonable to say that reducing the temperature of tempering for 35 M 13 B may be preferable as it saves space, reduces production time and cost, while maintaining or increasing the hardness and strength of the material. Further, the slight reduction in ductility should not lead to brittle fractures and thus may not affect the end product negatively...|$|E

Based on this assumption, a methodology has been developed and checked against actual cases, enabling description of the abrasiveness of a rock or the abrasion resistance of a metal through the ratio of comparable quantitative indicators. The paper describes the methods and provides examples of applications to practical cases (namely: rock cutting, excavation by means of tunnel boring machines (TBMs), rock crushing, and hydro-mill cutting) ...|$|E

In end milling BN added steel with square end mill, the progress rate of flank wear width was decreased and fracture at corner was suppressed in comparison with that in machining standard steel. In case of ball end mill, flank wear in end milling BN added steels were smaller in comparison with standard steel. In case of S 45 C, boundary wear was observed, however it was not observed in end milling BN added steel. BN added showed almost the same surface roughness as standard steel.

40|$|The wear of {{materials}} {{is a major}} and widely recognised industrial problem. The direct costs of wear failures, i. e., <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> failures and replacements, increased work and time, loss of productivity, as well as indirect losses of energy and the increased environmental burden, are real problems in everyday work and business. In this study, the materials of interest are wear-resistant powder metallurgical metal matrix composites, MMCs. Powder metallurgical, P/M, production of material, involving, for example, hot isostatic pressing (HIPing), offers considerable potential for enhanced wear resistance {{because it has a}} larger capacity to modify microstructures than conventional production technologies. Martensitic- and tool-steel-based composites were studied with reference {{to the needs of the}} mineral industry, while the wear of austenitic- or duplex-steel-based composites was evaluated with reference to those of the energy industry. The wear was studied both in functional wear tests involving a small-scale cone crusher, as well as in laboratory tests, such as the dry sand rubber wheel and erofuge tests. The correlation between the wear behaviour and the material-related parameters of the steel-based metal matrix composites was investigated. The material-related parameters were microstructural parameters, such as the volume fraction of the reinforcements and hard particles, the size of the reinforcements, the true carbide size of the hard particles and spacing between the reinforcement particles. These parameters are evaluated by varying the matrix material of the composite and by varying the reinforcements in the fixed matrix material. The significantly important parameters that have an effect on the material wear rate were identified. The most important reinforcement-related parameters in these wear environments were the total volume fraction of the hard phase, the spacing between hard particles and the type of the hard phase. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined This work {{presents}} a comparative study regarding wear behavior between a novel abrasion resistant cast iron, "Carbide Steel" {{and a number}} of conventional tool materials frequently used in the automotive industry. Carbide Steel is basically a high-Cr white cast iron heavily alloyed with cemented carbide. The high chromium content and additional alloying elements like WC. TiC or NbC results in a material containing a large portion of hard, wear-resistant carbides with a composition different from conventional white irons normally used in wear applications. Characteristic properties for the material are: superior as-cast properties, improved wear resistance and hardness. The as-cast hardness of Carbide Steel is comparative to hardened steel but depending on desirable properties of the <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> the alloying content can be varied within a wide range. An interesting aspect of the material is potential for sustainable manufacturing, {{due to the fact that}} the critical alloying elements are added in the form of recycled carbide inserts. The experimental work was carried out in a U-bending test equipment to simulate conditions in a stamping process. One type of sheet material was used and seven different conventional tool materials were evaluated. The selection of tool materials ranged from white cast irons to tool-steels and powder steels. The wear patterns were analyzed and expressed in percentages of reduction of weight of the test specimens, galling tendency and temperature variations during the experiments. All parameters were correlated to the number of strokes. The press force was measured and a friction coefficient was calculated. An important conclusion from the experimental work is that Carbide Steel has a significantly higher wear resistance compared to the other conventional tool materials evaluated. Galling is also significantly reduced when using Carbide Steel. The volume part of carbides and the relative size of the same play a significant role in the process leading to less galling and wear, when using Carbide Steel as a tool material.

40|$|This thesis has {{attempted}} to reduce costs associated with wear parts in test equipment at Ericsson’s master and industrialization center (MIC) in Kista. Two different cases have been pursued, and each {{has been designed to}} follow a, for the purpose, adapted version of the design research methodology (DRM). The adapted model was presented and its use in both cases was additionally evaluated. Both cases were based on products that already have been launched and are used in production. In order to avoid expensive changes to surrounding equipment, incremental product development was chosen in both cases. The first case focused on test equipment used in the production of digital units for radio base stations. After the wear parts of this test equipment were examined, it was found that a plastic detail was manufactured through milling and as a result was quite expensive. The plastic detail was redesigned so that it could be manufactured using the injection molding process instead. This resulted in an estimated cost reduction of 48 %. The second case focused on wear parts of test fixtures used in the production of radio filters, also used in Ericsson’s radio base stations. A more process-oriented view was adopted in this case and parameters believed to be causing added wear such as positional and angular misalignment were examined further. Tolerance chains for each <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> in the assembled test fixture were calculated to determine the degrees of possible misalignment. The resulting data did however not correlate with each wear part’s individual wear interval, and no concrete cost reductive improvements could be delivered. Instead suggestions which can lead to further cost reductions in the long term were presented. The model used to develop improvements for these two cases was found to have helped the process in both cases, however further research of this model is recommended in order to determine if it is suitable for these types of projects in genera...|$|E

Finally, using two <b>wearing</b> <b>parts</b> from the oil and gas drilling industry as examples—the filter element and the blowout preventer rubber core—the parameters of the distribution function of the initial failure time and the delay time for each example are estimated, and their distribution functions are obtained.
