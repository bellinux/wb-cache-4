25|$|I guess I {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} about me and all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre. I really {{want to be able to}} tell real stories through my music, rather than talking about stuff that doesn’t really matter which is <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> seem to end up doing these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I want my songs to deal with real issues.|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> have told me this record has been for them.|$|E

Your mama has {{to feel this}} record, your daddy has to feel this record, {{everybody}} has to feel this record. That's what good writers do." [...] Of its appeal Garrett {{said that it would}} have the effect of [...] "Yeah!", and called the song an [...] "explosive record". Garrett went on to say, [...] "I definitely feel it's what Usher's been wanting to say. But at the same time, it's <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> wanted to say, they just didn't know what to say." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News said that [...] "Usher pulls back the curtain, revealing that a rumored rift between him and his mother was very real", and the song could be heard as an [...] "postmortem" [...] on his marriage, through the lines, [...] "For you I gave my heart and turned my back against the world/ 'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl, I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama/ I done turned into the man I never thought I'd be/ I'm ready to sign them papers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jennie Rothenberg, {{reporting}} on this ban in the secular Jewish journal, Moment, {{asserted that the}} incident represents a major breaking point within ultra-Orthodox society. Rothenberg interviewed several rabbis who wished to remain anonymous. According to one of them, [...] "Over the past 15 years, the rabbis of Bnai Brak and the more open American ultra-Orthodox rabbis have been split {{on a number of}} important policy decisions. The Slifkin ban is a huge break. It’s a kind of power struggle, and those who didn’t sign the ban are outraged right now. I’m talking about rabbis with long white beards who are furious about it." [...] Slifkin’s views, according to this rabbi, are shared by countless figures within the ultra-Orthodox community.

2500|$|PVRIS {{planned to}} call the album Haunt or have it self-titled, however they were quite indecisive. Eventually they agreed on naming it {{after one of the}} songs, [...] "White Noise". All of the {{material}} that features on White Noise was written by Lyndsey Gunnulfsen and producer Blake Harnage of VERSA, with the exception of [...] "Holy", [...] "Fire" [...] and [...] "Eyelids", which were written by Gunnulfsen, Harnage and Sierra Kusterbeck. Gunnulfsen wrote the songs while she was [...] "in a very dark place in my mind". Compared to the band's previous output, Gunnulfsen said that White Noise [...] "is very different from <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> were expecting but in the best way". She explained that the album's sound was [...] "rock mixed with electronic/pop kind of stuff", resulting in [...] "a lot of different vibes throughout the album." [...] Gunnulfsen was inspired by Saosin, Circa Survive, Ellie Goulding, Rihanna, and The Weeknd. Gavin Lloyd of Classic Rock wrote that the album featured [...] "infectious rock" [...] done by the likes of Paramore and We Are the In Crowd, and [...] "dark electro-pop" [...] performed by artists such as Purity Ring and Banks. Natasha Van Duser of Inked compared the [...] "steady bass lines, groovy backbeats, and melodic vocals" [...] to the likes of Taylor Swift's 1989 (2014).|$|E
60|$|That is <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{say about}} Blacky the Crow. Of {{course it is}} true that Blacky does get into a lot of mischief, but if people really knew him they would find that he isn't as black as he looks. In fact, Blacky the Crow does a whole lot of good in his own {{peculiar}} way, but people are always looking for him to do bad things, and you know you most always see what you expect to see. Thus the good Blacky does isn't seen, while the bad is, and so he has grown to have a reputation blacker than the coat he wears.|$|E

And he remembered the many evenings he and his {{brothers}} and their cronies had wagged their heads over their wine and walnuts and that fellow in his salad days. And now he had come to the throne.

It didn't seem so very long since he and Swithin stood in the crowd outside Westminster Abbey when she was crowned, and Swithin had taken him to Cremorne afterwards--racketty chap, Swithin; no, it didn't seem much longer ago than Jubilee Year, when he had joined with Roger in renting a balcony in Piccadilly.|$|E
