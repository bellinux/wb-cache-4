Following latest developments, Supreme Court has decided to hear plea for quashing action against Gujarat police. Those killed in the incident were Ishrat Jahan Raza, a 19-year-old woman from Mumbra, Maharashtra, and three men – Javed Ghulam Sheikh (born Pranesh Pillai), Amjad Ali Rana and Zeeshan Johar. The police claimed that Ishrat Jahan and her associates were Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operatives involved in a terroristic plot to assassinate the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi. Though refuted by several human right activists and questioned by CBI, these claims have gained credence after revelations by several officials associated <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>case.</b> David Headley, a Pakistani-American terrorist who had collaborated with the LeT, later said that Ishrat Jahan was an operative of the LeT.. But when he was deposing via video conferencing from the U.S. before Judge G.A. Sanap in the 26/11 trial against Abu Jundal, David Coleman Headley told the court that he didn't have any first hand knowledge about Ishrat Jahan {{who was killed in}} a police encounter.Later, David Coleman Headley claimed that LeT commander Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi had told him about Ishrat Jahan ‘operation’ though he had also learnt about the case through the media.|$|E

500|$|Trial by {{battle was}} a {{procedure}} {{which had been}} brought to Britain by the Normans; it was not present in Saxon law.

Such an appeal, and such an offer of battle could also take place following an acquittal for treason or another felony. Appeals of murder were uncommon, had to be brought within a year and a day of the death, and were generally tried by jury.

[...] Kellahin argued that tribal sovereignty only extended to members of the tribe, citing both Oliphant and Montana v.

[...] Kellahin stated that those cases that allowed a tribe to tax non-Indians were not due to tribal sovereignty, but were connected with the authority of the tribe to regulate who could enter the reservation, {{in the same manner as}} a landlord controlled their property. [...] Cooney argued that the tax was a violation of the Commerce Clause, in that Congress divested the tribes of that authority when they enacted [...] granting the states the right to impose a severance tax on reservation lands. [...] Nordhaus, in arguing for the tribe, pointed out that there was first, no Congressional preemption of the tribal authority to tax, and that second, taxation was an inherent power of tribal sovereignty. [...] Claiborne first distinguished Montana, noting that it dealt with non-Indians on fee land owned by non-Indians that happened to be within the boundaries of the reservation, something that was completely unrelated to the current case.|$|E

2500|$|In both cases, the {{distinction}} mainly concerns simultaneous sounds; if successive sounds are considered, their consonance or dissonance {{depends on the}} memorial retention of the first sound while the second sound (or pitch) is heard. For this reason, consonance and dissonance have been considered {{particularly in the case}} of Western polyphonic music, and the present article is concerned mainly <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>case.</b> Most historical definitions of consonance and dissonance since about the 16th century have stressed their pleasant/unpleasant, or agreeable/disagreeable character. This may be justifiable in a psychophysiological context, but much less in a musical context properly speaking: dissonances often play a decisive role in making music pleasant, even in a generally consonant context—which {{is one of the reasons}} why the musical definition of consonance/dissonance cannot match the psychophysiologic definition. In addition, the oppositions pleasant/unpleasant or agreeable/disagreeable evidence a confusion between the concepts of [...] "dissonance" [...] and of [...] "noise".

2500|$|Senegal {{people are}} not prosecuted for their sexual {{orientation}}. Sexual orientation in Senegal is a purely private matter. It is a private matter, nothing more. For many years now, we have seen homosexuality in our country and that has never lead to situations where homosexuals are harassed, persecuted, or prosecuted. What {{has happened is that}} there have been sutiations where shocking behavior which ran counter to our religious beliefs and morality which [...] punishes unnatural sexual relations. I would ask you to understand the social realities of our country. This is an issue which is very complex. It is a very complicated issue in Senegal. Let me say once again in Senegal homosexuals lead freely ... we even had a federal republic to authorize a homosexual to have their name changed to a woman's name in order to emphasize their feminine side. No one was shocked when the president authorized the man to adopt the woman's name. But when homosexuality becomes blatantly public, it leads to embarrassing situations. You have to understand that we are a country with a particularly tolerant form of Islam. And that is why we must avoid, we must avoid the development of fundamentalism. We must ensure social cohesion. We must also take measures to protect the lives of homosexuals. That is why I ask you to bear in mind our society, our sociological realities. This is a perfectly complicated issue for us where there are some problems but we are aware of them. ... I would like {{to go back to a}} very important issue. We are all struggling for the independence of our judges, for the independence of our justice system. If the courts hand down a decision, you cannot say the government is responsible for that court decision. The ... independent justice system which hands down a decision. And that is what the courts did in the case of the trials of these homosexuals. And I must say ... for 25 years I was a lawyer at the bar. I know the Senegalese justice system from the inside. ... Over those years there have been three cases where homosexuals were brought before the courts. The first case was an organized homosexual marriage with a lot of fuss, a lot of publicity. The police arrested them and the court case led to an acquittal. The second case of homosexuals related to a foreign national who was already rather elderly who married a young Senegalese boy. And I would like to warn you ... that if an elderly man marries a young boy, the young boy does it so that he can emigrate and go in live in France or some other country abroad, that is the interest of the young person in getting married. This led to a conviction and an appeal was made against the conviction and ... the foreigner was able to leave the country after they were acquitted on appeal. And the third case ... is the case of homosexuals who joined together again with a great deal of fuss, carried out activities which led to disturbances in the neighborhood. The neighbors complained and the police acted. This has already been tried in the first instance, and an appeal has been made against that judgment, and the justice system is now dealing <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> independently on appeal.|$|E
