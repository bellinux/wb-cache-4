5|$|Beginning in 1950, the National Hurricane Center named officially {{recognized}} tropical {{storms and}} hurricanes. The unnamed hurricane {{was reported to}} have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone, but it was purposefully left unnamed. This was done to avoid confusion among the media and the public, who were focusing on the damage from the initial nor'easter, as the hurricane itself was not expected to pose a major threat to land. It was the eighth nameable storm of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. Had the system been named for whatever reason, it would've received the name Henri, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> name on the 1991 list after Grace.|$|E

Finally, the convention chairman announced that the candidate receiving the fewest votes on the next ballot would be dropped from the voting. Clardy received the fewest votes, and on the next ballot, his supporters divided almost equally between the remaining three candidates. Hardin <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> candidate to be dropped, and Brown received a majority over Clay on the thirteenth ballot.|$|E

This version (a draft was written by Alan Ormsby, but it was later re-written by John Sayles) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story. It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, {{making it to the}} final product. However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15million and rejected Dante's version.|$|E

Nani then {{knew he had to}} score to keep United in it, and he did, leaving it up to John Terry to win the cup for Chelsea; however, Terry lost his footing when planting his standing foot by the ball, and, even though Van der Sar was sent the wrong way, Terry's mis-hit effort struck the outside of the right post and went wide.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements, but support the placement of B.aculeata alongside B.caleyi in a clade corresponding closely with B.ser. Tetragonae. A 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using chloroplast DNA and combining it with earlier results found that B.aculeata was sister to B.lemanniana and that B.caleyi <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> closest relative.|$|E

Dumoulin <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> to attack, seeking to take back the race lead from Chaves. Chaves and Quintana initially followed him, but were soon dropped. Valverde was also unable to follow the pace, but Froome had kept a steady pace and by this point was leading the chase of Dumoulin.|$|E
