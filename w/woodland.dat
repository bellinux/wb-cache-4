5|$|The Early <b>Woodland</b> period saw the {{introduction}} of ceramics to Iowa, including Marion Thick and Black Sand types. Marion Thick may have originated with the nucleated Late Archaic cultures of the Upper Midwest, and was widespread in distribution. Early <b>Woodland</b> Indians in eastern Iowa built large burial mounds in the Mississippi River region, and participated in long-distance trade of exotic raw material. This long-distance trade {{may have been the}} forerunner of the later Havanna-Hopewell trading sphere. In north-central Iowa, Early <b>Woodland</b> peoples appear to have interacted more directly with the Prairie Lakes region of Minnesota. Numerous Early <b>Woodland</b> sites have been excavated in Iowa, including the Gast Spring Site, and many sites which have not been formally published.|$|E
5|$|The genus Iridomyrmex inhabits rural, arid, and {{semi-arid}} areas.

5|$|Associated {{species in}} the Sydney region include {{heathland}} species such as heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), coral heath (Epacris microphylla) and mountain devil (Lambertia formosa), and tick bush (Kunzea ambigua) and prickly-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca nodosa) in taller scrub, and under trees such as scribbly gum (Eucalyptus sclerophylla) and narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) in <b>woodland.</b> The Agnes Banks <b>Woodland</b> in western Sydney has been recognised by the New South Wales Government as an Endangered Ecological Community. Here B.oblongifolia is an understory plant in low open <b>woodland,</b> with scribbly gum, narrow-leaved apple and old man banksia (B.serrata) as canopy trees, and wallum banksia (B.aemula), variable smoke-bush (Conospermum taxifolium), wedding bush (Ricinocarpos pinifolius), showy parrot-pea (Dillwynia sericea) and nodding geebung (Persoonia nutans) as other understory species.|$|E

5|$|Common {{over most}} of its range in <b>woodland,</b> the common {{blackbird}} has a preference for deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per hectare (nearly three pairs per acre), with <b>woodland</b> typically holding about a tenth of that density, and open and very built-up habitats even less. They are often replaced by the related ring ouzel in areas of higher altitude.. The common blackbird also lives in parks, gardens and hedgerows.|$|E

5|$|During the <b>Woodland</b> period, many American Indians in Iowa shifted {{away from}} hunting and {{gathering}} and used more domesticated plants, although wild food was still important.

5|$|Great Oasis sites {{appeared}} in the Missouri River drainage, and have attributes of both Late <b>Woodland</b> and Late Prehistoric cultures. Great Oasis cultures extended through the eastern Plains from Iowa to South Dakota. Developing independently from the eastern Mississippian cultures, Great Oasis sites display large sites along major stream terraces, increased reliance on agriculture combined with hunting and gathering, substantial pit earth lodges, and a transition from Late <b>Woodland</b> to Late Prehistoric ceramic forms. Overall, Great Oasis {{appears to have been}} a regional adaptation of new forms of farming and settlement patterns, including seasonal occupation of different ecological zones, that includes aspects of Late <b>Woodland</b> and the subsequent Middle Missouri Tradition.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 {{part of the}} <b>woodland</b> was {{donated to}} the National Trust by the tobacco company owner George Alfred Wills. He did this to prevent housing {{development}} {{on the western side}} of the gorge as Bristol grew in size and population. In 1974 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food bought the <b>woodland</b> associated with the Leigh Court estate. Areas not owned by the National Trust have since been taken over by the Forestry Commission.|$|E
