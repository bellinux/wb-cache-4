Instead, he calls his friend Roger Taylor (Eric Lively), the son of President Elect Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones), for help. After Roger hears of the conspiracy, Whitley returns to his home to forward the files, only to be stopped by Hodges's men, Halcott and John Quinn (Sebastian Roche) <b>who</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> information, kill Whitley and bury the body in concrete.|$|E

Seven percent of Americans who {{have heard of the}} books have a negative view of them, with 52 percent having a positive opinion and the remaining 41 percent unsure.

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announces to {{the staff}} of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) that she is {{participating}} in a charity which provides gifts to underprivileged children who write letters to Santa. She buys far more than what is requested in the letter, wanting to see the children's happiness. When Liz delivers the presents to the apartment in the letter, however, the door is answered by two adults <b>who</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> gifts, and she believes she has been tricked. Receiving no help from the US Postal Service, who run the charity, she attempts to have it shut down. This upsets Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who refuses to believe anyone would scam a Christmas charity. She takes Kenneth back to the apartment to prove she was right, but two children answer the door and Liz accidentally reveals to them that Santa Claus is not real.|$|E

The yacht is eventually boarded by Chinese pirates <b>who</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> ship hostage. The pirates rob everyone on board and tie them up in a net which they then toss overboard. But to the luck of Homer {{and some of the}} other guests who happen to be above ocean surface level, it floats and they avoid drowning. Eventually Homer and Bart make it back to the mansion where the family returns the house to Burns after Marge and Lisa have scrubbed all the rooms clean. Back at the Simpsons home, everyone is glad to live a normal life again—with the exception of Homer, who is upset that he does not live the lifestyle of rich people. The episode ends with Homer wailing about how rich all the persons in the closing credits are (except Richard K. Chung, whom he dismisses as poor) and threatening to report them to the Internal Revenue Service and telling the Gracie Films woman not to shush him.|$|E
5|$|The True Directions {{kids are}} {{encouraged}} to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, ex-ex-gays Larry and Lloyd (Richard Moll and Wesley Mann), <b>who</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> campers to a local gay bar where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance. When Mary discovers the trip, she makes them all picket Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying placards and shouting homophobic abuse. Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love. When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} was performed aiming at studying {{the effects of}} teaching cognitive and meta cognitive strategies on self-regulation learning of girl students in orphanage centers and at guidance school level. The sample included 20 girl students living in residential centers supervised by Tehran Welfare Organization; 10 of which were assigned in experimental group and 10 in control group. The standardized motivational strategies questionnaire (MSLQ), was administered as pre-test and post-test to collect data. In this process, after <b>the</b> experimental group <b>took</b> <b>the</b> pre-test, they were assigned in an 8 -session course in which they learned cognitive and meta cognitive strategies and then the post-test was administered for both experimental and control groups and their scores were compared by T-test. The results showed that: There's {{no significant difference between}} the self-regulated learning of orphan girl students <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> cognitive and meta cognitive learning course and that of those <b>who</b> didn’t <b>take</b> <b>the</b> course. There's {{no significant difference between the}} test anxiety of the orphan girl students <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> cognitive and meta cognitive learning course and that of those <b>who</b> didn’t <b>take</b> <b>the</b> course. There's no significant difference in applying the cognitive strategies by the orphan girl students <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> cognitive and meta cognitive learning course and those <b>who</b> didn’t <b>take</b> <b>the</b> course. There's no significant difference in applying the meta cognitive strategies by the orphan girl students <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> cognitive and meta cognitive learning course and those <b>who</b> didn’t <b>take</b> <b>the</b> course...|$|R

25|$|The {{meaning of}} the word is not {{confined}} to male prostitutes. According to Malick (op cit), when malakos is employed in reference to sexual relationships of men with men, it is not a technical term for male call-boys in a pederastic setting.

25|$|Another {{explanation}} is an increased familiarity {{of the general}} population with tests and testing. For example, children <b>who</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> very same IQ test a second time usually gain five or six points. However, this seems to set an upper limit on the effects of test sophistication. One problem with this explanation and others related to schooling is that in the US, the groups with greater test familiarity show smaller IQ increases.|$|E
