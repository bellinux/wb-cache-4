5|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{was written}} {{at a more}} rapid pace than the band's {{previous}} album. Prior to the Chili Peppers relocation into the mansion, Frusciante and Kiedis collaborated at each other's homes, in order to arrange song structures and guitar riffs. They would then present ideas to Flea and Smith, and the band would, as a whole, decide <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> use for the bass, guitar, vocal and percussion ensembles.|$|E
5|$|Horses have an {{advanced}} sense of taste, which {{allows them to}} sort through fodder and choose <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> most like to eat, and their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains. Horses generally will not eat poisonous plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food.|$|E
5|$|The Season Eight DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Jim and the others {{trying to get the}} truck into the warehouse door but getting the truck stuck instead, Dwight trying to use Kevin as a bumper on the oil track, and Phyllis, Toby, and Ryan revealing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> do if they won the lottery.|$|E

50|$|As long as broker-dealers {{exercised}} “due diligence” (required carefulness) {{in their}} {{investigation into the}} company whose equity they were selling {{and as long as}} they disclosed to the investor <b>what</b> <b>they</b> found, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not be held liable for non-disclosure of information that was not discovered in the process of that investigation.|$|R
5|$|After {{learning}} {{that they have}} lost Prestige Direct, Jim, Dwight and Harry retreat outside for a coffee break. They end up having a conversation over <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> do with their lives, {{if they were not}} working for Dunder Mifflin. Jim jokingly says that he would be a beet growing competitor during the national contests while Harry would retire after selling one big item such as an airplane. Before he leaves, Harry says that Robert will be the ruin of the company and says they will not be working for Dunder Mifflin in six months, leaving a look of concern on Dwight and Jim's faces.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack to Nier {{is largely}} {{composed}} of melancholy acoustic pieces which heavily feature vocals by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer {{for the band}} freesscape, and had previously worked on video games such as Etrian Odyssey. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, where she tried to imagine <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> sound like after 1000 years of drifting.|$|E
5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> do in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him enough money to buy a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E

5|$|In December 1843, Smith petitioned Congress to make Nauvoo an {{independent}} territory {{with the right}} to call out federal troops in its defense. Smith then wrote to the leading presidential candidates and asked them <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> do to protect the Mormons. After receiving noncommittal or negative responses, Smith announced his own independent candidacy for President of the United States, suspended regular proselytizing, and sent out the Quorum of the Twelve and hundreds of other political missionaries. In March 1844 — following a dispute with a federal bureaucrat — Smith organized the secret Council of Fifty. Smith said the Council had authority to decide which national or state laws Mormons should obey. The Council was also to select a site for a large Mormon settlement in Texas, California, or Oregon, where Mormons could live under theocratic law beyond other governmental control.|$|E
5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E
5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E
50|$|The two then kidnapped Teena to a {{rural area}} and raped and beat him. Afterwards, Teena came to Tisdel's house, and Tisdel and her mother {{convinced}} him {{to speak to the}} police, and go to the hospital. Lotter and Nissen had told Teena that if <b>they</b> told anyone <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> kill him.|$|R

25|$|The {{expenses}} disclosures {{were published}} {{over an extended}} period of time, with the focus moving to different MPs daily. As a result, there was significant pressure on MPs who did not know whether, and for <b>what,</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be discussed, as well as a general deepening hostility that grew over a relatively long period.|$|E
25|$|Eddy and Boyd {{state that}} there is no {{evidence}} of a historical influence by outside sources on the authors of the New Testament, and most scholars agree that any such historical influence on Christianity is entirely implausible given that first century monotheistic Galilean Jews would not have been open to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have seen as pagan stories.|$|E
25|$|In reply, UMWA International President Cecil Roberts denied ‘manipulation', {{saying that}} it was {{fulfilling}} its responsibility under the MSHA regulations. He accused the ICG of attempting to get the identities of the miners who designated the UMWA as their representative, and questioned why they needed to know that, and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> do with that information.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} a {{prediction}} of quantum electrodynamics which has been verified experimentally is the Lamb shift. This refers to an effect whereby the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field causes the energy levels in an atom or ion to deviate slightly from <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> otherwise be. As a result, spectral lines may shift or split.|$|E
