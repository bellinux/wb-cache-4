5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement,</b> though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{summarised}} in Internet Bookwatch as [...] "ragmatic, insightful, rational, iconoclastic, informed and informative". It {{was described as}} [...] "thoughtful and thought-provoking, making it a welcome and highly recommended addition to personal and academic library Contemporary Ethics reference collections and supplemental reading lists." [...] In addition to a quote from Internet Bookwatch, Columbia University Press advertised Animal Rights Without Liberation with quotes from several academics working {{in the area of}} animal ethics. Philosophers Peter Singer and Paula Casal praised work for exposing a false dichotomy of animal rights versus animal welfare, both seeing the work as an important contribution to the literature for this reason. Francione, an advocate for an animal rights approach which does mandate liberation, was quoted as saying that [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement</b> to say that I disagree with Cochrane but he does a fine job presenting the argument and his book will surely provoke debate and discussion." ...|$|E
500|$|Recorded {{in three}} months, As Daylight Dies was {{released}} on November 21, 2006 and peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200 chart with 60,000 sales in its first week. [...] "As Daylight Dies" [...] proved {{to be one of}} their biggest albums yet. It also entered the Australian Albums Chart at number 29. Mixed by Dutkiewicz, the album received mostly positive reviews—Thom Jurek of Allmusic called it [...] "a Top Five metal candidate for 2006 for sure". Decibel Magazine contributor Nick Terry said [...] "To call As Daylight Dies addictive <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> That it outdoes its already impressive enough predecessor could almost go without saying". Cosmo Lee of Stylus Magazine commented [...] "the album is astonishingly badly sequenced", though he praised the album as being [...] "less emotionally heavy-handed, and a lot more fun". As of November 27, 2007, As Daylight Dies has sold more than 500,000 units in the US.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} for JazzTimes, Steve Greenlee states [...] "To {{say the new}} lineup <b>is</b> {{powerful}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> huge <b>understatement.</b> Smith elicits <b>a</b> symphony of sounds from his trumpet." ...|$|R
50|$|It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> Everest-sized <b>understatement</b> to {{say that}} James' plays have gotten bad notices from critics. Some have {{gone so far as}} to {{recommend}} would-be readers of James to skip the plays altogether, or at most to approach them gingerly after reading just about everything else he wrote.|$|R
5000|$|In his summing-up, George Bathurst-Norman {{suggested}} {{to the jury}} that [...] "you may well think that hell on earth <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement</b> of what the Gazans suffered in that time". Bathurst-Norman also highlighted the testimony by Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, that [...] "all democratic paths had been exhausted" [...] before the activists embarked on their action.|$|R
500|$|In 2008, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News awarded Walton a [...] "Daytime Gold Standard" [...] for her portrayal. He stated: [...] "Walton played each {{scene in}} this “Bette Davis-like” {{emotional}} marathon of a week. How did Walton do it? With aplomb and greatness." [...] The following year, when Jill opened her own nail salon, Mike Jubinville, also of Zap2it, {{noted that the}} character had [...] "stepped into a time warp". Prior to being paired with Colin, Nekeeta Borden wrote that, [...] "Jill Foster Abbott (cough, cough) Fenmore’s (Jess Walton) Jimmy Choos must have crossed paths with a black cat, because she can’t find a good man to bless her somewhat shriveled heart." [...] Of the character's possible pairing with Colin, she added: [...] "I, for one, hope that Maria Arena Bell and Co. keep Colin in Genoa City and surprise us all by making him a dream lover for Jill. She is a multidimensional character {{with a lot of}} fire, and a great capacity to be soft and vulnerable. Goodness knows she’s been through the ringer. Can Jill find love with Colin, or will her newest dalliance lead to heartbreak?" [...] In 2013, Giddens wrote of Walton's portrayal throughout her run, stating: [...] "Unlike most soap opera recasts, where success or failure depends on chemistry with an opposite sex romantic lead, newcomer Jess Walton would sink or swim, based on her ability to connect with fellow female powerhouse Jeanne Cooper, who played Jill's bitter rival Katherine [...] "Kay" [...] Chancellor." [...] He also commended Walton and Cooper's portrayal of their characters' rivalry, [...] "To say Walton swam alongside Cooper <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> The two women did a backstroke even Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps would have to admire, during their 26 years as acting partners," [...] he wrote.|$|E
2500|$|Dolphy was posthumously {{inducted}} into the Down Beat magazine Hall of Fame in 1964. John Coltrane paid tribute to Dolphy in an interview: [...] "Whatever I'd say <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> I can only say my life was made much better by knowing him. He {{was one of the}} greatest people I've ever known, as a man, a friend, and a musician." [...] Dolphy's mother, Sadie, who had fond memories of her son practicing in the studio in the backyard of their house, gave instruments that Dolphy had bought in France but never played to Coltrane, who subsequently played the flute and bass clarinet on several albums before his own death in 1967.|$|E
50|$|Times {{of india}} gave 1 out of 5 and said dialogues are 'poor' <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> Each {{character}} displays passion for spouting ridiculous mindless statements {{that make you}} cringe.|$|E
40|$|It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{significant}} <b>understatement</b> to {{say that}} sales promotion <b>is</b> enjoying <b>a</b> dominant role in the promotional mixes of most consumer goods companies. The 1998 Cox Direct 20 th Annual Survey of Promotional Practices suggests that many companies {{spend as much as}} 75 % of their total promotional budgets on sales promotion and only 25 % on advertising. This is up from 57...|$|R
5000|$|He wore tie-dyed {{shirts with}} track suit bottoms and talked a mile a minute. I'd {{never seen so}} much energy {{contained}} in one person. He <b>was</b> like <b>an</b> untied balloon that had been inflated and immediately released. I watched in awe as he virtually caromed off {{the walls of the}} classrooms and hallways. To say that he was [...] "on" [...] <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major <b>understatement.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On AllMusic, Fred Thomas wrote, [...] "Saying {{the band}} was deep into one of its jammier phases <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{tremendous}} <b>understatement,</b> with the set list getting into exploratory versions of crowd favorites like [...] "Jack Straw" [...] {{as well as a}} stunning rendition of [...] "Weather Report Suite" [...] that blurs into a particularly epic [...] "Dark Star", {{as well as some of}} the most jazz-influenced playing the Dead would branch into that year on [...] "Playing in the Band"." ...|$|R
50|$|To {{say that}} Glenn Roberts and his six {{brothers}} {{were born to}} humble beginnings, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> Few today could visualize sweeping snow out of every room the next morning after a snowfall. Probably no one can remember newspaper as their standard wall paper. It {{was not an easy}} life for Charlie and Orlena Roberts and their brood of seven boys.|$|E
50|$|M. {{works as}} a cook in a trendy Berlin restaurant. To say that his kitchen is busy like hell <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> Barely past thirty he suffers a mild heart attack, which gives him the scare of his life. Entering into a {{premature}} midlife crisis, he decides to turn his life around and write the great novel that he always felt inside him.|$|E
5000|$|Rock Paper Shotgun Konstantinos Dimopoulos {{review of}} the game states, [...] "Describing SanctuaryRPG as a huge, hilarious and most honorable devourer of free time <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>under{{statement}}.</b> Also, a rather vague statement too, as this freeware beauty {{also happens to be}} a proper, full-fledged text-based RPG with some terrific ASCII illustrations and outrageous bosses, that lets you fantasize about being anything from a burly barbarian or a pious paladin to a roaming ranger or a wicked wizard." ...|$|E
50|$|To {{say that}} corn is {{fundamental}} to the Nahua <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> enormous <b>understatement.</b> It engulfs every aspect of their life. From the actual consumption of corn at every meal, to its political role in the community, there is no escaping its power and influence. Nahua men will actually spend {{the greater part of}} their lives farming, while women and children also play a role in land cultivation. With everyone in the community contributing, an occasional cyclical shortage is possible, but normally, food like corn, is copious.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the groups}} often {{featured}} at the Atlanta concerts was The Lefevres, who later became known as The Nelons. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mild <b>understatement</b> to say that Karen had aspirations of singing with this talented family. In fact, that aspiration became her greatest desire, and in 1981, this dream became a reality when Karen was invited to travel with her favorite group. She remained with The Nelons for 10 years, gaining the respect of industry peers and fans alike with her exceptional vocal ability and caring personality.|$|R
5000|$|Posner {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prolific}} legal writers, through both the number and topical breadth of his opinions, to say nothing of his scholarly and popular writings. Unlike many other judges, he writes all his own opinions. Nobel Laureate economist Robert Solow says that Posner [...] "is an apparently inexhaustible writer on... nearly everything. To call him <b>a</b> polymath <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gross <b>understatement....</b> Judge Posner evidently writes the way other men breathe", though the economist describes the judge's grasp of economics as, [...] "in some respects, ... precarious." ...|$|R
50|$|To {{say that}} he {{inspired}} the historical profession <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> Most of {{his colleagues in the}} history department were among his students. He drew up the syllabus for the Columbia College course in American history (1913) and, with Carlton J. H. Hayes, the syllabus in modern European history (1912). The latter is notable for its attention to economic and cultural history. In his later years at Columbia, {{he was in charge of}} the historiography course required of graduate students, and anyone who heard his opening lectures was permanently inoculated against the dangers of present-mindedness.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{official}} album review of Abaddon by Faygoluvers.net, the reviewer concluded that [...] "After four years the Juggalos {{finally get to}} hear what Boondox has been hiding. To say he stepped up his game <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> This album is hands down his best work to date. ... With this and the new Axe Murder Boys album Psychopathic Records is showing they are not down for the count." [...] The album charted at number 147 on the Billboard 200 and number 29 on the Indie chart. Abaddon is Boondox's lowest charting album he has released thus far.|$|E
5000|$|Jamahl Epsicokhan at {{his website}} [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] gave {{the first episode}} a score of three out of four, {{and the second part}} a score of two and a half. He {{described}} it as an [...] "evil comic book", and regarding the first part, [...] "To call this episode over-the-top <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> This is a go-for-broke hour of lunatic madness." [...] His view on the second part was that while the re-created sets were impressive, but [...] "it goes so far over the top that it comes back around and kicks itself in its own ass. It's overplayed, overacted, and over-goofy." ...|$|E
5000|$|June 2009 - Hidden Lake saw Chapter 11 as {{a chance}} to regroup. School owner Buccelatto called the school's opponents [...] "vicious and unrelenting... It became very evident that the goal of the people {{involved}} was to discredit, and to ultimately close the school... creating as large a financial burden to the school as possible by attacking our referral sources through fear and intimidation. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gross <b>understatement</b> to say that these events did not {{have an impact on the}} school. The financial reality is one the school is still reeling from." ...|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the early}} history of Bohol was made around the town and church of Loboc. It <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement</b> to say that to know Loboc is to {{understand}} the entire drama of Bohol history. At present, Loboc church is deteriorating, ignored by tourists and visitors and continually threatened by the annual flood that has already robbed it of its ancient records and other priceless relics. The church was severely damaged by the 2013 Bohol earthquake, and the tropical storm Seniang at the end of 2014 washed away most of the remains waiting for repair.|$|R
5000|$|When {{this work}} has been reviewed, it has {{generally}} been to praise, such as in Richard B. Bilder and W. E. Butler's review in The American Journal of International Law:“To say, as a reviewer, that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> recommended read <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> considerable <b>understatement.</b> It <b>is</b> more than simply a first- class novel, superbly translated; for the cognoscenti, the novel makes its own contribution {{to the history of}} international law. Jaan Kross graduated from the Law Faculty of Tartu University, and his historical fiction is noted for scrupulous research and fidelity to actual events and personages." ...|$|R

Towards the end of his life he wrote to her mother:Vera!? To say that she is often in my thoughts... <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement,</b> for never a moment passes without my thinking of her! My whole being rests on my feelings and my thoughts about her. She is to my spirit what air is to physical existence! Human being, friend, daughter, sister, family—everything is concentrated in her alone...|$|E

It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement</b> to suggest that this has been a favourite discussion point in Launceston for longer than many would like to remember as a possible solution to clear some of the silt in Home Reach where the Esk Rivers meet to form the Tamar River.|$|E

40|$|Healthcare {{has had a}} storied past in the United States, and to {{say that}} the two have had <b>a</b> {{complicated}} relationship <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> egregious <b>understatement.</b> Intertwined in the narrative of our healthcare system is the narrative of United States hospitals, both how they came to be and the nature of their structures. Over time, legislation at local, state, and federal levels has shaped hospital organization and cost-structure. Here, I aim to better understand the effect of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and more specifically Medicaid expansion, on hospitals in a handful of Southern states...|$|R
5000|$|Write up for debut ep:I can't {{say enough}} {{good things about}} Dick Army. Yeah, maybe they <b>were</b> just <b>a</b> cheap, goofy Black Flag knockoff, but damnit, they had that underdog charm and you've just gotta love that. Matt from Dick Army started this band, {{and to say that}} I was looking forward to it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> huge <b>understatement.</b> It lived up to my expectations. Where Dick Army mostly played simple, sloppy three-chord punk, FOUR DEADLY QUESTIONS sound a lot more oiriginal and hard-to-pin-down. It's still fun and scrappy, to be sure, and it's not like they turned into Hawkwind or anything, but the choppy rhythms and female backups make this stand out a whole lot. Me likey.|$|R
40|$|Professor Harold Demsetz and I have <b>been</b> {{involved}} in <b>an</b> intellectual dispute which {{has taken place}} over several years. I can hardly have a better debating partner. He is easily amongst the half dozen or so most eminent economists who has not (yet) won the Nobel Prize in this discipline. 1 To say that his contributions {{to the theory of}} property rights, regulation, law and economics, to mention {{only a few of the}} areas on which he has focused his attention, are highly regarded within the profession <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> vast <b>understatement.</b> Most important of all to me, he is one of the very few eminent economists who has been willing to engage me in intellectual combat. 2 In Block (1977 a) I tried to make two points.

5000|$|Evolutionary {{biologists}} Kenneth McNamara and Michael McKinney {{stated that}} of all the books that Gould wrote in his career, [...] "the one with the most impact is probably Ontogeny and Phylogeny ... to say that this work is a hallmark in this area of evolutionary theory <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> It proved to be the catalyst for much of the future work in the field, and to a large degree was the inspiration for the modern field of 'evolutionary developmental biology.' Gould's hope was to show that the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny is fundamental to evolution, and at its heart is a simple premise—that variations in the timing and rate of development provide the raw material upon which natural selection can operate." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Heist {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74, based on eight reviews. David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "Macklemore's {{a mix of}} all of the above with some distinctive qualities, and with Lewis putting that kaleidoscope style underneath, The Heist winds up a rich combination of fresh and familiar." [...] Nathan S. of DJBooth said, [...] "Ultimately, these songs and all of the songs on the album are stories, and to call Macklemore a storytelling rapper <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> He only tells stories, most often his own, it just turns out he's the kind of gifted storyteller that can keep you listening." ...|$|E

It {{was one of the}} first songs we finished and it really set the bar for the rest of the album...To say we have argued over this song <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> I guess you know you've got a good one when that happens because everyone gets really precious about it. But it was really important to us that all the other tracks are strong too. We wanted to go back to how we were at the beginning when we released EPs and every track was as good as the lead track. It feels just like those days, we're all fired up and hungry for it because we've got it all to prove again." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Rick Anderson states [...] "To call the music he creates {{on this album}} [...] "introspective" [...] <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{something}} of <b>an</b> <b>understatement...</b> there's <b>a</b> darkness around the edges this time out that is unusual, as if he's lonely playing by himself {{and a little bit}} unnerved at the thoughts and feelings he's being forced to face on his own... There are moments of light relief, such as the gently lovely title track and the brief banjo interlude [...] "Fingers Snappin' and Toes Tappin'," [...] but the overall mood here is relatively dark, though consistently beautiful".|$|R

The site's critical consensus reads: [...] "Blood-spattered, emotionally resonant, and white-knuckle intense, The Walking Dead puts an intelligent spin on the overcrowded zombie subgenre." [...] Following the pilot episode's debut, TV Guides Matt Roush called the show [...] "a stark and harrowing survival parable ... visually stunning ... and daring in its artful use of silence." [...] Following the second episode, Simon Abrams from Slant Magazine awarded the show {{three and a half}} stars out of a possible four; [...] "To say that Darabont has kicked his series off with <b>a</b> bang <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> serious <b>understatement</b> ... he has fashioned a fully realized alternate reality and it's a thrilling thing to experience." ...|$|R
