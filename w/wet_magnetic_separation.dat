30|$|There {{are many}} wet or dry {{magnetic}} separation methods for {{the recovery of}} magnetic materials from CFA. The dry process uses a rotating magnetic drum and initial separation produces middling and tailings which are discarded and a crude iron oxide fraction which must be further refined by passing it through another magnetic unit. The wet process involves pumping CFA slurry into a magnetic drum where the magnetic iron oxides and associated materials are collected and then the material is passed through a similar unit for further refining.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} removal of silica, alumina and {{phosphorus}} as impurities from Sanje iron ore using <b>wet</b> high-intensity <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> (WHIMS). Sanje iron ore contains low-grade hematite ore found in Nampundwe area of Zambia from which iron {{is to be used}} as the feed in the steelmaking process. The chemical composition analysis using X-ray Florence spectrometer showed that Sanje low-grade ore contains 48. 90 mass% of hematite (Fe 2 O 3) with 34. 18 mass% as an iron grade. The ore also contains silica (SiO 2) and alumina (Al 2 O 3) of 31. 10 mass% and 7. 65 mass% respectively. The mineralogical analysis using X-ray diffraction spectrometer showed hematite and silica as the major mineral components of the ore while magnetite and alumina exist as minor mineral components. Mineral particle distribution analysis was done using scanning electron microscope with an X-ray energy dispersion spectrometry (SEM-EDS) and images showed that the average mineral size distribution of alumina-silicate gangue particles is in order of 100 μm and exists as iron-bearing interlocked particles. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> was done using series L model 4 Magnetic Separator.

The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the use of the Franspoort nepheline syenite as an alumina and alkali resource for the glass and ceramics industry at Mamelodi Quarries, and to evaluate the production of a concentrate of zircon and rare earth elements as economic by-products. International standards require a nepheline product with a ferric oxide content of less than 0. 35 weight percent. The Franspoort nepheline syenite contains 3. 37 weight percent of ferric oxide. The iron-containing minerals present are aegirine, aegirine-augite, magnetite, ilmenite and pyrite. The removal of iron-bearing minerals was attempted by high-intensity <b>wet</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation,</b> low-intensity dry magnetic separation, spiral gravity separation, and heavy liquid separation to produce a saleable nepheline product. This product is the cleaned final concentrate, of the different separation tests, which contains the lowest iron concentration for application in the glass and ceramic industry. The mineral assemblage was determined with a petrographic study as well as X-ray diffraction and electron microprobe analyses. Material from the different separation tests was analysed with X-ray fluorescence to obtain the chemical composition and to evaluate the final iron content of the nepheline product. The dry magnetic separation method produced the best results. The nepheline product has a ferric oxide content of 0. 68 weight percent compared to the starting concentration of 3. 37 weight percent. The ferric oxide concentration is, however, above the accepted levels for the glass and ceramics industry. The ferric oxide content is attributed to small iron-rich mineral inclusions, which are locked in feldspar and nepheline. The final nepheline product is not suitable for the use in the glass and ceramic industry. Zircon was concentrated the best by the use of heavy liquid separation. Zircon is in most cases locked in the minerals albite, microcline, and nepheline. The rare earth elements are mostly associated with zircon and fluorite and therefore it will not be viable to produce it as a by-product.

40|$|In {{the mining}} industry, {{ferromagnetic}} particles (e. g. magnetite) are concentrated using <b>wet</b> low-intensity <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> (LIMS). Mineral particles in suspension with water are {{pumped into the}} separator tank, and a magnetic concentrate is extracted by use of magnetic forces. The performance of the process is {{to a large extent}} controlled by the internal flow conditions in the separator, governed by process and machine settings. Due to the machine design these settings are not independent, and in some cases {{it can be difficult to}} reach optimal process performance. The main purpose of this work has been to find a measurement method capable of monitoring internal material transport in the wet LIMS, and use these data, together with numerical flow modelling, to get an increased understanding about the separation process. Since the mineral slurry entering the separator is essentially opaque, and the solids concentration is rather high, an ultrasound-based method was selected for the internal measurements. It is of interest to monitor both the internal flow patterns, as well as material build-up resulting from the magnetic field. The method development and evaluation proceeded in steps with increasing complexity, with later stages building on experience from the former. Initial measurements were done in model systems with simple geometries, and over a range of flow velocities corresponding to flow velocities in full-scale magnetic separators. Additional measurements were done on model systems under influence of a magnetic field of varying strength. After the measurement methods were verified in controlled laboratory conditions they were evaluated in real world conditions; in situ at the LKAB pilot plant in Malmberget, Sweden. For the pilot scale experiments a setup with two ultrasound transducers, mounted at the bottom of the separator tank, was used. The factors included in the designed experiment were the feed solids concentration, drum rotational speed, position of the concentrate weir, and the magnet assembly angle. Based on this investigation the drum rotational speed was the factor having the strongest influence on the overall flow velocity in the dewatering zone. Also, the presence of a recirculating flow transporting gangue particles away from the concentrate was confirmed. The factor with strongest influence on this flow is also the drum rotational speed, together with the magnet assembly angle. Using this method it is possible make high quality measurements of internal flow velocity profiles. It is also possible to monitor material build-up on the separator drum, and e. g. detect overload of magnetic material. The ultrasound based measurement system resulting from this work measures particle velocity based on a cross-correlation principle. Two consecutive ultrasound pulse-echo signals are cross-correlated piece-wise, to obtain a local velocity estimate. By measuring the suspension flow from two directions, using two transducers, 2 D velocity vectors can be estimated. Using the same measured data, but instead studying how the spectral contents of the signal vary with axial distance from the transducer, a qualitative measure of variations in local solids concentration can be obtained. During this work several aspects of wet LIMS have been studied, with focus on the internal material transport processes inside the separators. State-of-the-art measurement methods have been utilized to monitor the material flow inside the separators. Particle capture and entrainment have been studied on the particle level using numerical flow modelling. Measurement results have been linked to operational conditions of the separators. The insights gained, and the methods developed, have generated new possibilities to control, optimise, and develop the wet LIMS process.

40|$|The European Commission, {{as part of}} its Thematic Strategy on the {{prevention}} and recycling of waste, committed itself to tackle one of the issues around the waste definition, namely the distinction between waste and by-products. This definition has been outlined through the Communication on waste and by-product of the European Court of Justice (Brussels, 21. 2. 2007 COM(2007) 59 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT). By-product is a substance or object, resulting from a production process, the primary aim of which is not the production of that item. By-products can come {{from a wide range of}} business sectors, and can have very different environmental impacts. If there is a possibility that the material is in fact not useable, because it does not meet the technical specifications that would be required for its use, then it should continue to be considered as a waste. The status of waste protects the environment from the potential consequences of this uncertainty. If it subsequently happens that a use is found for the waste in question then it will lose its status of waste and it will be considered a by-product. An incorrect classification could be the cause of environmental damage or unnecessary costs for business. For this purpose a characterization of sludge coming from different plants of stone processing was carried out for a better classification of the materials in view of a future recovery. The different stones cutting processes considered for this study are: gangsaw, diamond blade and diamond wire. The cut materials are granites, gneisses, and other stones mainly of silicatic nature. The tests performed on the sawing sludge are the following: particle size analysis, chemical analysis, <b>wet</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation,</b> diffraction and SEM analysis. The study performed is useful for evaluating the possible reuses of the products coming from the magnetic separation: the metal fraction, and the mineral one. In order to avoid a subsequent environmental degradation and to promote a technology innovation (sustainability and circular economy) a proactive waste management strategy trying to optimize on the one hand the processing to obtain reduced waste and the other to improve the process to obtain two reusable by-products was considered...|$|E
40|$|Solid waste {{management}} {{is a key}} component for the natural stone industry. In recent years, multiwire machines have been overtaking stone gang saw cutting technology. The advantages of these new cutting-edge technologies are high efficiency and performance, flexibility of use, high quality of the cut surfaces, very low environmental impact (low energy consumption, lowest concentration of heavy metals in the sludge, less waste) and lowest noise levels. There are many studies on the separation and recovery of sludge from cutting with the gang saw, but very few on diamond cutting sludges. In accordance with the European Commission's Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste (EC raw material strategies), {{it is important to}} perform a correct characterization of sludge from cutting with the new technologies, in order to investigate its possible recovery. This paper presents a preliminary investigation of the sludge resulting from different types of silicatic stones with the aim of their valorization. The investigation was conducted on sludge from cutting with diamond wire, diamond saw blades, and mixed sludge resulting from the filter press. The following tests have been performed to characterize the sludge properties: chemical analysis on the solid fraction of sludge, particle size distribution, evaluation of the metals content through image analysis for each particle size, and leaching tests. To assess the possible recovery of the sludge, <b>wet</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> tests with a high gradient magnetic separator were performed in order to obtain two types of secondary materials, namely the mineral fraction and metals fraction. The separation efficiency has been evaluated through DRX and SEM analysis on the two fractions. The results obtained for the different particle size classes have been compared. The magnetic separation of the size class < 0. 038 mm has a low separation efficiency because of the phenomenon of grain capture by metallic granules: for this reason the metallic fraction of this class must be further processed {{if it is to be}} considered as a secondary raw material. On the other hand, the magnetic separation of the other granulometric classes is characterized by good separation efficiency. A good efficiency of the process is a key factor in order to optimize the recovery process and to increase the economic advantages. The study performed is useful for evaluating the possible reuse of both the metal and the mineral parts, through the implementation of a proactive {{waste management}} strategy in order to avoid a subsequent environmental degradation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this project}} the {{internal}} material transport processes of wet low-intensity magnetic separation (LIMS) is studied. The {{aim is to}} use results from experiments combined with published results to create a base for further research and development. During the initial work, presented here, the focus has been to develop an experimental platform and verify that ultrasound is a viable tool for flow measurement in suspensions with solids concentrations realistic for <b>wet</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> processes. The experiments {{have been carried out}} in a purpose built flow cell equipped with ultrasonic transducers and supported by a pump, mixer and necessary data accusation electronics. In the first conference paper, ultrasonic velocity profiling is used to estimate flow velocity profiles, and initial results are presented. When applied to flows of mineral suspensions of high solids concentration, similar to those in wet LIMS, the method is unique in combining:* Non-intrusive measurements. * Operation by a single transducer element. * Relatively good spatial resolution. * Operation in opaque suspensions. * Fast sampling rate. In a second conference paper the signal processing behind the measurement method is investigated more thoroughly and focus is on robust profile estimation. The connection between solids concentration, ultrasonic transducer centre frequency and penetration depth is also investigated. In a publication the measurements are put in relation to the application of interest. It is shown that the methods are generally applicable and can be used in situations where variations in suspension flow velocity through narrow geometries are of interest. The novelty shown is {{that it is possible to}} measure flow velocity profiles through suspensions carrying at least 10 vol% solids. For solids concentrations of 5 vol% or less it is possible to get a velocity profile through at least 50 mm of suspension. Results from measurements in suspensions of such high solids concentration combined with such long penetration depth have not been published before. The measurement method has gained attention from industry since it is generally applicable to narrow channel flows reachable from only one access point.

40|$|International audienceAutomotive {{shredder}} fluff is a by-product vacuumed during the shredding of end-of-life vehicles (ELV) hulks, and further refined in Post-Shredder lines of Treatment (PST). To date in Europe the mineral part exiting the PST is mostly landfilled without regards for its potentially valuable iron content. Yet, iron {{could be used}} a use {{as part of the}} ore in blast furnaces, provided several issues related to the chemical composition of fluff were solved. Besides increasing iron content, several tramp elements must be curbed below tight specifications to avoid iron spoiling, furnace wall corrosion, and changes in the hydrodynamic profiles during iron reduction. The present work aims at designing such a fluff sorting process, on the basis of two representative fluff fractions properly sampled on an industrial PST. The size distributions of these fractions and the repartitions of their chemical elements are used to rationalize and compare three different sorting processes which couple sieving, wet attrition, and dry or <b>wet</b> Low Intensity <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Separation.</b> The best process led to an optimized iron recovery of 78. 5 % corresponding to an elemental iron content of 51 %, close to the ore grade required in a blast furnace.

40|$|The first {{objective}} of the thesis was to reveal the characteristic magnetic behaviour of natural weakly magnetic minerals (such as hematite and chromite), and the size limits of the particles recoverable by the existing modem high intensity and high gradient magnetic separators. The second objective was to enhance the particle aggregation andlor the <b>magnetic</b> response for <b>wet</b> <b>magnetic</b> concentration of the ultrafines which escaped from the separators. It was observed that weakly magnetic natural minerals (hematite and chromite) exhibited variations in the magnetic behaviour with respect to magnetizing field, temperature and even particle size, It was indicated that high gradient <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> with industrial matrices was efficient for weakly magnetic minerals as small as 10 um, but below this size, poor separation efficiency was obtained. In this thesis, modifications to the existing magnetic technology or alternative methods were investigated for the efficient recovery of particles below 10 gm. The technology or methods included "carrier" or "piggy-back" method, aggregation with magnetic bonding (with permanent or fieldinduced magnetic moment), and hydrophobic magnetite seeding. The thesis discusses the theoretical aspects {{of the problem and}} the experimental work. It was clearly demonstrated that <b>wet</b> <b>magnetic</b> concentration was more efficient for the ultrafine fractions whereas other methods could be used to increase the effective particle size dimensions andlor the magnetic susceptibilities.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{utilization}} mode of titano-magnetite was firstly separating titano-magnetite by low intensity <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation,</b> then concentrating ilmenite from <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> tailings. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> tailings mainly contained ilmenite, {{but there}} was still a small quantity of titano-magnetite. Magnetic agglomeration of titanomagnetite occured because of existentence of remanence and pre-flotation grinding. It was found that titanomagnetite presented more optimal floatability than ilmenite. Therefore some gangues wrapped by titano-magnetite went into the floatation concentrate. In a word, titano-magnetite had negative effect on ilmenite floatation by decreasing grade and recovery of concentrate and increasing reagent consumption. The pre-removal of residual titano-magnetite before cleaning ilmenite from <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> tailings by floatation was essential...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, ferrous {{materials}} are usually recovered from Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) bottom ash by <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation.</b> To our knowledge, such a physical technique {{has not been}} applied so far to other MSWI residues. This study focuses thus on the applicability of <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> on boiler fly ashes (BFA). Different types of magnet are used to extract the magnetic particles. We investigate the magnetic particle composition, {{as well as their}} leaching behaviour (EN 12457 - 1 leaching test). The magnetic particles present higher Cr, Fe, Mn and Ni concentration than the non-magnetic (NM) fraction. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> does not improve the leachability of the NM fraction. To approximate industrial conditions, <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> is also applied to BFA mixed with water by using a pilot. BFA <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> is economically evaluated. This study globally shows {{that it is possible to}} extract some magnetic particles from MSWI boiler fly ashes. However, the magnetic particles only represent from 23 to 120 g/kg of the BFA and, though they are enriched in Fe, are composed of similar elements to the raw ashes. The industrial application of <b>magnetic</b> <b>separation</b> would only be profitable if large amounts of ashes were treated (more than 15 kt/y) and the process should be ideally completed by other recovery methods or advanced treatments. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
