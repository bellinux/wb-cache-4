Blue Lagoon {{which is a}} lake with a mini island is located behind KRS <b>water</b> <b>Dam</b> {{and it is very}} mesmerising to be there and watch the sunset and sunrise. The colour of the water and the sky is Blue and there is a mini island in the middle due to which it was named as Blue Lagoon. Mysuru has the Regional Museum of Natural History, the Folk Lore Museum, the Railway Museum and the Oriental Research Institute. The city is a centre for yoga-related health tourism that attracts domestic and foreign visitors, particularly those who, for years, came to study with the late ashtanga yoga guru K.

25|$|One {{scheme to}} save the temples {{was based on an}} idea by William MacQuitty to build a clear fresh <b>water</b> <b>dam</b> around the temples, with the water inside kept at the same height as the Nile. There were to be {{underwater}} viewing chambers. In 1962 the idea was made into a proposal by architects Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry and civil engineer Ove Arup. They considered that raising the temples ignored the effect of erosion of the sandstone by desert winds. However the proposal, though acknowledged to be extremely elegant, was rejected.|$|E

40|$|One hundred {{seventeen}} beaver dams were partially or wholly demolished {{with explosives}} from April through August between 1982 and 1984. These dams were of two types; shallow <b>water</b> <b>dams</b> found {{in areas of}} flat terrain, and deep <b>water</b> <b>dams</b> found in major creek channels or in areas of hilly terrain. Following demolition, various treatments were applied to the dam sites to try to retard rebuilding. Our conclusions are that deep <b>water</b> <b>dams</b> can be removed more effectively than shallow <b>water</b> <b>dams</b> and that late summer removals were rebuilt less frequently than early and midsummer removals. Also, certain types of repellents may be effective at reducing the frequency of rebuilding...|$|R
