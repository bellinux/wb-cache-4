40|$|AbstractThis study {{introduces}} {{an experimental}} work {{carried out in}} multi-pass laser welding with cold filler wire and laser-arc hybrid welding of thick section austenitic stainless steel. As it has been demonstrated earlier, hybrid and cold wire welding with a keyhole-mode can offer very efficient way to produce multi-pass welds in narrow gap thick section joints. However, when multi-pass welding is applied to one pass per layer method without e. g. scanning or defocusing, the used groove width needs to be very narrow {{in order to ensure}} the proper melting of groove side walls and thus to avoid lack of fusion/cold-run defects. As a consequence of the narrow groove, particularly in thick section joints, the accessibility of an arc torch or a <b>wire</b> <b>nozzle</b> into the very bottom of a groove in root pass welding can be considerably restricted. In an alternative approach described in this paper, a power density of a laser beam spot was purposely dispersed by using a defocusing technique. In groove filling experiments, a power density of defocused laser beam was kept in the range, which led the welding process towards to conduction limited regime and thus enabled to achieve broader weld cross-sections. The object was to study the feasibility of defocusing as a way to fill and bridge wider groove geometries than what can be welded with focused keyhole-mode welding with filler addition. The paper covers the results of multi-pass welding of up to 60 mm thick joints with single side preparations...|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} be able to control the {{positions}} of the <b>wire</b> guiding <b>nozzle</b> in relation to the component to be wound, even with different component geometries, normally three CNC axes are used for the method with a <b>wire</b> guiding <b>nozzle.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} of the needle winding technology {{is the fact that}} the needle support carrying the <b>wire</b> guiding <b>nozzle</b> is normally coupled to a CNC coordinate system. This allows moving the nozzle through space towards the stator. This way, it is possible to also perform a laying movement apart from the normal lifting motion and the rotation of the stator. A targeted placing of the wire is nevertheless only possible to a limited extend since the wire is pulled at an angle of 90° from the <b>wire</b> guiding <b>nozzle</b> resulting in an undefined bulging.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{impact that}} {{distance}} between thermal <b>wires</b> and <b>nozzle</b> on flow distribution of fluidic gyroscope {{with three different}} cavity structures was researched. Using the Finite element method we calculated the two-dimensional flow distribution of fluidic gyroscope with rectangular cavity and two streamlined cavity structures when the distance d between thermal <b>wires</b> and <b>nozzle</b> is different. The results show that: flow velocity at the outlet in two streamlined cavities is larger than that in rectangular cavity, which is 28. 87 % and 28. 91 % of flow velocity at the nozzle respectively; the velocity in the three cavities decrease with d, the velocity in streamlined cavity 1 is always larger than that in streamlined cavity 2. When d = 16 mm and 17 mm, there are a larger velocity and a smaller x-axial velocity of the fluidic beam center in streamlined cavity 1, and velocity difference of two thermal wires increase, so the resolution of fluidic gyroscope can have an improvement...|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>wire</b> guiding <b>nozzle</b> can {{be moved}} freely {{throughout}} the room, {{it is possible for}} the nozzle to terminate the wire at the contact points if equipped with an additional swivel device. As {{in the case of the}} conventional linear winding technology, a contact pin or a hook contact can be terminated for the electrical connection and for interconnecting the single poles in a star connection or delta connection.|$|R
40|$|Powder {{and wire}} {{deposition}} {{have been used}} separately in many laser-cladding, rapid prototyping and other additive manufacturing applications. In this paper, a new approach is investigated by simultaneously feeding powder from a coaxial <b>nozzle</b> and <b>wire</b> from an off-axis nozzle into the deposition melt pool. Multilayer parts are built from 316 L steel using a 1. 5 kW diode laser and different configurations of the powder and <b>wire</b> <b>nozzles</b> are compared in terms of surface roughness, deposition rate, porosity and microstructure. The parts are analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and optical microscopy techniques. Results show that deposition efficiency increased and surface roughness decreased with the combined process; some porosity was present in samples produced by this method, but it was 20 - 30 % less than in samples produced by powder alone. Wire injection angles into the melt pool in both horizontal and vertical planes {{were found to be}} significant for attaining high deposition efficiency and good surface quality. Reasons for the final sample characteristics and differences between the combined process and the separate powder and wire feeding techniques are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|This {{enables the}} {{terminating}} to coil body posts (the posts are also {{intended to make}} contacts by soldering or welding): By letting the three axes run {{in a way that}} a spiral movement of the <b>wire</b> guiding <b>nozzle</b> around the initial winding post is resulting, it is possible to fix the start or end wire of a coil by the so-called termination. To keep the wire under tension when changing the product, it is fixed to a wire parking pin of the machine.|$|R

Since a purely analytic solution is not available, a series of semiempirical solutions was proposed...|$|R
50|$|These {{unpredictable}} circumstances may {{be prevented}} or counteracted {{at the beginning}} of the winding by forcing the wire, meaning, every single winding of the first layer on the inner coil diameter, into a predefined position. The wire places itself into a prefabricated groove geometry of the coil body and the wire guide does not need to follow it exactly but only approximately. Since the wire always loses in cross-sectional area due to the wire drawing to be used and the necessary deflections (mechanical stresses under tensile load) during winding, the distance between the grooves is designed only for the max. possible wire diameter. Effects of bends and tolerances of the wire and the coil body as well as changing surface qualities can be avoided that way. Especially wire bends that develop due to wire deflections caused by, e.g., pulleys, wire eyelets or even the <b>wire</b> guiding <b>nozzle</b> itself within the wire feeder of a winding machine can lead to deformations that remain on the winding of a coil. Applying grooves to the winding basis supports the layer-accurate position of the wire during the winding process. This behavior isparticularly beneficial for the winding processes where a plastic deformation of the wire is unavoidable immediately before the depositing of the wire onto the winding basis. This behavior can be observed especially in the needle winding technology. Due to physical reasons, it is unavoidable that the wire leaves the <b>wire</b> guiding <b>nozzle</b> at an angle of approx. 90°. Therefore, mechanical tensions remain inside the wire that are visible in the form of a bent winding on the winding basis. As a result, the following windings or also the following layers can change in their desired position.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{from the}} second layer, the {{relocation}} is facilitated, since the wire is guided through the inter-spaces of the preceding layer. In case of deflections that are not too excessive {{as far as the}} process is concerned, the wire leads itself and with a constant number of windings per layer. It means for the wire guiding movement that the smaller the distance of the <b>wire</b> guiding <b>nozzle</b> towards the coil, the more precise the tracking must be. In certain circumstances it can be completely performed without a relocating movement, if the distance from the nozzle to the coil is that long that the force component against the guiding behavior of the wire itself has no longer an effect. Due to the self-guiding behavior of the wire, it is therefore possible that also during orthocyclic winding the wire guide can run continually and does not need to follow gradually.|$|R

40|$|Wire is a {{versatile}} product that offer the highest strength in any material and has therefore been a product form {{that is highly}} valued in engineering alloys. The idea of direct casting wire directly from metallic alloy melt {{has been around for}} long but for many reasons has not progressed to large scale commercialization. The main problem had been the difficulty of maintaining a stable melt stream while melt jet can be quenched and continuously solidified into unbroken wire product. Here, we consider the factors responsible for stabilizing a liquid metallic melt jet and the optimization of these. Experimentation with Fe-Si-B-Cr melts for single and multi-strand is reported. It is demonstrated that high strength metallic glass wires were castable using up to five strands. The role of oxide forming elements in stabilizing and widening the range of process parameters is emphasized. X-ray photon electron spectroscopy (XPS) of direct cast wires showed that stable Cr/Si oxide were formed and the evaluation of experimental cast data suggest that a minimum concentration of oxide former is required to maintain continuity in wire products. Other significant process parameters to be optimized for continuous wire formation in multi-streaming <b>wire</b> casting were, <b>nozzle</b> spacing, nozzle-water clearance, and the cast temperature. The multi-streaming of the wire casting process was achieved using laser drilled nozzles and thus provided a credible path for increasing the throughput in a wire casting process...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:––Metal parts {{often fail}} their {{intended}} use {{not because they}} fracture, but because they wear, which causes them to lose dimension and functionality. Different categories of wear exist, but the most typical modes are – Abrasion, Impact, Metallic (metal to metal), Heat, Corrosion etc. Most worn parts don't fail from a single mode of wear, such as impact, but {{from a combination of}} modes, such as abrasion and impact etc. Hardfacing is the deposition of material on the base material, the filler material which is deposited is harder than the base material by MIG welding.

40|$|Environmental destruction, {{global warming}} and limited potable water {{resources}} are problems often mentioned in opinion polls that ask the public to identify major problems to be solved, this century. Demand for freshwater continues to grow, but sufficient natural sources are not always available. One solution is to supply potable water from seawater using desalination technology. Most conventional desalination systems are very energy intensive and use energy supplied by fossil fuels. There is a new interest to utilise low grade energy and couple a desalinator with a thermal process such as oil, gas or utility plant to produce both freshwater and power. The aim {{of this research is}} to design and evaluate a novel heat recovery system, which can cogenerate freshwater and power. Discharge thermal energy combined desalination (DTECD) with a power cycle utilises a waste heat stream as an energy source, which is available in some energy intensive plants such as ammonia or gas processing plant. DTECD includes two sub-systems: closed power cycle and open water cycle. At the core of the open water cycle is a vacuum spray flash evaporator (VSFE), which is based on low temperature thermal desalination system. The new VSFE system utilises a gas-liquid ejector to consume less energy and enable greater ease of operation compared to conventional vacuum desalinators, which use a vacuum pump or steam jet ejector. The feasibility of the proposed DTECD process was evaluated by applying the ASPEN/HYSYS V 8. 0. Two configurations of process were modelled and the results were validated based on the waste heat of two industrial case studies: ammonia and gas processing plants. Subsequently, the performance of the proposed process was evaluated by using an exergy approach, thermodynamic modelling and a thermo-economic study. The bottlenecks of the DTECD process were improved by parametric optimisation and process modification. The results revealed that the overall exergy efficiency of the proposed heat recovery system is about 50 % and this is an economic option to couple with a thermal plant. Furthermore, the core VSFE system has been designed and manufactured for the experimental study of: (i) the performance of suggested downward gas-liquid ejector (eductor), (ii) the effects of temperature and salinity of motive fluid on overall performance of the eductor and desalination system. Numerical models of two-phase flow, based on the thermodynamic model and transfer phenomena were applied to the VSFE system. Experimental conditions were compared with a predictive model to find its accuracy. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method, which is embedded in ANSYS/Fluent 16. 2 was undertaken to investigate the individual conversion laws inside the vessel. Based on the physics of VSFE, a discrete phase model (DPM) is needed to investigate the spray of saline water under vacuum conditions. The experimental data proved that the performance of the VSFE system is in good agreement with theoretical model and utilising a downward eductor with saline water as motive fluid is an economic option to generate the required vacuum. Also, the CFD results showed that the evaporation rate of the system follows the experimental data and the optimum geometry of the VSFE affects the overall performance. Finally, general aspects of working fluids in the proposed process and applications of <b>wire</b> mesh <b>nozzle</b> vs. spiral nozzle in desalinator are discussed...|$|R
