5|$|The Germans {{became aware}} of their losses to night fighters, and began a rush program to {{introduce}} a new radar operating on different frequencies. This led to the lower-VHF band FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2, which began to reach operational units in small numbers between August and October 1943, with about 50 units in use by November. In February 1944, No. 80 Sqn noticed a marked decrease in FuG 202 transmissions. By this time the Germans had produced 200 SN-2 sets, and this had reached 1,000 by May. This set deliberately selected a frequency close to that of their ground-based Freya radar sets, {{in the hopes that}} these sources would swamp any <b>wide-band</b> receiver set used on RAF aircraft. Early Serrate units were effectively useless by June 1944, and their replacements were never as successful.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, one {{important}} research avenue {{was trying to}} increase the design bandwidth of <b>wide-band</b> filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was {{to start with a}} lumped element prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum Q of five (see Band-pass filters below for an explanation of Q). In 1957, Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype. This prototype was based on quarter wave impedance transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave, corresponding to a Q of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later, exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The capacitive gap filter (figure 8) and the parallel-coupled lines filter (figure 9) are examples of directly coupled resonators.|$|E
5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with <b>wide-band</b> FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E

Such approaches have been shown to perform superior to other methods for discontinuous frequency signal, e. g. the harmonic retrieval problem. In this report a similar approach is applied to <b>wide-banded</b> AR processes. It is found that the so-called extraneous poles of the lower rank solution spoil the spectral estimate. A new approach, the direction weighted total least squares solution, which enforces the extraneous poles to be located at the origin while maintaining the good properties of the aforementioned approaches, is therefore introduced.

500|$|The <b>wide-band</b> {{nature of}} waffle-iron filters finds {{applications}} in satellite communications. [...] A satellite earth station may have multiple diplexers {{connected to a}} multi-band antenna feeder.

[...] They are also used in industrial microwave manufacturing processes to prevent the escape of microwave radiation from the microwave chamber.

40|$|CIVINSApproved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedObserved distributions of wave heights and periods taken from {{one year of}} surface wave monitoring near Martha's Vineyard are compared to distributions based on narrow-band theory. The joint distributions of wave heights and periods and the marginal height distributions are examined. The observed significant wave heights and periods of the extreme waves are also studied. Seas are classified by the shapes of their power density spectra. Spectra with a single peak are designated as unimodal and spectra with two peaks as bimodal. Seas are further classified by spectral width, {{a function of the}} thee lowest spectral moments. The joint distributions of wave heights and periods from seas with narrow spectral widths take the general shape predicted by narrow-band theory and the statistics of extreme waves for these seas are well described. As spectral width increases, agreement between the theoretical and observed distributions diminishes and the significant wave heights and statistics of extreme waves show increasingly variability.
