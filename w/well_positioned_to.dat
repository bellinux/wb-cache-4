5|$|At 15:00 Lhermitte {{ordered the}} masts on Preneuse {{to be cut}} away and the frigate and battery then opened fire on Adamant, which was {{carefully}} sailing through the coastal shoals {{in an effort to}} engage the beached French ship. For more than two hours Hotham's ship worked its way inshore until at 17:30 it was <b>well</b> <b>positioned</b> <b>to</b> open fire, unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse. By 17:45 it was clear that further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|When the Germans {{launched}} {{the invasion of}} Crete on 20 May, Kippenberger, {{like most of the}} defenders of the island, was surprised at the sight of hundreds of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) descending under parachutes. He quickly recovered and was making his way to his headquarters, when a burst of gunfire from a paratrooper was directed his way. After twisting his ankle in avoiding the gunfire, he stalked and killed the paratrooper with a shot to the head. His brigade was positioned east of Maleme airfield, on the Galatas plains. It was <b>well</b> <b>positioned</b> <b>to</b> counterattack scattered paratroopers who were beginning to consolidate into a good starting position from which an attack on the airfield could be launched. His request to do so was denied by the acting divisional commander, Brigadier Edward Puttick. An attack launched later without Kippenberger's knowledge failed although he believed the outcome could have been different if his troops had been involved.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{study of the}} water-flooding process with different horizontal and vertical well configurations using flow visualization technique. The effect of horizontal wells on flood profile has been investigated by using two different well configurations, viz., horizontal injection-vertical production (HI-VP) and vertical injection-horizontal production (VI-HP). The experimental results show that HI-VP configuration recovers more oil than VI-HP configuration. The commercial simulator, ECLIPSE, is used for simulating the flood profiles for these well configurations. A good agreement is observed with the experimental flood profiles. Further simulations are carried out with varied perforation lengths and <b>well</b> <b>positions</b> <b>to</b> find out the optimal well configuration for both HI-VP and VI-HP.

Crabbe was <b>well</b> <b>positioned</b> <b>to</b> serve the King in this task, and from 4 April to 12 August 1339 was with the Admiral of the Fleet North of the Thames, Robert de Morley, 2nd Baron Morley.

Following Gemellus' death, Caligula marked his brother-in-law, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, husband of his sister Julia Drusilla, as his heir. However, after Drusilla's death, Lepidus was accused of having affairs with Caligula's other sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla and he was executed. He had previously had Drusilla's first husband Lucius Cassius Longinus killed and upon the death of Agrippina's husband Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, he seized his inheritance.|$|E

25|$|In less {{developed}} countries, some traditional fishing villages persist {{in ways that}} have changed little from earlier times. In more developed countries, traditional fishing villages are changing due to socioeconomic factors like industrial fishing and urbanization. Over time, some fishing villages outgrow their original function as artisanal fishing villages. Seven hundred years ago, Shanghai, beside the Yangtze River delta, was a small fishing village. In recent times, fishing villages have been increasingly targeted for tourist and leisure enterprises. Recreational fishing and leisure boat pursuits can be big business these days, and traditional fishing villages are often <b>well</b> <b>positioned</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of this. For example, Destin {{on the coast of}} Florida, has evolved from an artisanal fishing village into a seaside resort dedicated to tourism with a large fishing fleet of recreational charter boats. The tourist appeal of fishing villages has become so big that the Korean government is purpose-building 48 fishing villages for their tourist drawing power. In 2004 China reported it had 8,048 fishing villages.|$|E

500|$|The {{stations}} burned {{a mix of}} bituminous and anthracite coal. They consumed [...] of coal {{per week}} and had a peak consumption of [...] per week during the winter. They were <b>well</b> <b>positioned</b> <b>to</b> use coal from the Northumberland and County Durham coal fields. All of the coal used in the stations was brought to them via rail transport from UK coal stocks. Trains delivered coal to the station using the North Blyth Branch of the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The stations' coal handling facility was fitted with a Merry go Round (MGR) coal delivery system in 1981, after high capacity rapid discharge waggons became the British Rail standard. This system involved the trains slowly passing over a hopper and automatically discharging their cargo through doors underneath the train. Because of site space restrictions, a balloon loop track layout could not be constructed, so instead {{of being able to}} move continuously, trains arriving on site had to pull onto a reception track; the locomotive would then uncouple and recouple at the opposite end, before slowly moving over the unloading track hopper and discharging the coal and eventually leaving site. Towards the end of the station's operation, coal was more frequently brought in by road. All coal was delivered to and stored in a large open area {{to the north of the}} power stations. This had a tarmac barrier underneath it to prevent downward contamination. The coal was brought from the storage area to the station using a system of conveyor belts, which travelled over the Bedlington-Cambois Road separating the two sites, before being integrated to feed both stations as necessary.|$|E
