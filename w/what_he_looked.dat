5|$|Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch, a {{linguist}} and cartographer at the Smithsonian who {{was recruited}} to decipher The Shepherd's Journal while directing {{an expedition to}} Atlantis. Kirk Wise, one of the directors, said that they chose Fox for the role because they felt he gave his character his own personality and made them more believable on screen. Fox said that voice acting was much easier than his past experience with live action {{because he did not}} have to worry about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like in front of a camera while delivering his lines. The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for Titan A.E.; he allowed his son to choose which film he would work on, and he chose Atlantis. Viewers have noted similarities between Milo and the film's language consultant, Marc Okrand, who developed the Atlantean language used in the film. Okrand stated that Milo's supervising animator, John Pomeroy, sketched him, claiming not to know how a linguist looked or acted.|$|E
25|$|Gudea's {{appearance}} is recognizable today {{because he had}} numerous statues or idols, depicting him with unprecedented, lifelike realism, placed in temples throughout Sumer. Gudea took advantage of artistic development because he evidently wanted posterity to know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like. And in that he has succeeded—a feat available to him as royalty, {{but not to the}} common people who could not afford to have statues engraved of themselves.|$|E
500|$|King {{initially}} named Donald DeFreeze, lead kidnapper in the Patty Hearst case, as {{his inspiration}} for Randall Flagg. According to King, {{he remembered the}} Patty Hearst case {{when he began to}} write a description of DeFreeze: [...] "Donald DeFreeze is a dark man". He remembered that in photographs of the bank robbery in which Patty Hearst participated that DeFreeze was only partially visible, hidden under a large hat. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like was based on guesses made by people who only saw a portion of him. This inspired King, who then wrote [...] "A dark man with no face". After reading [...] "Once in every generation the plague will fall among them", King began writing The Stand and developing the character of Randall Flagg.|$|E
50|$|The Principal: The {{principal}} of the school. No one knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like or where he is.|$|R
6000|$|... "All night I waited!" [...] he cried. [...] "I {{could not}} sit still. I could {{scarcely}} breathe. Tell me <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is like, Julia? Tell me <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like? Is <b>he</b> strong? Does <b>he</b> <b>look</b> strong {{enough for the}} work?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet, Count; but I {{hope to do}} so shortly. I know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like now. This gentleman is his twin-brother. They are doubles." ...|$|R
2500|$|The People's Republic of China, just {{ending a}} war with Vietnam, gave Hui {{permission}} to film on Hainan Island. [...] Boat People was the first Hong Kong movie filmed in Communist China. Hui saved a role for Chow Yun-Fat, but because at that time Hong Kong actors working in mainland China were banned in Taiwan, Chow Yun-Fat declined the role out of fear for being blacklisted. Six months before filming was set to start, and after the film crew were already on location in Hainan, a cameraman suggested that Hui give the role to Andy Lau. [...] At that time, Andy Lau was still a newcomer in the Hong Kong film industry. Hui gave Lau the role and flew him to Hainan before a proper audition or even seeing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like.|$|E
2500|$|The father, Frans Ludwig Billman (1862–1930), {{was born}} in Berg' parish near Billingen. Here Torsten Billman's {{grandfather}} had worn himself out in the hell of a crofter's holding. Torsten's mother Maria (1870–1953), born Hultgren, came from Skövde. Both parents had grown up under very poor conditions in Västergötland. Frans Billman's great talent for tailoring allowed him, despite only 14 days of elementary school, go to Copenhagen and London to train himself to become a fine tailor. In the 1890s Frans and Maria moved to workingclass suburb Haga, Gothenburg. 1909 they moved, with their three-year-old daughter Ingegerd (b. 1906), to Kullavik (south of Gothenburg). In Kullavik Frans Billman opened his own tailor shop. Frans wished that Torsten also should become a tailor; so Torsten's artistic interest lay dormant after he finished school in 1924. Torsten also understood that the father got fewer and fewer customers, {{as more and more}} hand-tailors in the mid-1920s were knocked out by the expanding clothing industry. So for good reasons Torsten had no desire to become a tailor - he longed out, away! [...] <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> for was both freedom and contact with human beings, work communion.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it, you ugly little toad?" [...] I asked viciously, {{for that}} was just <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like; even the skin under his jaw moved like a toad's.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell {{him first}} {{what we think}} of him," [...] he objected. [...] "Let me tell him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> in the eyes of a pure-minded American." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is nothing}} of the sort," [...] said Mr. Marwood indignantly. [...] "There {{is no such thing}} as a picture of God, Felix. No human being knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like--no human being CAN know. We should not even try to think <b>what</b> <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> like. But, Felix, you may be sure that God is {{infinitely}} more beautiful and loving and tender and kind than anything we can imagine of Him. Never believe anything else, my boy. As for this--this SACRILEGE--take it and burn it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've often {{wondered}} myself <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like," [...] said Felicity {{in a burst}} of confidence. Even in Felicity, so it would seem, there were depths of thought unplumbed.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has made}} some promise, has gone to get {{released}} from it, and {{will come back to}} say <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> last night. He is so true I will believe in him and wait." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} forget her {{troubles}} {{for a little}} while, and {{began to think of}} Richard Darrien, her boy-lover of a long-past hour, wondering <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like now that he was grown to be a man.|$|E
60|$|But {{soon they}} gained courage {{to look more}} closely at the Peculiar Person. As he was a type of all the {{inhabitants}} of this extraordinary land whom they afterward met, I will try to tell you <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like.|$|E
6000|$|... "We will rig him out fresh when I get him home," [...] {{he said to}} the merchant. [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> {{like now}} in that {{greatcoat}} and billycock hat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] replied Sammy, [...] "he is just <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> to be,--king of the birds,--and {{that white}} head is {{the sign of}} his royalty given his great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather by Old Mother Nature, {{way back in the}} {{beginning}} of things." ...|$|R
50|$|He hates lies, meanness and sham {{but keeps}} his temper. He is loyal to his paper and to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> upon as his {{profession}}; {{whether it is}} a profession or merely a craft, he resents attempts to debase it.|$|R
60|$|I {{wanted to}} hear more. I wanted to know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like, how he spoke, how he {{compared}} with me in a thousand ways; but it was plain {{that she would not}} willingly be communicative about him; and, with a feeling of resentment, I gave her her way and suppressed my curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor {{yet they}} shallna, Alan! There's {{my hand on}} that," [...] cried James, {{for all the world}} as if he had really known my name and was {{foregoing}} some advantage. [...] "But just the habit he was in, and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like, and his age, and the like? I couldna well do less." ...|$|E
60|$|Aubrey {{was going}} to ask <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> to; but Leonard saw, or thought he saw, a weasel in the hedge, and the {{consequent}} charge and pursuit finished the dialogue, the boys parted, and Aubrey walked home, his satisfaction in his expedition oozing away at every step, though his resolve to assert his liberty grew in proportion.|$|E
5000|$|The World Association of Ugly People (in Italian Club dei Brutti) is an {{organization}} dedicated to fighting for the recognition of ugly people, {{in a society that}} places a high value on physical beauty. The group's motto is [...] "A person is <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is and not <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like".|$|R
5000|$|Went to {{the same}} high school as Mikoko. Brown hair. A very normal human being, [...] "I" [...] can never {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like. Has a frivolous personality. After the second book ends, [...] "I" [...] completely forgets about his existence.|$|R
50|$|Georg Hackl (born 9 September 1966) is a German former luger who {{was three}} time Olympic and World Champion. He is known affectionately as Hackl-Schorsch {{or as the}} Speeding Weißwurst a {{reference}} to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like in his white bodysuit coming down the luge at fast speeds.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{few minutes}} {{afterwards}} {{a knock at}} the door was heard, and the monthly nurse entered. She held something in her embrace; but he could not see <b>what.</b> <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> down pryingly into her arms, and at the first glance thought that it was his umbrella. But then he heard a little pipe, and he knew that it was his child.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] the Inspector answered. [...] "It's just as Dr. Wade said. Suggest a fact in {{your past}} history, {{and you may}} {{possibly}} remember it; but ask you to recall anything not suggested or already known, and all seems a mere blank to you! You haven't the faintest idea, then, who the murderer was or <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like?" ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{needless to}} add that the young girls never knew of this act of violence, or the {{delicacy}} that kept them in ignorance of it. Mr. Carr was too absorbed in business to give heed to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> upon as a convulsion of society as natural as a geological upheaval, and too prudent to provoke the criticism of his daughters by comment in their presence.|$|E
50|$|Fuzzy22 {{has asked}} Jen {{to meet him}} in person, to which she reluctantly agrees, though Jen is very nervous - she and Fuzzy22 had agreed to not {{exchange}} any identifying information, so {{she has no idea}} how old <b>he</b> is, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like, or if he is male or female.|$|R
50|$|Hussein al-Yemeni was a {{suspected}} Al-Qaeda terrorist group member {{believed to have}} {{played a part in}} the December 2009 attack on CIA employees in Afghanistan. While there are no witnesses who claim to know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like, <b>he</b> was thought to be in his later twenties or early thirties.|$|R
40|$|It&# 039;s just {{basically}} {{some of my}} favourites that&# 039;s on here. I&# 039;m into the desert, I like Vincent Van Gogh very much, two funny cards, that&# 039;s what my best friend looks like, that&# 039;s exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like. Take away the hat and that&# 039;s the exact spitting image of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like. So in actual fact if you come back this way, zoom in on that, that {{is my best friend}} {{and as you can see}} the resemblance between him and Chef is quite staggering. That&# 039;s why I&# 039;ve called my bear Sal because <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like him. And basically the rest of it I went to France in the World Cup, just the memorabilia, that which is round my neck there, because I write a lot I like to have a nice creative environment. So my favourite things around, nice pictures around, a nice environment that would inspire me or help me think (Mario, UK) ...|$|R
60|$|An {{infusion}} of feasibility--or <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> upon as such--into the sentimentality {{of such a}} man as Walter Lodloe generally acts as a stiffener to his purposes. He was no more in love with Mrs. Cristie {{than he had been}} when he left the Squirrel Inn, but he now determined, if he saw any reason to suppose that she would accept them, to offer himself and a Lethbury cottage to Mrs. Cristie.|$|E
60|$|The {{pedestrian}} was <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> like--a {{young man}} from London and the cities of the Continent. Nobody could see at present that his urbanism sat upon him only as a garment. He was just recollecting with something of self-reproach that a whole three years and eight months had flown since he paid his last visit to his father at this lonely rock of his birthplace, the intervening time having been spent amid many contrasting societies, peoples, manners, and scenes.|$|E
60|$|Then {{his eyes}} {{fell on the}} bed of mats in the corner, and he went up, {{and he saw the}} dreadful, mutilated, ghastly object which had been Strickland. He was dead. Dr. Coutras made an effort of will and bent over that {{battered}} horror. Then he started violently, and terror blazed in his heart, for he felt that someone was behind him. It was Ata. He had not heard her get up. She was standing at his elbow, looking at <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> at.|$|E
50|$|Bob Neil is an enigma. Much {{is known}} about him, but few could tell you <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> like, or how to find him. Many have tried and failed - his fans have carried banners emblazoned with his name to major {{sporting}} events in Australia and around the world, from Adelaide Oval to the MCG, from Lord's to Trinidad.|$|R
50|$|Price {{has drawn}} notoriety for {{the matter in}} which he conducts his {{business}} and hires employees, as well. He has strict guidelines for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> for when expanding his team. Specifically, Ph.D.'s with backgrounds in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, or computer science. Also, strong analytical and programming skills is something he values in his hiring practices.|$|R
5000|$|With the others, Xman {{attends the}} funeral of the slumlord. Xman finds that death is <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> <b>looking</b> for: [...] "captionless and devoid of symptomal content.". [...] During a eulogy, Siegfried throws Xman a sawed-off shotgun, who fires, first at Fatima, then the others. Chaos breaks out, Xman himself is shot, he throws a bomb, and dies.|$|R
