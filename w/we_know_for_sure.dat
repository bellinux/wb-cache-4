NBC reported losing $500,000 in advertising revenue. Speaking of this loss, then-NBC president Warren Littlefield said, at odds with NBC's earlier denial of possible revenue loss being a factor in its scheduling decision, [...] "There are few things in broadcasting that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure,</b> {{and one of those}} is that when you do an episode of any series that deals with AIDS, {{there is going to be}} advertiser sensitivity to it.

[...] He also condemned Levingston for not standing up for his players. On May 7, Clarós issued an open letter to the City of Halifax and the fans of the Rainmen. In a paragraph about the forfeit, he wrote, [...] "At this time, we don't know what the future holds.

2500|$|The Parthenon's façade {{as well as}} {{elements}} of its façade and elsewhere are said {{by some to be}} circumscribed by golden rectangles. Other scholars deny that the Greeks had any aesthetic association with golden ratio. For example, Midhat J. Gazalé says, [...] "It was not until Euclid, however, that the golden ratio's mathematical properties were studied. In the Elements (308 BC) the Greek mathematician merely regarded that number as an interesting irrational number, in connection with the middle and extreme ratios. Its occurrence in regular pentagons and decagons was duly observed, {{as well as in the}} dodecahedron (a regular polyhedron whose twelve faces are regular pentagons). It is indeed exemplary that the great Euclid, contrary to generations of mystics who followed, would soberly treat that number for what it is, without attaching to it other than its factual properties." [...] And Keith Devlin says, [...] "Certainly, the oft repeated assertion that the Parthenon in Athens is based on the golden ratio is not supported by actual measurements. In fact, the entire story about the Greeks and golden ratio seems to be without foundation. The one thing <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> is that Euclid, in his famous textbook Elements, written around 300 BC, showed how to calculate its value." [...] Later sources like Vitruvius exclusively discuss proportions that can be expressed in whole numbers, i.e. commensurate as opposed to irrational proportions.|$|E

2500|$|In a December 2016 {{interview}} with Bleeding Cool, Galligan again spoke {{about a third}} film saying that [...] "Warner Bros. definitely wants it, Chris Columbus {{wants to do it}} because he’d like to undo the Gremlins 2 thing as he wasn’t thrilled with it, and Spielberg wants to do it I imagine – because he’s Spielberg – and why wouldn’t he want to do it." [...] He said that Columbus was now in control of the franchise and once confirmed {{that there will be no}} remake or reboot, only a sequel. He also said that that Columbus [...] "has been aggressively working on a Gremlins 3" [...] and Columbus even went into some detail about what the third film would be about. Gremlins 3 takes place in present day. He tantalizingly says there will be some new characters and some old characters – I guess in the style of a [...] type sequel. One thing <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> is they have a writer on board. The only insight I can give is the following: There was a 6-year gap between Gremlins and Gremlins 2; most of that time was spent with them writing and rejecting ideas and re-writing. One of the ideas that was rejected was ‘gremlins in Vegas.’ They went with that for 18 months and felt it was too expensive. Eventually they came up with the tower idea, where essentially I’m working for Donald Trump, our new President! That took six years to happen. Carl Ellsworth has been apparently working on the script for a year and a half now." [...] Galligan said. It is unknown if Joe Dante will return to direct the third film.|$|E

In February 2008 the duo met up with Brian McCorkle, who was playing as the one-man project What Color Is Your Machine Gun. Lyndon and Jamie found themselves on the same musical plane as Brian, and they decided to head up to a farmhouse in Brattleboro, VT to record. They set up in a barn, accompanied by some “psychedelic experiences,” and began to lay down the tracks that would become their self-titled album.

40|$|The Supreme Court {{has told}} us, {{on the one}} hand, that provinces have {{constitutional}} capacity to infringe Aboriginal rights if they can justify the infringement and, on the other hand, that Aboriginal and treaty rights lie within a core of exclusive federal authority protected altogether from provincial impairment by the constitutional doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. In its 2010 jurisprudence, the Court had three opportunities to reflect on interjurisdictional immunity and perhaps to resolve this antinomy; two of those expressly involved provincial laws and Aboriginal interests. Yet {{at the end of}} 2010, we were no further ahead on it than we had ever been. All <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> was that rumours of the death of interjurisdictional immunity were exaggerated and that the Court was divided, and seemed confused, about how and when to think about the core of exclusive federal authority over “Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians”.
