5|$|Fame was {{the last}} musical film to be {{produced}} by MGM, before the studio merged with United Artists in 1981. The film has been credited with revitalizing the teen musical subgenre by adding dramatic elements into its story, echoing 1950s melodramas. Its presentation of musical numbers {{in the style of}} a music video—through the use of quick cuts with multiple angles and crowded, kinetic frames—was a major influence on other 1980s films in the dance film genre, such as Flashdance (1983), Footloose (1984) and Dirty Dancing (1987). It also inspired the creation of many similar performing arts schools around the world—notably the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA)— and popularized the use of leg <b>warmers.</b>|$|E

25|$|Athletic {{accessories}} were {{a massive}} {{trend in the}} early 1980s, and their popularity was largely boosted by the aerobics craze. This included leg <b>warmers,</b> wide belts, elastic headbands, and athletic shoes known as 'sneakers' in the US or 'trainers' in the UK.|$|E
25|$|A battery's {{characteristics}} {{may vary}} over load cycle, over charge cycle, and over lifetime due to many factors including internal chemistry, current drain, and temperature. At low temperatures, a battery cannot deliver as much power.

In the film version, when not actually participating in a group performance she would strike poses reminiscent of ancient Egyptian paintings, and she was Mr. Mistoffelees' assistant in his magic trick to rescue Old Deuteronomy.|$|E

25|$|Sodium acetate is {{also used}} in heating pads, hand <b>warmers,</b> and hot ice. Sodium acetate trihydrate {{crystals}} melt at 136.4°F/58°C (to 137.12°F/58.4°C), dissolving in their water of crystallization. When they are heated past the melting point and subsequently allowed to cool, the aqueous solution becomes supersaturated. This solution is capable of cooling to room temperature without forming crystals. By pressing on a metal disc within the heating pad, a nucleation center is formed, causing the solution to crystallize back into solid sodium acetate trihydrate. The bond-forming process of crystallization is exothermic. The {{latent heat of fusion}} is about 264–289kJ/kg. Unlike some types of heat packs, such as those dependent upon irreversible chemical reactions, a sodium acetate heat pack can be easily reused by immersing the pack in boiling water for a few minutes, until the crystals are completely dissolved, and allowing the pack to slowly cool to room temperature.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the food}} aboard is vacuum sealed in plastic bags. Cans are rare because they are heavy and {{expensive}} to transport. Preserved food is not highly regarded by the crew, and taste is reduced in microgravity. Therefore, effort is made to make the food more palatable, such as using more spices than in regular cooking. The crew looks forward {{to the arrival of}} any ships from Earth, as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables. Care is taken that foods do not create crumbs. Sauces are often used to avoid contaminating station equipment. Each crew member has individual food packages and cooks them using the on-board galley. The galley features two food <b>warmers,</b> a refrigerator added in November 2008, and a water dispenser that provides both heated and unheated water. Drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption. Drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws. Solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away. Any food that floats away, including crumbs, must be collected to prevent it from clogging the station's air filters and other equipment.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{station was}} a crude earth bank [...] high, {{held in place}} by wooden planks, but it was later rebuilt. The station was equipped with a short level platform, and a small [...] square goods shed. The main users of the goods facilities appear to have been the local dairy farms; in the 1880s, prior to the transfer to Metropolitan Railway operation, Wotton station was handling from 45,000 to 60,000 gallons (200,000 to 270,000l; 54,000 to 72,000USgal) of milk each year. The passenger station building itself was a wooden hut with an iron roof, [...] long by [...] wide, including a waiting room, a booking office and male and female toilet facilities. Until the early 20th century the station porter was required to keep a three-gallon kettle on the boil for foot <b>warmers,</b> should the passengers require them. A pair of small cottages were built near the station to house Tramway employees.|$|E

As Cyrus continues to sing, she is replaced by more girls holding different items, including teddy bears, stuffed animals, snow globes, and love letters. As the song approaches its chorus, Cyrus and the girls start dancing and jumping. Cyrus continues singing as she holds a white rose and a girl deletes a text message from her boyfriend. At one point, Cyrus holds a photograph of her and an ex-boyfriend with black curly hair, his face obscured by a doodle on a piece of notebook paper. At the end of the video, Cyrus blows the camera a kiss, mouths [...] "I love you," [...] and turns away.|$|E
500|$|Other {{developments}} in the dance industry occurred {{in response to the}} growing popularity of hip-hop. On the traveling convention circuit there were tap, ballet, and jazz dance conventions, but there were none specifically for hip-hop. The same void existed in dancewear. There was dancewear for tap, ballet, and jazz dancers but none for hip-hop dancers. Monsters of Hip Hop and Nappytabs dancewear were formed to answer to both needs. Nappytabs is the first line of hip-hop dancewear. Because their clothing is made for hip-hop dancers, they do not sell leotards, unitards, tights, or leg <b>warmers.</b> Their line consists of tank tops, shorts, t-shirts, sweat pants, harem pants, and hoodies. Monsters of Hip Hop (MOHH) was founded in 2003 in Baltimore, Maryland by Andy Funk, Becky Funk, and Angie Servant. The convention is dedicated exclusively to hip-hop instruction. Fatima Robinson, Stefan [...] "Mr. Wiggles" [...] Clemente, and Timothy [...] "Popin' Pete" [...] Solomon have taught classes at MOHH in the past. Every year, the convention brings together its top student dancers for a professionally choreographed showcase in Los Angeles called Monsters of Hip Hop: The Show.|$|E
500|$|By 1935 Jack Mara had {{received}} a degree from Fordham Law School, passed the bar, and was, at age 27, the team's president. By that same year, 19‑year‑old Wellington had become the team's secretary, {{and he started to}} exert influence over personal decisions. Newman retired before the 1935 season rather than come back from a back injury suffered the previous year when the team refused to give him a raise. This left Strong as the team's top draw, and the Giants signed him to a contract which guaranteed him $4,000 but gave him a percentage of the draw that could make his salary reach a maximum of $6,000 depending on attendance. At midseason the team's attendance had increased by 15% from the previous year's record ticket sales. Although Strong was paid well that season, and took advantage of high ticket sales from games in which he was injured, many of the other team's players were not. [...] "I felt pretty damn good," [...] Strong later said about his salary, [...] "but guys like Hein, Morgan, and Burnett weren't making much more than a hundred dollars a game. The salaries the front office fed to the newspapers weren't exactly true. We had three All-Stars on the Giants making less money than most of the bench <b>warmers</b> on the Dodgers. Hein was the greatest player the Giants ever had, but he didn't start making $5,000 until after his 12th season." [...] Hein remarked that he felt he was well paid for the time however, [...] "I think at the time $150 [...] was probably the highest pay of any lineman in the league. It was pretty good money, even though it wouldn't sound that way now, but you could buy a loaf of bread for a nickel and get a full meal for thirty-five cents in the Automat back then. And you had no income tax." ...|$|E

2500|$|If {{the wearer}} {{believes}} {{it is not possible}} to avoid high heels altogether, it is suggested that the wearer spend at least a third of the time they spend on their feet in contour-supporting [...] "flat" [...] shoes (such as exercise sandals), or well-cushioned sneaker-type shoes, saving high heels for special occasions; or if it is a necessity in their job, such as a lawyer, it is recommended that they limit the height of the heel that they wear, or, if they are in court, remain seated as much as possible to avoid damage to the feet. It is recommended to wear a belt if possible with heels, because the elevation of the foot and extension of the leg can cause pants to become looser than wanted. In the winter time, one could use seat <b>warmers</b> with heels to relax and loosen muscles all over the body.|$|E

2500|$|Being {{the record}} a more {{developed}} and mature set of songs, [...] "Subject to Change" [...] also {{proved to be}} The Faith's swan song, as the group disbanded {{by the summer of}} 1983. Drummer Ivor Hanson announced he would soon leave for college. Finding a replacement was not an option. According to guitarist Mike Hampton, the rest of the band was having trouble getting along. [...] "It was a good time to stop, but I suppose it’s a shame that we flamed out before getting a solid tour set up and executed, but it’s also a wonder and a success that we did what we did." [...] Alec declared that it was getting more difficult to be productive and creative together, although the end was also a beginning. After The Faith broke up, guitarist Eddie Janney formed Rites of Spring with Guy Picciotto; while Hampton, Bald, and Hanson went on to join Embrace with Ian MacKaye on vocals. When Embrace broke up in early 1986, Chris Bald rejoined Alec MacKaye in Ignition (with Alec on vocals;) meanwhile, Janney reunited with Michael Hampton for One Last Wish following Rites of Spring's breakup (later reformed as Happy Go Licky.) Finally, Hampton and Hanson reunited in Manifesto in 1991, while Alec MacKaye sang with The <b>Warmers</b> during the mid-'90s.|$|E

First, Jimmy Hart became his manager when Hart traded King Kong Bundy to Heenan {{in exchange for}} Adonis and The Missing Link. With Hart in his corner, Adonis defeated Corporal Kirchner to advance in The Wrestling Classic pay-per-view tournament in November, then lost to Dynamite Kid in the quarterfinals. In early 1986, Adonis started carrying a briefcase with the phrase [...] "Relax with Trudi" [...] on it and a spray called Fragrance. During an edition of Piper's Pit, Adonis gave his signature leather jacket away to host Roddy Piper (who wore it for years afterward). Adonis then adopted the gimmick of the effeminate [...] "Adorable" [...] Adrian Adonis, bleaching his hair blonde and wearing pink ring attire, as well as scarves, leg <b>warmers,</b> dresses, hats, and clownish amounts of eye shadow and rouge.
