About this time the textile industry in New England experienced a boom. With living conditions so harsh, and <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find even in the largest city, Montreal, emigration seemed the only option for many.

Mill owners hired these French immigrants to staff their mills more cheaply than American and Irish-born workers, who were themselves displaced.|$|E
