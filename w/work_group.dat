25|$|The <b>work</b> <b>group</b> {{published}} {{its final}} report on 31 December 2003 {{and came to}} a conclusion that while the proposed vessel would definitely be needed and it would be technically possible to construct one, fulfilling the requirements of the different operators with a single ship would be difficult and, as noted before, remaining on standby during the open water season would be very expensive. The <b>work</b> <b>group</b> estimated that the purchase price of the vessel would be 30–70 million euro.

25|$|Wilfred Bion's {{observations}} {{about the role}} of group processes in group dynamics are set out in Experiences in Groups and other papers, written in the 1940s but compiled and published in 1961, where he refers to recurrent emotional states of groups as 'basic assumptions'. Bion argues that in every group, two groups are actually present: the <b>work</b> <b>group,</b> and the basic assumption group. The <b>work</b> <b>group</b> is that aspect of group functioning which {{has to do with the}} primary task of the group—what the group has formed to accomplish; will 'keep the group anchored to a sophisticated and rational level of behaviour'. The basic assumption group describes the tacit underlying assumptions on which the behaviour of the group is based. Bion specifically identified three basic assumptions: dependency, fight-flight, and pairing. When a group adopts any one of these basic assumptions, it interferes with the task the group is attempting to accomplish. Bion believed that interpretation by the therapist of this aspect of group dynamics would, whilst being resisted, also result in potential insight regarding effective, co-operative group work.|$|E

25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a <b>work</b> <b>group</b> and quickly begin to measure up their skills with {{the people that they}} are assigned to work with.

Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the new multipurpose vessel began on 25 May 2003 when the Ministry of Transport and Communications appointed a <b>work</b> <b>group</b> to investigate the technical requirements and economic aspects of building a new multipurpose icebreaker capable of combating oil and chemical spills around the year. The amount of oil transported in the Gulf of Finland had increased from a mere 15 million tons {{per year in the}} early 1990s to 69 million tons in 2003 and was expected to reach 130 million tons by 2010 after the new Russian oil terminals became operational, increasing the risk of a large spill in the vulnerable sea area considerably. While Finland already had a fleet of vessels with oil recovery equipment, none of them were capable of collecting spilled oil efficiently in heavy seas or in ice. The new multipurpose icebreaker would be designed to be capable of recovering spilled oil and chemicals in both open water and ice conditions, extinguishing shipboard fires and emergency towing of the largest merchant ships operating in the Gulf of Finland. The new vessel would also have sufficient icebreaking capability to assist oil tankers to the Kilpilahti oil refinery in Porvoo during winter. However, in the interim report, published on 30 September 2003, the <b>work</b> <b>group</b> noted that unless other work outside the winter months could be arranged and the new multipurpose icebreaker would have {{to spend the rest of}} the year in pollution control readiness, the operating expenses would be very high.|$|E
25|$|When the {{earthquake}} hit, the third {{game of the}} 1989 World Series baseball championship was about to begin.

As a consequence the normally crowded freeways contained unusually light traffic. If traffic had been normal for a Tuesday rush hour, injuries and deaths would certainly have been higher. The initial media reports failed {{to take into account}} the game's effect on traffic and initially estimated the death toll at 300, a number that was corrected to 63 in the days after {{the earthquake}}.|$|E

25|$|Locke {{suggested}} {{several reasons}} why goals are motivating: they direct attention, lead to task persistence {{and the development}} of task strategies for accomplishing the goal. In order for a goal to be motivating, the employee or <b>work</b> <b>group</b> must first accept the goal. While difficult goals can be more motivating, a goal still needs to appear achievable, which in turn will lead to greater goal acceptance. The person or group should have the necessary skills and resources to achieve the goal, or goal acceptance could be negatively impacted. Specific goals that set a performance expectation are more motivating than those that are vague. Similarly, more proximal goals have greater motivation impact than those that are very long range or distal goals.|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} {{of individuals to}} be assigned to specific teams bears on the resulting effectiveness of those teams. Aspects of team composition {{that should be considered}} during the team selection process include team members' knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) as well their personalities and attitudes. To achieve high-quality results, teams built with members having higher skill levels {{are more likely to be}} effective than teams built around members having lesser skills; teams that include a members with a diversity of skills are also likely to show improved team performance. Additionally, higher levels of cognitive ability of team members has been shown to consistently correlate to increased <b>work</b> <b>group</b> effectiveness. Team members' personalities and attitudes have also been studied. For example, the personality factors agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability are related to better team performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{monopoly}} of the VAAP was abolished in 1989. Also during Perestroika, a <b>work</b> <b>group</b> was formed {{with the task}} to adapt the Soviet copyright law to a market economy. These efforts culminated in the passing of a profoundly revised copyright law on March 31, 1991. This new law was a radical break with the previous Socialist practice. Author's rights were exclusive again, the copyright term was increased to 50 years p.m.a., neighbouring rights were introduced {{for the first time}} in Soviet legislation, and the free uses were reduced considerably and defined much narrower. Compulsory licenses were abolished altogether. The initial copyright owner in a work in all cases was the natural person who created the work; the copyright of legal entities no longer existed. The provisions of the 1991 Fundamentals, which were scheduled to enter in force on January 1, 1992, never became effective in the Soviet Union, as the USSR was dissolved before that date.|$|E
