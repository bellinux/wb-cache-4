The works were originally planned as three phases: Bank-Lewisham, Poplar-Stratford, and the Beckton branch. The original £200m contract was awarded on 3 May 2007. Work started in 2007 and Bank-Lewisham was originally {{due to be}} completed in 2009. However, the work programme for the first two phases was merged and the infrastructure work was completed by the end of January 2010. The Lewisham-Bank route now runs three-car trains exclusively.

25|$|The Cruze {{returned}} to the BTCC in 2013 {{in the hands of}} Joe Girling and Tech-Speed Motorsport, who loaned the car from Finesse Motorsport. The increase in performance of the Next Generation Touring Car entries meant the older Super 2000 specification cars like the Cruze were now too uncompetitive to compete for wins but were provided with their own category. Now running a 2.0-litre turbocharged NGTC-specification engine, Girling took one class win at Donington Park but missed {{the second half of the}} season. The car {{returned to}} Finesse Motorsport who entered the Knockhill round of the championship with Aiden Moffat driving. At sixteen years old, Moffat became the BTCC's youngest driver at 16 years, 10 months and 28 days. This was to be the S2000 Cruze's final appearance in the BTCC, as S2000 cars are to be abolished from 2014. Andy Neate entered the 2013 season with a new NGTC-specification Cruze, built by his own team, IP Tech Race Engineering and used an engine built by RML. The car made its debut at Snetterton and competed at several rounds towards the end of the season. The car has since been sold to Aiden Moffat, who <b>will</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> car with his own team for 2014. BTC Racing will enter a hatchback variant of the Cruze for 2014, driven by Chris Stockton. The car was originally intended to be used by Jason Plato in 2012 but RML and Chevrolet withdrew from the BTCC and mothballed the shell. BTC Racing acquired it and were initially included on the entry list for 2013 but the car was not finished in time and never appeared all season.|$|E
500|$|The toothcomb {{is usually}} used for grooming. While licking the fur clean, the animal <b>will</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> toothcomb through the fur to comb it. Fine grooves or {{striations}} are usually {{cut into the}} teeth during grooming by the hair and may {{be seen on the}} sides of the teeth when viewed through a scanning electron microscope. The toothcomb is kept clean by either the tongue or, in the case of lemuriforms, the sublingua, a specialized [...] "under-tongue". The toothcomb can have other functions, such as food procurement and bark gouging. Within lemuriforms, fork-marked lemurs and indriids have more robust toothcombs to support these secondary functions. In some lemurs, such as the aye-aye, the toothcomb has been lost completely and replaced with other specialized dentition.|$|E

2500|$|Napoleon enacts {{changes to}} the {{governance}} structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who <b>will</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> farm. Through a young pig named Squealer, Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea. The animals work harder {{with the promise of}} easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project. Once Snowball becomes a scapegoat, Napoleon begins to purge the farm with his dogs, killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who {{was nowhere to be found}} during the battle) frequently smears Snowball as a collaborator of Jones', while falsely representing himself as the hero of the battle. [...] "Beasts of England" [...] is replaced with an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man.
