5000|$|<b>Riveting</b> <b>machines</b> can be sub-divided {{into two}} broad groups [...] - [...] impact <b>riveting</b> <b>machines</b> and orbital (or radial) <b>riveting</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic orbital <b>riveting</b> <b>machines</b> {{typically}} provide {{downward force}} in the 1000 - 7500 lb range. Hydraulic orbital <b>riveting</b> <b>machines</b> typically provide downward {{force in the}} 6000 - 50000 lb range.|$|R
50|$|<b>Riveting</b> <b>machines</b> {{are used}} to {{automatically}} set (squeeze) rivets in order to join materials together. The <b>riveting</b> <b>machine</b> offers greater consistency, productivity, and lower cost when compared to manual riveting.|$|R
50|$|Automatic feed <b>riveting</b> <b>machines</b> {{include a}} hopper and feed track which {{automatically}} delivers and presents the rivet to the setting tools which overcomes {{the need for}} the operator to position the rivet. The downward force required to deform the rivet with an automatic <b>riveting</b> <b>machine</b> is created by a motor and flywheel combination, pneumatic cylinder, or hydraulic cylinder. Manual feed <b>riveting</b> <b>machines</b> usually have a mechanical lever to deliver the setting force from a foot pedal or hand lever.|$|R

50|$|Impact <b>riveting</b> <b>machines</b> set the <b>rivet</b> {{by driving}} the rivet downwards, through the {{materials}} {{to be joined}} and on into a forming tool (known as a rollset). This action causes {{the end of the}} rivet to roll over in the rollset which causes the end of the rivet to flare out and thus join the materials together. Impact <b>riveting</b> <b>machines</b> are very fast and a cycle time of 0.5 seconds is typical.|$|R

50|$|There are {{different}} types of <b>riveting</b> <b>machines.</b> Each type of machine has unique features and benefits. The orbital riveting process is different from impact riveting and spiralform riveting. Orbital riveting requires less downward force than impact or spiral riveting. Also, orbital riveting tooling typically lasts longer.|$|R
50|$|In 1891, George Talbot {{developed}} {{a new type of}} wagon - the self discharging wagon, which became a major source of sales. A modern plant along North American lines was added in Jülicher Straße in the 1890s, with modern equipment including air hammers, <b>rivetting</b> <b>machines,</b> and electric power for machines. By 1900, the plant employed up to 400 workers.|$|R
50|$|Orbital <b>riveting</b> <b>machines</b> have a {{spinning}} forming tool (known as a peen) which is gradually {{lowered into the}} rivet which spreads the material of the rivet into a desired shape depending upon {{the design of the}} tool. Orbital forming machines offer the user more control over the riveting cycle but the trade off is in cycle time which can be 2 or 3 seconds.|$|R

A shoemaker in Leicester, Tomas Crick, patented the design for a <b>riveting</b> <b>machine</b> in 1853. His machine used an iron plate to push iron rivets into the sole. The process greatly increased the speed and efficiency of production. He also introduced the use of steam-powered rolling-machines for hardening leather and cutting-machines, in the mid-1850s.|$|R

5000|$|A {{flywheel}} {{may also}} be used to supply intermittent pulses of energy at power levels that exceed the abilities of its energy source. This is achieved by accumulating energy in the flywheel over a period of time, at a rate that is compatible with the energy source, and then releasing energy at a much higher rate over a relatively short time when it is needed. For example, flywheels are used in power hammers and <b>riveting</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R

50|$|The ZMC-2 was {{successful}} both in performance and longevity. Its manufacture required {{the development of}} a <b>riveting</b> <b>machine</b> and final assembly that are comparable to modern rockets and transport aircraft fuselages, while being capable of dealing with aluminum skin thicknesses thin enough to allow aerostatic lift. The final assembly of the single closing seam of the two hull-halves took over two months. Filling the rigid shell was similarly problematic, requiring an expensive and time-consuming process of filling it first with carbon dioxide, then with helium, and finally purifying the helium by scrubbing residual carbon dioxide from the helium. In addition, the hull had to be strengthened to sustain the weight of the carbon dioxide during the filling process.|$|R

The puddling furnaces employed hundreds of men, stripped to the waist, wearing hob-nailed shoes, and covered in coal dust. Boys worked at the swaging furnaces, removing the heated horseshoes with tongs and placing them on the revolving dies of the swaging machine.
