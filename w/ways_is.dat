Banquo's ability to live on in different <b>ways</b> <b>is</b> another oppositional force, in this case to Macbeth's impending death. His spirit lives on in Fleance, his son, and in his ghostly presence at the banquet.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by head writer Neil Cross. It was also {{additionally}} written by Ben Richards. The plot of the episode {{was influenced by the}} resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle <b>ways</b> <b>is</b> threatening the security of the West. The producers also included scenes that would show Lucas adjusting to the outside world following eight years of imprisonment, to show how emotionally damaged the character is, and make the audience realise he is struggling. One of the scenes include Lucas struggling to sleep on a bed, and soon resorts to lying on the floor instead.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} the plot, the {{producers}} wanted to repeat the same style as the previous sixth series and include another story-arc in the seventh. The writers and producers got together {{to think about what}} is to become a big political story that will affect the United Kingdom in twelve to eighteen months time. They decided on using the resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle <b>ways,</b> <b>is</b> threatening the security of the West. The new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the character should trust. The episode was written by Neil Cross. It was also additionally written by Ben Richards.|$|E

5|$|The Sandmans main {{character}} is Dream, the titular Sandman, also known to various characters throughout the series as Morpheus, Oneiros, the Shaper, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, the Cat of Dreams, Murphy, Kai'ckul and Lord L'Zoril, {{who is the}} anthropomorphic personification of dreams. At {{the start of the}} series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. The character's initial haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment {{at the start of the}} series, but the challenge of undoing past sins and changing old <b>ways</b> <b>is</b> an enormous one for a being who has been set in his ways for billions of years. In its beginnings, the series is a very dark horror comic. Later, the series evolves into an elaborate fantasy series, incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology, ultimately placing its protagonist in the role of a tragic hero.|$|E

25|$|Many {{forms of}} amnesia fix {{themselves}} without being treated. However, {{there are a}} few ways to cope with memory loss if that is not the case. One of these <b>ways</b> <b>is</b> cognitive or occupational therapy. In therapy, amnesiacs will develop the memory skills they have and try to regain some they have lost by finding which techniques help retrieve memories or create new retrieval paths. This may also include strategies for organizing information to remember it more easily and for improving understanding of lengthy conversation.|$|E
25|$|Another {{technique}} for overcoming the memory-size problem is using external sorting, for example {{one of the}} <b>ways</b> <b>is</b> to combine two algorithms {{in a way that}} takes advantage of the strength of each to improve overall performance. For instance, the array might be subdivided into chunks of a size that will fit in RAM, the contents of each chunk sorted using an efficient algorithm (such as quicksort), and the results merged using a k-way merge similar to that used in mergesort. This is faster than performing either mergesort or quicksort over the entire list.|$|E

25|$|From Biblical {{times to}} today, {{the most common}} form of prayer is to {{directly}} appeal to God to grant one's requests. This in many <b>ways</b> <b>is</b> the simplest form of prayer. Some have termed this the social approach to prayer. In this view, a person directly enters into God's rest, and asks for their needs to be fulfilled. God listens to the prayer, and may so or not choose to answer in the way one asks of him. This is the primary approach to prayer found in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, most of the Church writings, and in rabbinic literature such as the Talmud.|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) is {{a method}} that in some <b>ways</b> <b>is</b> more powerful than GC, but can be coupled to mass spectrometry just as easily. In LC, the concerns involving sample preparation can be minimal. In LC, both the stationary and mobile phase can affect the separation, whereas in GC only the stationary phase should be influential. This allows for the sample preparation to be minimal if one is willing to adjust the stationary phase or mobile phase before running the sample. The primary concern is the concentration of analyte. If the concentration is too high then separation can be unsuccessful, but mass spectrometry as a detection method does not need complete separation, showing another benefit of coupling LC to a mass spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|After a century, Doro finally tracks Anyanwu {{down to a}} Louisiana plantation. To his surprise, Anyanwu {{has created}} her own colony, which in many <b>ways</b> <b>is</b> more {{successful}} than Doro's. She protects her people until Doro's arrival, at which point he forces his breeding program on her community. One man he brings to mate with one of Anyanwuâ€™s daughters ruins the harmony of the colony, resulting in several deaths. Anyanwu becomes tired of Doro's control, since his immortality makes him the only permanent thing in her life. She decides to commit suicide. Her decision causes Doro to have a change of heart. In desperation, he agrees to compromise {{as long as she}} goes on living. From that point on, Doro no longer kills as carelessly to remain immortal, and does not choose his kills from the people that he should be protecting. He also stops using Anyanwu to breed; from now on she helps him in his quest to try to find more promising seeds, but is more of an ally and partner than his slave.|$|E

25|$|Gene {{nomenclature}} is {{the scientific}} naming of genes, the units of heredity in living organisms. An international committee published recommendations for genetic symbols and nomenclature in 1957. The {{need to develop}} formal guidelines for human gene names and symbols was recognized in the 1960s and full guidelines were issued in 1979 (Edinburgh Human Genome Meeting). Several other genus-specific research communities (e.g., Drosophila fruit flies, Mus mice) have adopted nomenclature standards, as well, and have published them on the relevant model organism websites and in scientific journals, including the Trends in Genetics Genetic Nomenclature Guide. Scientists familiar with a particular gene family may work together to revise the nomenclature for the entire set of genes when new information becomes available. For many genes and their corresponding proteins, an assortment of alternate names is in use across the scientific literature and public biological databases, posing a challenge to effective organization and exchange of biological information. Standardization of nomenclature thus tries to achieve the benefits of vocabulary control and bibliographic control, although adherence is voluntary. The advent {{of the information age}} has brought gene ontology, which in some <b>ways</b> <b>is</b> a next step of gene nomenclature, because it aims to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species.|$|E

500|$|A {{review by}} Eric Anderson of Bowling Green State University in the Journal of Popular Culture praised the author's use of {{interviews}} throughout the book, writing that it [...] "...shines with McLeod's broad use of interviews... records and reports {{the voices of}} creative {{people who have been}} encumbered by the contemporary intellectual property regime. The incorporation of these interviews, demonstrating as they do specific examples of creativity obstructed in specific <b>ways,</b> <b>is</b> this book's most important contribution." [...] Anderson said the book is [...] "an informative, thought-provoking, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny examination of specific ways the privatization of ideas suppresses creativity in contemporary culture." [...] Anderson mentions McLeod's and the book's publisher's uncommon tactic of making the book freely available via a Creative Commons license.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the series, Homer and Lisa's {{relationship}} is problematic, as Homer often struggles to understand Lisa, who in many <b>ways</b> <b>is</b> {{a little girl}} but who is also smarter than him. Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay analyzed [...] "Make Room for Lisa" [...] in their book The Simpsons in the classroom: Embiggening the Learning Experience with the Wisdom of Springfield. They wrote that in the episode, Homer and Lisa's {{relationship is}} badly damaged after Homer allows Lisa's room to {{be turned into a}} cell phone tower. When the two enter sensory-deprivation tanks, Lisa has several hallucinations, including one in which she becomes Homer. This experience shows Lisa how she appears from Homer's point of view, and makes her realize that her treatment of Homer is hurtful, as he often participates in activities with her that he does not enjoy. The episode ends with Homer and Lisa watching a demolition derby, which Lisa enjoys because she is spending time with Homer. The episode advises children to be accepting of their parents, who [...] "do the best [...] can" [...] to raise them.|$|E

[...] Chan is representative of a model minority, the good stereotype that counters a bad stereotype: [...] "Each stereotypical image is filled with contradictions: the bloodthirsty Indian is tempered with the image of the noble savage; the bandido exists along with the loyal sidekick; and Fu Manchu is offset by Charlie Chan." [...] However, Fu Manchu's evil qualities are presented as inherently Chinese, while Charlie Chan's good qualities are exceptional; [...] "Fu represents his race; his counterpart stands away from the other Asian Hawaiians." ...|$|E
