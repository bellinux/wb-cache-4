50|$|New bridges were {{constructed}} by lashing penteconters and triremes together. 360 ships {{were used to}} construct the northeasterly bridge and 314 ships {{were used for the}} southwesterly bridge. Anchors were lowered {{at either end of the}} boats to keep them in place and cables, alternatively made of <b>white</b> <b>flax</b> and papyrus, were stretched from shore to shore to hold the boats together and were tightened by large winches. The weight of the cables of flax is said to have been one talent per cubit. Three openings were provided for the passage of small boats. Wooden planks were laid across the cables, and brushwood and soil used to cover the planks and form a dirt roadway. Screens were put up on either side of the bridges to prevent the horses and other animals from panicking at the sight of the sea below.|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition and antioxidant capacity of five seeds, chia, golden <b>flax,</b> brown <b>flax,</b> <b>white</b> perilla, and brown perilla, were determined. The chemical properties analyzed included moisture, ash, crude protein, carbohydrates, total lipids, fatty acids, and antioxidant capacity (ABTS•+, DPPH•, and FRAP). The results showed the highest amounts of protein and total lipids in brown and white perilla. Perilla and chia showed higher amounts of alpha-linolenic fatty acid {{than those of}} flaxseed varieties, ranging between 531. 44 mg g- 1 of lipids in brown perilla, 539. 07 mg g- 1 of lipids in white perilla, and 544. 85 mg g- 1 of lipis in chia seed. The antioxidant capacity of the seeds, evaluated with ABTS•+, DPPH•, and FRAP methods, showed that brown perilla had greater antioxidant capacity when compared with <b>white</b> perilla, <b>flax,</b> and chia seeds...|$|R

5000|$|The orders {{made in the}} {{preparatory phase}} to produce cables for the bridges are {{mentioned}} by Herodotus in a rather casual way like orders for larger quantities of standard merchandise. Only when he describes the bridges rebuilt after the storm he gives a single indication saying that {{the weight of the}} cables made of <b>white</b> <b>flax</b> was one talent per cubit what roughly translates into 26 kg/46 cm or 56.5 kg per meter. [...] Using various methods of conversion one arrives at diameters between 23 and 28 cm (between 9 and 11 inches)! Cables weighing that much cannot be handled, {{it is almost impossible to}} bend cables with such a diameter or to reel them on a cable drum - which probably did not yet exist at that time - or to put them into any other transportable condition. Bollards of several meters in diameter would have been necessary in order to fasten these cables without breaking them. Herodotus appears to talk about undivided cables reaching from shore to shore. However, a single cable of 2,200 m would have weighed 124.3 tonnes and even today could not be transported by any practical means.|$|E
5000|$|... and {{meanwhile}} other chief-constructors proceeded {{to make the}} bridges; and thus they made them: They put together fifty-oared galleys and triremes, three hundred and sixty {{to be under the}} bridge towards the Euxine Sea, and three hundred and fourteen to be under the other, the vessels lying {{in the direction of the}} stream of the Hellespont (though crosswise in respect to the Pontus), to support the tension of the ropes. They placed them together thus, and let down very large anchors, those on the one side towards the Pontus because of the winds which blow from within outwards, and on the other side, towards the West and the Egean, because of the South-East and South Winds. They left also an opening for a passage through, so that any who wished might be able to sail into the Pontus with small vessels, and also from the Pontus outwards. Having thus done, they proceeded to stretch tight the ropes, straining them with wooden windlasses, not now appointing the two kinds of rope to be used apart from one another, but assigning to each bridge two ropes of <b>white</b> <b>flax</b> and four of the papyrus ropes. The thickness and beauty of make was the same for both, but the flaxen ropes were heavier in proportion, and of this rope a cubit weighed one talent. When the passage was bridged over, they sawed up logs of wood, and making them equal in length to the breadth of the bridge they laid them above the stretched ropes, and having set them thus in order they again fastened them above. When this was done, they carried on brushwood, and having set the brushwood also in place, they carried on to it earth; and when they had stamped down the earth firmly, they built a barrier along on each side, so that the baggage-animals and horses might not be frightened by looking out over the sea.

40|$|The {{collection}} of oil species in Novi Sad contains 12 species represented with 1 - 4 cultivars or landraces. In the continuous {{work on this}} collection {{in the sense of}} breeding of some of those species and their usage as a source of 'desirable genes' we analyzed pollen grain morphology (shape and size), as well as pollen viability. To determine mentioned pollen traits we used Axiovert 40 C microscope together with a software package (AxioVision LE; Rel. 4. 3.) for measurement of pollen length and width. Pollen viability was determined using a staining method (ALEXANDER, 1969). The results showed that species differ by pollen grain shape (round, egg-shaped, triangular and rod) as well as by shape of exine (thick and spiky, thick to thin). In some species there was a specific number of apertures present (1 - 11). The size of viable pollen grains ranged from 29, 10 / 12, 58 μ (coriander) to 176, 63 / 169, 94 μ (oil gourd), while non-viable pollen grains were always smaller (27, 27 / 10, 97 μ to 119, 62 / 100, 86 μ) at the same plant species. Pollen viability of most species was around 80 %. Lowest pollen viability was found in <b>white</b> <b>flax</b> (56, 98 %), and the highest in oil pumpkin (91, 43 %) ...|$|E
60|$|After another dip, {{the road}} to Otterbourne leaves the main one, and skirts Cranbury Park, and has on the {{opposite}} side the once open country, since planted first with trees and later with houses, leading to Chandler's Ford. The very pretty and uncommon Linaria repens, a toad <b>flax,</b> <b>white</b> and striped with purple, is a speciality that it is hoped may not be smothered with houses and gardens. A lane, called even in 1588 Mallibar, runs southward over the heath, and emerges into the Southampton road. It is a grand place for heath, ferns, and broom-rape, with daffodils in a field at the end. There are remains of a farm-yard and orchard, once apparently rented by Mr. Coram of Cranbury.|$|R
5|$|From the 1840s onwards more mines {{provided}} crude shelters {{to protect}} surface {{workers from the}} worst of the weather, but at many others work at surface-level took place in the open air. Workers were generally expected to remain at their posts except in the most extreme weather conditions. Bal maidens wore gooks, a specialised bonnet which covered the shoulders and extended over the face to protect from rain, bright sunlight, flying debris and loud noise. In the winter the gook was made of felt, and in summer of cotton. Working in close proximity to heavy industrial machinery, they wore shorter dresses or skirts than the ankle-length clothing typical of the period, and their exposed lower legs were wrapped in protective coverings. Their arms were sometimes protected by hessian sleeves worn over their clothes. Some bal maidens working in cobbing and bucking wore rubber tubing on the fingers of one hand as protection from their hammer. While working bal maidens wore a waist-length hessian apron ('towser') over their clothes, and those who could afford it would have a <b>white</b> herden (<b>flax</b> and hemp) apron for wearing to and from work. These working clothes were accessorised with flowers, bows, ribbons, jewellery and other decoration. Until the end of the 19thcentury the working clothing of a bal maiden changed very little.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} foliar application of plants with growth stimulants and seed priming on yield and seed oil content of flax, a factorial experiment was conducted at the Saatlo Agricultural and Natural Resources Research Center of West Azarbaijan based on a randomized complete block design with three replication in 2015. The first factor was two varieties of <b>flax</b> seed (yellow, <b>white</b> flowered and brown, purple flowered), the second factor was seed priming consisted of 3 levels (control, hydro-priming and priming with Auxin + GA) and the third factor was foliar application of growth stimulants with three levels (control, Auxin and GA). The results showed that effect of seed priming was significant on all traits except pod weight, thousand seed weight and seed oil percent. Foliar application of plants with growth stimulants were also, significant on plant height, seed number/plant, pod weight, biological yield, seed yield and grain oil percent. Interaction of cultivar and priming on seed weight and seed yield and also on cultivar with foliar application were significant on plant height and pod weight and seed oil percent. Interaction of priming and foliar application on plant height, number of branches, number of pods/plant, pod weight, seed yield and seed oil percent was also observed. Brown purple flowering flax cultivar had higher seed yield and seed oil percent as compared with yellow <b>white</b> flowering <b>flax</b> seed. Seed priming and foliar application of plants with growth stimulants, and seed priming with Auxin + GA along with foliar application of GA produced highest seed yield and seed oil percent, as compared with other treatments...|$|R
