5|$|Named {{board members}} were Paul, his <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> father-in-law. The NBO was never itself {{accepted}} as an accrediting entity by {{organizations such as}} the American Board of Medical Specialties, and its certification was considered invalid by many hospitals and insurance companies. Paul let his own ABO certification lapse in 2005, which did not affect his practice in Kentucky, since the state does not require board certification.|$|E
5|$|Doubts about Oppenheimer's loyalty dated {{back to the}} 1930s, when he was {{a member}} of {{numerous}} Communist front organizations, and was associated with Communist Party USA members, including his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> brother. These associations were known to Army Counter-intelligence at the time he was made director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1942, and chairman of the influential General Advisory Committee of the AEC in 1947. In this capacity Oppenheimer became involved in bureaucratic conflict between the Army and Air Force over the types of nuclear weapons the country required, technical conflict between the scientists over the feasibility of the hydrogen bomb, and personal conflict with AEC commissioner Lewis Strauss.|$|E
5|$|Grimaldi's {{association}} with Sadler's Wells {{came to an}} end in 1820, chiefly {{as a result of his}} deteriorating relationship with the theatre's management. After numerous injuries over the years from his energetic clowning, his health was also declining rapidly, and he retired in 1823. He appeared occasionally on stage for a few years thereafter, but his performances were restricted by his worsening physical disabilities. In his last years, Grimaldi lived in relative obscurity and became a depressed, impoverished alcoholic. He outlived both his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> actor son, Joseph Samuel, dying at home in Islington in 1837, aged 58.|$|E

5|$|His {{young son}} {{came to the}} throne as James III, {{resulting}} in another minority, with Robert, Lord Boyd emerging {{as the most important}} figure. In 1468 James married Margaret of Denmark, receiving the Orkney and the Shetland Islands in payment of her dowry. In 1469 the King asserted his control, executing members of the Boyd family and his brothers, Alexander, Duke of Albany and John, Earl of Mar, resulting in Albany leading an English backed invasion and becoming effective ruler. The English retreated, having taken Berwick for the last time in 1482, and James was able to regain power. However, the King managed to alienate the barons, former supporters, his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> son James. He was defeated at the Battle of Sauchieburn and killed in 1488.|$|E
5|$|In 1275, Magnús Óláfsson's illegitimate son, Guðrøðr, led {{a revolt}} on Mann and {{attempted}} to establish himself as king. According to the Chronicle of Mann and the Chronicle of Lanercost, a Scottish fleet landed on Mann on 7 October, and {{early the next morning}} the revolt was crushed as the Scots routed the rebels at the Battle of Ronaldsway. Guðrøðr may very well have been slain in the defeat, although one source, the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum, states that he, his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> followers escaped the carnage to Wales.|$|E

5|$|Jamie Bojanowski and Chris Miles joined Robin Marrella as stage assistants for Family Double Dare, {{replacing}} Dave Shikiar {{who left}} the series between the ending of Super Sloppy Double Dare in 1989 {{and the beginning of}} Family Double Dare in 1990 to pursue production opportunities on other programs like The Home Show and Wild & Crazy Kids. In order to spend time with his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> newborn son Caleb, Harvey did not announce the last season of Family Double Dare in 1992.

5|$|Lepidus {{surrendered}} to Octavian and {{was permitted to}} retain the office of Pontifex Maximus (head {{of the college of}} priests), but was ejected from the Triumvirate, his public career at an end, and effectively was exiled to a villa at Cape Circei in Italy. The Roman dominions were now divided between Octavian in the West and Antony in the East. Octavian ensured Rome's citizens of their rights to property in order to maintain peace and stability in his portion of the Empire. This time, he settled his discharged soldiers outside of Italy, while also returning 30,000 slaves to their former Roman owners—slaves who had fled to join Pompeius' army and navy. Octavian had the Senate grant him, his <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> sister tribunal immunity, or sacrosanctitas, in order to ensure his own safety and that of Livia and Octavia once he returned to Rome.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, Secretary of State Robert Lansing was {{the first}} {{official}} to propose that Marshall forcibly assume presidential powers and duties. Other cabinet secretaries backed Lansing's request, as did Congressional leaders, including members of both the Democratic and Republican parties who sent private communications to Marshall. Marshall was cautious in accepting their offers of support. After consulting with his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> long-time personal adviser, Mark Thistlethwaite, he privately refused to assume Wilson's duties and become Acting President of the United States. The process for declaring a president incapacitated was unclear at that time, and he feared the precedent that might be set if he forcibly removed Wilson from his powers and duties. Marshall wanted the president to voluntarily allow his powers to devolve to the vice president, but that was impossible given his condition and unlikely given Wilson's dislike for Marshall. Marshall informed the cabinet that the only cases {{in which he would}} assume Wilson's powers and duties were a joint resolution of Congress calling on him to do so, or an official communication from Wilson or his staff asserting his inability to perform his duties.|$|E
5|$|Shannon was {{discharged}} from the RAAF as a squadron leader on 15December 1945. He remained in England and became an executive with Shell and later Cunard. Shannon no longer flew after the war, but did like to drive fast cars. He also {{served as chairman of}} the No.617 Squadron Association, helping to raise funds for the Dambusters memorial at Woodhall Spa near RAF Scampton. His wife Ann died in 1990, and he married Eyke Taylor. On 8April 1993, shortly before a planned fiftieth anniversary reunion of surviving Dambusters, Dave Shannon died at his home in Sydenham, South London, aged seventy.

5|$|Stanley's {{will was}} signed on 20 March 1908, and was probated on 26 October 1909. When he died, his wealth was £58,905 18s. 4d. The will {{provided}} for Stanley's wife, and each nephew, niece, great-nephew and great-niece were mentioned by name, and left money and shares. His brother's <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> adopted daughter also received shares. Every servant received £5, as did each {{teacher in the}} school. Every factory employee received £2. Several individuals received monthly incomes of £1 or £2 a month. Croydon General Hospital, the Croydon Natural History Society, The British Home and Hospital for Incurables, Croydon Police Court Relief Fund and Croydon Society for the Protection of Women and Children all received shares, as did the Croydon Corporation, although these were {{to be used for}} the purchase of books annually to be used as prizes for students in Croydon.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Parma's artillery pounded at {{the walls}} for 3hours with iron cannonballs weighing 30–50 pounds; in total, his artillery fired more than 2700rounds. The Spanish made several attempts to storm the city, each repelled by Cloedt's 1600soldiers. The ninth assault breached the outer wall. The Spanish and Italian forces entered the town from opposite ends and met in the middle. Cloedt, gravely injured (his leg was reportedly almost ripped off and he had five other serious wounds), had been carried into the town. Parma's troops discovered Cloedt, being nursed by his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> sister. Although Parma was inclined to honor the garrison commander with a soldier's death by sword, Ernst demanded his immediate execution. The dying man was hanged from the window, with several other officers in his force.|$|E
5|$|While the WHA {{opened the}} door, and players slowly joined the NHL, those behind the Iron Curtain were {{restricted}} from following suit. In 1980, Peter Stastny, his <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> brother Anton secretly fled Czechoslovakia {{with the aid}} of Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut. The Stastnys' defection made international headlines, and contributed to the first wave of Eastern Europeans' entrance into the NHL. Hoping that they would one day be permitted to play in the NHL, teams drafted Soviet players in the 1980s, 27 in all by the 1988 draft. However, defection was the only way such players could join the teams that drafted them. Michal Pivonka defected from Czechoslovakia in 1986, while Russian Alexander Mogilny defected following the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Anchorage, Alaska. Czech teenager Petr Nedved walked into a Calgary police station in January 1989 after playing in the Mac's AAA midget hockey tournament.|$|E
