5|$|Eastwood {{was then}} offered {{the role of}} Benjamin L. Willard in Francis Coppola's Apocalypse Now, but {{declined}} as he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> weeks on location in the Philippines. He also refused {{the part of a}} platoon leader in Ted Post's Vietnam War film, Go Tell the Spartans and instead decided to make a third Dirty Harry film, The Enforcer. The film had Callahan partnered with a new female officer (Tyne Daly) to face a San Francisco Bay area group resembling the Symbionese Liberation Army. The film, culminating in a shootout on Alcatraz island, was considerably shorter than the previous Dirty Harry films at 95minutes, but was a major commercial success grossing $100million worldwide to become Eastwood's highest-grossing film to date.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy {{begins to}} {{question}} the reason why his sons <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> so much time with him. One day, Tracy sees a special about Lyle and Erik Menendez—the two brothers who became famous for killing their parents—which leads him to believe that his sons are plotting to kill him. As a result, Tracy buys a life-Japanese sex doll that looks like him {{to use as a}} decoy to fool them. Eventually, Tracy realizes that he overreacted with his sons but warns his son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), that if he were to die, that he and his brother will face jail time.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the Walt Disney Studios {{acquired}} the film rights to Evita, and Glenn Gordon Caron {{was hired to}} direct the film, with Madonna set {{to appear in the}} lead role. Disney was to produce the film under its adult film label Hollywood Pictures. Although Disney had spent $2–3 million in development costs, it canceled the plans in May 1991 when the budget climbed to $30 million. Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> more than $25.7 million on the film. In November 1993, Stigwood sold the film rights to Andrew G. Vajna's production company Cinergi Pictures. Vajna later enlisted Arnon Milchan of Regency Enterprises as a co-financier, and Stone returned as the film's director after meeting with Dan Halsted, the senior vice president of Hollywood Pictures. Production was set to begin sometime in 1995 after Stone and Milchan concluded filming of Noriega, a film chronicling the life of Panamanian general and dictator Manuel Noriega. Stone and Milchan disputed over the high production costs of Evita, Noriega (which was never filmed) and Nixon (1995), resulting in Stone leaving the project in July 1994.|$|E

5|$|Ripley's {{performance}} in the first series won her a nomination for Best TV Comedy Actress at the British Comedy Awards 1999. For her {{performance in}} the third series (2000), in which her character separates from her husband and dates another man (played by Ben Miles), she was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. During pre-production of the fourth series (2001), Ripley announced to the producers {{that she would be}} leaving the show, partly because she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> five months living in Manchester away from her home in London and wanted {{to spend more time with}} her husband, and partly to take other roles which she would otherwise not be able to do. She asked the writer Mike Bullen to either kill off Jenny or have her lose a limb. Bullen refused and instead wrote a plot in which Jenny moves to New York. Ripley returned to the series for a guest appearance in the final episode (2003). She had originally planned not to return to the show, but reprised the role so she could have an on-screen record of the final stages of her pregnancy with her first child.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, Bethlehem Steel {{allowed the}} Lackawanna Steel plant to become obsolete. Foreign {{competition}} made it financially impossible {{to continue to}} manufacture most of the products produced at Lackawanna. Bethlehem Steel also disliked the high tax rates {{of the state of}} New York, and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> the millions of dollars in air and water pollution abatement which were required by state and federal authorities. The company built a new facility in Burns Harbor, Indiana, and stopped investing in new steel production methods at Lackawanna.|$|E
25|$|Sarafian {{wanted to}} score the {{majority}} of the film from an album called Motel Shot by Delaney, Bonnie & Friends. Lionel Newman, head of Fox's music department at the time, denied Sarafian's request because the studio did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> a substantial amount of money obtaining rights to the tracks. The director then suggested that musician Randy Newman score the film, but Fox refused this request as well. After watching the film, musical supervisor Jimmy Bowen wrote three original songs. Delaney, Bonnie & Friends ended up performing a musical number in the film.|$|E

25|$|Pat Johnson {{remained}} {{convinced of}} the validity of the idea, and had Whittle patent the idea in January 1930.

Johnson arranged a meeting with British Thomson-Houston (BTH), whose chief turbine engineer seemed to agree with the basic idea. However, BTH did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> the ₤60,000 it would cost to develop it, and this potential brush with early success went no further.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Silver Dome entered service, {{railroad}} {{managers and}} passenger train executives met {{to discuss the}} merits of the dome car design. In the United States, domes could only be readily used on railroads west of the Mississippi, due to lower clearances in tunnels in the eastern USA. (In Canada, Canadian Pacific would run its domes from coast to coast.) The managers also noted that the passenger carrying space was regarded as non-revenue space because the managers believed that passengers would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> their entire trip in the domes. These factors and the added costs of car construction in adding stairs, two levels of car floors and air conditioning increased the costs to railroads that chose to operate dome cars.|$|E
25|$|In early 1997, Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland {{stated that}} he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> Connecticut {{taxpayer}} dollars to fund a new arena in Hartford. Despite this, negotiations between the Whalers and Rowland to build a new $147.5 million arena seemed to be going well. After a near-complete agreement, talks fell apart at the last minute when Karmanos wanted an additional $45 million to cover losses during the three years the new arena was to be built. The Whalers ultimately announced that they would be leaving Hartford after the 1996–97 season. This marks {{one of the few times}} that a team announced it would leave its current city without having already announced an agreement with a new one. Karmanos had discussed relocating the Whalers to Norfolk, Virginia (which would have been the first major sports team for that market) as the Hampton Roads Rhinos, but the failure of a season-ticket drive in Norfolk, coupled with a lack of an adequate arena, led to those plans being canceled. Karmanos stated that Rowland had no intention making a serious offer to keep the Whalers in Connecticut since Rowland harbored hopes to bring a National Football League (NFL) franchise to the State. Rowland went on to negotiate a tentative deal that would bring the New England Patriots to Connecticut, but those talks also fell apart after the State and Patriots ownership failed to reach an agreement on a new stadium.|$|E

Fuller told the writers they would have to do without it because it would cost [...] $100,000.

500|$|James Horner {{was hired}} to compose the film score in September 1997. Horner's work on The Mask of Zorro was {{influenced}} by Miklós Rózsa's score from El Cid. The soundtrack, released by Sony Classical Records and Epic Soundtrax, was commercially successful and propelled by the rising profile of the Latin heartthrobs of Marc Anthony and Australian singer Tina Arena. Their duet, [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Spend</b> My Lifetime Loving You", plays in the closing credits of the film and was released as a single in Europe.

Recorded {{in the early morning}} hours of the March 9–10 Nashville session under the working title [...] "Black Dog Blues", the song is driven by Robertson's guitar, Charlie McCoy's harmonica and Ken Buttrey's drumming. After an initial breakdown, Dylan complained to the band that the song was [...] "very easy, man" [...] and that he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> much time on it.

Before the studio sessions, Bloc Party listened to varied musical sources, from composers Philip Glass, György Ligeti, and Krzysztof Penderecki to urban artists Amerie and Missy Elliott. The band members were largely disillusioned with the evolution of contemporary guitar music and aimed to re-create the highly stylised production values of R and hip-hop records, while relying on an atmosphere similar to neo-classical music.|$|E
