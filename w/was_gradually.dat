5|$|As the VOR {{system was}} phased {{in around the}} world, the LFR <b>was</b> <b>gradually</b> phased out, mostly disappearing by the 1970s. There are no {{remaining}} operational LFR facilities today. At its maximum deployment, there were nearly 400 LFR stations in the U.S. alone.|$|E
5|$|Boosey & Hawkes' musical {{instruments}} division <b>was</b> <b>gradually</b> scaled {{down from the}} mid-1970s as it became less viable to have such an extensive range of products. Various lines were outsourced and sold off. By {{the time of the}} closure of the Edgware factory in 2001, brass instruments were the only thriving part of the instrument range. Production was moved to Watford, Hertfordshire, and the instruments rebranded Besson.|$|E

5|$|Capitalization {{during this}} time was not standardized. It {{depended}} on the authors and their background. Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns, while others capitalized more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized owing to the Gothic or blackletter typeface which was used to print the Bible. This typeface was in use until the mid-18th century, when it <b>was</b> <b>gradually</b> replaced with a Latin typeface (often antiqua).|$|E
5|$|Cleveland won the AAFC {{championship}} {{again in}} 1947 behind an offensive attack that employed the forward pass more frequently and effectively than was typical at the time.

5|$|Coding of Ottawa was {{followed}} by a provincial-level rollout of the system in Manitoba, and the system <b>was</b> <b>gradually</b> implemented {{in the rest of the}} country from 1972 to 1974, although the nationwide use of the code by the end of 1974 was only 38.2 per cent.|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} of feature point {{matching}} on the same scale image, {{when the number of}} pyramid layers is unchanged (i[*]=[*] 4) and the scale parameters between pyramid images <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> increasing, the following conclusions are drawn: first, the algorithm consumes a slight decrease in time consumption; and second, the accuracy of feature detection <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> increasing and it tends to be stable from 37 to 54 %. The best matching accuracy is achieved when the scale parameter between pyramid images is 1.6. Third, the number of feature points detected <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> decreasing, and the number of feature points that are accurately matched <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> increasing.|$|R

5|$|Contrary to {{government}} expectations the reform was neither popular nor productive. Agricultural harvests plummeted and the reform itself led to rising discontent amongst Afghans. When Taraki realized {{the degree of}} popular dissatisfaction with the reform he quickly abandoned the policy.

Police officers in the city arrested 20people for violating curfew or creating unrest.|$|E

Hesketh <b>was</b> <b>gradually</b> becoming more interested in the lives and conditions of the working classes.|$|E

5|$|Quarrying ceased in {{the early}} 1960s (1962–1965), when the stones {{extracted}} were no longer of sufficient quality.

5|$|The 3rd-century {{emperors}} Diocletian and Maximian issued constitutions exempting {{the students}} {{of the law school}} of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.
