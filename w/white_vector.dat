50|$|A random vector (that is, a {{partially}} indeterminate process that produces vectors of real numbers) {{is said to}} be a <b>white</b> noise <b>vector</b> or <b>white</b> random <b>vector</b> if its components each have a probability distribution with zero mean and finite variance, and are statistically uncorrelated: that is, their joint probability distribution must be the product of the distributions of the individual components.|$|R

Therefore, any orthogonal transformation of the vector will result in a Gaussian <b>white</b> random <b>vector.</b> In particular, under most types of discrete Fourier transform, such as FFT and Hartley, the transform W of w will be a Gaussian <b>white</b> noise <b>vector,</b> too; that is, the n Fourier coefficients of w will be independent Gaussian variables with zero mean and the same variance [...]|$|R

5000|$|The series' protagonists {{were two}} Southern California police detectives: David Michael Starsky (Paul Michael Glaser), the dark-haired, Brooklyn {{transplant}} and U.S. Army veteran, with a street-wise manner and intense, sometimes childlike moodiness; and Kenneth Richard [...] "Hutch" [...] Hutchinson (David Soul), the divorced, blond, Duluth, Minnesota native {{with a more}} reserved and intellectual approach. Under the radio call sign [...] "Zebra Three", they were known for usually tearing around the streets of fictional Bay City, California. The vehicle of choice was Starsky's two-door Ford Gran Torino, which was bright red, with a large <b>white</b> <b>vector</b> stripe on both sides. They used around four different cars for filming. Earlier shots had red wing mirrors usually for long shots or footage used in later episodes, close ups and later episodes had silver wing mirrors. The Torino was nicknamed the [...] "Striped Tomato" [...] by Hutch in the episode [...] "Snowstorm", and fans subsequently referred to the car by that nickname, too. However, this moniker didn't come from the writers, {{it came from a}} real-life comment that Glaser made. In a segment titled Starsky & Hutch: Behind The Badge that was featured on the first season DVD collection, Glaser stated that when he was first shown the Torino by series producer Aaron Spelling, he sarcastically said to Soul, [...] "That thing looks like a striped tomato!" [...] In characteristic contrast, Hutch's vehicle was a battered, tan, 1973 Ford Galaxie 500. It occasionally appeared when the duo needed separate vehicles, or for undercover work. However, the duo's cover was often blown because Hutch's vehicle had a bad habit; when its driver's side door was opened, the horn would go off, instantly drawing attention. It was also noticeable due to the severely cluttered back seat, so cluttered that there was no room to transport both prisoners and the two detectives simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} for generating light beams that carry orbital angular momentum (OAM) by means of total internal reflection in an isotropic medium. A continuous space-varying cylindrically symmetric reflector, {{in the form of}} two glued hollow axicons, is used to introduce a nonuniform rotation of polarisation into a linearly polarised input beam. This device acts as a full spin-to-orbital angular momentum convertor. It functions by switching the helicity of the incoming beam’s polarisation, and by conservation of total angular momentum thereby generates a well-defined value of OAM. Our device is broadband, since the phase shift due to total internal reflection is nearly independent of wavelength. We verify the broad-band behaviour by measuring the conversion efficiency of the device for three different wavelengths corresponding to the RGB colours, red, green and blue. An average conversion efficiency of 95 % for these three different wavelengths is observed. This device may be used to generate a <b>white</b> <b>vector</b> vortex beam, as we show, and may find applications in imaging from micro- to astronomical systems where a white vortex beam is needed...|$|E
5000|$|Often {{the weaker}} {{condition}} [...] "statistically uncorrelated" [...] {{is used in}} the definition of white noise, instead of [...] "statistically independent". However some of the commonly expected properties of white noise (such as flat power spectrum) may not hold for this weaker version. Under this assumption, the stricter version can be referred to explicitly as independent <b>white</b> noise <b>vector.</b> Other authors use strongly white and weakly white instead.|$|R
50|$|A {{necessary}} (but, in general, not sufficient) {{condition for}} statistical independence of two variables {{is that they}} be statistically uncorrelated; that is, their covariance is zero.
