500|$|After {{the first}} eight months of development, game {{director}} Cory Barlog left Santa Monica for unexplained reasons and Stig Asmussen (lead environment artist and art director on God of War and God of War II, respectively) became director. In an interview with IGN, Asmussen said that Barlog [...] "had a major impact on the game" [...] and although he had left the team, they spoke several times afterwards and [...] "bounced a few ideas off him," [...] but there was no formal collaboration. He also said that David Jaffe [...] " [...] been around the studio a few times" [...] and they [...] " [...] gone over some high-level stuff with him to get his observations and feedback." [...] Early in development when Barlog was still with the team, he expressed interest in a cooperative mode [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> unique with it". In November 2009, Asmussen told GamePro that although a multiplayer option had been discussed, it was unsuitable for God of War III: [...] "There's a story we want to tell and an experience we want to deliver, and multi-player doesn't fit into that." [...] By December 2009, the game was in its final developmental stages.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} U2's first under their 12-year deal with Live Nation. It was {{sponsored}} by BlackBerry, {{in a move that}} broke U2's prior relationship with Apple Inc. and opened possibilities for collaborations between U2 and Research In Motion on mobile music experiences. Lead singer Bono said of the new relationship, [...] "I'm very excited about this. Research in Motion is going to give us what Apple wouldn't: access to their labs and their people so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> really spectacular." [...] The explicit corporate sponsorship of a tour was a first for the group, and was due to the anticipated production costs being higher than for any previous U2 tour. The first commercials for a new Blackberry application, called the [...] "U2 Mobile App", began airing in early July 2009 against the song [...] "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight"; the application allows the user to listen to the album No Line on the Horizon, contains a news section which features updates about the tour, and an interactive section that allows the sharing of images and enables the user to see their position during a concert relative to the band and other application users. Models of the stage were added to Google Earth approximately a week before the scheduled concert took place; tour architect Mark Fisher stated, [...] "We thought {{it would be interesting to}} put up on Google Earth a piece of portable architecture." ...|$|E
500|$|Apple filed {{a patent}} {{infringement}} suit against High Tech Computer Corp. (HTC) in March 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware {{in the two}} companies' ongoing battle with each other, and a complaint against HTC under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington, D.C. Apple's suit alleged 20 separate patent infringements relating to the iPhone's user interface, underlying architecture and hardware. Steve Jobs exclaimed [...] "We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it. We've {{decided to do something}} about it ... think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours". The ITC rejected all but one of Apple's claims, however, ruling for Apple on a single claim relating to data tapping. HTC motioned the Delaware court for a change of venue to the Northern District of California, arguing against Apple's desire to consolidate the case with the similar cases brought by Nokia against Apple, alleging insubstantial overlap between those cases and Apple's complaint, but Judge Gregory M. Sleet denied HTC's motion for a venue change, ruling that Apple's choice of forum would prevail. HTC countersued Apple in September 2011 in the same court claiming infringement of four patents HTC obtained from Google, also filing a counter-complaint with the ITC, with HTC's general counsel saying [...] "HTC will continue to protect its patented inventions against infringement from Apple until such infringement stops." [...] In May 2012 the Delaware court ordered mediation between the companies. In November 2012, HTC and Apple ended the patent dispute by settling the case, but did not disclose the terms of the settlement. The companies reported the settlement included a 10-year agreement for licensing both companies' current and future patents to each other." ...|$|E

The band considered R.E.M.'s guitarist Peter Buck as producer, but when they met him in Athens, Georgia, they did not have enough material to begin recording. Instead, Jesperson and Steve Fjelstad co-produced the album. By this time, the Replacements had grown tired of playing loud and fast exclusively; Westerberg stated, [...] "Now we're softening a little where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that's a little more sincere without being afraid that someone's not going to like it or the punks aren't {{going to be able to}} dance to it." ...|$|E

[...] Tim Gerritsen, business development director at Human Head Studios, said, [...] "While we are disappointed that we won’t be able to deliver our vision of the game, we remain proud of our work on the franchise, which we feel speaks for itself, including the award-winning presentation of the game at E3 2011.

5000|$|Observing the {{conditions}} {{in his own country}} and comparing them to what was happening in Europe, Picarte developed an interesting theory that he incorporated to his university thesis, called: [...] "The importance of life insurance, and related projects which are likely to be established in Chile" [...] (Importancia de la Institución de Seguros de la Vida, y proyectos sobre el particular que son susceptibles de establecerse en Chile) In his thesis, Picarte expressed his views as follows: [...] "If this horrible state of things (misery) is a necessity in that sad European civilization, sustained only by poverty and selfishness; in America, continent of new republics, and especially in Chile, where the arteries of blundering speculation are not yet formed or solidified, it would be an eternal shame if <b>we</b> (society) <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it and don’t." [...] In this report, Picarte criticizes the economic system and sets out the basis of the scientific approach to a future social program in Chile, after seeing how those organizations operate in Europe. Through mathematics, he proposes that it is scientifically proven that these social institutions are possible ("es un hecho matemáticamente probado que son posibles").|$|R

As is often mentioned, teaching is an art rather than a science, and I do not presume to have the cure to all the ills that plague mathematics education. However, it is my belief that something can be gained by paying special attention to five basic guidelines when teaching calculus. They are as follows: 1. Try to strike a balance with regard to what to prove and what to accept without proof. 2. Convey the idea that sometimes there is more than one way to solve a problem. 3. Discuss significant applications in the classroom, not relegating them to the end as optional materials. 4. Place the subject in a historical perspective whenever possible...|$|R

The theoretical battle appears to be over, {{at least for the}} present, with no winners. There are definitely losers though-landowners who are victims of inequity, if not of constitutional wrongs. Why are we in this situation? Because it is an inescapable product of the land use system we have created. To promote unconstrained private initiative by landowners, we allow owners to consume limited ambient resources like open space and habitat in a version of a prior appropriation system so that nothing is left to later-developing landowners when the limits of acceptable use are finally acknowledged through late-stage regulation. We have thus created a system of winners and losers, burdening a few with obligations that should in fairness have been more equitably apportioned. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> and should <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it as an alternative to constitutional litigation...|$|R
