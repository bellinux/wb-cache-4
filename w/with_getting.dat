40|$|Get 3, Get 4, and Get 5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{participate}} in the insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. We elucidated the interaction between Get 4 and Get 5 and investigated their interaction <b>with</b> <b>Get</b> 3 and a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein, Sgt 2. Based on co-immunoprecipitation and crystallographic studies, Get 4 and Get 5 formed a tight complex, suggesting that they constitute subunits of a larger complex. In contrast, although Get 3 interacted physically <b>with</b> the <b>Get</b> 4 -Get 5 complex, low amounts of <b>Get</b> 3 co-precipitated <b>with</b> <b>Get</b> 5, implying a transient interaction between Get 3 and Get 4 -Get 5. Sgt 2 also interacted <b>with</b> <b>Get</b> 5, although the amount of Sgt 2 that co-precipitated <b>with</b> <b>Get</b> 5 varied. Moreover, GET 3, GET 4, and GET 5 interacted genetically with molecular chaperone YDJ 1, suggesting that chaperones might also {{be involved in the}} insertion of tail-anchored proteins...|$|R

5|$|After convalescing, Miles re-joined the 2nd New Zealand Division in North Africa, {{where it}} was {{reforming}} after the losses incurred in Greece and on Crete. He then participated in Operation Crusader. During this campaign, aimed at lifting the besieged port of Tobruk, the 2nd New Zealand Division was involved in heavy fighting around Sidi Rezegh, where Miles deployed artillery {{in support of the}} 6th Infantry Brigade. Having established a corridor to Tobruk, the commander of the division, Major General Bernard Freyberg, was becoming concerned that they would be unable to hold it open. On 30 November, he entrusted Miles <b>with</b> <b>getting</b> permission from Lieutenant General Alfred Godwin-Austen, the corps commander, to withdraw into or alongside Tobruk. Tentative permission was granted but only if Sidi Rezegh could not be held. However, the same day the 6th Brigade was overrun by elements of the 15th Panzer Division.|$|E
5|$|Along <b>with</b> <b>getting</b> {{the motor}} patented, Peck and Brown {{arranged}} {{to get the}} motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent {{with the issue of}} the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system — something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Flemish {{political}} parties demanded Flanders be given jurisdiction over cultural matters, {{concerned with the}} dominance of the French language in the federal government. Likewise, as Wallonia was in economic decline, Francophone {{political parties}} were concerned <b>with</b> <b>getting</b> economic autonomy for the French-speaking regions to address the situation. The Flemings also feared being in the minority, faced with two other French-speaking regions. They viewed the creation of a separate Brussels region as definitively cutting Brussels off from Flanders, an admission of the loss of Brussels to Francization. Essentially, the Flemings had a vision of Belgium with two parts: a Dutch-speaking part and a French-speaking part, whereas Francophones had a vision with three parts: Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia.|$|E
