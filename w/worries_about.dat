5|$|Fresh <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> France, {{combined}} {{with the development of}} rifled cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom being established in 1859, and expressing fears about the security of the south coast. In response, Sandgate was re-equipped with heavier guns in 1859, and extensive work was carried out on Southsea. Hurst was fitted with two huge batteries of heavy rifled breech-loading guns, protected by iron armour-plate, intended for use against fast-moving enemy warships. Tilbury Blockhouse was destroyed to make way for heavier guns at the fort after 1868. Portland was readopted by army as a garrison base in 1869 in response to fears of an invasion, but it was not rearmed.|$|E

Zita in later years recalled that after her engagement she had expressed to Charles her <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> {{the fate of the}} Austrian Empire and the challenges of the monarchy. Charles and Zita were married at the Schwarzau castle on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph, attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast. Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and Otto was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children would follow in the next decade.|$|E
5|$|In May 1648, a Royalist {{rebellion}} {{broke out}} in Kent. There were fresh Parliamentary concerns about Henry Hastings and fears grew that he might reoccupy Ashby de la Zouch Castle. Lord Grey - a rival of the Hastings family in Leicestershire - {{was put in charge}} of the castle in August, which was used to hold Royalist prisoners, including James Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton. Parliamentary <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> the security of the castle persisted and, possibly because of Henry's involvement in the recent rebellion, William Bainbrigg was ordered in November to slight the castle to put it beyond military use. He carried out his orders immediately, demolishing one side of the Great Tower and the Kitchen Tower, undermining the foundations and deploying gunpowder charges.|$|E
5|$|In the War of the Third Coalition, 1803–1806, an {{alliance}} of Austria, Portugal, Russia, and others fought the First French Empire and its client states. Although several naval battles determined control of the seas, {{the outcome of the}} war was determined on the continent, predominantly in two major land operations. In the Ulm campaign, Klenau's force achieved the single Austrian victory prior to the surrender of the Austrian army in Swabia. In the second determining event, the decisive French victory at the Battle of Austerlitz over the combined Russian and Austrian force forced a final capitulation of the Austrian forces and took the Habsburgs out of the Coalition. This did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Prussian <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806, in which Austria did not participate.|$|E

5|$|The second {{determining}} event, {{the decisive}} French {{victory at the}} Battle of Austerlitz over the combined Russian and Austrian armies, forced the Austrian withdrawal from the Coalition. The subsequent Peace of Pressburg, signed on 26 December 1805, reinforced the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and Lunéville. Furthermore, Austria ceded land to Napoleon's German allies, and paid an indemnity of 40million francs. Victory at Austerlitz also gave Napoleon the latitude to create a buffer zone of German states between France and the states of Prussia, Russia, and Austria. These measures did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Prussian <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806, in which Austria did not participate.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick voiced {{concerns}} {{about the need for}} such pure plutonium to make a feasible bomb. He also suspected that the gun method of detonation for a plutonium bomb would lead to premature detonations due to impurities. After Chadwick met Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, he learned of a proposed bomb design which they were calling an implosion. The sub-critical mass of plutonium was supposed to be surrounded by explosives that were arranged to detonate simultaneously. This would cause the plutonium core to be compressed and become supercritical. The core would be surrounded by a depleted uranium tamper which would reflect the neutrons back into the reaction, and contribute to the explosion by fissioning itself. This design solved Chadwick's <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> purity because it did not require the level that would be needed for the gun-type fission weapon. The biggest problem with this method was creating the explosive lenses. Chadwick took this information with him and described the method to Oliphant who then took it with him to England.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{and authors}} {{writing about the}} 1954 coup have debated the {{relative}} importance {{of the role of the}} United Fruit Company and the <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> communist influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC. Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others have argued that the overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, China {{temporarily}} blocked all {{exports of}} rare earths to Japan {{in the midst}} of a diplomatic dispute between the two countries. These minerals are used in hybrid cars and other products such wind turbines and guided missiles, thereby augmenting the <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> the dependence on Chinese rare-earth elements and the need for geographic diversity of supply. A December 2010 report published by the US DoE found that the American economy vulnerable to rare-earth shortages and estimates that it could take 15 years to overcome dependence on Chinese supplies. China raised export taxes for some rare earths from 15 to 25%, and also extended taxes to exports of some rare-earth alloys that were not taxed before. The Chinese government also announced further reductions on its export quotas for the first months of 2011, which represent a 35% reduction in tonnage as compared to exports during the first half of 2010.|$|E

40|$|Public insecurities {{about crime}} are widely assumed to erode {{individual}} well-being and community cohesion.

This paper draws on data from a prospective cohort study (the Whitehall II study) to show a strong statistical effect of mental health and physical functioning on <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime. Combining with existing evidence, we suggest a feedback model in which <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime harms health, which, in turn, serves to heighten <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime. We conclude with the idea that, while fear of crime may express {{a whole set of}} social and political anxieties, there is a core to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime that is implicated in real cycles of decreased health and perceived vulnerability to victimization. The challenge for future study is to integrate core aspects of the everyday experience of fear of crime with the more layered and expressive features of this complex social phenomenon...|$|R

5|$|The Allied {{disaster}} significantly {{shook the}} faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after, on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both {{the war and the}} Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands in Italy and Bavaria to France, and in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Critically, victory at Austerlitz permitted the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German states intended as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe. The Confederation rendered the Holy Roman Empire virtually useless, so the latter collapsed in 1806 after Francis abdicated the imperial throne, keeping FrancisI of Austria as his only official title. These achievements, however, did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Prussian <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Little {{is known}} about the {{relationship}} of <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia with diabetes-specific and typical youth behaviors among emerging adults with type 1 diabetes. This study's purpose was to examine the relationship among <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia, diabetes management, and glycemic control within the context of alcohol use, hypoglycemia-related weight control behaviors, depressive symptoms, and impulse control among emerging adults with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The sample was 181 emerging adults with type 1 diabetes who were part of a larger study. Path analysis was used to test associations among <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia, diabetes management, hypoglycemia-related weight control behaviors (WCB), alcohol use, impulse control, depressive symptoms, and glycemic control. RESULTS: Path model fit and modification indices suggested that a feedback loop between <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia and diabetes management should be incorporated into the original model. Youth with fewer depressive symptoms reported fewer hypoglycemia-related WCB and less <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia; those with higher impulse control had less alcohol use and better diabetes management; those with lower alcohol use had more <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia; and better glycemic control was associated with better diabetes management. CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals need to understand how multiple factors related to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia and diabetes management interact in emerging adults. In the context of depressive symptoms, impulse control, alcohol use, and hypoglycemia-related WCB, the path model results suggest several potential avenues for intervening to improve glycemic control in emerging adults...|$|R
