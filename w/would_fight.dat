5|$|A July 1861 {{address to}} the people of Bourbon County, {{authored}} by Hawes and other like-minded Democrats, blamed Republicans for starting the Civil War, denounced the coercion of states to remain in the Union, and warned that the Lincoln administration <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> to end slavery. The address {{called for an end to}} the war, recognition of the Confederate States of America as a sovereign nation, and equitable distribution of the national debt and federal property.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, the Allies {{spent the}} evening heatedly debating their course of action. The Peloponnesians were {{in favour of}} evacuating, {{and at this point}} Themistocles {{attempted}} his ruse with Xerxes. It was only when Aristides, the exiled Athenian general arrived that night, followed by some deserters from the Persians, with news of the deployment of the Persian fleet, that the Peloponnesians accepted that they could not escape, and so <b>would</b> <b>fight.</b>|$|E

Gaddafi was {{the first}} head of state to recognize the new government, and he also signed treaties of friendship and cooperation on various levels.

5|$|In May 2011, Fox had a list {{of eight}} {{candidates}} to replace Aronofsky, including directors José Padilha, Doug Liman, Antoine Fuqua, Mark Romanek, Justin Lin, Gavin O'Connor, James Mangold and Gary Shore. In June 2011, Fox entered negotiations with Mangold and intended to start principal photography in fall 2011. In July 2011, Jackman {{said he planned to}} begin filming in October 2011 and that he <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> the Silver Samurai.|$|E
5|$|In episode 8, Team GSP {{had to pick}} which {{team members}} <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> each other (considering they had 5 members in the quarter-finals).

5|$|The {{fine for}} {{neglecting}} fyrd, {{the obligation to}} do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, incidentally revealing that ceorls were required {{to serve in the}} army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but {{it is not surprising that}} all free men <b>would</b> <b>fight,</b> since defeat might have meant slavery.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E
5|$|Courtly {{love was}} the eroticisation of love between the nobility. Emphasis {{was placed on}} {{restraint}} between lovers. Though sometimes expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments, where knights <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> wearing a token from their lady, {{it could also be}} private and conducted in secret. The legend of Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages. It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other, although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous– Henry I of England had over 20bastards for instance– but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with such}} {{conflicting}} accounts {{and unable to}} reach a conclusion, the Parlement announced on 15 September {{that the two men}} <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> to the death on 27 November 1386 to decide guilt in the case. If Carrouges lost, then Marguerite would be burnt at the stake for perjury. In fact, the duel was delayed a month as the King and his court, which contained most of the country's senior dukes and generals, was held up on campaign in Flanders and could not return in time. Eager to see what was rapidly becoming the event of the season, the King ordered the duel postponed until 29 December so that he would be present for its culmination.|$|E
5|$|For the offensive, {{the corps}} was {{reinforced}} by the 368th Fighter Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, the 71st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, and the 47th Engineer Battalion, and {{was to make a}} breakthrough on the first day in the area between the advance of the 48th Guards and 184th Rifle Divisions, seizing Yekaterinovka and advancing on Varvarovka and Alexeyevka {{by the end of the}} day. The attack was originally scheduled to begin on 12 January, but was moved back two days to account for railroad delays. By 13 January there were 122 tanks from the army still delayed by maintenance issues, mostly from the corps' 113th and 195th Brigades. This resulted from the Voronezh Front's initial offensive planning mandating that only the 12th Tank Corps <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> in the first attack, which transferred the new tanks of the 15th to the 12th and the 12th's worn-out tanks to the 15th, although it was later decided that the entire army <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> in the operation. As a result, the 15th had much less time to reorganize in preparation for the assault, and as a result of the 113th and 195th Brigades arriving in the concentration areas on 13 January with only between 10 and 12 tanks due to the delays, all of the serviceable tanks were transferred to the 88th Tank Brigade, which was brought up to a strength of 74 tanks. This single brigade constituted the entirety of the corps' armored troops involved in the first day's attack, as the 113th and 195th were placed in army reserve until their tanks arrived.|$|E
5|$|It was {{activated}} in mid 1918, {{too late}} to join the fighting in World War I. The division {{is best known for}} its exploits during World War II as the 100th Infantry Division. Fighting in the European Theater, the division advanced through France and Germany {{through the end of the}} war, fending off serious German counterattacks along the way. World War II would be the only war the division <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> in before taking on its role as a training unit.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{elements}} of the 2nd Division reached the 17th Army headquarters area at Kokumbona, west of the Matanikau on 4 November. The same day, Shoji's unit reached Koli Point and made camp. Decimated by battle deaths, combat injuries, malnutrition, and tropical diseases, the 2nd Division was incapable of further offensive action and <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> as a defensive force {{for the rest of}} the campaign. Later in November, U.S. forces drove Shoji's soldiers from Koli Point back to the Kokumbuna area, with a battalion-sized Marine patrol attacking and harassing them almost the entire way. Only about 700 of Shoji's original 3,000 men ultimately returned to Kokumbuna.|$|E
5|$|Men without property, {{who were}} thereby {{excluded}} from the qualifying social classes of the adsidui, were exempted from military service {{on the grounds that}} they were too poor to provide themselves with any arms whatsoever. However, in the most pressing circumstances, even these proletarii were pressed into service, though their military worth was probably questionable. Troops in all of these classes <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> together on the battlefield, with the exception of the most senior troops, who were expected to guard the city.|$|E
5|$|The Allied command {{structure}} in the South West Pacific Area faced the challenges of coalition warfare in several ways, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The benefits of the wartime alliances proved to be substantial, but required constant effort to maintain. For Australia and New Zealand, coalition warfare became the norm, and the experience in SWPA proved to be a formative and informative one, with many political and military lessons. Over the following decades, Australian, New Zealand and American forces <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> together again, in the Korean War, Vietnam War and the War on Terror.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Army {{had entered}} the Second World War with {{inadequate}} resources due to severe cutbacks {{at the hands of}} conservative governments in the 1920s and 1930s. This was compounded by a lack of interest and appreciation of logistics on the part of its civilian and military leadership. There was an assumption that the Australian Army would form part of an expeditionary force that <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> overseas in a larger British force. This was indeed the case in the Great War, and again in the Second World War in the Middle East and Malaya, but not in SWPA, where the Australian Army not only had to provide its own logistic support, but support to its Allies as well.|$|E
5|$|To besiege the fortress, Ferdinand {{brought more}} than 400 Fussvolk (foot soldiers) and five squadrons of mounted soldiers, plus {{a half dozen}} heavy caliber cannons, called culverins. His soldiers, among them Spanish and Italian mercenaries, took up {{quarters}} in neighboring villages, a process accompanied by pillage, arson, murder and rape. On 18 November, {{the first day of}} the siege, Ferdinand sent a trumpeter and formally asked the fortress to surrender; the defending garrison replied that they had sworn their allegiance to Gebhard and <b>would</b> <b>fight</b> to the death for him.|$|E
