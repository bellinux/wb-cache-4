5|$|In mid-May, aerial {{reconnaissance}} near Mont Sorrel indicated that German forces were preparing an attack. Royal Flying Corps (RFC) observers had noted {{the existence of}} works curiously resembling the Canadian positions, <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> the German lines. The Germans were also observed digging new sap trenches which implied that an assault was intended. The Canadian Corps had just begun developing plans to overrun the more dangerous German positions, when the Germans executed an assault of their own.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{chosen by}} chance was that commanded by Brig. Gen. James H. Ledlie, {{who failed to}} brief the men on {{what was expected of}} them and was reported during the battle to be drunk <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> the lines, providing no leadership. Ledlie's men entered the huge crater instead of going around it, becoming trapped, and were subjected to heavy fire from Confederates around the rim, resulting in high casualties.|$|E
5|$|As the Browns recaptured {{a hint of}} past {{success in}} 1994, all was not <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> the scenes. Modell was in {{financial}} trouble. The origins of Modell's woes dated to 1973, when he worked out a deal to lease Cleveland Municipal Stadium from the city for a pittance: only enough to service the facility's debt and pay property taxes. Cleveland Browns Stadium Corporation, or Stadium Corp., a company Modell and a business associate created and owned, held the 25-year lease. Stadium Corp. then subleased the stadium to the Browns and the Cleveland Indians, and rented it out for concerts and other events. While the deal worked fine {{for the city and}} Modell early on, the owner was later dogged by excessive borrowing and lawsuits.|$|E

5|$|As the Canadians began {{preparations}} for an assault, the Germans {{were in the}} process of executing an assault plan of their own. The XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps spent six weeks planning and carefully preparing their attack on the Mount Sorrel, Tor Top (Hill 62) and Hill 61 peaks. Their objective was to take control of the observation positions east of Ypres and keep as many British units as possible pinned down in the area, to avoid them transferring to the Somme front and assisting with the observed build-up in that area. The Germans constructed practice trenches resembling the Canadian positions near Tor Top to rehearse the assault, <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> their own lines.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, the Brazilian Navy {{found itself}} <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> its Argentine and Chilean rivals in quality and total tonnage; few ships {{had been ordered}} {{since the fall of}} the Brazilian monarchy in 1889, while Argentina and Chile had just {{concluded}} a fifteen-year naval arms race which filled their navies with modern warships. Rising demand for coffee and rubber was fueling a large increase in the Brazilian government's revenue, and the country's legislature voted to devote some of the proceeds to address this naval imbalance. They believed that building a strong navy would play an essential role in remaking the country into an international power.|$|E
5|$|In clock-limited sports, games {{often end}} with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than {{competing}} aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even {{in the case of}} multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.|$|E

Schirra Jr., orbited the Earth six times in the Sigma 7 {{spacecraft}} on October 3, 1962, in a nine-hour flight focused mainly on technical evaluation rather than on scientific experimentation. This was the longest U.S. manned orbital flight yet achieved in the Space Race, though <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> the several-day record set by the Soviet Vostok 3 earlier in the year. It confirmed the Mercury spacecraft's durability ahead of the one-day Mercury-Atlas 9 mission that followed in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two days}} later, on Sunday 18 June, the Duke of Wellington {{positioned}} his Anglo-allied army along a ridge {{near the village}} of Waterloo, in order to block Napoleon's advance along the road to Brussels. The Brunswick Corps formed part of Wellington's reserve corps, under his personal command. In that capacity, they were kept <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> the crest of the ridge and avoided casualties during the opening French bombardment. In {{the early part of the}} afternoon, the British Foot Guards moved down the slope to reinforce the Château d'Hougoumont, which was under fierce French attack; the Brunswick Corps was brought forward to take their place.|$|E
5|$|The {{bramble shark}} has a thick, {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} somewhat flattened head. The snout is blunt and shorter than {{the width of the}} mouth, with widely spaced nostrils that are preceded by small flaps of skin. The eyes lack nictitating membranes; the tiny spiracles are located <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> them. The wide, curved mouth bears very short furrows at the corners. There are 20–26 upper and 22–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is knife-like, with a single main cusp and up to three cusplets on either side. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair the longest.|$|E

5|$|The {{changing}} strengths {{between the}} two opponents prompted the Luftwaffe to make operational changes for the battle. Previous offensive campaigns had been initiated with Luftwaffe raids against opposing airfields to achieve air superiority. By {{this point in the}} war Red Army equipment reserves were extensive and the Luftwaffe commanders realised that aircraft could be easily replaced, making such raids futile. Therefore, this mission was abandoned. In addition, previous campaigns had made use of medium bombers flying <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> the frontline to block the arrival of reinforcements. This mission, however, was rarely attempted during Citadel.|$|E
5|$|The prickly shark has a flabby and {{cylindrical}} body, {{with the}} adults markedly bulkier than juveniles, and a short, moderately flattened head. The nostrils are placed far apart and preceded by small flaps of skin. The spiracles are tiny and positioned <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> the eyes, which lack nictitating membranes. The mouth forms a broad arch, with very short furrows at the corners. There are 21–25 and 20–27 tooth rows {{in the upper}} and lower jaws respectively. The knife-like teeth each have a strongly angled main cusp flanked by up to three smaller cusplets on either side; the lateral cusplets are absent in young sharks. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair the longest.|$|E
5|$|A counterattack to {{take back}} the {{airfield}} and Point 107 was organised for the following day at Hargest's headquarters. He was exhausted and had to take a quick nap before a conference to work out detailed plans for the counter-attack, much to the disgust of some of the other participants. Afterwards, he became pessimistic of the chances of success and unsuccessfully sought to have the attack called off. The attack did fail but Hargest, still <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> the frontlines, mistakenly believed it to be going well until he found that his brigade had returned to their starting positions. His pessimism began to affect Puttick, who asked Freyberg to allow the 5th Infantry Brigade to withdraw, which it duly did. This began an eventual retreat and evacuation from Crete on 31 May, with Hargest flying out for Egypt by seaplane, his brigade following by sea.|$|E

5|$|A varsity {{baseball}} team is an established part {{of physical education}} departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2008, {{nearly half a million}} high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' {{baseball team}}s. The number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s, falling <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> the front axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers {{were concerned that}} this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the previous generation Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Hitler was living in Munich and voluntarily enlisted in the Bavarian Army. According to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing Hitler to serve was almost certainly an administrative error, since as an Austrian citizen, {{he should have been}} returned to Austria. Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment), he served as a dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium, spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in Fournes-en-Weppes, <b>well</b> <b>behind</b> the front lines. He was present at the First Battle of Ypres, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras, and the Battle of Passchendaele, and was wounded at the Somme. He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross, Second Class, in 1914. On a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann, Hitler's Jewish superior, he received the Iron Cross, First Class on 4 August 1918, a decoration rarely awarded to one of Hitler's Gefreiter rank. He received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918.|$|E

5000|$|Along with Darrin's {{trademark}} fender line, the Kaiser Darrin had {{entry doors}} that, {{instead of being}} hinged to open outward, slid on tracks into the front fender <b>wells</b> <b>behind</b> the front wheels. Fueled by Darrin's dislike for conventional doors, the designer had taken out a patent on the sliding auto door concept in 1946. To keep the door assembly as simple as possible, no side windows were built into them. The car was equipped with a three-position Landau top, which was also considered novel, and the design on the whole considered by industry critics and writers as beautifully proportioned. The only flaw was considered the car's front grille. High and shell-shaped, {{it looked as though}} the automobile [...] "wanted to give you a kiss," [...] as one writer commented.|$|R
