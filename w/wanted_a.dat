5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} because the designer Gregg Barnett <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> large adventure for CD-based systems. A licence {{was difficult to}} obtain; Pratchett was reluctant to grant one as he <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> Discworld game to be developed by a company with a reputation and who cared about the property. An original story was created due to Barnett having difficulty basing games on one book. Discworld was praised for its humour, voice-acting and graphics, though some criticised its gameplay and difficult puzzles. Discworld {{was followed by a}} sequel, , in 1996.|$|E

5|$|After {{the science}} fiction-focused Moonraker, the {{producers}} <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> {{return to the}} style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. For Your Eyes Only followed a grittier, more realistic approach and a narrative theme of revenge and its consequences. Filming locations included Greece, Italy and England, while underwater footage was shot in The Bahamas.|$|E

40|$|Since 1990, migrant Australians' {{attitudes to}} {{immigration}} have waned and waxed {{according to the}} same overall pattern {{as those of the}} Australia-born. However, migrants are consistently less likely to <b>want</b> <b>a</b> decrease in the intake and consistently (slightly) more likely to <b>want</b> <b>an</b> increase. This is particularly true of those born in non-English-speaking-background (NESB) countries. Even so, in 2004, only 26 per cent of NESB-born Australians <b>wanted</b> <b>an</b> increase in immigration. Migrants are also likely to <b>want</b> <b>an</b> increase in immigration from their own region of origin. But the stand-out group here are the British. UK-born Australians {{are much more likely to}} <b>want</b> <b>an</b> increase in British immigration than are Asia-born Australians to <b>want</b> <b>an</b> increase in Asian immigration or Southern-Europe-born Australians to <b>want</b> <b>an</b> increase in Southern European immigration. When we focus on regions within New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, the differences between the Australia-born and the NESB-born in their attitudes to immigration in general are marked. But in no instance do a majority of the NESB-born <b>want</b> <b>an</b> increase in immigration...|$|R

5|$|As England had {{a strong}} batting lineup, Bradman <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> large range of {{specialist}} bowlers in the Tests, and this was made possible as his preferred bowlers were skillful with the bat. Australia's bowling line-up consisted of Miller, McCool (leg spin), Johnson (off spin), Lindwall, George Tribe (both left arm orthodox and unorthodox) and Toshack. The only deviations were Lindwall missing one Test due to chickenpox, and leg spinner Dooland replacing left-arm spinner Tribe in two Tests.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} years of the 1960s the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{considered}} new types of tactical transport aircraft to replace the RAAF's obsolete Douglas Dakotas. The Army <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> simple and rugged aircraft that could be purchased immediately, and pressed for the acquisition of de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribous, but the RAAF regarded the Caribou as inadequate for the role and preferred a more sophisticated aircraft, leading to delays in the selection process.|$|E
5|$|Duyệt {{and fellow}} {{southern}} general Le Chat then resigned their positions, but the emperor rejected their offers. Duyệt <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> {{post in the}} capital, but was not given one, in part of suspicions among the court that the general could launch a palace coup, not unlike many insurrections in Vietnam's past.

5|$|It {{took four}} months for reports of Heber's death to reach England. At Oxford, representatives of Brasenose and All Souls opened a fund for an {{appropriate}} memorial; this idea {{was taken over}} by Williams-Wynn, who <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> national rather than an Oxford-based monument. From the large sum collected, Chantrey was paid £3,000 for a huge marble sculpture that was placed in St Paul's Cathedral, London. More modest memorials were raised in the parish churches at Hodnet and Malpas.|$|E

5|$|Market {{research}} conducting during 1997 {{revealed that}} airlines <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> smaller {{aircraft in the}} 70-80-seat range. As the project proceeded, there were increasing disagreements between the Chinese side and Airbus. China <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> larger aircraft than originally envisioned. In addition, there were difficulties arising out of negotiations about technology transfer and production workshare, and a weak business case. STAe, having previously expressed doubts about returns on the project, in 1998 withdrew from the project out of the failure between AIA and AVIC to reach an agreement; Airbus and AVIC would cancel the project in July that year. The A318 {{is believed to have}} emerged from the AE31X project though an Airbus-only project, named the A319M5 in 1995, began before the AE31X cancellation.|$|E
5|$|McCartney had {{originally}} <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> 90-piece orchestra, but this proved impossible. Instead, the semi-improvised segment was recorded multiple times, filling a separate four-track tape machine, {{and the four}} different recordings were overdubbed into a single massive crescendo. The results were successful; in the final edit of the song, the orchestral bridge is reprised after the final verse.|$|E

Sculpted by Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, the medals recognize those immigrants' Viking heritage, depicting a warrior of that culture on the obverse and his vessel on the reverse. The medals also recall the early Viking explorations of North America.|$|E
