60|$|Toby {{poured in}} {{quite as much}} water as he thought the already weak mixture could receive and retain any flavor of lemon; and then, as his {{employer}} motioned him to add more, he mixed another quart in, secretly <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> taste like.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; then I {{want to get}} a noo clock. That one in {{the corner}} is a perfit fright. A noo table, too, for the leg o' that one has bin mended so often that it won't never stand another splice. Then a noo tea-pot an' a fender and fire-irons would be a comfort. But my great wish is to get a big {{mahogany}} four-post bed with curtains.

[...] "It's a very fine thing to have enough to eat--I've often <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like--but I'm p'ticler about my cooking. And Mrs. Wiley'll be here yet.

60|$|Honora breathed easier {{after this}} confession, {{but it was}} long before sleep came to her that night. She <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like to visit at a great country house such as Silverdale, {{what it would be}} like to live in one. It seemed a strange and cruel piece of irony on the part of the fates that Susan, instead of Honora, should have been chosen for such a life: Susan, who would have been quite as happy {{spending}} her summers in St. Louis, and taking excursions in the electric cars: Susan, who had never experienced that dreadful, vacuum-like feeling, who had no ambitious craving to be satisfied. Mingled with her flushes of affection for Susan was a certain queer feeling of contempt, of which Honora was ashamed.|$|E

You crossed Sloane Square, turned up King's Road, and finally arrived here. I followed. I saw a notice up, [...] "Studio to Let". I {{reflected}} that, having done a little painting in an amateur way, I could pose as an artist all right; so I took the studio. Also the name of Alan Beverley. My own is Bill Bates. I had often <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> feel like to be called by some name like Alan Beverley or Cyril Trevelyan. It was simply the spin of the coin which decided me in favour of the former. Once in, the problem was {{how to get to}} know you. When I heard you playing I knew it was all right. I had only to keep knocking on the floor long enough--' ...|$|E
6000|$|Felix and Peter and I were {{required}} to help Uncle Roger in some carpentering work that day, and Felicity indulged {{in one of the}} house-cleaning orgies so dear to her soul; so that it was evening before we were all free to meet in the orchard and loll on the grasses of Uncle Stephen's Walk. In August it was a place of shady sweetness, fragrant with the odour of ripening apples, full of dear, delicate shadows. Through its openings we looked afar to the blue rims of the hills and over green, old, tranquil fields, lying the sunset glow. Overhead the lacing leaves made a green, murmurous roof. There {{was no such thing as}} hurry in the world, while we lingered there and talked of [...] "cabbages and kings." [...] A tale of the Story Girl's, wherein princes were thicker than blackberries, and queens as common as buttercups, led to our discussion of kings. We <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like to be a king. Peter thought it would be fine, only kind of inconvenient, wearing a crown all the time.|$|E
60|$|Vane made no comment, but {{he watched}} her with {{satisfaction}} while he ate. There {{was no sign of}} the others; they were alone on the waste of tumbling water in the early dawn. The girl was pretty, and there was a pleasing daintiness about her. What was more, she was a guest of his, dependent for her safety upon his skill with the tiller. So far as he could remember, it was a year or two since he had breakfasted in a woman's company; it was certain that no woman had waited on him so prettily. Then as he remembered many a lonely camp in the dark pine forest or high on the bare rangeside, it occurred to {{him for the first time}} that he had missed a good deal of what life had to offer. He <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been like if when he had dragged himself back to his tent at night, worn with heavy toil, as he had often done, there had been somebody with blue eyes and a delightful smile to welcome him.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} the movie is {{explained}} in a voiceover intro by G. W. Bailey, who <b>wonders</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like {{if one of the}} 1930s/1940s Rex O'Herlihan movies were to be made today. At that point, in a scene reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz, the cinematography shifts from black & white to color and the soundtrack changes from mono to surround sound.|$|R
6000|$|Ryder {{passed his}} tongue over his parched lips. [...] "I {{will tell you}} it just as it happened, sir," [...] said he. [...] "When Horner had been arrested, {{it seemed to me}} that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a {{policeman}} or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be best to do.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} idea for Echo Burning came from two sources. The first was an idea {{he had in}} which he <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like to a woman whose husband was returning home from jail, but she didn't want him to return. He also took inspiration from seeing the grave of the gunfighter Clay Allison who [...] "never killed a man that did not need killing." [...] He <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like if Reacher was confronted by a man {{he had been told}} needed killing.|$|E
5000|$|Gaiman {{mentioned}} {{wanting to}} do a Renfaire issue with Hob in it {{because he thought it}} would be funny for several reasons: Gaiman himself mentioned in [...] "The Sandman Companion" [...] that he never liked Renfaires, particularly in America and <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like if someone from the time popped in.|$|E
6000|$|Harrington {{went back}} to the house, feeling that life was flat, stale, and unprofitable. That evening at the tea table he caught himself <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like to see Mary Hayden sitting at his table in place of Sarah King, with Bobbles and Ted on either hand. Then he found out what was the matter with him. He was in love, fathoms deep, with the blue-eyed widow! ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{had just}} {{finished}} reading The Government Racket: Washington Waste from A to Z, by Martin L. Gross. It is without a doubt the most disheartening and enlightening book about politics that I've ever read. I was out jogging one day <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take to really change Washington, when my thoughts turned to {{a friend who had}} been shot and killed in Washington, D.C., several summers earlier.

60|$|So Phoebe {{obtained}} {{the use of}} the brougham for the next day and set off for her long Essex drive, much against Augusta's will, and greatly <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> produce; compassionate of course for poor Lucilla, yet not entirely able to wish that Robert should resign the charge for which he was so eminently fitted, even for the sake of Hiltonbury and home. Lucy must be altered, indeed, if he would not be happier without her.|$|R
5000|$|The {{author was}} {{inspired}} to write The Mount after she took a class in the psychology of prey animals.

5000|$|King says he <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{have been}} like to have been raised by such a mother, and based the story itself on a {{reversal}} of the Cinderella fairy tale.

5000|$|Of the film, Nathan {{stated that}} he was {{inspired}} to create the movie after his writing and producing partner showed him a porn website that would invite its members to have sex on camera. Nathan {{found it difficult to}} believe that the participants, who were portrayed as ordinary, were as normal as they appeared and <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like if the [...] "wrong guy" [...] was hired.|$|E
25|$|Shoji {{lives with}} a bar hostess, <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be like to}} have a child with her and whether the child would grow up as a Napoleon or Hitler. Their {{apartment}} is frequented by a large rat, but he finds himself unable to kill it because it is pregnant. This causes the hostess to stay at her friend's place. When Shoji visits her bar, he tells her that none of the rat's six babies came out like Hitler, and leaves her.|$|R

Fully aware that Tommy deliberately sold her out, Elizabeth reports Helena and forces her {{to testify before the}} committee. Following Helena's testimony, however, Copeland chides both women and claims their efforts to undermine one another only resulted in them incriminating themselves.

50|$|The idea to {{make the}} film came to Paul Hogan (the lead actor {{and one of the}} story writers) when he was in New York. He <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like if a Northern Territory bushman arrived in town. As Paul Hogan said:The film's budget was raised through the 10BA tax {{concessions}} via Morgan Sharebrokers. Paul Hogan used his regular collaborators from TV, including John Cornell, Peter Faiman and Ken Shadie. Linda Kozlowski was imported to play the American reporter; Actors' Equity Australia objected to this but eventually relented.|$|E

5000|$|Kim's next {{work after}} that was The Tower, a {{disaster}} {{film about a}} fire in a high-rise apartment building, starring Sol Kyung-gu, Kim Sang-kyung and Son Ye-jin. In response to the criticisms of Sector 7, Kim spent nearly two years working with the post-production team on CGI; the film was finally released in December 2012. Kim stated that he {{got the idea for}} The Tower from a variety of boyhood experiences, including his first visit to Seoul where he saw the 63 Building and <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like to get trapped inside, and a later incident where he got stuck in an elevator, which he described as [...] "the moment when I first felt dread".|$|E

"I <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be like to}} live in a {{world where}} it was always June," [...] said Anne, as she came through the spice and bloom of the twilit orchard to the front door steps, where Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were sitting, talking over Mrs. Samson Coates' funeral, which they had {{attended}} that day.

500|$|In a {{scene in}} [...] "Apollo, Apollo", Jack <b>wonders</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be {{like to see the}} world through NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) eyes, {{revealing}} that Kenneth sees everyone as Muppets. To accommodate this, Sesame Street puppeteers Joey Mazzarino, Carmen Osbahr, and Matt Vogel were brought in to do the muppet versions of Jack, Liz, and Tracy Jordan. This angle would later be used again in the show's fourth season episode [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show" [...] in which Kenneth appears as a muppet while walking by a high-definition camera. In addition, the program was parodied by Sesame Street, in the show's 39th season, entitled [...] "30 Rocks".|$|R
60|$|Inside was {{something}} that looked good to eat. It smelled good, too. Chatterer began to <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> taste like.

He jumped down to the floor and ran all around the queer little wire house. At each end was a sort of little wire hallway. Chatterer stuck his head in one. It seemed perfectly safe. He crept a little way in and then backed out in a hurry. Nothing happened. He tried it again. Still nothing happened.|$|R
