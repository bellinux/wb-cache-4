5|$|Advertising for the {{permanent}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries in early 2015 was again shaped {{around a large}} digital-media push headed by its new advertising firm David.

In the host city of Indianapolis, Burger King sponsored Chicken Fries-branded SUVs that would give free rides to visitors.

Although Flat Holm was in full view of both the Welsh and English coasts, customs authorities were powerless to act as they had no boat to take them to the island.

5|$|For {{the primary}} deposits, the source pegmatites, {{which are usually}} {{obtained}} by mining, are divided into small parts and then undergo flotation. Alkaline earth metal carbonates may be removed after reaction with hydrogen chloride; then follow thickening, filtration, and calcination. The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%. Secondary materials (such as coastal sands) undergo gravity separation. Magnetic separation follows, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> magnets of increasing strength. Monazite obtained by this method can be as pure as 98%.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} {{literary}} debut in 1802 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> observational {{letters to the}} Morning Chronicle, written under the pseudonym Jonathan Oldstyle.

5|$|His first efforts, {{published}} under {{a variety}} of pseudonyms, were cheaply printed potboiler novels. In 1829 he finally released a novel under his own name, titled Les Chouans; it was a minor success, though it did not earn the author enough money to relieve his considerable debt. He found fame soon afterwards <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> novels including La Physiologie du mariage (1829), Sarrasine (1830), and La Peau de chagrin (1831).|$|E

Prior to the match, O'Neill was hounded by the media. The tourists decided to test him with short-pitched bowling, especially Fred Trueman. O'Neill decided to abstain from hooking, while attacking the spin of Jim Laker <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> sweep shots. After four and a half hours of uncharacteristic restraint, he compiled 104 with an emphasis on off side play. He took a total of 2/67, removing Fred Trueman and Arthur Milton.|$|E
