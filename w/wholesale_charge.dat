This report aims to examine and suggest possible solutions and policy options that may {{address the problem of}} high IMRS charges. It assesses their viability and possible side effects. Report Summary The first report on international mobile roaming services (“International Mobile Roaming Charging in the OECD Area”, DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009) 8 /FINAL 1), provided information on market development and pricing of International Mobile Roaming Services (IMRS) in the OECD area. It found prices to be unreasonably high, considering the underlying costs, and identified some of the causes for high roaming prices. High <b>wholesale</b> <b>charges,</b> the fact that consumers do not seem to take into account roaming services when choosing a bundled mobile offer, lack of contestability and low consumer awareness of roaming prices and of substitutes were found to be among the reasons for this price level. This report is a follow-up that proposes solutions to the described problems, and assesses their viability and possible side effects. The development of on-net offers by operators with large footprints is a desirable market-driven {{solution to the problem of}} high <b>wholesale</b> roaming <b>charges.</b> This response was referred to as “internalisation” in the first roaming report. Although trans-national footprints are needed in order to avoid <b>wholesale</b> <b>charges,</b> on-net offers based on the internalisation of wholesale costs and traffic steering to subsidiaries are a natural solution to launch reasonably priced and convenient retail roaming offers. However, the number of operators with large footprints remains low, and some on-net offers are likely to be focused on roaming in a particular region (e. g. Zain in East Africa). Due to competition dynamics at the retail level and the fact that roaming services are an element of the mobile services bundle, trans-national operators are likely to decide not to lower retail prices in order to retain high revenues from non priceelastic customers. In the event of a marketplace dominated by few operators with large footprints, smaller operators may be put aside, due to their inability to internalise wholesale roaming costs. Bigger players may impose high <b>wholesale</b> <b>charges</b> and make them unable to launch competitive retail roaming offers. The natural response for smaller operators is to form alliances in order to get substantial wholesale rate reductions. Although such alliances have existed for some time and did not prove to be very successful in bringing down overall wholesale costs, they may be again a valid response in a new scenario with increased operator consolidation and the presence of a higher number of on-net offers. As a last resort, regulatory intervention may be warranted to allow for improved market contestability. Another way forward to improve market contestability in roaming services was termed “localisation” in the first report. Global Mobile Virtual Network Operators (global MVNOs) are those operators that gain access to local airtime on local terms and conditions, thus avoiding wholesale roaming rates. Even though a number of global MVNOs have entered the market during the last few years, this option still remains not very widespread. It faces some important drawbacks, such as customers being reluctant to have two mobile service providers, lack of brand recognition, etc. They also face serious challenges to expand their customer base such as low bargaining power compared to “national” MVNOs, and relatively low volumes to justify investments. However, global MVNOs remain as an alternative to provide better market contestability and this report supports enhancing their visibility and consumer awareness. National regulatory frameworks as well should enable global MVNOs to develop by allowing access to airtime on local terms and conditions.  ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} firm financial and investment decisions and regulatory outcomes in network industries, where regulatory opportunism is often viewed to lead to underinvestment. We develop a model to describe the effect {{of an increase in}} leverage on regulated rates, retail as well as wholesale, and company investment. We then test the model's predictions using a panel of 15 EU Public Telecommunication Operators (PTOs) over the period 1994 - 2005. Our results show that the data cannot reject the model's predictions that leverage positively affects regulated wholesale and retail rates, as well as the PTOs' investment rate. Moreover, since leverage does affect <b>wholesale</b> <b>charges</b> that alternative operators pay to access to the incumbent's network infrastructure, we also find that an increase in leverage is followed by a {{decrease in the number of}} competitors and by an increase of the incumbent's market share. This suggests that the use of debt to discipline the regulator's lack of commitment within a vertically integrated network industry may somewhat impair or delay retail market competition, but has a favorable counterpart in mitigating the underinvestment proble...|$|R

40|$|In its Digital Single Market (DSM) strategy, the European Commission has rightly {{noted the}} {{importance}} of lowering the price paid for basic cross-border delivery by consumers and by small and medium size retail shippers. Consumers and SMEs may have few alternatives to the National Postal Operators (NPOs), or may be unaware of the options that they have. These concerns led to the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal in May 2016. 3 With its legislative proposal, the Commission has sought (1) to strengthen the data gathering powers of Member State postal regulatory authorities, and to oblige them to collect data at both retail and wholesale levels; (2) to increase transparency into pricing for those who use cross-border parcel delivery services; (3) to oblige Member State postal regulatory authorities to assess annually the affordability of these services; and (4) to open cross-border Terminal Dues (TD) and Inward Land Rates (ILR) arrangements to competitors There are parallels that can be drawn between the payment flows for cross-border parcel delivery and those of telecommunications, especially those of international mobile roaming. As with roaming, {{it is clear that}} the linkages between wholesale payments between and corresponding retail prices need to be properly understood in order to craft good policy.

There are, however, also important differences between roaming versus parcel delivery.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the effects of {{different}} forms of wholesale and retail regulation on retail competition in fixed network telephony markets. We explicitly model two asymmetries between the incumbent operator {{and a group of}} homogenous entrants: (i) while the incumbent has zero marginal costs, the entrant has the <b>wholesale</b> access <b>charge</b> as (positive) marginal costs; (ii) while the incumbent sets a two-part tariff at the retail level (fixed fee and calls price), the entrant can only set a linear price for calls. We model the product of the incumbent as horizontally differentiated from the products of the entrants, who are homogenous and do not have any market power. Competition from other infrastructures such as mobile telephony or cable is modelled as an outside opportunity for consumers. We find that entrants without market power might be subject to a margin squeeze if the wholesale access price is set at average costs and competitive pressure from other infrastructures increases. We argue that wholesale price regulation at average costs is not optimal in such a situation and discuss other forms of cost-based regulation, retail-minus and deregulation as potential alternatives. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceElectrical power {{consumption}} or demand varies very significantly from region to region. There are various factors which affect {{the demand for}} a particular location; higher the electrical demand higher is the <b>wholesale</b> electrical <b>charge</b> as well. These higher prices included the cost incurred to operate a peaking power plant; these power plants are commissioned to supply peak demands, and the capital cost to establish such a plant is very high; furthermore these plants are left idle for most part of the year. This is an inefficient process {{but it has to}} be commissioned to meet the basic criteria to supply uninterrupted power supply to the consumers. However, with the advance in technology, demand response is now progressing as a preferable alternative for peak load reductions, thereby reducing the dependencies on the peak load power plants. Some loads on the customer's side can be effectively controlled and shut off for short durations during the peak load times. These controllable devices can be used in such a way that there is no significant impact on the consumer's lifestyle or comfort. This research analyzes the potential of demand response for a small area or a community having residential houses in the United States. Different population sizes and properties of the residential sectors have been simulated with and without demand response for few days in the typical summer period June through September using GridLAB-D software. Potential savings in terms of demand reduction and energy consumption have been observed when demand response is coordinated with better thermal integration on residential houses.

40|$|Abstract The mixed channel {{model is}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular in the hi-tech industry where a firm, in addition to selling through the traditional supply chain of wholesaler and retailer, opens a direct channel to the customer through Internet sales. While the dual channel has its advantages, it gives rise to channel conflict. One way of alleviating the possibility of channel conflict is proposed in this paper where the retailer is allowed to add value to the product at a cost. A per unit value-adding cost is considered and any fixed upfront cost is not included. We model this mixed channel where the manufacturer, who is assumed to have more power than the retailer, makes decision {{on the price of}} the direct product and the <b>wholesale</b> price it <b>charges</b> the retailer. The retailer makes decision about the amount of the value added and the price of the augmented product. We also take into account the fact that the manufacturer may have only incomplete information about the retailer's cost of adding value. We present this model as a game between the two parties where the manufacturer acts as the leader. We obtain managerial insights into the dual-channel supply chain based on the analytical solutions. We compare the cases of complete and incomplete information and quantify the value of information to the manufacturer. In addition, we find that the retailer would be willing to share information with the manufacturer if her cost of adding value is lower than a threshold value. We report results of numerically obtained sensitivity analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} piracy {{on the price of}} eBook when the publisher uses the market platform for the sale of eBook. Under the traditional sales mechanism, called “resale model”, the market platform or an intermediary purchases eBook from the publisher at a wholesale price and sets the retail price. Under the new sales mechanism, called “agency model”, the publisher sets the retail price directly and pays a share of revenue to the platform as a fee for its service. Using a theoretical model, this thesis compares the equilibrium outcomes under both sales mechanisms. It shows that the retail price is always higher in the resale model regardless of the presence of piracy due to the presence of double marginalization associated with the resale model. In the presence of piracy, the size of the price increase is higher under the agency model due to investment in Digital Right Management (DRM) by the publishers. Under the agency model, publisher can recoup DRM cost only by setting higher retail price. However, under the resale model, platform recovers DRM cost in two ways: paying lower <b>wholesale</b> price and <b>charging</b> on retail price. Therefore, the demand for an original eBook reduces more with piracy under the agency model than under the resale model. The equilibrium amount of investment for DRM is the same under the both models, because consumer’s piracy behavior does not relate to the pricing model adopted by the industry. The amount of profits for publisher and marketplace vary according to pre-specified share of revenue. This thesis suggests that, in the presence of piracy, the agency model may not be a better strategy for the publisher if the market structure is monopoly; the resale model may be better for the publisher in this situation...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three essays {{relating to}} vertical {{integration in the}} petroleum industry {{and its relationship to}} retail gasoline prices. The first essay of the dissertation is a policy paper about price differences between partially integrated lessee operated stations and wholly integrated company operated stations and acts as a good introduction for the other two essays. The second essay employs structural estimation to determine the relative importance of various differences in price setting incentives. The third essay looks at how different stations impact pricing dynamics. ^ There has been some debate about the real world impact of vertical integration on prices for consumers. In the retail gasoline market this has taken the form of debate over the efficacy of divorcement legislation prohibiting major oil companies from integrating into the retail market in the form of company operated stations. In the first chapter, we supplement existing literature studying divorcement by examining daily station-specific pricing differences. We find that vertically-integrated company operated stations charge prices roughly 5 cents lower than partially-integrated lessee operated stations. ^ The second chapter explores the importance of three ways in which the pricing decisions of integrated company-operated retailers differ from the pricing decisions of solitary non-integrated retailers. The first reflects double marginalization wherein the non-integrated retailer charges a higher price because the combined markups of the wholesaler and the retailer exceed the markup of the integrated retailer. The second difference is a multimarket brand pricing reputation mediated by consumer search or switching costs which is important to the integrated firm operating in multiple markets but not to the solitary non-integrated retailer. The third difference reflects the concern of price setters at integrated retailers for stealing demand from other stations of the brand if consumers substitute between them. We construct a dataset for a regional gasoline market in order to explore the magnitude of each effect. The Arellano-Bond method for a dynamic panel was used to estimate demand parameters and two-stage least squares was used to estimate conjectural derivatives. Results indicate that the multimarket brand pricing reputation was a significant determinant of higher pricing by the non-integrated retailer. ^ Existing research has identified several interesting pricing dynamics in the gasoline market. The third chapter extends this literature by examining the effects of having two types of operators in the market - stations with prices set by an integrated company-operator and stations with prices set by a non-integrated lessee-operator. With heterogeneous station operators, we are able to not only reproduce existing empirical findings, but also identify several new empirical regularities. For instance, by linking data on <b>wholesale</b> prices <b>charged</b> to the lessee-operated stations, we identify how heterogeneity in costs between company-operators and lessee-operators can lead to asymmetry in price adjustments and to price leadership. Simulation results based on a model that incorporates heterogeneous station operations confirms the ability of such a model to replicate key pricing dynamics that we find in our data. ...|$|R
25|$|Bell Canada usage-based billing: On October 28, 2010, the CRTC {{handed down}} its final {{decision}} on how wholesale customers can be billed by large network owners. Under the plan which starts within 90 days, Bell {{will be able to}} <b>charge</b> <b>wholesale</b> service providers a flat monthly fee to connect to its network, and for a set monthly usage limit per each ISP customer the ISP has. Beyond that set limit, individual users will be charged per gigabyte, depending on the speed of their connections. Customers using the fastest connections of five megabits per second, for example, will have a monthly allotment of 60 GB, beyond which Bell will charge $1.12 per GB to a maximum of $22.50. If a customer uses more than 300 GB a month, Bell will also be able to implement an additional charge of 75 cents per gigabyte. In May 2010, the CRTC ruled that Bell could not implement its usage-based billing system until all of its own retail customers had been moved off older, unlimited downloading plans. The requirement would have meant that Bell would have to move its oldest and most loyal customers. The CRTC also added that Bell would be required to offer to wholesale ISPs the same usage insurance plan it sells to retail customers. Bell appealed both requirements, citing that the rules do not apply to cable companies and that they constituted proactive rate regulation by the CRTC, which goes against government official policy direction that the regulator only intervene in markets after a competitive problem has been proven. In Thursday's decision, the CRTC rescinded both requirements, thereby giving Bell the go-ahead to implement usage-based billing. This ruling according to Teksavvy handcuffs the competitive market. This has been asked by Stephen Harper and Parliament to have the decision reviewed. According to a tweet by Industry Minister Tony Clement, unless the CRTC reverses this decision, the government will use its override power to reverse the decision.|$|R

The purpose of work was the assessment of costs and costeffectiveness of regimens for the treatment of HCV (1 genotype) at the treatment-naive patients. Methods. The assessment was carried out from the payer perspective. In base case the analysis of costs of the drugs included and recommended for inclusion in the List of VED was carried out on the basis of a median of the registered prices including VAT and the average <b>wholesale</b> extra <b>charge</b> taking into account population in the Russian Federation. Besides, the scenario with the assessment on the basis of the prices of all drugs (which both are included, and not included in the List by VED) revealed in auctions for 2016 is analysed. Results. In the base case cost of paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ dasabuvir/ritonavir (PTV/OBV/DSV/r) therapy in patients without cirrhose is 12, 2 - 26, 6 % less compared with simeprevir with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV/ SMV) at a full course of the last (12 weeks) at all patients. In scenario with refusal of inefficient therapy with PegIFN/ RBV/SMV after 4 weeks, PTV/OBV/DSV/r is characterized by the comparable volume of expenses – from decrease by 15, 5 % to increase by 3, 2 %. The analysis on the basis of the prices of auctions has shown that in comparison with the PegIFN/RBV/SMV (without refusal of inefficient therapy with PegIFN/RBV/SMV after 4 weeks) and daclatasvir and asunaprevir, economy at therapy by a PTV/OBV/DSV/r will make 4, 1 - 19, 8 % and 28, 3 %, respectively. In comparison with PegIFN/RBV/SMV (with refusal of therapy in the absence of effect in 4 weeks) PTV/OBV/DSV/r is characterized by the comparable volume of expenses (from decrease by 7, 5 % to increase by 12, 8 %). In genotype 1 b costs of PTV/OBV/DSV/r are 24, 6 % higher compared with narlaprevir in a combination with ritonavir, peginterferon and ribavirin. Cost-effectiveness of PTV/OBV/DSV/r is higher at patients without cirrhosis in comparison with all analysed alternatives, except for a narlaprevir in a combination with ritonavir, peginterferon and ribavirin (genotype 1 b). At patients with cirrhosis the analysis on the basis of the registered prices has shown that at a full cycle of therapy decrease in costs of a PTV/OBV/DSV/r ± RBV will make 8, 4 % in comparison with the PegIFN/RBV/SMV, but at refusal of PegIFN/RBV/SMV in 4 weeks in the absence of the response, additional expenses on PTV/OBV/DSV/r ± RBV will make 5, 6 %. In the analysis on the basis of the prices of auctions PTV/ OBV/DSV/r ± RBV will allow to lower expenses at patients with cirrhosis on average by 11, 9 % in comparison with the daclatasvir and asunaprevir. In comparison with PegIFN/ RBV/SMV PTV/OBV/DSV/r ± RBV or it doesn’t influence expenses (at a full course of a simeprevir at all patients), or it increases them by 15, 2 % (at refusal of therapy in the absence of the response in 4 weeks). The cost-effectiveness of PTV/ OBV/DSV/r ± RBV surpasses all comparators at patients with cirrhosis, as well as at patients without cirrhosis. The sensitivity analysis has shown high reliability of the received results. Conclusions. Costs of PTV/OBV/DSV/r ± RBV at treatment-naive patients with HCV (1 genotype) without cirrhosis and with the compensated cirrhosis, are comparable to costs of a PegIFN/RBV/SMV at higher clinical and economic effectiveness. Taking into account the need for repeated courses of therapy to treatment-naive patients with the compensated cirrhosis, now purpose of a PTV/OBV/DSV/r ± RBV in the first line of therapy is the most preferable economically. </p...|$|R
