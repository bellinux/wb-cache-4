5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve {{returned}} to ABC the following New Year's Eve {{for the arrival}} of 2001. The 2000–01 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt positive about the program's expansion into primetime – believing that viewers, no matter where they were, wanted to know <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Michelle Madison as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by Lonestar, Boyz II Men, 98 Degrees, Baha Men, and Third Eye Blind among others.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{criticism}} continued even a {{week after}} the storm, especially over the scale of the disaster. The government claimed that only 27 people had been killed by Giri while numerous local and international agencies stated significantly higher totals. They were also blamed for downplaying the amount of damage, resulting in slower distribution of aid to areas in desperate need. Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by the Junta. The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries out of the area and prevent them from knowing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the region. On November8, local media discovered that the Junta was threatening to sever aid to the region if residents did not vote for them in the national election. According to Mizzima, the opposing party won landslide victories in numerous townships; however, in the cyclone affected areas, the Junta had complete victories.|$|E

25|$|During {{the reign}} of Aman Ullah Khan (1919–29), the Iranian {{minister}} in Kabul Sayyed Mahdi Farrokh compiled a “who’s who” of contemporary Afghan leaders. His sketch of Faiz Mohammad characterizes him as a devout Shia Muslim, highly regarded by the Qizilbash community of Kabul, {{as well as a}} leader among his own people, the Hazaras, and an important source of information for the Persian mission about <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the capital.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Stieglitz became {{increasingly}} intrigued {{with a more}} modern visual aesthetics for photography. He became aware of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> avant-garde painting and sculpture and found that pictorialism no longer represented the future – it was the past. He was influenced in part by painter Charles Sheeler and by photographer Paul Strand. In 1915, Strand, who had been coming to see shows at 291 for many years, introduced Stieglitz to a new photographic vision that was embodied by the bold lines of everyday forms. Stieglitz {{was one of the}} first to see the beauty and grace of Strand's style, and he gave Strand a major exhibit at 291. He also devoted almost the entire last issue of Camera Work to his photographs.|$|E

25|$|The {{knowledgeable}} Vicar Kersten (died 25 Oct. 1967), becoming {{after the}} war {{one of the first}} woman pastors in Berlin, was an important proponent of the Confessing Christians in the Capernaum Congregation. She led the Sunday school of the official Capernaum Congregation and regularly attracted 250 children and juveniles of parents of all allegiances. In the scope of the Confessing Church she held weekly Bible hours in her private apartment in Müllerstraße #97c, until she was bombed out in an allied air raid in February 1945. At the end of these meetings she traded the latest news about murders, arrests, and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> concentration camps, which were concealed by the official Nazi media. Kersten informed about a senior police officer in the local Seestraße precinct, who issued official police documents confirming the Christianness of its bearer, as Mechur recalled in 1989.|$|E
500|$|After the Pinkerton tour, Sharp {{left the}} band and Weezer went on a five-year hiatus. Cuomo moved to simpler songwriting with less {{personal}} lyrics; he stated that Weezer's subsequent albums the Green Album (2001) and Maladroit (2002) were [...] "very intentionally not about me. Not about <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> my life, {{at least in a}} conscious way."

500|$|Later, {{after reading}} {{an article in}} the San Francisco Examiner, Ryan {{declared}} his intention to go to Jonestown, an agricultural commune in Guyana where Jim Jones and roughly 1,000 Temple members resided. [...] Ryan's choice was also influenced both by the Concerned Relatives group, which consisted primarily of Californians, as were most Temple members, and by his own characteristic distaste for social injustice. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, while investigating the events, the United States Department of State [...] "repeatedly stonewalled Ryan's attempts to find out <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> Jonestown", and told him that [...] "everything was fine".|$|E

An estimated 10,000 people appeared at the screening in New York City. The designs of costumes were altered, according to Bryant, to reflect the general fashion development and changes in mainstream pop culture during the 1960s. In {{an interview with the}} San Francisco Chronicle, she teased: [...] "My characters are in an office environment in New York; it's very different from <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> London at the time.

When the American Civil War began in 1861, Disraeli said little publicly, but like most Englishmen expected the South to win. [...] Less reticent were Palmerston, Gladstone (again Chancellor) and Russell, whose statements {{in support of the}} South contributed to years of hard feelings in the United States.

500|$|The Incredibles as {{a concept}} dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during {{a period in which}} he tried to break into film. Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life. During this time, Bird had inked a {{production}} deal with Warner Bros. Animation and {{was in the process of}} directing his first feature, The Iron Giant. Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life. He stated, [...] "Consciously, this was just a funny movie about superheroes. But I think that <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> my life definitely filtered into the movie." [...] After the box office failure of The Iron Giant, Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.|$|E
500|$|In late March, VIII Corps {{advanced}} eastward through Eisenach {{and then}} across the Fulda River. Here some of Middleton's infantrymen {{came across the}} concentration camp at Ohrdruf, discovering the sickening evidence of what had transpired there. Middleton called Patton to come take a look, and Patton was joined by Bradley and Eisenhower. [...] In his diary, Patton described the place as [...] "one of the most appalling sights that I have ever seen." [...] This was the first Nazi concentration camp to be discovered by the United States Army, and Eisenhower cabled Marshall to get a delegation from congress over to witness and communicate what took place there. Middleton later had officials from the town come in to witness <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> their midst.

Milian {{did not try to}} write mainstream records for the radio; rather, she wrote about [...] "everything, about your life and concentrate on you doing you." [...] For previous albums, Milian wrote about things that had happened in the past, whereas for So Amazin, she focused on the present. She compared the writing process to writing a diary; whenever she would experience something that she thought would be important, she would write it down for future reference. Milian felt that by writing down true experiences, her songs were like [...] "captured emotion". When writing songs, Milian said that the amount of time it took to write varied. It would depend on what she was writing about, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> her life, and if it pertained to that exact moment. Sometimes the process was quick, but other times it could take several hours to write an entire song.|$|E
500|$|While {{removed from}} the public's gaze, Dylan and The Band made music very {{different}} from the recordings of other major artists. Andy Gill writes, [...] "Musically, the songs were completely at odds with <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the rest of the pop world, which during the long hot summer of 1967 was celebrating the birth of the hippie movement with a gaudy explosion of 'psychedelic' music—mostly facile paeans to universal love draped in interminable guitar solos." [...] Patrick Humphries itemizes the ways in which Dylan's songs dissented from the dominant ethos of rock culture: [...] "While the rock world vented its spleen on parents and leaders, Dylan was singing privately about parental fidelity. While George Harrison was testifying that life went on within and without you, Dylan was taking his potatoes down to be mashed. While Mick Jagger was 2,000 light years from home, Dylan was strapping himself to a tree with roots." ...|$|E

[...] The game has also received criticism for its system requirements, which called for an extremely powerful PC for its time. The Xbox 360 port has also received positive reviews, almost as favorable as the PC version. The multiplayer and instant-action mode were praised for better gameplay, but the control scheme was negatively viewed. Reviews have also stated that it lacked bonus features, despite the new mission included in the game. GameSpot gave the game 8.6. while IGN rated it 9.1 ...|$|E
