Since majority of the IT workforce in India are young {{it is important to}} understand whether earlier parameters for work life balance are relevant in the present context. The analy-sis revealed that the <b>work</b> family <b>conflict</b> has a definitive impact in both men and women in the IT companies. However it was found that women suffer more from <b>work</b> family <b>conflict</b> as they have the dual responsibility though the difference is not significant. To analyze the data collected from the IT employees in India we used linear regression model using Excel and SPSS.

This study examined longitudinally the influence of work–family conflicts on subsequent sleep medication. Questionnaire data were derived from the Helsinki Health Study mail surveys in 2001 – 2002 (2929 women, 793 men) of employees aged 40 – 60 years. Data concerning sleep medication were derived from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution’s registers covering all prescribed medication from 1995 to 2007. Four items measured whether job responsibilities interfered with family life (<b>work</b> to family <b>conflicts),</b> and four items measured whether family responsibilities interfered with work (family to <b>work</b> <b>conflicts).</b> Cox proportional hazard models were fitted, adjusting for age, sleep medication five years before baseline, as well as various family- and work-related covariates. During a five-year follow-up, 17 % of women and 10 % of men {{had at least one}} purchase of prescribed sleep medication. Among women, family to <b>work</b> <b>conflicts</b> were associated with sleep medication over the following 5 years after adjustment for age and prior medication. The association remained largely unaffected after adjusting for family-related and work-related covariates. <b>Work</b> to family <b>conflicts</b> were also associated with subsequent sleep medication after adjustment for age and prior medication. The association attenuated after adjustment for work-related factors. No associations could be confirmed among men. Thus reasons for men’s sleep medication likely emerge outside their work and family lives. Concerning individual items, strain-based ones showed stronger associations with sleep medication than more concrete time-based items. In conclusion, in particular family to <b>work</b> <b>conflicts,</b> but also <b>work</b> to family <b>conflicts,</b> are clear determinants of women’s sleep medication...|$|R
