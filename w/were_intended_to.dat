5|$|The {{walls of}} the inner ward contain {{extensive}} first floor passageways, similar to those at Caernarfon Castle. These <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> allow members of the castle to move between the towers, accessing the guardrooms, sleeping chambers and the castle latrines. The latrines were designed to be drained by a special system using {{the water from the}} moat, but the system {{does not appear to have}} worked well in practice. The six towers <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be three storeys high and contained fireplaces. The castle chapel was built into one of the towers and would have been used by the king and his family, rather than the wider garrison.|$|E

5|$|An {{explanation}} {{put forward}} by the Russian Government appeared {{to be that the}} deaths of Litvinenko and Politkovskaya <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> embarrass President Putin.

5|$|An ineffectual start {{led to the}} {{conclusion}} that deeper structural changes were necessary and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called perestroika, or restructuring.

5|$|Eight Chinook HC Mk3s {{were ordered}} in 1995 as {{dedicated}} special forces helicopters, which <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be low-cost variants of the US Army's MH-47E. The Mk3s include improved range, night vision sensors and navigation capability. The eight aircraft were to cost £259million and the forecast in-service date was November 1998. Although delivered in 2001, the Mk3 could not receive airworthiness certificates {{as it was}} not possible to certify the avionics software.|$|E

He then travelled to Los Angeles {{for a series of}} Beatles-related business meetings held at the offices of Apple's US distributor, Capitol Records, primarily to discuss the upcoming Beatles compilations 1962–1966 and 1967–1970. While these two double albums <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> foil bootleggers, Doggett notes that the profits financed the Beatles' litigation against Klein until well into 1974.|$|E

As part of this programme of work, Camber Castle was considerably expanded {{at a cost of}} £5,660.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson was published. Using the {{physical}} evidence of the original papers, the poems <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be published in their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets. Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems {{to be more than}} chronological or convenient.|$|E

However, {{none of these}} projects resulted in a production quantity, mainly because of its low impact resistance and its low fracture toughness.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, the People’s Republic of China was {{identified}} as a possible export customer. Russia's state weapons exporter, Rosoboronexport, was previously negotiating an order of 50 aircraft totalling US$2.5 billion.
