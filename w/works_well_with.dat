It <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Dominique's voice". However, while tracks like [...] "Edge of the Ocean" [...] experimented with new music like trip hop, [...] "Lucy Doesn't Love You" [...] reflected Ivy's previous material.|$|E

500|$|During {{recording}} {{sessions for}} the song, Adam Schlesinger and Chase played {{around with the}} idea of incorporating new genres into their music; in an interview with Billboard, Ivy stated, [...] "The first songs [...] recorded were jangly and simple and straight-ahead. We started gravitating toward the groovier, slightly more melancholy stuff. It <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Dominique's voice". With the exploration, Ivy began crafting [...] "stronger" [...] songs, that were less atmospheric than those on their previous studio album, Apartment Life (1997), but contained more [...] "infectious melodies".|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Apartment Life (1997), Ivy began work on a new studio album; however, the band was dropped by their label, Epic Records, shortly after the reissue of Apartment Life was released. After the end of their {{contract}} with Epic, and lead singer Dominique Durand's pregnancy, the New York City studio where Ivy regularly recorded music burned down. In order to forget about these events, Ivy resumed recording sessions, and began incorporating influences from new wave. Member Adam Schlesinger detailed the album's exploration of different genres: [...] "The first songs [...] recorded were jangly and simple and straight-ahead. We started gravitating toward the groovier, slightly more melancholy stuff. It <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Dominique's voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{focused on}} the album's light lyrical themes. Entertainment Weekly called the {{references}} to Stefani's clothing line [...] "shameless" [...] and stated that [...] "each song becomes akin to a pricey retro fashion blurb", and Pitchfork quipped that [...] "the Joker's free-money parade through Gotham City was a much more entertaining display of wealth, and he had Prince, not just Wendy & Lisa." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that the album's [...] "fashion fetish [...] gives the album a sense of thematic cohesiveness" [...] but that the [...] "obsession with Harajuku girls borders on maniacal". The Guardian disagreed with this perspective, arguing that [...] "her affinity with Japanese pop culture [...] yields a synthetic sheen [...] that <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the other point of reference, hip-hop." ...|$|E

The magazine added that the gun registered shots faster than the controller, was more accurate, and worked well from a distance. Neil West of Mega wrote the Menacer <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Terminator 2 in his review of the game. The Hawk Eye Will Smith wrote in 2010 that the six-game pack and Terminator 2 were the only Menacer games readily accessible. Ken Horowitz of Sega-16 wrote that none of the Menacer-compatible titles were exceptional, though Terminator and Body Count were standouts. He added that the Menacer's small library made collecting easier. Edward Fox of The Centre for Computing History has said that the museum's Menacer is his favorite piece in the collection when used with the Aura Interactor haptic suit.|$|E

Billboards Michael Menachem gave a positive review of the song saying that [...] "the song opens up with blurred 'wooh-ooh-oohs' that establish an uptempo pace, and its lively, danceable rhythm <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> frontman Jason Wade's vocals, which waver between intimate and explosive." [...] He also said that working with Kevin Rudolf and Jacob Kasher resulted in [...] "a fresh sound for Lifehouse as the band aims to extend its run on the hot AC and Billboard Hot 100 charts."

Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic said although he believed the no-dating policy was little more than an unnecessary device meant to create friction between Leslie and Ben, he enjoyed the lengths with which they were going to keep their relationship secret. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called [...] "The Bubble" [...] an excellent episode that went a long way in fleshing out the Leslie and Ben romance, but primarily set the scene for the superior [...] "Li'l Sebastian".

Once a contract was signed, ways {{to get out of}} it were limited to whether it had been signed under duress, misrepresentation, or fraud. The general theory was freedom of contract; a contract can include almost any terms, as long as both parties agree to them. But in reality this doctrine was problematic. Firstly, while the idea that a person should be held to those terms he agrees to and signs <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> individually negotiated contracts, it does not with [...] "standard form" [...] contracts– printed, non-specific contracts drawn up in advance by one party, such as those used by banks. Such contracts can include clauses that severely restrict the rights of one party (exclusion clauses). Secondly, while the idea that signing a contract indicates consent worked well when there was little disparity between the parties, when the parties are a small business or individual and a major corporation, the smaller party may have to [...] "take or leave" [...] the contract, which can be a problem if all other corporations in the industry use similar terms. Although it had long been argued that [...] "unfair" [...] clauses should be struck down, the courts were obliged by the doctrine of freedom of contract to uphold them.|$|E

Norman Mayers of Prefix Magazine wrote that B'Day {{is packed with}} standouts such as [...] "the Rich Harrison-produced 'Freakum Dress' and the Neptunes-helmed 'Kitty Kat'." [...] Picking out [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] {{as one of the}} four top tracks of the album, Spence D of IGN Music added that the song slows things down, allowing for Knowles' [...] "crystal clear vocals to take some down time and relinquish up a dreamy, creamy sound that is playfully sensuous." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic described [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] as [...] "a deceptively sweet, rainbow-colored track" [...] where purrs - that are sound made by all species of felids and are a part of cat communication - are more like [...] "claws-out dismissals." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times called the song a [...] "cooing [...] sighing" [...] one. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] was [...] "the only mid-tempo break" [...] until {{the very end of the}} album. Darryl Sterdan, writing for the Canadian website Jam!, said that the song is just about what you think. Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine commented that [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] seems to be an obvious tracks produced by The Neptunes. He went on complimenting [...] "the squishy R keyboard which <b>works</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the song’s 'I’m not feelin it' vibe." [...] A writer of Seattle Post-Intelligencer commented, [...] "Beyoncé is better at being sexy than sarcastic, and 'Kitty Kat' doesn't make any bones about what her absentee lover is missing."
