There's a sort of {{abstract}} YOU that I want to go on with. Something I've made out of you.... I want to know things about you--but I don't want to see or feel or imagine. When some day I have got rid of my intolerable sense of proprietorship, it may be different. Then perhaps we may meet again. I think it is even more the loss of our political work and dreams that I am feeling than the loss of your presence. Aching loss. I thought so much of the things we were DOING for the world--had given myself so unreservedly. You've left me with nothing to DO. I am suddenly at loose ends....|$|E
6000|$|An inscrutable and {{untoward}} fate condemns me to strange delinquencies--though it is {{no doubt}} the weakness of my nature {{as well as the}} strength of the said treacherous principle that the [...] "undone vast," [...] in my existence, lords it chronically and shamelessly over the [...] "petty done." [...] It strikes me indeed both as vast, and yet in a monstrous way as petty too, that I should have joyed so in [...] "The Kentons," [...] which you sent me, ever so kindly, more weeks ago than it would be decent in me to count--should have eaten and drunk and dreamed and thought of them as I did, should have sunk into them, in short, so that they closed over my head like living waters and kept me down, down in subaqueous prostration, and all the while should have remained, so far as you are concerned, brutishly and ungratefully dumb. I haven't been otherwise dumb, I assure you--that is so far as they themselves are concerned: {{there was a time when}} I talked of nothing and nobody else, and I have scarcely even now come to the end of it. I think in fact it is because I have been so busy vaunting and proclaiming them, up and down the more or less populated avenues of my life, that I have had no time left for anything else. The avenue on which you live, worse luck, is perversely out of my beat. Why, however, do I talk thus? I know too well how you know too well that letters, in the writing life, are the last things that get themselves written. You see the way that this one tries to manage it--which at least is better than no way. All the while, at any rate, the impression of the book remains, and I have infinitely pleased myself, even in my shame, with thinking of the pleasure that must have come to yourself from so acclaimed and attested a demonstration of the freshness, within you still, of the spirit of evocation. Delightful, in one's golden afternoon, and after many days and many parturitions, to put forth thus a young, strong, living flower. You have done nothing more true and complete, more thoroughly homogeneous and hanging-together, without the faintest ghost of a false note or a weak touch--all as sharply ciphered-up and tapped-out as the [...] "proof" [...] of a prize scholar's sum on a slate. It is in short miraculously felt and beautifully done, and the aged--by which I mean the richly-matured--sposi as done as if sposi were a new and fresh idea to you. Of all your sposi they are, I think, the most penetrated and most penetrating. I took in short true comfort in the whole manifestation, the only bitterness in the cup being that it made me feel old. I shall never again so renew myself. But I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> that it has really--the sense and the cheer of having done it--set you spinning again with a quickened hum. When you mentioned to me, I think in your last letter, that you had done the Kentons, you mentioned at the same time the quasi-completion of something else. It is this thing I now want--won't it soon be coming due?--and if you will magnanimously send it to me I promise you to have, for it, better manners. Meanwhile, let me add, I have directed the Scribners to send you a thing of my own, too long-winded and minute a thing, but well-meaning, just put forth under the name of The Wings of the Dove.|$|E
6000|$|... "MORAL STATISTICIAN."--I don't {{want any}} of your statistics; I took your whole batch and lit my pipe with it. I hate your kind of people. You are always {{ciphering}} out how much a man's health is injured, and how much his intellect is impaired, and how many pitiful dollars and cents he wastes {{in the course of}} ninety-two years' indulgence in the fatal practice of smoking; and in the equally fatal practice of drinking coffee; and in playing billiards occasionally; and in taking a glass of wine at dinner, etc., etc., etc. And you are always figuring out how many women have been burned to death because of the dangerous fashion of wearing expansive hoops, etc., etc., etc. You never see more than one side of the question. You are blind to the fact that most old men in America smoke and drink coffee, although, according to your theory, they ought to have died young; and that hearty old Englishmen drink wine and survive it, and portly old Dutchmen both drink and smoke freely, and yet grow older and fatter all the time. And you never try to find out how much solid comfort, relaxation, and enjoyment a man derives from smoking {{in the course of a}} lifetime (which is worth ten times the money he would save by letting it alone), nor the appalling aggregate of happiness lost in a lifetime by your kind of people from not smoking. Of course you can save money by denying yourself all the little vicious enjoyments for fifty years; but then what can you do with it? What use can you put it to? Money can't save your infinitesimal soul. All the use that money can be put to is to purchase comfort and enjoyment in this life; therefore, as you are an enemy to comfort and enjoyment, where is the use of accumulating cash? It won't do for you to say that you can use it to better purpose in furnishing a good table, and in charities, and in supporting tract societies, because you know yourself that you people who have no petty vices are never known to give away a cent, and that you stint yourselves so in the matter of food that you are always feeble and hungry. And you never dare to laugh in the daytime for fear some poor wretch, seeing you in a good humor, will try to borrow a dollar of you; and in church you are always down on your knees, with your eyes buried in the cushion, when the contribution-box comes around; and you never give the revenue officers a full statement of your income. Now you know these things yourself, don't you? Very well, then what is the use of your stringing out your miserable lives to a lean and withered old age? What is the use of your saving money that is so utterly worthless to you? In a word, why don't you go off somewhere and die, and not be always trying to seduce people into becoming as [...] "ornery" [...] and unlovable as you are yourselves, by your villainous [...] "moral statistics"? Now I don't approve of dissipation, and I don't indulge in it, either; but I haven't a particle of confidence in a man who has no redeeming petty vices, and so I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> any more. I think you are the very same man who read me a long lecture last week about the degrading vice of smoking cigars, and then came back, in my absence, with your reprehensible fireproof gloves on, and carried off my beautiful parlor stove.|$|E

40|$|Cooperation between {{customers}} and companies {{has existed for}} a long time. However, {{the role of a}} customer was rather passive and organizations were the ones who dictated their rules and took {{a leading role in the}} process of product creation. With a course of time the situation has been changed and customers are becoming more and more involved into the process of cooperation. As a customer driven innovation is relatively new phenomenon, the aim of our study is to examine its status in the modern business world. It can be observed that organizations all around the globe claim about their readiness and willingness to listen to {{customers and}} cooperate with them. Companies create customer support sections where they offer to leave complaints, comments and suggestions. Airline companies tend to have such experience. “We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>you.</b> Your feedback is important and helps us become a better airline” claims Delta Airlines. Tiger Airways states “Yes! We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>you!</b> Submit your feedback via our Customer Support Portal”. And there is multitude of such examples. With the help of the investigation of theoretical material, survey conduction and examining practical examples we aim to examine the issue of customer involvement into cooperation with organizations as well as to found out how ready customers are for such collaboration...|$|E

40|$|Translation begins] Hotel Albert Selma, Ala., March 15, 1945 My darling husband, One day {{has gone}} by {{and it was}} a day wasted. Any day that I don’t see you is. Just woke up a few seconds ago, sweetheart. It was awful to sleep along without you, honey. One good thing was that I was so tired hat I went right to sleep + slept until around nine almost without waking up. Gee, darling, {{marriage}} sure {{can make a difference in}} a person’s life. I feel so sorry for all my friends who aren’t’ married. The poor girls- oh, well, they don’t know what they’re missing so that probably is all right. Everyone was so right who told me about you’ll wonder how you ever lived before without it. It seems as though we’d always been married. It really amazes me now more than ever how girls can marry someone they don’t really love. Julie + I were talking about that last night. If I wasn’t madly in love with you it would make me hate you more to even touch me. I just can’t see how they ever could. Marriage is the most wonderful think in the world when you’re in love. And I sure am in love with you. Being away from you is so awful. Part of me just isn’t- (this is the worst pen). Golly, darling, I hope the 31 st hurries and gets here. Golly, what a marriage. We’ve only been married less than a week and you’re miles away. They can’t do that to us. How do you like the field down there. It’s supposed to be awful from what I’ve heard. How do you like air gunnery. I suppose you do a lot. It’s miserable day today. Looks like it’s going to rain any minute. I’m so glad that we had such a beautiful day for you graduation + wedding. I wish that you had married me before you graduated- at Christmas. But I suppose it would have been awful because you never got open Post. It seems so long ago- Christmas I mean. Years and years- and it seems like eight million years since we were together. Gee, honey, I hope you’re at this post a good long time. Don’t get angry. I know you don’t but I like it here. Everyone has been so nice and besides the longer you’re here, the longer we can be together. Last night I slept in the top to your pajamas- slightly large but it was comfortable. Besides you wore them and it made me not so lonesome. I really should get up + get ready to go to Mrs. Moseley’s. I would rather write to you though. How I’ll ever get there with all this extra stuff will be a problem. My suitcases are packed real full and there’s still all the clothes in the closet to go. Oh, honey, I love you so. Being married to you is the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me. You’re so sweet and understanding and thoughtful and the most wonderful husband in the world. Lord, I’m lucky. Today I’ll be real good + write to mom. I just was too beat last night and too busy all day. I wish that the 31 st would hurry- Golly after we were married I never thought I’d be anxious for the days to hurry. After the 31 st though when we’re together again I hope they go so nice and slowly. Julie’s going to try to get some film for me but it won’t do much good until you fix the camera. She said she knew an officer who wanted to sell a car but can’t remember who it was. Maybe we can buy one. Julie wants me to go out to the Post + get my pass. I’m sorta afraid to go when you’re not here. It wouldn’t see right but I would like to see the bulletin board + try to get a house- I mean a room. Well, darling, I’d better get a bath + start packing- I love you so, honey. I miss you terribly. I love you more than I ever thought possible. Well, darling, here I am at Mrs. Moseley’s. It’s a nice clean place but holy cow if you breathe around here, it sounds like an A 9 - 6 taking off. Everyone is so darned quiet. We’d never be able to stay here. They’d probably throw us out at the first night. Well, I’ll look for a room tomorrow. I have to stay here a week + maybe at the end of that time something will turn up. It’s raining now I think. Golly, honey, I miss you so. Every time I say my husband- it sounds so nice. I wish you were here with me now. It’s thundering and we could be so comfortable here. The bed doesn’t squeak by the way. I hope that I can find someplace to live before this week is up because you’d go crazy here. We’d undoubtedly be requested to leave the way we carry on. Lord, in the middle of the night we get the maddest ideas- remember? Gee, honey, I wish I could tell you how very much I love you. It is so lonesome without you, honey- life just isn’t the same for me. These seventeen days shouldn’t take too long but I know every minute will seem like a thousand years. I love you so, Judd. I’m so happy honey, of course not as happy as I’d be if you were here- but you know what I mean. Everyone at the hotel is trying to find us a room, honey. I sure hope I can find one near to town for when you come back. Julie + Betty Jo + I will probably go to the movies tonight. Julie is so nice to me. She wouldn’t let me be alone at all. Afraid I’ll get lonesome but she’s no consolation. You’re all I need, baby + you’re all I’ll ever need. Without you my life just wouldn’t be anything. I couldn’t live without you, honey. What a difference marriage can make. I never thought I would ever be dependent upon one man for my happiness. It sure changes everything. Golly, I love you. Every minute we’re together makes me love you more + more. My husband- that sure sounds wonderful and you sure are- Golly, Judd, I never dreamed I could be so happy. You’re so wonderful, honey and I’m so proud to be your wife. I hope that one morning soon we’ll be able to lie in bed together + not have to get up a four or five so that I can just sit and look at you. You look so adorable when you’re asleep. I hope that you’re not working too hard + that the weather is nice down there. It would be horrible if it wasn’t and they made you stay down longer- what an awful thought. Do you miss me, honey? Golly, I miss you. Millions more than I ever did before. If these seventeen days don’t hurry I’ll be so lonesome that it will be almost dangerous for you to get back. I wish we could find a handcuff or something so that they could never make us apart. We just shouldn’t be separated darling. It’s funny, darling, ever since I first met you I’ve had that we were meant for each other feeling. As we sure were. Honey, would you mind awfully if something happened- that sounds queer but I mean if I did have a baby. I know that you’d hate to be tied down. If we were going to have one maybe it would be better if I didn’t tell you about it. I wouldn’t want you to worry or be unhappy. You know how I feel about it, honey, in case- But you know how I feel. I love you so, my darling. Being away from you is just like living in a sorta semi-existence. Life won’t be the same until you and I are together again. Then everything will be perfect + I’ll be so happy. Darling, I’ll never be able to tell you how much I love you or show you. I’ll be trying to for the rest of our lives but it just can’t be done. Besides, my love for you keeps growing stronger every day. I was sure before we were married- when everyone said you’ll love each other more after you’re married that I couldn’t possible love you any more, but I do and every day I love you more. Honey, I’ll be so happy when we’re together again. Just walking down the street with you will be wonderful and being in your arms again will be heaven. Honey, I wish I could write the way I feel but I just can’t express it. You always say the sweetest things, Judd. I love you so. Golly, it’s pouring! Have to get some more ink- just a sec Oh, honey, I must remember to write to the paper. I can’t do anything- I’m much too much in love. That’s the understatement of the year. Golly, darling, you sure have changed me. How I love it, too. Julie is wrapping Tom’s glasses that he left at her house and we’ll probably mail them tonight + you can give them to Tom. I should go into town now + get some of the things that I’ve forgotten to. I can’t find my tooth brush. You must have it, honey. Do you? I’ll get one tonight anyway. Honey, I hope I’ll be a good wife. I can’t do a thing a wife is supposed to- can’t cook + don’t like to- can’t keep house + have no ambition to- can’t do much of anything but love you. That’s the only thing I like to do, too. I guess I’ll just have to devote all my time + energy to that. What a wonderful job. I have your pictures by my bed darling so that when I wake up every morning that’s the first thing I see. Honey, it sure was fate that brought us together. I’m so lucky darling to have you for my husband. I’ll be thankful for you for always. I can’t imagine what I ever would have done without you. Being your wife, darling, is so heavenly. Lord, I’m lucky- and so much in love. Don’t suppose that you’ll have any time to write will you, honey, but try to because I miss you so much and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> so. The hotel said they’d keep any mail that came for me. By the way, have you gotten any for me? Gee, Judd, I never dreamed I could be so completely in love with anyone. I was in love with you before we married but it was nothing compared to this. Every minute we’re together is wonderful. I’ll be so glad when we are together again. What a thing for the Army to do. Here we’ve practically just been married and what do they do- separate us. At a time like this, too. I tried to write a letter to mom + my mother but I just can’t. It’s just as thought they were here when we were together. I can‘t write to anyone but you. Told mom that you were going to air gunnery school. It’s awful, Judd. I could write to you all night but a page is the most I can write anyone else. Gee, honey, I’ll sure be glad when you’re back here again. Without you I’m completely lost. Like a fish out of water only worse. Golly, I love you so. I’ll be so happy to be with you again, honey. It’s going to be wonderful. That’s all I can think about- you. My darling, I miss you so. Golly, honey, you can’t imagine how much. Well sweetheart, I guess I’d better start going into Selma before all the stores close. Oh, I can eat now it’s amazing. Please try to write often darling, a letter from you would mean so much. I hope you don’t mind if I sleep in the tops of your pajamas but it makes me feel closer to you + not quite so lonesome. I love you so, darling. I’ll mail this now + will probably write when I get back from the movies. How long does it take for you to get my mail? I love you so honey. I miss you so much, darling. Til we’re together again. My darling, I love you + I’m always Yours, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
