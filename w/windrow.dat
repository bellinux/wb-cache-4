25|$|There are {{two main}} methods of {{large-scale}} vermiculture. Some systems use a <b>windrow,</b> which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin; organic material is added to it. Although the <b>windrow</b> has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping, in theory they should not due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on. Often windrows are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from gaining access to the worm population.|$|E
40|$|Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) {{exhibits}} extreme {{plant to}} plant variability {{which can make}} estimation of <b>windrowing</b> time difficult. Canadian research indicates that buckwheat should be <b>windrowed</b> when 75 % of the seeds have turned brown and flowering is near completion [2, 4]. This visual estimation can be difficult for farmers. Since the development rate of crops is heat unit driven and closely related to air temperature, a study was initiated to determine if growing degree days could be utilized to estimate the optimum <b>windrowing</b> period in buckwheat. Results indicate that growing degree days provide an accurate method to assist in estimating the optimum <b>windrowing</b> time. Field validation of a computer model which will implement this estimation method will be utilized in 1995...|$|R

40|$|A {{field study}} {{was carried out}} to {{investigate}} the impacts of <b>windrowed</b> harvesting residues on denitrification, immobilisation and leaching of 15 N-labelled nitrate applied at 20 kg N ha- 1 to microplots in second-rotation hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) plantations of 1 - 3 years old in southeast Queensland, Australia. The PVC microplots were 235 mm in diameter and 150 mm long, and driven into the 100 mm soil. There were three replications of such microplots {{for each of the}} six treatments which were areas just under and between 1 -, 2 - and 3 -year-old <b>windrows</b> of harvesting residues. Based on gaseous N losses estimated by the difference between the recoveries of bromide (Br) applied at 100 kg Br ha- 1 and 15 N-labelled nitrate, denitrification was highest (23 % based on 15 N loss) in the areas just under the 1 -year-old <b>windrows</b> 25 days after a simulated 75 mm rainfall and following several natural rainfall events. There {{was no significant difference in}} 15 N losses (14 - 17 %) among the other treatments. The 15 N immobilisation rate was highest for microplots in the areas between the 1 -year-old <b>windrows</b> and generally higher for microplots in the areas just under the <b>windrows</b> (30 - 39 %) than that (26 - 30 %) between the <b>windrows.</b> Direct measurement of 15 N gas emissions (15 N 2 + 15 N 2 O) confirmed that the highest denitrification rate occurred in the microplots under the 1 -year-old <b>windrows</b> although the gaseous 15 N loss calculated by gas emission was only about one-quarter that estimated by the 15 N mass balance method. A significant, positive linear relationship (P< 0. 05) existed between the gaseous 15 N losses measured by the two methods used. The research indicates that considerable mineral N could be lost via denitrification during the critical inter-rotation period and early phase of the second rotation. However, the impacts of <b>windrowed</b> harvesting residues on N losses via denitrification might only last for a period of about 2 years. No Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|Langmuir {{circulation}} {{results in}} the occurrence of thin, visible stripes, called <b>windrows</b> {{on the surface of}} the ocean parallel to the direction that the wind is blowing. If the wind is blowing with more than 3 m s−1, it can create parallel <b>windrows</b> alternating upwelling and downwelling about 5-300 m apart. These <b>windrows</b> are created by adjacent ovular water cells (extending to about 6 m deep) alternating rotating clockwise and counterclockwise. In the convergence zones debris, foam and seaweed accumulates, while at the divergence zones plankton are caught and carried to the surface. If there are many plankton in the divergence zone fish are often attracted to feed on them.|$|R

40|$|Solid-state 13 C nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) with cross-polarisation (CP) and magic-angle-spinning (MAS) was used to: (a) examine the changes in carbon (C) composition of <b>windrowed</b> harvest residues during the first 3 years of hoop pine plantations in subtropical Australia; (b) assess the impacts of <b>windrowed</b> harvest residues on soil organic matter (SOM) composition and quality in the 0 - 10 cm soil layer. Harvest residues were collected from 0 -, 1 -, 2 - and 3 -year-old <b>windrows</b> of ca. 2. 5 m width (15 m apart for 0 -, 1 - and 2 -year-old sites and 10 m apart for 3 -year-old site). Soils from the 0 to 10 cm soil layer were collected from the 1 -, 2 - and 3 -year-old sites. The 13 C NMR spectra of the harvest residues indicated the presence of lignin in the hoop pine wood, foliage and newly incorporated organic matter (NIOM). Condensed tannin structures {{were found in the}} decay-resistant bark, small wood and foliage, but were absent in other residue components and SOM. The NMR spectra of small wood samples contained condensed tannin structures because the outer layer of bark was not removed. NIOM showed a shift from foliage-like structures (celluloses) to lignin-type structures, indicating an incorporation of woody residues from the decomposing harvest residues. Suberins were also present in the small wood, foliage and bark. The 13 C CP NMR spectra of SOM indicated that in areas where <b>windrows</b> were present, SOM did not show compositional changes. However, an increase in SOM quality under the <b>windrows</b> in the second year after their formation as characterised by the alkyl C/O-alkyl C (A/O-A) ratio was mainly due to inputs from the decomposition of the labile, readily available components of the <b>windrowed</b> harvest residues.

500|$|Snow blowers, {{also known}} as {{rotating}} snowplows or snow cutters, {{can be used in}} place of snowplows on winter service vehicles. A snow blower consists of a rapidly spinning auger which cuts through the snow, forcing it out of a funnel attached {{to the top of the}} blower. Snow blowers typically clear much faster than plows, with some clearing in excess of [...] of snow per hour, and can cut through far deeper snow drifts than a snowplow can. In addition, snow blowers can remove snow from the roadway completely, rather than piling it at the side of the road, making passage easier for other road users and preventing the <b>windrow</b> from blocking driveways.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The agro-industrialization {{of animal}} {{products}} {{has led to}} a significant waste generation, which has been stabilized by composting process in specialized plants. Waste stabilization time on composting depends on the handling used. 12 treatments were performed, three frequency turnings combined with two environmental conditions (with and without coverage of the composting area) and with and without commercial inoculant, whose results were submitted to multiple regression analysis. <b>Windrows</b> turned twice a week in the first month had adequate temperature control and stabilization time of 83. 5 and 95. 5 days for uncovered and covered <b>windrows,</b> respectively. Uncovered <b>windrows</b> have accelerated the process in 10 days on average, with the disadvantage of increasing nutrient losses.

500|$|De Castries' {{seclusion}} in his bunker, {{combined with}} his superiors' inability to replace him, created a leadership vacuum within the French command. On 24 March, an event took place which {{later became a}} matter of historical debate. The historian Bernard Fall records, based on Langlais' memoirs, that Colonel Langlais and his fellow paratroop commanders, all fully armed, confronted de Castries in his bunker on 24 March. They {{told him he would}} retain the appearance of command, but that Langlais would exercise it. De Castries is said by Fall to have accepted the arrangement without protest, although he did exercise some command functions thereafter. Phillip Davidson stated that the [...] "truth would seem to be that Langlais did take over effective command of Dien Bien Phu, and that Castries became 'commander emeritus' who transmitted messages to Hanoi and offered advice about matters in Dien Bien Phu". Jules Roy, however, makes no mention of this event, and Martin <b>Windrow</b> argues that the [...] "paratrooper putsch" [...] is unlikely to have ever happened. Both historians record that Langlais and Marcel Bigeard were known to be on good terms with their commanding officer.|$|E

[...] The route for the Viet-Minh between Thanh Hoa and the Delta contained a crossroads at Lai Cac which was targeted by the operation. Seven Mobile Groups (Groupes Mobiles) were deployed with river and amphibious units; tank units (largely the M24 Chaffee); half-tracks and paratroopers at designated landing sites, after counter-intelligence misled the Viet-Minh into defending the wrong locations.

40|$|Wood chips need {{to fulfill}} {{specific}} quality parameters {{in order to}} be used as fuel for industrial or residential use. Moisture content and chip size distribution are recognized as the main physical characteristics affecting energy conversion efficiency. Objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the effects of harvesting mode on the quality of wood chips, under the typical conditions offered by SRC poplar grown in Central Italy. Single-pass and two-pass harvesting were compared. Standing stems and cut <b>windrowed</b> stems were harvested using two modified foragers alternately equipped with a drum or a disc chipper, allowing a further comparison of different chipping devices. Data were obtained from 3 fields in Central Italy and allowed analyzing the drying process occurring when stems are felled and stored in the field as <b>windrows.</b> The mean water content at the time of cutting was 59 % (wH 2 O) (wH 2 O), which was reduced below 30 % after about 100 days of storage in the <b>windrows.</b> Regression analysis of storage duration and moisture content showed that air temperature is the main driver of the drying process, under the typical conditions of a Mediterranean climate. Harvest mode (single-pass or two-pass) and chipping device (drum or disc) have a significant effect on particle-size distribution. The incidence of accept particle was higher when chipping <b>windrowed</b> stems or using the drum chipper. The paper discusses the advantages of two-pass harvesting and emphasizes the importance of flexibility when choosing harvest mode and chipper type...|$|R
