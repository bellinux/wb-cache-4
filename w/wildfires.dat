40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} the effect <b>wildfire</b> mitigation has on broad-scale <b>wildfire</b> behavior. Each year, hundreds of million {{of dollars are}} spent on fire suppression and fuels management applications, yet little is known, quantitatively, of the returns to these programs {{in terms of their}} impact on <b>wildfire</b> extent and intensity. This is especially true when considering that <b>wildfire</b> management influences and reacts to several, often times confounding factors, including socioeconomic characteristics, values at risk, heterogeneous landscapes, and climate. Due to the endogenous nature of suppression effort and fuels management intensity and placement with <b>wildfire</b> behavior, traditional regression models may prove inadequate. Instead, I examine the applicability of propensity score matching (PSM) techniques in modeling <b>wildfire.</b> This research makes several significant contributions including: (1) applying techniques developed in labor economics and in epidemiology to evaluate the effects of natural resource policies on landscapes, rather than on individuals; (2) providing {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between <b>wildfire</b> mitigation strategies and their influence on broad-scale <b>wildfire</b> patterns; (3) quantifying the returns to suppression and fuels management on <b>wildfire</b> behavior...|$|R

30|$|A {{report by}} USDA Forest Service (2014) {{documents}} the financial scale of <b>wildfire</b> management activities including large fire suppression and associated consequences to the Agency’s budget. Large <b>wildfire</b> suppression activities by US Federal agencies have cost nearly $ 24 billion between 2000 and 2013 (adjusted to 2013 US$). This {{does not include}} {{state and local government}} costs nor does it include federal cost for pre-suppression activities (planning, equipment and labor acquisition), <b>wildfire</b> initial attack, or hazardous fuels management. The USDA Forest Service maintains the largest federal <b>wildfire</b> organization representing approximately 70 percent of all federal expenditures on <b>wildfire</b> management. In 1995 <b>wildfire</b> related expenses represented 17 percent of the US Forest Service’s appropriated funds, by 2014, 51 percent of the appropriated funds were related to <b>wildfire</b> management. This increased demand for <b>wildfire</b> suppression has created a budgetary cycle where ever increasing demands for <b>wildfire</b> suppression funding come at the cost of other public land management programs, some of which are intended to directly reduce future <b>wildfire</b> damage. During this period of time, the Agency’s budget has not increased commensurately with the rise in <b>wildfire</b> management expenditures. Thus other major budget items have experienced significant reduction; for example vegetation and watershed management (22 percent reduction), facilities (67 percent reduction), roads (46 percent reduction), and deferred maintenance (95 percent reduction) (USDA Forest Service 2014). Increasing <b>wildfire</b> damage to human and ecological systems compromise public land management agencies such as the USDA Forest Service’s ability to maintain key ecological function and the provisioning of ecosystem services.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} the treatment effects <b>wildfire</b> suppression (fire crew response time) and fuel management (prescribed fire) have on <b>wildfire</b> size and intensity.

The suitability of IV versus PSM methods {{depends largely on}} the assumptions made and the data available, {{and in the case}} of <b>wildfire</b> modeling, it seems PSM may be more appropriate. While the vast majority of PSM literature focuses on binary treatments, we explore the ability of recently developed continuous treatment propensity score models.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review {{progress}} towards {{the implementation of}} a risk management framework for US federal wildland fire policy and operations.

These systems include new analytical methods to measure <b>wildfire</b> risk to human and ecological values and to inform fuel treatment investment strategies at national, regional, and local scales. Application of the risk management framework to support <b>wildfire</b> incidents has been dramatically advanced with the Wildland Fire Decision Support System and allowed policy modifications that encourage management of incidents for multiple objectives. The new <b>wildfire</b> risk management decision support systems we discuss provide Federal agencies in the US the ability to integrate risk-informed approaches {{to a wide range of}} <b>wildfire</b> management responsibilities and decisions. While much progress has been made, there remain several barriers that need to be addressed to fully integrate risk science into current <b>wildfire</b> management practices.

40|$|This thesis extends FARSITE (a {{software}} {{used for}} <b>wildfire</b> modeling and simulation) to incorporate data assimilation techniques based on noisy and limited spatial resolution {{observations of the}} fire perimeter to improve the accuracy of <b>wildfire</b> spread predictions. To include data assimilation in FARSITE, uncertainty on both the simulated <b>wildfire</b> perimeter and the measured <b>wildfire</b> perimeter is used to formulate optimal updates for the prediction of {{the spread of the}} <b>wildfire.</b> For data assimilation, <b>Wildfire</b> perimeter measurements with limited spatial resolution and a known uncertainty are used to formulate an optimal adjustment in the fire perimeter prediction. The adjustment is calculated from the Kalman filter gain in an Ensemble Kalman filter that exploits the uncertainty information on both the simulated <b>wildfire</b> perimeter and the measured <b>wildfire</b> perimeter. The approach is illustrated on a <b>wildfire</b> simulation representing the 2014 Cocos fire and presents comparison results for hourly data assimilation results. In later chapters we extend FARSITE with the ability to update both fire perimeters and fuel adjustment factors to further improve the accuracy of <b>wildfire</b> spread predictions. To show the effectiveness of fuel adjustment factor updates, a comparison is made using an EnKF with fixed adjustment factor on a <b>wildfire</b> simulation representing the 2014 Cocos fire.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 The hazards-of-place {{model of}} {{vulnerability}} to environmental hazards posits that vulnerability has biophysical and social components. While biophysical characteristics {{are important in}} predicting locations of elevated <b>wildfire</b> risk, the social characteristics of human communities may help us predict locations of elevated <b>wildfire</b> impacts. We {{examine the relationship between}} biophysical and social vulnerability to identify places that may experience impacts from <b>wildfire</b> hazards more acutely. We examine whether a singular focus on either biophysical or social vulnerability will accurately represent vulnerable places and predict that areas of high <b>wildfire</b> do not coincide with all areas of high social vulnerability. We develop a neighborhood-level social vulnerability index using principal component analysis and intersect it with an existing measure of <b>wildfire</b> risk to compare areas by place vulnerability to <b>wildfire</b> hazards. These results were mapped and further compared by wildland-urban interface categories. We find that few areas of high <b>wildfire</b> risk intersect with areas of high social vulnerability, but that stronger associations exist in some portions of the coterminous US. This analysis identifies regions and states with elevated levels of place vulnerability to <b>wildfire</b> hazards, places that would have otherwise have been under identified in analyses that focused on either biophysical or social vulnerability alone. These results can help inform <b>wildfire</b> prevention, mitigation, and recovery planning processes, ultimately decreasing the hazards associated with <b>wildfire</b> for vulnerable places...|$|R

5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area.

Fossil charcoal indicates that <b>wildfires</b> began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago.
