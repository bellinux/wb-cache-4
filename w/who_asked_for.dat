5|$|On September 25, 1989, several Republicans from Ohio {{filed an}} ethics {{complaint}} against Glenn, charging {{that he had}} improperly intervened on Keating's behalf. The initial charges against the five Senators were made on October 13, 1989, by Common Cause, a public interest group, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> the U.S. Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate {{the actions of the}} senators relative to Lincoln and the contributions received from Keating and whether they violated the rules of the Senate or federal election laws. But the most public attention came from the House Banking Committee, whose new chair Henry B. Gonzalez held 50hours of hearings into the Lincoln failure and associated events.|$|E
5|$|Wilde was {{initially}} {{buried in the}} Cimetière de Bagneux outside Paris; in 1909 his remains were disinterred and transferred to Père Lachaise Cemetery, inside the city. His tomb there was designed by Sir Jacob Epstein. It was commissioned by Robert Ross, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a small compartment {{to be made for}} his own ashes, which were duly transferred in 1950. The modernist angel depicted as a relief on the tomb was originally complete with male genitalia, which have since been vandalised; their current whereabouts are unknown. In 2000, Leon Johnson, a multimedia artist, installed a silver prosthesis to replace them.|$|E

Ricketts died hours before Steinbeck arrived. Upon returning home, Steinbeck was confronted by Gwyn, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a divorce, which became final in August.

25|$|The Estates-General {{convened in}} the Grands Salles des Menus-Plaisirs in Versailles on 5 May 1789 and {{opened with a}} three-hour speech by Necker. The Third Estate demanded that the {{credentials}} of deputies should be verified by all deputies, rather than each estate verifying the credentials of its own members, but negotiations with the other estates failed to achieve this. The commoners appealed to the clergy, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> more time. Necker then stated that each estate should verify its own members' credentials and that the king should act as arbitrator.|$|E
25|$|Riley and Babcock {{found that}} women are penalized {{when they try to}} {{negotiate}} starting salaries. Male evaluators tended to rule against women who negotiated but were less likely to penalize men; female evaluators tended to penalize both men and women who negotiated, and preferred applicants who did not ask for more. The study also showed that women who applied for jobs were not as likely to be hired by male managers if they tried to ask for more money, while men <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a higher salary were not negatively affected.|$|E

Patrick joined the board at the request of Ameriquest's founder, Roland Arnall, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> his help managing the investigations and changing the company's culture. During his tenure on the board, Ameriquest and Argent originated over $80 billion in subprime mortgages, but those conducting the investigation said that at the time Patrick left Ameriquest the company was on the road to change.|$|E

After victory and peace with the Türgesh, the Chinese {{attacked}} the Tibetan army. The Tibetans suffered several defeats in the east, despite strength in the west. The Türgesh empire collapsed from internal strife. In 737, the Tibetans launched an attack against the king of Bru-za (Gilgit), <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> Chinese help, but was ultimately forced {{to pay homage to}} Tibet. In 747, the hold of Tibet was loosened by the campaign of general Gao Xianzhi, who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and Kashmir.|$|E

According to Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta the prince Borghese wanted a list with all mafiosi of Sicily. Calderone and Giuseppe Di Cristina went to Rome and met the prince Borghese. They told Borghese they wouldn’t give him any list and also asked him to manage the trials they were interested in. However, the Mafia decided not to participate and the so-called Golpe Borghese fizzled out in the night of December 8, 1970.|$|E
25|$|The {{demands for}} his {{services}} were {{so much that he}} had to go for help to the Brothers of the Common Life of Windesheim in the Netherlands, who agreed to send him six priests, led by Jean de Bruxelles, and including an interpreter. These, along with Montaigu graduates, he sent to monasteries and bishops <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> help in reforming their priests. They would work by setting an example of a strict ascetic life of prayer and devotion. Many monks began to suspect some order of take-over. Still others began resenting the suggestion they {{did not know how to}} live a holy life, while still others felt that Standonck's approach was too extreme. He had mixed success, and the Dutch brothers returned home. He won some powerful enemies in several prestigious convents, including St Victor.|$|E
25|$|A {{member of}} the patrician gens Valeria, Valerius first came to {{prominence}} in 349 BC when {{he served as a}} military tribune under the consul Lucius Furius Camillus who was on campaign against the Gauls of northern Italy. According to legend, prior to one battle a gigantic Gallic warrior challenged any Roman to single combat, and Valerius, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> and gained the consul’s permission, accepted. As they approached each other, a raven settled on Valerius’ helmet and it distracted the enemy's attention by flying at his face, allowing Valerius to kill the enemy Gaul. The two armies then fought, resulting in the Gallic forces being comprehensively routed, and ending in a decisive Roman victory. As a reward for his courage, Valerius was apparently given a gift of ten oxen and a golden crown, and he was eventually given the agnomen Corvus, which is the Latin term for a raven.|$|E

25|$|The ninth match, and {{the main}} match in the undercard, was between Totally Buffed (Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell) and Goldberg with DeWayne Bruce in a No Disqualification tag-team match, where if Goldberg lost {{he would have had}} to retire. The match started out with Goldberg against Bagwell, where Goldberg had full control of the match. Bruce was then tagged in by Goldberg where he gained an early {{advantage}} over Bagwell for a short time, but was then double teamed by Totally Buffed. Goldberg was then tagged in, where Bagwell gained the upper-hand. Luger then exited the ring and walked up to a fan, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> Goldberg's autograph earlier in the event. This distracted and lured Goldberg near the fan, who sprayed mace into Goldberg's eyes. Luger then lifted Goldberg on his shoulders and Bagwell hit a Super Blockbuster. Luger covered him for the victory, thus ending Goldberg's undefeated streak of thirty-five victories and forcing Goldberg to retire from professional wrestling.|$|E
25|$|Immediately after General Rockey {{accepted}} {{the surrender of}} Japanese forces in the Tientsin area, he left for Chefoo with the 29th Marine Regiment, 6th Division, to investigate conditions at that port. However, when he arrived, Rockey found that Communist troops had already taken control of the city from the Japanese and installed a new mayor. The Communists in Chefoo were not cooperative with the Americans. Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, commander of the United States Navy's 7th Fleet, {{sent a message to}} the Chinese commander requesting that he withdraw his men from Chefoo before the Marines land. Following a conference on October 7, 1945, with the Communist mayor of Chefoo, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> withdrawal terms that were unacceptable to the Americans, Vice Admiral Daniel E. Barbey, commander of VII Amphibious Force (VIIAF), recommended that the landing be postponed. Rockey agreed, so the 29th Marines were ordered to land {{with the rest of the}} 6th Division at Tsingtao on October 11, instead of going in ahead.|$|E
