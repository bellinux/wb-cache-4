40|$|Flow of l iquid crystal {{from one}} {{electrode}} {{to the other}} was observed uring dynamic scattering of a phenyl benzoate nematic liquid crystal. The direction of the flow depended upon the electrochemical properties of dopants. The flow was from cathode to anode when the dopant was an electron acceptor, and vice versa when the dopant was a donor. A redox dopant gave dis-tinctively different d-c dynamic scattering patterns from a salt dopant, and did not give the <b>Williams</b> <b>domain</b> pattern which was observed with a salt dopant. Charge conduction mechanisms through the liquid crystal are dis-cussed {{in terms of the}} electrode reactions of the liquid crystal components and the dopants. Dopants are commonly used to improve the proper-ties of nematic l iquid crystals (LC) for dynamic scattering (DS) displays (1).

40|$|A {{method to}} {{modulate}} the defect modes intensity in a multilayer photonic crystal with a nematic liquid crystal layer arranged midmost has been proposed. The various electrohydrodynamic <b>domain</b> structures (<b>Williams</b> <b>domains,</b> oblique rolls and grid pattern) were {{formed in the}} nematic layer under the action of ac electric field. The domains cause a polarization-sensitive light scattering which leads to an anisotropic reduction of the defect modes intensity.

In addition, the spectrum strongly depends on the light polarization direction above threshold voltage...|$|R

5|$|Liquid crystal {{materials}} {{became a}} focus {{of research in the}} development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a nematic liquid crystal at 125°C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as <b>Williams</b> <b>Domains).</b> This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the para-Azoxyanisole that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116°C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.|$|R

The thermal behaviour of this polymer is very complex and includes four main transitions at 36, 70, 141 and 176 °C, associated with the glass transition, a smectic SC to SA transition, a change from smectic SA to the nematic phase and the isotropization temperature, respectively. Changes in the structure from fan-shaped to focal conic structures confirm the transition from SC to SA {{and the appearance of}} <b>Williams</b> <b>domains</b> confirm the transition from SA to nematic. These observations coincide with the data obtained by X-ray diffraction, in which a shift in the peak at 2 θ = 3. 35 ° is detected.

40|$|In {{this work}} we studied the {{electrohydrodynamics}} instabilities (EHD) {{from a different}} point of view. We used the traditional tools, belonging to the traditional fluid turbulence framework, to the world of liquid crystals. This tools in addition, for the first time, a 3 D scanning of the NLC sample driven in these turbulent regimes, give us some interesting results. As an example a fragmentation of the large scale structures (<b>Williams</b> <b>Domains)</b> whit characteristics similar to the Richardson cascade. We also studied, for the first time, the intensity fluctuation at different depth z inside the sample, and we found a strong non gaussianity in the probability density function of this fluctuation. Further information has been obtained by by studying the decorrelation processes in EHD. We found a local transition between two different regimes: the classical Kolomokorov K 41 law in the y direction, and a random sweeping decorrelation in the opposite x direction. Finally we study the weak localization of light obtained during the EHD. We found a drastic reduction in the scattering mean free path `? and a strong enhancement of the backscattering cone.

40|$|While insulin {{omission}} {{has been}} found to be a common behavior in those with type I diabetes, it has been primarily studied within the context of disordered eating behavior. Previous research supports medical providers and patients lack of comfort in discussing insulin omission. This study was designed to answer two questions. Why do young adult college students with type I diabetes omit insulin? and what factors facilitate and act as barriers to open communication regarding insulin omission in the patient-provider interaction. A total 13 (10 females, 3 males) college students completed a qualitative interview focused on insulin omission and communication of this behavior to medical providers, and 11 of the 13 completed a modified EAT- 26. Using consensual qualitative research methods CQR (Hill, Thompson, & <b>Williams,</b> 1997), <b>domains</b> that emerged were reasons for insulin, predominant reason for insulin omission, motivators to give insulin as prescribed (i. e., adhere), overall communication of insulin omission to medical providers, and factors facilitating and barriers inhibiting communication regarding insulin omission to medical providers. Typical reasons for insulin omission included forgetting or delaying and forgetting, worrying about hypoglycemia and its social implications, being in situations where limited access to food/medical supplies, planning to be physically active, or being unsure of carbohydrate count in food. Insulin omission as a weight loss behavior was not reported by any of the participants during the interviews and all denied using insulin as a way to control their weight or shape on the EAT- 26.

5|$|William {{took over}} an English {{government}} {{that was more}} complex than the Norman system. England was divided into shires or counties, which were further divided into either hundreds or wapentakes. Each shire was administered by a royal official called a sheriff, who roughly had the same status as a Norman viscount. A sheriff was responsible for royal justice and collecting royal revenue. To oversee his expanded <b>domain,</b> <b>William</b> was forced to travel even more than he had as duke. He crossed {{back and forth between the}} continent and England at least 19 times between 1067 and his death. William spent most of his time in England between the Battle of Hastings and 1072, and after that he spent the majority of his time in Normandy. Government was still centred on William's household; when he was in one part of his realms, decisions would be made for other parts of his domains and transmitted through a communication system that made use of letters and other documents. William also appointed deputies who could make decisions while he was absent, especially if the absence was expected to be lengthy. Usually this was a member of William's close family– frequently his half-brother Odo or his wife Matilda. Sometimes deputies were appointed to deal with specific issues.|$|R
40|$|Theoretical, {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} studies involving elastic plate components, weakened by through-the-thickness cracks {{and subjected to}} loading parallel to {{the plane of the}} plate, are often based on plane stress or plane strain simplifications. These simplifications essentially reduce the dimensionality of the physical three-dimensional problem and enable the achievement of effective analytical and numerical solutions for many important practical problems. The influence of various three-dimensional effects, such as the variation of stresses across the plate thickness, effects of the three-dimensional corner (vertex) singularities and coupling of fracture modes II and III, on the deformation and stresses near the crack front are at present largely ignored or viewed as negligible for all practical purposes. As a result of this view, the outcomes of experimental studies and fracture tests are also commonly analysed {{within the framework of the}} plane theories of elasticity. Nevertheless, a number of theoretical and experimental studies over the past two decades have demonstrated that the predictions made within these theories can be unsatisfactory and the effect of three-dimensional stress states at the crack front on deformation, fatigue and fracture of plate components can be significant. This thesis aims to elucidate the role of three-dimensional stress states in the deformation, fracture and fatigue phenomena further. The main outcomes of this thesis are: (1) the development and validation of a simplified method for the evaluation of the fatigue crack front shapes and their effect on the steady-state fatigue crack growth rates in plate components; (2) investigation of the effect of three-dimensional corner (vertex) singularities on the stress intensities and displacement field near the crack front; and (3) development and validation of a new experimental approach for the evaluation of mode I and mode II stress intensity factors from the measurement of the out-of-plane displacements in the near crack tip region, which are affected by three-dimensional effects, and, in particular, by the 3 D corner (vertex) singularity. This new research is important in many engineering contexts. For example, the new theoretical model, which takes into account the actual shape of the crack front, can be utilised in advanced fatigue life calculations, as well as in failure investigations. The latter is possible as the shape of the fatigue crack front can now be related to the parameters of fatigue loading. The new experimental approach developed in this thesis can be useful in fracture characterisation of thick plate components with through-cracks. This approach specifically addresses the situation when the Kdominance zone, or <b>William’s</b> solution convergence <b>domain,</b> are relatively small. In this case, the data extraction region can be affected by the three-dimensional stress states leading to significant errors in the evaluation of the stress intensity factors when using traditional approaches. This thesis is presented in the form of a compendium of published papers that are the summation of the research undertaken by the author. The five articles which form the main body of the thesis are united by a common theme, which is the investigation of three-dimensional effects near the crack front on stresses and displacements, fracture and fatigue phenomena. Two appendices are also included; they represent a compilation of the candidate’s publications related to the main topic of the thesis. Thesis (Ph. D.)
