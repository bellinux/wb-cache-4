Kennan found his ambassadorship in Belgrade to be much improved from his experiences in Moscow a decade earlier. He commented, [...] "I was favored in being surrounded {{with a group of}} exceptionally able and loyal assistants, whose abilities I myself admired, whose judgment I valued, and whose attitude toward myself was at all times... enthusiastically cooperative... Who <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> complain?" [...] Kennan found the Yugoslav government treated the American diplomats politely, in contrast from {{the way in which the}} Russians treated him in Moscow. He wrote that the Yugoslavs [...] "considered me, rightly or wrongly, a distinguished person in the U.S., and they were pleased that someone whose name they had heard before was being sent to Belgrade".|$|E

The album's lead single, [...] "The Fear of Being Alone" [...] reached No. two on the country charts, and its further two singles ("How <b>Was</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> Know" [...] and [...] "I'd Rather Ride Around with You") reached No. 1 and No. 2 respectively. The release garnered higher critical acclaim than Starting Over, with Thom Owens of Allmusic calling the album [...] "nevertheless an excellent reminder of her deep talents as a vocalist". MCA Nashville chairman Bruce Hinton told Billboard how pleased he was with McEntire's release, calling the album's ten tracks [...] "powerful" [...] and concluding by stating, [...] "There are so many writers and so many great songs in Nashville, and Reba has collected her disproportionate shareShe's country music's female artist of the 90's."

500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many {{noting that the}} Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was [...] "one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [...] {{one of the better}} episodes from the last couple of seasons." [...] Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that [...] "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction – and hope that maybe the series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8." [...] Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that [...] "A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?" [...] Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it’s fair to say that The Office is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'." [...] TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars. Despite praising the episode for coming [...] "together {{as one of the best}} Office episodes of the season," [...] he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it [...] "not funny." [...] The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode [...] "solid" [...] and noted [...] "While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show." [...] He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10. Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season. What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [...] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we've been waiting for all season." ...|$|E

He appeared on the BBC's Wogan show, hosted by Terry Wogan, an event which McAvennie claims changed his life and introduced him to a celebrity lifestyle. He is quoted as saying [...] "Then I signed for West Ham and money and girls were thrown at me and, hey, who <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> say no? Then I went on Wogan and it really took off. I was never under any illusions why it was happening. It wisnae because of my looks, it was because I was a footballer." ...|$|E

"This feeling led me {{into the}} excess of being very rude to that zealous and most {{charitable}} man, Mr. Spencer, {{when he came to}} Oxford in January, 1840, to get Anglicans to set about praying for Unity. I myself then, or soon after, drew up such prayers; {{it was one of the}} first thoughts which came upon me after my shock, but I was too much annoyed with the political action of the members of the Roman Church in England to wish to have anything to do with them personally. So glad in my heart <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> see him when he came to my rooms, whither Mr. Palmer of Magdalen brought him, that I could have laughed for joy; I think I did; but I was very rude to him, I would not meet him at dinner, and that, (though I did not say so,) because I considered him [...] " [...] in loco apostatx [...] " [...] from the Anglican Church, and I hereby beg his pardon for it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 1945, Maria Antonescu {{was taken}} into custody by the Soviet {{occupation}} forces, and, like her husband before her, was transported into Soviet territory, where she was only interrogated once. They were not told of each other, even though their cells at Moscow's Lubyanka are said to have shared a wall. Maria Antonescu returned in April 1946, {{at the same time as}} her husband. She was submitted to interrogations by Interior Ministry Secretary, Romanian Communist Party member and public investigator Avram Bunaciu, who recorded her views on Antonescu's political choices. Part of the inquiry focused on Maria Antonescu's own involvement. When asked about her support for a war of aggression, which Bunaciu defined as [...] "a war of plunder", she replied: [...] "When I started [...] there was no war. What <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> do? Not to keep going? I originally started because of all the misery in the Romanian land." [...] She denied accusations of having participated in extortion, but admitted to having received funds from Lecca, and replied that she had never considered providing aid to Transnistrian deportees because Jews had [...] "enough funds", and denied knowledge that Jews had been imprisoned in concentration camps.|$|E
