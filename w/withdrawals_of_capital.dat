50|$|Neighborhood {{disinvestment}} is {{a systematic}} <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and neglect <b>of</b> public services by the city. Public services may include schools; building, street, and park maintenance; garbage collection and transportation. Absentee landlordism and mortgage redlining also characterize disinvestment. As redlining prevents households from owning, {{they have no}} choice but to rent from landlords that neglect property and charge high rent. These factors allow the devalorization cycle to occur in a neighborhood, eventually leading to the reclamation and transformation of the neighborhood, uprooting the poor residents who have no equity to use for relocation.|$|R

Rollover, converted (before age 59½) contributions held in a Roth IRA may be withdrawn tax and penalty-free after 5 years. Distributions from a Roth IRA do not increase Adjusted Gross Income. This differs from a traditional IRA, where all withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, and a penalty applies for withdrawals before age 59½. (Even capital gains on stocks or other securities held in a regular taxable account-so {{long as they are}} held for at least a year-are generally treated more advantageously than traditional IRA withdrawals, being taxed not as Ordinary Income, but at the lower Long-Term Capital Gain rate.) This potentially higher tax rate for <b>withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> gains from a traditional IRA is a quid pro quo for the deduction taken against ordinary income when putting money into the IRA.|$|E
40|$|The basic {{features}} of financial intermediation - asymmetric information and liquidity transformation - {{have not changed}} along history. In an intermediated financial system, the asymmetric information between investors and intermediaries can cause <b>withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> even {{in the presence of}} good investments. It is the combination of asymmetric information and illiquidity that gives rise to the possibility of a banking crisis, a situation whereby all depositors want their cash back. A securities-based financial system has the same attributes as the classic banking business model. Providing liquidity in securities markets by buying relatively illiquid securities and selling more liquid securities is the same risky activity as banking. Therefore, a security crisis is associated with an increase in demand for liquidity, or more liquid securities. This puts strain on the balance sheets of those intermediaries who provide liquidity in securities markets: their assets fall in value, including sovereign bonds of troubled countries, and their liabilities increase in value. To restore their own financial equilibrium, those intermediaries sell their assets in a situation where buyers are relatively fewer. Securities prices fall further, and this causes the “panic”, the “flight to quality”, the “run”, or whatever one chooses to call it. Short term credit dries up, including the normally straightforward repurchase agreement (“the run on repo”), interbank lending, and commercial paper markets. This panic is usually followed by a very sharp recession. The chapter also deals with the argument if financial crises are predictable by the usual economic models, or they are rare unpredictable phenomena (black swans), and finally the extension of the global crisis to the European sovereign debt and banking sector is shortly analyzed...|$|E
40|$|The large {{reserves}} of East Asian central banks {{have received a}} great deal of attention (Aizenmann and Marion (2002)). Some observers consider that these have made regional finances more robust and better able to weather sudden <b>withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> Others have criticised the reserves as low-yielding external assets that are accumulated at the expense of higher-yielding domestic investment. Others worry that exchange rate management that gives rise to the reserves might result in investment in the traded goods sector that will prove wasteful if exchange rates subsequently appreciate. Less attention has been paid to the financing of the reserve build-up. The financing, or sterilisation, of the foreign exchange reserve build-up has presented an opportunity for bond market development, but policy has not made the most of this opportunity. While the interest bearing debts issued by central banks to finance the reserve build-up have added to the sum of public debts outstanding, they have generally also segmented that market into government debt per se and central bank debt. While from a macroeconomic standpoint this choice seems innocent, from a market development standpoint it has serious drawbacks. This paper starts by considering the alternatives faced by a central bank in financing large holdings of foreign exchange reserves. These choices are ranked, with use of government securities in the first position. Then the transactions needed to use government securities to finance reserves when these are held by the central bank are outlined. Then the benefits of this approach are adduced and the issues that must be faced are discussed. These include the attitude of the government and the rating agencies above all, and the practical questions of the return to be paid to the government for its deposit at the central bank, the duration of the extra government debt and consistency with the government budgetary process. This proposal was originally made with reference to East Asia, especially Indonesia, Korea...|$|E

The investment of firms that depend on convertible debt for financing responds positively to flows into convertible arbitrage hedge funds.

At the same time, convertible arbitrage strategy returns are uncorrelated with the stock returns of convertible dependent firms.

We also examine an isolated market dislocation that occurred in 2005 when funds suffered large withdrawals. Though the macroeconomic outlook was positive and stable, dependent firms sharply cut their investment in response to the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> with the overall reduction in capital expenditures amounting to 55 % of outflows.

40|$|In {{this article}} I ask why leading {{institutions}} of global capitalism {{have begun to}} take activist stances against homophobia, and why {{they have done so}} now.

Positioning themselves as external to the problem they seek to alleviate, IFIs are able to cast themselves as progressive forces in a greater moral struggle at precisely the historical moment in which austerity and capitalist crisis threaten to bring them into ever greater disrepute. Through a critical survey of recent IFI initiatives on homophobia, I attempt to delineate the emerging contours of what I call ‘global homocapitalism’...|$|R

50|$|Michael E. Edleson and Paul S. Marshall {{argue that}} Value Averaging can provide for an {{increased}} {{rate of return}} when compared to dollar cost averaging and other investment techniques. Professor Edleson recommends a VA period of three years. He suggests an infusion or <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> every three or six months. For example, {{if one were to}} win or be bequeathed one million dollars, roughly 8.33 percent, with the exact amount being set by the formula, could be invested every quarter.

Opponents argue that this misses the opportunity of already being fully invested when a large market upswing occurs. This argument against value averaging and dollar cost averaging and in favor of lump sum investing ignores the suggestion of Ben Stein and Phil DeMuth that it is more important to avoid a large market downswing, which is theoretically equally possible, since market movements are essentially unpredictable. Participating early on in a large market downswing has been shown to be devastating to the success of long term retirement, for example.|$|R

50|$|Capital {{controls}} are measures imposed by a state's government aimed at managing capital account transactions - in other words, capital market transactions {{where one of}} the counter-parties involved is in a foreign country. Whereas domestic regulatory authorities try to ensure that capital market participants trade fairly with each other, and sometimes to ensure institutions like banks don't take excessive risks, capital controls aim to ensure that the macroeconomic effects <b>of</b> the <b>capital</b> markets don't have a net negative impact on the nation in question. Most advanced nations like to use capital controls sparingly if at all, as in theory allowing markets freedom is a win-win situation for all involved: investors are free to seek maximum returns, and countries can benefit from investments that will develop their industry and infrastructure. However, sometimes capital market transactions can have a net negative effect - for example, in a financial crisis, there can be a mass <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> leaving a nation without sufficient foreign currency to pay for needed imports. On the other hand, if too much capital is flowing into a country, it can push up inflation and the value of the nation's currency, making its exports uncompetitive. Some nations such as India have also used capital controls to ensure that their citizens' money is invested at home, rather than abroad.|$|R

Once a crisis hits, the traditional IMF policy of austerity may not work and may in fact worsen the crisis. It is also possible that an economy at the border of equilibrium may be thrown into disequilibrium if any of the restrictive policies are pursued. The instability is rooted in the formation of market perception of risk associated with tradable short-term assets. Perceived risk makes asset demand functions nonlinear, which is instrumental in determining whether financial markets are stable, and if a stable economy eventually returns to equilibrium when subjected to a financial shock. ...|$|R

Apparently, some of the measures proposed during the US election campaign by the president elect, such as financial market deregulation, economic stimulus, tax cuts and infrastructure are expected to support the economy in the US and beyond. However, this stimulus bears considerable risks already for the near future: other economies could face considerable problems due to a further appreciation of the dollar, rising financing costs and the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> towards the US. • In the euro area, as monetary policy continues its expansive course, financing costs will stay very low in 2017, and fiscal policy will be mildly expansive, although a bit less so than in 2016.
