25|$|Although High Scawdel stands east of {{the main}} summit, the high ground takes a great loop to the south around the head of Newlands Beck. It then drives north to the {{depression}} at Wilson's Bield (1,655ft) before climbing to the summit of High Spy. The rest of the North Western Fells bear no tarns worthy of the name, but Dale Head has two. On the northern slope near the source of Newlands Beck is Dalehead Tarn, while the smaller Launchy Tarn lies {{near the top of}} High Scawdel. Dalehead Tarn is a shallow pool providing a popular stopping place for walkers. Its varied flora include <b>water</b> <b>horsetail,</b> sedge and bogbean. Launchy Tarn is smaller and may have been formed by overgrazing and erosion of the underlying peat.|$|E
25|$|Pine forests (with Pinus sylvestris) are {{the most}} {{widespread}} and occupy 51% of the forested area of the Karelian Isthmus, followed by spruce forests (with Picea abies, 29%) and birch forests (with Betula pendula and B. pubescens, 16%). Stands on more fertile soils and in more favorable locations are occasionally dominated by Norway maple, black alder, grey alder, common aspen, English oak, grey willow, dark-leaved willow, tea-leaved willow, small-leaved lime or European white elm. Common vegetation of various types of pine forests includes heather, crowberry, common juniper, eared willow, lingonberry, <b>water</b> <b>horsetail,</b> bracken, graminoids (i.e. grasses in the wider sense) Avenella flexuosa and Carex globularis, mosses Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum angustifolium and S. russowii, and lichens Cladonia spp. Prominent in various spruce forests are wood horsetail, common wood sorrel, bilberry, lingonberry, graminoids Avenella flexuosa, Calamagrostis arundinacea, Carex globularis, and mosses Polytrichum commune and Sphagnum girgensohnii. Prominent vegetation of various birch forests include meadowsweet, common wood sorrel, bilberry and graminoids Calamagrostis arundinacea and C. canescens.|$|E
25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous cover policy (rather than clear felling and restocking). Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Corsican pine and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and broadleaved woodland, mainly oak, sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including fly agaric, stinkhorns, honey fungus and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed, while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including amphibious bistort, water mint, <b>Water</b> <b>Horsetail</b> and common spikerush.|$|E
50|$|The {{ridgeline}} in {{this area}} had a permanent covering or cap of firn. When this firn cap melted, it formed small lakes in the hollows which had no drainage. In the warm period that followed the glacial period, vegetation grew {{on the shores of}} these <b>waters.</b> Reeds and <b>horsetails</b> produced the first humus and initiated the formation of peat. Meanwhile, falling deciduous leaves, pollen and grass collected in the waters. The pollen trapped in the fen still enables today, after thousands of years, an accurate determination of the then prevailing vegetation and the climate.|$|R

50|$|Equisetum fluviatile, the <b>water</b> <b>horsetail</b> or swamp horsetail, is a {{vascular}} plant that commonly grows in dense colonies along freshwater shorelines or {{in shallow water}} in ponds, swamps, ditches, and other sluggish or still waters with mud bottoms. It is a perennial herbaceous species, growing 30-100 cm (rarely 140 cm) tall with erect dark green stems 2-8 mm in diameter, smooth, with about 10-30 fine ridges. At each joint, the stem has a whorl of tiny, black-tipped scale leaves 5-10 mm long. Many, but not all, stems also have whorls of short ascending and spreading branches 1-5 cm long, with the longest branches on the lower middle of the stem. The side branches are slender, dark green, and have 1-8 nodes with a whorl of five scale leaves at each node.

Great spearwort, Ranunculus lingua, a rarity in north-east England, is still found, but a number of other uncommon species have been lost in recent years, among them narrow-leaved water-parsnip, Berula erecta, water dropwort, Oenanthe fistulosa, and fringed water-lily, Nymphoides peltata.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} many old and over-mature trees, and {{extensive}} dead wood {{which provides a}} habitat for invertebrates, including the nationally rare jewel beetle Agrilus pannonicus. This type of canopy is uncommon nationally and very scarce in Greater London. The main trees are sessile oak and beech, with a few pedunculate oaks and wild service trees. The shrub layer is dominated by holly and rowan. Next to Ken Wood is a small valley which has soft-rush, six sphagnum species and <b>water</b> <b>horsetail.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>water</b> <b>horsetail</b> has {{historically}} been used by both Europeans and Native Americans for scouring, sanding, and filing {{because of the high}} silica content in the stems. Early spring shoots were eaten. Medically it was used by the ancient Greeks and Romans to stop bleeding and treat kidney ailments, ulcers, and tuberculosis, and by the ancient Chinese to treat superficial visual obstructions. Rootstocks and stems are sometimes eaten by waterfowl. Horsetails absorb heavy metals from the soil, and are often used in bioassays for metals.|$|E
50|$|Freshwater marshes {{exist in}} many places around the shore but {{extensive}} reed-beds stretching out into the lake are rare. The margins of the marshes are mostly sedge dominated by such species as bottle sedge, bladder-sedge, tufted-sedge, common-sedge and occasionally water-sedge, <b>water</b> <b>horsetail,</b> marsh cinquefoil and bur-reeds also occur commonly. Also on the fringes occurs a more varied community characteristic of base-poor areas, with such species as marsh ragwort, lesser spearwort, devils-bit scaboius, marsh bedstraw and hoary willowherb, creeping bent, sweet vernal-grass, Yorkshire fog and purple moor-grass.

50|$|The Weesener Bach, {{also called}} the Lutterbach, is a {{tributary}} of the river Örtze in northern Germany. It rises in the Südheide Nature Park, south of the village of Lutterloh near Unterlüß, then flows through the Hermannsburg village of Weesen and enters the Örtze north of Hermannsburg after about 10.5 km. The source of the stream lies at 84 m above sea level, its mouth is 54 m above sea level, giving a height difference of 30 metres. Originally the Weesener Bach emerged from a bog region. Most of this was converted into ponds. The ponds have become overgrown in many areas with <b>Water</b> <b>Horsetail.</b> The entire course of the stream together with the banks either side, a total of 348 ha, was declared a nature reserve in 1999. As a result, an almost natural, totally healthy stream has been preserved, whose water quality, apart from its upper course near the source ponds, is of the highest category, I-II, and only slightly polluted. Due to its high water quality, the stream is home to a multitude of rare animals. Amongst the fish that thrive here are Brown Trout, Bullhead and Brook Lamprey. In 1987, 176 species of animals were recorded here, of which 36 were on the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species. Along the banks and water meadows there are 60 more endangered species, such as vascular plants, mosses, amphibians and reptiles. Even the Kingfisher lives here.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master’s thesis was {{to study}} the {{feasibility}} of different pattern recognition techniques for classification of wetland vegetation and ground cover from SAR images. Use of pattern recognition and remote sensing techniques provides an efficient and fast way to survey large areas of earth’s surface without time consuming and difficult field studies. Utilization of SAR-technology enables monitoring of the area regardless of time or weather conditions unlike passive radiometers operating in visible light spectrum. The thesis {{is part of the}} biosphere modelling project of Posiva Oy, the instance responsible for spent nuclear fuel disposal of the nuclear power plant in Olkiluoto. The test data for the classification algorithms consisted of a SAR image obtained from Lake Poosjärvi on 4 th of July 2014. Lake Poosjärvi is a small (area of 794 hectares) lake located {{in the western part of}} Finland in the Satakunta region. Forest type at Lake Poosjärvi is mainly mixed forest, and ground vegetation is dominated by sedges, <b>water</b> <b>horsetail,</b> water lilies, pondweeds and reed. Seven classes were used in classification: reed, reed in water, <b>water</b> <b>horsetail,</b> water, trees, sedge and yellow water lily. In the thesis, the feasibility of four different classification algorithms was studied: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron ensemble and K-Nearest Neighbor. Features used in classification were selected from image processing and remote sensing literature. It was found, that the classification methods used in the thesis were applicable to the task, and that texture-based features had significant positive im-pact on classification results. The best classification results were achieved using the Multilayer Perceptron ensemble classifier, though Random Forest and Support Vector Machine produced good results as well. The question whether the classifiers were classifying the test data according to the properties of soil, ground cover or vegetation, remains open...|$|E
40|$|Plants (macrophytes) {{growing in}} lake and wetland sediments are known {{mediators}} {{of greenhouse gases}} (GHG), specifically methane (CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Current studies have emphasized the potential risk of underestimation regarding emissions of plant-mediated GHGs from terrestrial systems including lakes, streams and other freshwater bodies. In order to differentiate the possible sources and sinks of atmospheric carbon and nitrogen in aquatic environments, this study aims to investigate the spatial variability of GHG fluxes in stands of common wetland macrophytes. Field samplings were {{carried out in the}} summer of 2012 where 24 -hour diel measurements were conducted with the static chamber method in a boreal lake in south western Sweden. Two macrophyte communities were studied; one mixed-species stand and one species-specific stand of <b>water</b> <b>horsetail</b> (Equisetum fluviatile). Spatial variability was confirmed at several stages, both between and within stands. The species-specific stand emitted more CH 4 than the mixed stand, from 0. 17 to 8. 99 mmol m- 2 h- 1, compared to 0. 63 – 1. 95 mmol m- 2 h- 1 maximum measured. Within stand variability was confirmed as variable CH 4 flux per strand of E. fluviatile was established. No significant differences were observed regarding CO 2 and N 2 O, other than weak correlation in diel patterns, e. g. daytime uptake and night time respiration/emission for both gases...|$|E
40|$|General Description: The {{leaves are}} {{strongly}} papillose on upper surface, involute (edges rolled back), and glaucous (waxy); the widest leaf blades are 1 / 16 to 1 / 8 inch wide; the culms are round or very obtusely trigonous (3 -angled), and smooth below the inflorescence; long, creeping rhizomes are present. Identification Tips: Carex rostrata and C. utriculata differ conspicuously in their leaves and flowers spikes. C. rostrata leaves are narrow, inrolled, strongly glaucous, {{and have the}} stomata on the upper blade surface. Leaf blades of C. utriculata are broader, bright green, and have stomata on the lower surface. The fruiting spikes of C. rostrata are more slender than those of C. utriculata. C. rostrata is currently restricted to the NE part of WA, while C. utriculata has a much broader distribution. Phenology: Flowers and fruits in July and August. Range: Alaska, most of Canada, and northern portions of the United States. In WA, it is currently restricted to the northeast, in the Okanogan Highlands physiographic province. Habitat: Quaking or floating peat in association with slender sedge (C. lasiocarpa) along lake shoreline. Other associated species include mud sedge (Carex limosa), bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), pink elephants (Pedicularis groenlandica), great sundew (Drosera anglica), many-spiked cottongrass (Eriophorum polystachion), yellow pond lily (Nuphar polysepalum) and <b>water</b> <b>horsetail</b> (Equisetum fluviatile). Elevation 4500 - 5000 feet. C. utriculata grows in shallow water on firm substrate with water sedge (C. aquatilis).
