It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to <b>weld</b> <b>iron</b> and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E

[...] "Max, can't you understand? It isn't that. Max, {{if you would}} only work at something. That is why the Yankees beat us.

6000|$|So {{much for}} the master's motto, [...] "Every man in his place." [...] Next for the laborer's motto, [...] "Every man his chance." [...] Let us mend that for them a little, and say, [...] "Every man his certainty"--certainty, {{that if he does}} well, he will be honored, and aided, and {{advanced}} in such degree as may be fitting for his faculty and consistent with his peace; and equal certainty that if he does ill, he will by sure justice be judged, and by sure punishment be chastised; if it may be, corrected; and if that may not be, condemned. That is the right reading of the Republican motto, [...] "Every man his chance." [...] And then, with such a system of government, pure, watchful and just, you may approach your great problem of national education, or in other words, of national employment. For all education begins in work. What we think, or what we know; or what we believe, is in the end, of little consequence. The only thing of consequence is what we do; and for man, woman, or child, the first point of education is to make them do their best. It is the law of good economy {{to make the best of}} everything. How much more to make the best of every creature! Therefore, when your pauper comes to you and asks for bread, ask of him instantly--What faculty have you? What can you do best? Can you drive a nail into wood? Go and mend the parish fences. Can you lay a brick? Mend the walls of the cottages where the wind comes in. Can you lift a spadeful of earth? Turn this field up three feet deep all over. Can you only drag a weight with your shoulders? Stand at the bottom of this hill and help up the overladen horses. Can you <b>weld</b> <b>iron</b> and chisel stone? Fortify this wreck-strewn coast into a harbor; and change these shifting sands into fruitful ground. Wherever death was, bring life; that is to be your work; that your parish refuge; that your education. So and no otherwise can we meet existent distress. But for the continual education of the whole people, and for their future happiness, they must have such consistent employment as shall develop all the powers of the fingers, and the limbs, and the brain: and that development is only to be obtained by hand-labor, of which you have these four great divisions--hand-labor on the earth, hand-labor on the sea, hand-labor in art, hand-labor in war. Of the last two of these I cannot speak to-night, and of the first two only with extreme brevity.|$|E

50|$|According to Vagn Fabritius Buchwald, wustite was an {{important}} component during the Iron age to facilitate the process of forge welding. In ancient times, when blacksmithing was performed using a charcoal forge, the deep charcoal pit in which the steel or iron was placed provided a highly-reducing, virtually oxygen-free environment, producing a thin wustite layer on the metal. At the welding temperature, the iron becomes highly reactive with oxygen, and will spark and form thick layers of slag when exposed to the air, which makes welding the iron or steel nearly impossible. To solve this problem, ancient blacksmiths would toss small amounts of sand onto the white-hot metal. The silicon in the sand then reacts with the wustite to form fayalite, which melts just below the welding temperature. This produced an effective flux that shielded the metal from oxygen and helped extract oxides and impurities, leaving a pure surface that can weld readily. Although the ancients {{had no knowledge of}} how this worked, the ability to <b>weld</b> <b>iron</b> contributed to the movement out of the Bronze age and into the modern.|$|E

Essentially, a chemical mixture was injected directly under pressure into the hot exhausts of the motor torpedo boats and other small craft or the hot interior surface of the funnels of destroyers. The larger ships each had <b>welded</b> <b>iron</b> contraptions, {{in the region of}} ten feet in height, hastily assembled at Chatham. These were fed with solid cakes of phosphide of calcium. Dropped into a bucket-like container full of water, the resulting smoke and flames roared up a chimney and were dispersed by a windmill arrangement. It was more toxic than its predecessor. Taking in a lungful was an extremely unpleasant experience.|$|R

5000|$|His most noted {{work was}} {{a base of}} <b>welded</b> <b>iron</b> {{supporting}} a silver krater.

Perhaps it is this passage that has led Meyer and others into the mistake of explaining κόλλησις as that kind of engraving on steel which is now called damascene work.

40|$|When gas-tungsten arc <b>welded,</b> <b>iron</b> {{aluminides}} form {{a coarse}} fusion zone microstructure which {{is susceptible to}} hydrogen cracking. Magnetic arc oscillation and weld pool inoculation were implemented to refine the fusion zone microstructure in iron aluminide alloy FA- 129 weldments. Magnetic arc oscillation effectively refined the fusion zone microstructure, and slow strain rate tensile tests showed fine-grained microstructures to be less susceptible to hydrogen cracking. However, magnetic arc oscillation {{was found to be}} suitable only for well-controlled fabrication environments. Weld pool inoculation offers a potentially more robust refinement method. Titanium inoculation was also shown to effectively refined the fusion zone microstructure, but weldment properties were not improved using this refinement method. The effect of titanium on the size, shape and distribution of the second phase particles in the fusion zone appears to be the cause of the observed decrease in weldment properties...|$|R
