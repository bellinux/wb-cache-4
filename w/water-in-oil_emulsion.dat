This results in an emulsion consisting of a closely packed [...] "foam" [...] of oil droplets.

40|$|AbstractThe {{measurement}} of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy used in situ is a suitable technique for {{the characterization of}} oil and <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>emulsions.</b> Nyquist diagrams for dehydrated oils are characterized by the formation of one semi-circle. The equivalent circuit proposed for the dehydrated oil is a resistance and capacitor (ROCO) in parallel. The resistance and conductivity of the oil calculated by impedance were 2. 96 Gohm and 486 nSm− 1, respectively. Nyquist diagrams for {{the system composed of}} water emulsions in oil are mainly characterized by two semi-circles with different relaxation for oil and <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>emulsions.</b> The equivalent circuit is formed by RO and CPEO in parallel and in series with the arrangement of RW/O and CPEW/O in parallel, where RO and CPEO represents the oil, and RW/O and CPEW/O represents <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>emulsions.</b> The resistance of oil (RO) and <b>water-in-oil</b> (RW/O) <b>emulsions</b> increase with the increasing amount of water in the preparation. The increase in resistance shows that the emulsions become more stable with the addition of water. This result is consistent with the formation of rigid films on water–oil interfaces.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine a batch microwave process of 2450 MHz in demulsification of water-oil- (w/o) emulsions as well as the effect of triton X- 100 and Low Sulfur Wax Residue (LSWR) from synthesized (w/o) emulsions stability and demulsification. Oil exploitation is always accompanied by the non-desired formation of emulsions caused by the presence of naturally occurring surface-active molecules such as asphaltenes and resins. Because their presence stabilizes the oil/water interface, it is necessary to break emulsions by adding other surface-active molecules. In this study, a microwave demulsification method was utilized in a 50 - 50 % and 20 - 80 % of <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>emulsions</b> with varied microwave exposure time.

40|$|Both {{series of}} {{monoglyceride}} gels samples with different monoglyceride concentration of two monoglycerides C 14 and C 16 / 18 and series of <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>emulsions</b> {{that differ from}} flocculation, water concentration and biopolymer have been investigated by means of PFG NMR.

For the monoglyceride gels a return-to-the-origin probability, the average surface-to-volume ratio of the pore space {{as well as the}} tortuosity and dimensionality of the network could be calculated on the basis of echo attenuation and diffusion curves. Additionally pore size distributions have been determined for the monoglyceride gels. The results verify a postulated crystallisation process for monoglyceride gels and were validated by CryoSEM images and image analysis. The PFG NMR findings of the <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>emulsions</b> have been fitted with four various models which were developed {{in the context of this}} thesis and assume different diffusion behaviour of the water molecules. All models show individual deficits as the real movement of water molecules in the <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>emulsions</b> is more complex than assumed. Non flocculated and flocculated emulsions could be characterised and the droplet and aggregate size as well as the effective diffusion coefficient could be calculated.

40|$|<b>Water-in-oil</b> (W/O) <b>emulsions</b> {{consist of}} water {{droplets}} dispersed in continuous oil phase. They are encountered {{at various stages}} of oil production. The oil produced from an oil-well usually carries {{a significant amount of}} water in the form of droplets. In enhanced oil recovery techniques involving the injection of polymer solution, the aqueous phase of the <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>emulsions</b> produced from the oil well consists of polymeric additive. A good understanding of the flow behavior of emulsions in pipelines is essential for the design and operation of oil production-gathering facilities and emulsion pipelines. A number of studies have been reported on simultaneous flow of oil and water in pipelines. However, the studies reported in the literature are mainly focused on either oil-water flow patterns and separated flows (annular and stratified flow of oil and water phases) or oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion flows. The pipeline flow of <b>water-in-oil</b> (W/O) <b>emulsions</b> has received less attention. Also, little work has been carried out on the effect of additives such as polymer. In this study, new experimental results are presented on the pipeline flow behavior of <b>water-in-oil</b> (W/O) <b>emulsions,</b> with and without the presence of polymeric additive in the aqueous phase. The emulsions were prepared from three different oils, namely EDM- 244, EDM-Monarch, and Shell Pella of different viscosities (2. 5 mPa. s for EDM- 244, 6 mPa. s for EDM-Monarch, and 5. 4 mPa. s for Shell Pella, at 25 0 C). The <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>emulsions</b> prepared from EDM- 244 and EDM-Monarch (without any polymeric additive in the dispersed aqueous phase) exhibited drag reduction behavior in turbulent flow. The turbulent friction factor data of the emulsions fell well below the standard Blasius equation for smooth pipes. The <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>emulsions</b> prepared from EDM- 244 exhibited stronger drag reduction as compared with the EDM-Monarch emulsions. The Shell Pella emulsions (w/o type) did not exhibit any drag reduction in turbulent flow; the friction factor data followed the Blasius equation. The Shell Pella emulsions were more stable than the EDM- 244 and EDM-Monarch emulsions. When left unstirred, the EDM- 244 and EDM-Monarch emulsions quickly coalesced into separate oil and water phases whereas the Shell Pella emulsions took significantly longer time to separate into oil and water phases. The Shell Pella oil emulsions were also milkier than the EDM emulsions. The addition of polymer to the dispersed aqueous phase of <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>emulsions</b> had a significant effect on the turbulent drag reduction behavior. Emulsions were less drag reducing when polymer was present in the aqueous droplets. The effect of surfactant on the pipeline flow behavior of water/oil emulsions was also investigated. The surfactant-stabilized <b>water-in-oil</b> <b>emulsions</b> followed the single phase flow behavior. The presence of surfactant in the emulsions caused the dispersed droplets to become significantly smaller. It is believed that the droplets were smaller than the scale of turbulence when surfactant was present and consequently no drag reduction was observed...|$|R
