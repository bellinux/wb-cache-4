500|$|The device's [...] LCD has a 1280×800-pixels resolution, {{giving it}} a density of 216 pixels per inch (PPI). Its IPS display enables a <b>wide</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> (178°) without {{significant}} color distortion, and enhances color reproduction. The tablet's thin, lightweight form factor was achieved without sacrificing computer power through a special LCD design called Asus TruVivid. The LCD panel uses a [...] "one-glass" [...] solution and a non-traditional lamination technique. Tablet touchscreens typically comprise four pieces of glass—two that sandwich the liquid crystal, a touch sensor glass, and a protective glass—whereas the Asus TruVivid design fuses the protective and sensor glass, with the sensor attached as a film. The conventional lamination technique for touchscreens involves air bonding, in which the glass layers are glued around the edges, leaving air in between; Asus used a [...] "full lamination" [...] technique, in which the glass layers are fused by adhesive with no air between. This yielded thinner display panels, but made production more difficult, as there was less tolerance for imprecision without affecting {{the quality of the}} screen. The tablet's display is protected by a layer of Corning Fit Glass.|$|E

50|$|It {{achieved}} pixel response {{which was}} fast for its time, <b>wide</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>angles,</b> and high contrast {{at the cost}} of brightness and color reproduction. Modern MVA panels can offer <b>wide</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>angles</b> (second only to S-IPS technology), good black depth, good color reproduction and depth, and fast response times due to the use of RTC (Response Time Compensation) technologies. When MVA panels are viewed off-perpendicular, colors will shift, but much less than for TN panels.|$|R
50|$|Display: 12.5 in 1366x768 (HD) resolution, {{optionally}} IPS (<b>wide</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>angles).</b> The X220 was {{the first}} non-tablet X series to have an IPS screen option.|$|R

5000|$|Reflected Color {{under an}} Angle - as a {{reflected}} light source is reflected from the glazing under a shallow angle, some anti-reflective coatings may cause the reflected color to shift.

50|$|Each has its {{pros and}} cons. Front {{projection}} and plasma displays have a <b>wide</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> (nearly 180 degrees) {{so they may}} be best for a home theater with a wide seating arrangement. Rear projection screens do not perform well in daylight or well-lit rooms and so are only suitable for darker viewing areas.|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} {{applications of}} universal modeling systems MOUSE-LCD {{for the development}} of new LCDs with high contrast and <b>wide</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>angles</b> are presented. The software enables to combine LCDs both with uni and biaxial phase retardation plates as well as to use double cell configuration for the purpose of optimization. Any type of the director distribution inside LC cell with arbitrary (nonsymmetric) tilts and twist angles can be taken into account. The wideness of <b>viewing</b> <b>angles</b> can be estimated using equi-contrast ratio and equi-transmission curves for various angles of light incidence.

50|$|Initial {{iterations}} of IPS technology were characterised by slow {{response time}} and a low contrast ratio but later revisions have made marked improvements to these shortcomings. Because of its <b>wide</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> and accurate color reproduction (with almost no off-angle color shift), IPS is widely employed in high-end monitors aimed at professional graphic artists, although with the recent fall in price it has {{been seen in the}} mainstream market as well. IPS technology was sold to Panasonic by Hitachi.|$|E

5000|$|Laser holography, in its {{original}} [...] "pure" [...] form of the photographic transmission hologram, is the only technology yet created which can reproduce an object or scene with such complete realism that the reproduction is visually indistinguishable from the original, given the original lighting conditions. It creates a light field identical to that which emanated from the original scene, with parallax about all axes and a very <b>wide</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> The eye differentially focuses objects at different distances and subject detail is preserved down to the microscopic level. The effect is exactly like looking through a window. Unfortunately, this [...] "pure" [...] form requires the subject to be laser-lit and completely motionless—to within a minor fraction of the wavelength of light—during the photographic exposure, and laser light must be used to properly view the results. Most people {{have never seen a}} laser-lit transmission hologram. The types of holograms commonly encountered have seriously compromised image quality so that ordinary white light can be used for viewing, and non-holographic intermediate imaging processes are almost always resorted to, as an alternative to using powerful and hazardous pulsed lasers, when living subjects are photographed.|$|E
