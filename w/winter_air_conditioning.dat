In spring, autumn and <b>winter,</b> {{centralized}} <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system frequently produces excessive cooling, if we {{use both}} air-energy saving system and water-energy saving system for directly cooling, replacing the chiller cooling, we can achieve the objective of energy saving.

50|$|The cave {{dwellings}} {{are well}} {{adapted to the}} climate, remaining cool in summer and retaining warmth in winter, and it is disputed how far they {{should be regarded as}} defensive as opposed to purely practical.

40|$|Operation of {{the site}} is running {{smoothly}} with {{all but one of}} the planned measurement systems (carbonyls) now in place and producing data. Data capture and processing for the measurements that are operated by CEH are given in the report. Although operation of measurement equipment by CEH on behalf of other operators is progressing well, and initial problems have been addressed, there is still no mechanism in place for retrieving ratified data from the other networks (AURN, VOCs etc.) so that all the data can be compiled in a single location at CEH. There has also been delay in the retrieval of analytical data from external laboratories (e. g. rainfall chemistry). These issues will be addressed in parallel with the development of the web-based data storage system; a basic system for capture and secure storage of raw data is in place and construction of a database awaits the availability of staff resources, but is planned to be in place by the end of the summer. Agreement has been reached for an extension to install 3 -phase power to the site, which in <b>winter</b> (without <b>air</b> <b>conditioning)</b> is consuming around 30 A continuously. The present electrical supply cannot cope with possible additional sampling instruments (e. g. hi-vol samplers for POPs), and is likely to be close to its operating limits in summer when the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> is running.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. A numerical method for analysing and quantifying the thermal behaviour of wind turbine nacelle of 2. 5 MW operating in the extreme winter conditions have been presented. The effects of the extreme external temperatures of - 30 oC, - 20 C and - 10 oC on the electrical equipment and mechanical components within the nacelle have been determined at the design wind speed of 12 m/s. Two cases, open and closed system applications, have been considered. For both cases without the AC at Text=- 30 oC,the surface temperatures of the gear box and generator are outside the temperature limits. When applying the AC to the systems, temperatures became inside the operation temperature limits. For closed system applications at Text=- 30 oC and - 20 oC, the surface temperatures of all components are inside the temperature limits with the capacities of the AC system, 5 kg/s at 0 oC, 5 kg/s at 10 oC with some icing problems inside wall of the nacelle. For closed system applications at Text=- 10 oC, the surface temperatures of components are inside the temperature limits with the AC capacities of 4 kg/s at 30 oC, 5 kg/s at 0 oC, 5 kg/s at 5 oC and 5 kg/s at 10 oC without icing problems. The simulation results have confirmed that, to maintain an acceptable temperature levels inside the nacelle and on the components for typical <b>winter</b> conditions, the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems are needed. The <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems of the nacelle have to be optimized and adjusted properly as functions of wind turbines rated power, external wind velocity and temperatures. cf 201...|$|R
