40|$|AbstractIn {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of Photosystem II (PSII) analyzed at {{a resolution of}} 1. 9 Å, most of the bond lengths between Mn and O atoms in the oxygen-evolving Mn 4 Ca cluster are 1. 8 – 2. 1 Å. On the other hand, the Mn 1 O 5 bond in the Mn 3 CaO 4 cubane region of the Mn 4 Ca cluster is significantly elongated to 2. 6 Å. Using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach, we investigated factors {{that are responsible for}} distortion of the Mn 3 CaO 4 cubane. Removal of Ca led to shortening the Mn 1 O 5 bond by 0. 2 Å; however, Mn 1 O 5 remained significantly elongated, at > 2. 5 Å. Conversely, removal of Mn 4 significantly shortens the Mn 1 O 5 distance by 0. 5 Å to 2. 2 Å, resulting in a more symmetric cubane shape. These results suggest that Mn 4, not Ca, is predominantly responsible for distortion of the Mn 3 CaO 4 cubane. It was not the Ca component that was responsible for the existence of the two S 2 conformers but two different Mn oxidation states (Mn 1, Mn 2, Mn 3, M 4) =(III, IV, IV, IV) and (IV, IV, IV, III); they were interconvertible by translocation of the O 5 atom along the Mn 1 –O 5 –Mn 4 axis. Depletion of Ca resulted in rearrangement of the H-bond network near TyrZ, which proceeds via a chloride ion (Cl- 1 pathway). This may explain <b>why</b> <b>Ca</b> depletion inhibits the S 2 to S 3 transition, the same process that can also be inhibited by Cl− depletion...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Cardiac {{guidelines}} {{recommend that}} the decision to perform coronary angiography (CA) in patients with Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NST-ACS) is based on multiple factors. It is, however, unknown how cardiologists weigh these factors in their decision-making. The aim was to investigate the importance of different clinical characteristics, including information derived from risk scores, in the decision-making of Dutch cardiologists regarding performing CA in patients with suspected NST-ACS. Design: A web-based survey containing clinical vignettes. Setting and participants: Registered Dutch cardiologists were approached to complete the survey, in which they were asked to indicate whether they would perform CA for 8 vignettes describing 7 clinical factors: age, renal function, known coronary artery disease, persistent chest pain, presence of risk factors, ECG findings and troponin levels. Cardiologists were divided into two groups: group 1 received vignettes ‘without’ a risk score present, while group 2 completed vignettes ‘with’ a risk score present. Results: 129 (of 946) cardiologists responded. In both groups, elevated troponin levels and typical ischaemic changes (p< 0. 001) made cardiologists decide more often to perform CA. Severe renal dysfunction (p< 0. 001) made cardiologists more hesitant to decide on CA. Age and risk score could not be assessed independently, as these factors were strongly associated. Inspecting the factors together showed, for example, that cardiologists were more hesitant to perform CA in elderly patients with high-risk scores than in younger patients with intermediate risk scores. Conclusions: When deciding to perform in-hospital CA (≤ 72 hours after patient admission) in patients with suspected NST-ACS, cardiologists tend to rely mostly on troponin levels, ECG changes and renal function. Future research should focus on <b>why</b> <b>CA</b> is less often recommended in patients with severe renal dysfunction, and in elderly patients with high-risk scores. In addition, the impact of age and risk score on decision-making should be further investigated. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – It {{is argued}} that {{traditional}} audit methods are becoming outdated in terms of delivering sufficient assurance on business objectives, whereby, a paradigm shift towards continuous auditing (CA) is proposed and perceived as necessary both by academia, standard-setting groups, and business society. However, the practical prevalence of CA is insignificant {{in relation to the}} expectations depicted. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to examine why this is the case by means of investigating what factors that motivate an adoption of CA amongst various internal audit functions (IAFs). Design/methodology/approach – The study draws on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and data are obtained through semi-structured interviews capturing internal auditors’ attitude towards CA, and what factors that influence an adoption. Findings – There is a shattered view on CA amongst IAFs, where the proponents embrace it as a set of value-adding methodologies whilst the opponents argue that it falls outside their responsibility and threaten the independence of the function. Thus, <b>why</b> <b>CA</b> has not been leveraged to its full potential is, in contrast to previous research, not solely attributable to practical factors but also due to the IAFs’ vast differences in approach to CA as a concept. Practical implications – The study has brought attention to the distinguished disparity found in internal auditors’ attitude towards CA. Ultimately, doubts, whether CA should be leveraged by IAFs has come to light. These are hurdles that need to be considered, both by academia, standard-setting groups, and business society if the leap for CA ought to continue. Originality/value – The use of semi-structured interviews contributes to in-depth understandings and insights of the internal auditors’ attitudes towards CA. Moreover, such an approach is more likely to capture the stance towards CA in greater detail than that possible of previous large-scale surveys...|$|E

We found that these Co-O triangular lattice systems have in common that their Co 3 + and Co 4 +, ions are all low-spin, supporting the Koshibae-Tsutsui-Maekawa theory to explain the enhanced thermopower at elevated temperatures. The concentration of holes in the Co 3 d t(2 g) shell {{is estimated to be}} about 0. 4, 0. 6, and 0. 33, respectively.

Cloning the two alleles into the upstream of a promoterless luciferase reporter gene revealed that the A allele decreases transcriptional activity by 68  % compared with the C allele in a reporter gene analysis. This suggested that the A allele might have reduced E-cadherin expression in vivo (Li et al. 2000). While most studies on the − 160 C > A SNP focused on cancer, only one study has examined its association with noncancerous diseases including urolithiasis. In a hospital-based case–control study of 127 nephrolithiasis patients and 152 controls, Tan et al. (2013) genotyped the − 160 C > A SNP and found that CA/AA genotypes were associated with a significantly decreased risk of nephrolithiasis (OR 0.53; 95  % CI 0.32 – 0.87), compared with the CC genotype. Our findings regarding the distribution of this polymorphism were {{consistent with those of}} Tan et al. (2013), except for the CA genotype. Even though AA genotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk of nephrolithiasis in our population, CA variants were found to increase this risk. CA genotype of rs 16260 CDH 1 polymorphism has increased stone formation risk almost threefolds compared with the AA genotype (95  % CI 1.08 – 7.28, OR 2.8, P =  0.033). This discrepancy might have resulted from ethnic composition differences between the studies. Other factors such as selection bias of subjects and different matching criteria may also have played their roles. In brief, alleles occur at different frequencies in different human populations as populations that are more geographically and ancestrally remote tend to differ more in terms of allele frequencies. We found CA+CC genotypes at the very edge of significance (P =  0.053). Overall, these results suggested that “A” allele may confer protective effects against nephrolithiasis. We found no significant differences in the allele frequencies between the patients and healthy control subjects. It is not clear <b>why</b> <b>CA</b> carriers of − 160 C > A were likely to develop kidney stone. This could be because the possible binding sites of transcription factors may have been affected by the − 160 C > A substitution of the promoter region. The C allele might have caused weak transcription factor binding affinity and low transcriptional activity in the expression of E-cadherin—a homophilic cell adhesion molecule which {{plays an important role in}} maintaining epithelial integrity due to its anti-invasive properties in numerous epithelial-derived cancers. Each of the two regulatory variant alleles in the hybrid cross has regulated expression of the other. We found that when stratified by serum calcium levels, the C allele carriers (CA and CC genotypes) had a significantly increased risk of nephrolithiasis. Significantly decreased 24  h urinary magnesium levels associated with increased nephrolithiasis risk were found in non-A allele carriers (CC). We confirmed that the A variant allele was likely to be protective against the development of nephrolithiasis. Magnesium inhibits calcium oxalate crystallization in human urine and may be highly useful as antilithiasis therapy (Grases et al. 2015).|$|E

The Dcx protein {{plays a key role}} in neuronal migration, and hippocampal pyramidal neurons in Dcx knockout (KO) mice are disorganized. The single CA 3 pyramidal cell layer observed in wild type (WT) is present as two abnormal layers in the KO, and CA 3 KO pyramidal neurons are more excitable than WT. Dcx KO mice also exhibit spontaneous epileptic activity originating in the hippocampus. It is unknown, however, how hyperexcitability arises and <b>why</b> two <b>CA</b> 3 layers are observed. Transcriptome analyses were performed to search for perturbed postnatal gene expression, comparing Dcx KO CA 3 pyramidal cell layers with WT. Gene expression changes common to both KO layers indicated mitochondria and Golgi apparatus anomalies, as well as increased cell stress. Intriguingly, gene expression analyses also suggested that the KO layers differ significantly from each other, particularly in terms of maturity. Layer-specific molecular markers and BrdU birthdating to mark the final positions of neurons born at distinct timepoints revealed inverted layering of the CA 3 region in Dcx KO animals. Notably, many early-born ‘outer boundary’ neurons are located in an inner position in the Dcx KO CA 3, superficial to other pyramidal neurons. This abnormal positioning likely affects cell morphology and connectivity, influencing network function.

40|$|Lysosomes are acidic {{intracellular}} vesicles containing hydrolases that degrade intracellular and extracellular debris delivered through endocytic {{trafficking and}} autophagy. Lysosome function requires {{the establishment of}} luminal ionic homeostasis for ions including H+ and Ca 2 +, which are 1, 000 - 5, 000 times more concentrated in the lysosome lumen than in the cytosol. Lysosomal H+ homeostasis is required to activate hydrolases and Ca 2 + efflux through lysosomal ion channels serves as signals required for precise delivery of hydrolases and cargo and the timely removal of catabolites. Impaired lysosomal Ca 2 + homeostasis results in lysosomal dysfunction, lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), and has been implicated more broadly in neurodegenerative phenotypes. The molecular mechanisms by which lysosomes acquire and refill Ca 2 + are unknown. We developed a physiological assay to monitor lysosomal Ca 2 + store refilling using specific activators of lysosomal Ca 2 + channel TRPML 1 to repeatedly induce lysosomal Ca 2 + release. In contrast to the prevailing view that lysosomal acidification drives Ca 2 + into the lysosome, inhibiting the V-ATPase H+ pump did not prevent Ca 2 + refilling. Instead, pharmacological and genetic depletion or chelation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2 + prevented lysosomal Ca 2 + stores from refilling. More specifically, antagonists of ER IP 3 receptors rapidly and completely blocked Ca 2 + refilling to lysosomes. Reducing ER Ca 2 + or blocking IP 3 receptors resulted in a dramatic lysosome storage phenotype. By closely apposing each other, the ER {{may serve as a}} direct and primary source of Ca 2 + to the lysosome.

40|$|Transcription by {{the nuclear}} factor of {{activated}} T cells (NFAT) is {{regulated by the}} frequency of Ca 2 + oscillation. However, <b>why</b> and how <b>Ca</b> 2 + oscillation regulates NFAT activity remain elusive. NFAT is dephosphorylated by Ca 2 +-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to initiate transcription. We analyzed the kinetics of dephosphorylation and translocation of NFAT. We show that Ca 2 +-dependent dephosphoryl ation proceeds rapidly, while the rephosphorylation and nuclear transport of NFAT proceed slowly. Therefore, after brief Ca 2 + stimulation, dephosphoryl ated NFAT has a lifetime of several minutes in the cytoplasm. Thus, Ca 2 + oscillation induces a build-up of dephosphorylated NFAT in the cytoplasm, allowing effective nuclear translocation, provided that the oscillation interval is shorter than the lifetime of dephos phorylated NFAT. We also show that Ca 2 + oscillation is more cost-effective in inducing the translocation of NFAT than continuous Ca 2 + signaling. Thus, the lifetime of dephosphorylated NFAT functions as a working memory of Ca 2 + signals and enables the control of NFAT nuclear translocation by the frequency of Ca 2 + oscillation at a reduced cost of Ca 2 + signaling...|$|R
40|$|In {{smooth muscle}} cells calcium is {{released}} from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the cytosol via calcium release events which occur either spontaneously or {{as a result of}} cell stimulation. The release occurs through the opening of either ryanodine receptor (RyRs; e. g. Nelson et al. 1995; Gordienko et al. 2001) or inositol trisphosphate receptor calcium channels (IP 3 Rs; e. g. Iino, 1987; Boittin et al. 1999). Where several of these calcium release channels open more or less simultaneously, the release of SR calcium (in the presence of a suitable indicator dye) gives rise to a transient localized increase in fluorescence termed a calcium ‘spark’. Such releases occur at one or a few preferred sites in the cell, named frequent discharge sites (FDSs; Gordienko et al. 1998). It was demonstrated that the structural basis of FDSs is portions of the SR enriched in RyRs (Gordienko et al. 2001). While in cardiac and skeletal muscle the physiological role of Ca 2 + sparks is to promote contraction, they have been suggested to have a dual role in smooth muscle (Jaggar et al. 2000). On the one hand, Ca 2 + sparks (usually from the dominant FDS) may precede and then develop into either a spontaneous (in guinea-pig ileal myocytes: Gordienko et al. 1999; in rabbit portal vein myocytes: Gordienko et al. 2001) or a stimulus-evoked Ca 2 + wave (in guinea-pig mesenteric arteriole myocytes, this study), often giving rise to contraction. It is not yet clear <b>why</b> some <b>Ca</b> 2 + sparks develop into Ca 2 + waves and the others do not. On the other hand, {{it has been suggested that}} Ca 2 + sparks have a role in opposing contraction through the activation of Ca 2 +-activated potassium (BKCa) channels, causing spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) and membrane hyperpolarization (Ganitkevich & Isenberg, 1990; Nelson et al. 1995) or in promoting contraction through opening of calcium-activated chloride channels (ClCa) causing spontaneous transient inward currents (STICs) which depolarize the membrane (ZhuGe et al. 1998; Gordienko et al. 1999).

The understanding of the Ca 2 + role in NaHCO 3 crystallization would be helpful for {{improving the quality of}} the final products. The influence of calcium ions on NaHCO 3 crystallization was investigated in a 5 -l mixed suspension mixed product removal crystallizer under controlled conditions. A density meter was used for continuous supersaturation monitoring. After a steady state had been reached, different CaCl 2 amounts were added at a constant flow rate. It was found that limited calcium ion levels in the system reduce drastically the nucleation frequency of NaHCO 3 and has a limited influence on crystal growth rate. The supersaturation measurements and other methods confirmed this phenomenon. The relationship between the Ca 2 + influence on NaHCO 3 crystallization, the calcium carbonate solubility and its metastable zone in concentrated NaHCO 3 solution was established. In fact, Ca 2 + has a maximum effect on NaHCO 3 crystallization kinetics when the saturation of calcium carbonate in NaHCO 3 solution has been reached, and the effect is constant in the metastable zone. The excess of Ca 2 + precipitates in NaHCO 3 solution as CaCO 3, as observed by energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray diffraction. This explained <b>why</b> an increasing <b>Ca</b> 2 + concentration in the solution has a limited influence on NaHCO 3 crystal size distribution and habit, but decreases the crystal purity.

By varying the permeant ions (Ba 2 +, Ca 2 +) and concentrations (2 – 70 mm), we estimated the affinity constant (KD) of the two channels as follows (mm) : L-type channel, KD,Ba = 7. 4 ± 1. 0, KD,Ca = 7. 1 ± 2. 2 (n = 7); non-L-type channel, KD,Ba = 5. 3 ± 3. 2, KD,Ca = 2. 0 ± 1. 0 (n = 8). Using ionic concentrations close to physiological conditions (2 mm Ca 2 + and 1. 0 mm Mg 2 +), the conductance of the L-type channel was ∼ 2 pS. We determined the mechanisms by which ions traverse the pore of these single Ca 2 + channels, using mixtures of Ba 2 + and Ca 2 + at total concentrations above (70 mm) or close to (5 mm) the KD of the channels. We found evidence for an anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE) only when the total divalent ion concentration was 5 mm, consistent with a multi-ion pore. We show that AMFE arises from the boundaries between the pore and bulk solution in the atria of the channel, which is derived from the presence of depletion zones that become apparent at low divalent cation concentrations. The present findings provide an explanation as to <b>why</b> previous whole-cell <b>Ca</b> 2 + currents that were recorded in quasi-physiological Ca 2 + concentrations (∼ 2 – 5 mm) showed clear AMFE, whereas single Ca 2 + channel currents that were recorded routinely at high Ca 2 + concentrations (20 – 110 mm) did not...|$|R
40|$|Experiments are {{described}} in which Ca efflux is monitored in axons under voltage clamp. As Ca efflux consists {{of more than one}} component, conditions were sought where one component predominates. Thus external Na-dependent Ca efflux can be studied in relative isolation either at pH 9. 0 or in fully poisoned axons immersed in Ca-free media; external Ca-dependent Ca efflux can be studied in fully poisoned axons immersed in Na-free media and the Na-independent, energy requiring, pump is best examined in Na and Ca-free sea waters. Both in unpoisoned axons at pH 9. 0 and fully poisoned axons at pH 7. 8, the external Na-dependent Ca efflux is activated by hyperpolarization and inhibited by depolarization. Depolarizations achieved either electrically or by exposure to high K are roughly comparable and the inhibition brought about by high K can largely be removed by electrical hyperpolarization to the initial resting potential. In both Na sea waters and choline sea waters containing 100 mM-Na, Ca efflux is increased e-fold over approximately 50 mV. In choline sea water, external Ca-dependent Ca efflux from fully poisoned axons is unaffected by voltage over the range - 80 to - 30 mV. But addition of K or Li activates the flux and this activation is increased by hyperpolarization and decreased by depolarization, suggesting that the activating cation may also be transported into the axon. The Na-independent, energy-requiring, flux is inhibited by electrical hyperpolarization and stimulated by electrical depolarization. External K also stimulates the flux and part of this stimulation can be removed by electrical hyperpolarization. These data show that the energy-dependent pump is sensitive to membrane potential in the physiological range and suggest that it may be an electrogenic process. The finding that voltage affects the energy-dependent (uncoupled) pump and external Na-dependent fluxes in opposite directions may help explain <b>why</b> the total <b>Ca</b> efflux from intact axons responds to potential in a very variable manner...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} study on localization of carbonic anhydrase (CA) in {{male and female}} reproductive organs. CA functions in pH and bicarbonate homeostasis and catalyzes the reaction CO₂ + H₂O ↔ HCO₃⁻ + H⁺. At present 15 different isozymes (CA I-XIV) have been characterized, three of them without catalytic activity. Only active isozymes are of physiological interest and a method demonstrating CA activity in tissues was used. Furthermore, a study on knockout mice deficient in CA II has been undertaken since these are used as model animals for the inherited human CA II deficiency syndrome. Tissues from testis and epididymis were taken from sexually mature pig, rabbit and mouse males; and from the ovary, oviduct and uterus from females {{of the same species}} and also cat. Corresponding tissues were taken from CA II-deficient mice. Tissues from other species were included when available from other studies. The tissues were fixed and processed for histochemical demonstration of CA activity and on mouse tissue also for immunohistochemical localization for CA II and CA IV. Spermatozoa were collected from testis, caput, corpus and cauda epididymidis and labelled for CA IV for scanning electron microscopy. Testis: The seminiferous epithelium was unstained except for the Sertoli cells in pig and acrosomes in hamster and lemming. The Leydig cells were CA positive in rat and pig. The capillaries were stained for CA activity in the testis of all species. Epididymis: The apical cells in caput showed CA activity in all species. The principal cells had basolateral membrane staining in cauda. The stereocilia/microvilli were stained in some regions in the species but not in pig. The membrane-bound CA IV was found to be transferred to the spermatozoa during passage through the duct. The capillaries were unstained. Ovary: The oocyte was unstained except for the rabbit cell membrane. The granulosa cells were stained only in the mouse and the theca interna was negative in all species. The luteal cells of corpus luteum were always unstained. The capillaries were variably stained for CA activity and unstained in mouse. Uterus: The surface epithelium was stained during at least some stage of the oestrus cycle in all species except pig. CA disappeared from the epithelium during the non-luteal phase in rabbit, while the glands were negative during the entire cycle. In the other species the glands were stained for CA activity. Stained capillaries were present in all species, except during the luteal phase in rabbit. CA II-deficient mouse: Membrane-bound CAs were more predominant than CA II in males, which may explain <b>why</b> the <b>CA</b> II-deficiency does not affect male fertility in the mouse. In the control females CA II was present in the uterine epithelium and glands as well as membrane-bound CA. The deficient females, however, often produce stillborn pups, which might be related to the lack of CA II in the uterine mucosa. Conclusions: The CA present in the epididymis is thought {{to be involved in the}} gradual acidification and bicarbonate resorption taking place in the duct. The envi 4 ronment in cauda must have a low pH to keep the spermatozoa immotile during storage. The CA in the female is thought to have a function in the micro milieu in the oviduct and uterus during transport of spermatozoa and ovum and later for embryonic implantation in the uterus. However, the cyclic variation affects CA activity, which together with a significant species variation warrant further studies...|$|R
