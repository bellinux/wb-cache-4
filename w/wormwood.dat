5|$|Once Sarah Jane has {{analysed}} {{that the}} Bane ingredient was sentient, she activates her computer, Mr Smith - after some shouting by Kelsey - and contacts <b>Wormwood</b> and politely requests that she leaves Earth. <b>Wormwood</b> refuses, and in retaliation takes {{control of the}} majority of the human race. Sarah Jane races to the factory, but cannot enter until she drives the bus into a wall. <b>Wormwood</b> reveals the Bane Mother, and explains the Archetype is a conglomerate of human DNA designed to be investigated so that Bubble Shock could be improved. The Archetype uses an alien communicator Sarah Jane had been given, realising that the signal would be strong enough to kill the Bane Mother, and Sarah Jane, Maria, and the Archetype escape as the factory explodes.|$|E
5|$|Between May and July 1918, {{military}} stores from White City, <b>Wormwood</b> Scrubs and Baker Street {{were moved}} to the site, with items kept in the completed sheds. A shortage of bricks in October meant the widening of the bridge over the railway was delayed, as was {{the construction of the}} railway line into the site.|$|E

5|$|Joseph Millson appears {{throughout}} the first series as Maria's recently separated father, Alan, with Chrissie Jackson, Maria's mother, played by Juliet Cowan. One other regular is Alexander Armstrong of comedy duo Armstrong and Miller, who provides {{the voice of}} Mr Smith, an extraterrestrial computer in Sarah Jane's attic.The 2007 special featured Samantha Bond as the scheming villain Mrs <b>Wormwood</b> and Jamie Davis as her PR agent Davey. The first series included among its guest cast Jane Asher as Sarah Jane's childhood friend Andrea Yates, Floella Benjamin as Professor Rivers, who returned in Series 2, Series 3 and Series 5, and Phyllida Law as Bea Nelson-Stanley. The second series guest starred Bradley Walsh as an evil alien clown in the story The Day of the Clown and Russ Abbot as a sinister astrologer in Secrets of the Stars. Also appearing in the second series were Gary Beadle and Jocelyn Jee Esien, who portrayed Clyde's parents Paul and Carla in The Mark of the Berserker; Esien reprised her role briefly in Series 4 and more prominently in series 5. Nicholas Courtney guest starred in Enemy of the Bane as classic Doctor Who character Sir Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart, and Samantha Bond also returned as <b>Wormwood</b> for the episode.|$|E
5|$|Today {{herbs are}} {{typically}} {{thought of as}} culinary plants, but in the traditional cottage garden they {{were considered to be}} any plant with household uses. Herbs were used for medicine, toiletries, and cleaning products. Scented herbs would be spread on the floor along with rushes to cover odors. Some herbs were used for dyeing fabrics. Traditional cottage garden herbs included sage, thyme, southernwood, <b>wormwood,</b> catmint, feverfew, lungwort, soapwort, hyssop, sweet woodruff, and lavender.|$|E
5|$|Kelsey wanders {{from the}} tour and {{attempts}} to phone Maria, but disturbs an unknown beast, the Bane Mother, to the annoyance of the staff, to which <b>Wormwood</b> orders the alarms switched off and Sarah Jane killed. Maria attempts to phone Kelsey, but sets off the alarms again, causing the Archetype to escape, transferring the focus upon him. Maria, while escaping, encounters him, who just mimics her, and they escape into a women's bathroom. Sarah Jane then enters, and although they are surprised to see each other, they manage to escape the factory, albeit without Kelsey. When they arrive back on Bannerman Road, Sarah warns Maria not to get involved as her life is too dangerous.|$|E
50|$|The moth {{will take}} {{advantage}} of a number of host plants other than corn, including other crops such as bell pepper, cotton, hops, millet, pearl millet, foxtail millet, sugarcane, sorghum, and ginger. It can be found on a number of wild plants, as well, such as <b>wormwoods,</b> Job's-tears, knotweeds, wild sugarcane, Johnson grass, and para grass.|$|R

Smith's, he follows the two to <b>Wormwood's</b> office, where he is killed when Danny launches {{him out of a}} window.|$|R
5|$|The CLR's next planned {{extension}} was westward to Ealing. In 1905, the Great Western Railway (GWR) {{had obtained}} parliamentary approval {{to construct the}} Ealing and Shepherd's Bush Railway (E), connecting its main line route at Ealing Broadway to the West London Railway (WLR) north of Shepherd's Bush. From Ealing, the new line was to curve north-east through still mostly rural North Acton, then run east for a short distance parallel with the GWR's High Wycombe line, before curving south-east. The line was then to run on an embankment south of Old Oak Common and <b>Wormwood</b> Scrubs before connecting to the WLR a short distance {{to the north of}} the CLR's depot.|$|E
5|$|The first {{historical}} {{mention of}} the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as Adalard of Corbie, though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century. Before the thirteenth century, and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, grains of paradise or alehoof. Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like <b>wormwood</b> would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used. Some beers today, such as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Los Angeles, Cameron befriended the socialite Samson De Brier and {{established}} herself within the city's avant-garde artistic community. Among {{her friends were}} the filmmakers Curtis Harrington and Kenneth Anger. She appeared in two of Harrington's films, The <b>Wormwood</b> Star and Night Tide, {{as well as in}} Anger's film Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. In later years, she made appearances in art-house films created by John Chamberlain and Chick Strand. Rarely remaining in one place for long, during the 1950s and 1960s she lived in Joshua Tree, San Francisco, and Santa Fe. In 1955, she gave birth to a daughter, Crystal Eve Kimmel. Although intermittent health problems prevented her from working, her art and poetry resulted in several exhibitions. From the late 1970s until her death from cancer in 1995, Cameron lived in a bungalow in West Hollywood, where she raised her daughter and grandchildren, pursued her interests in esotericism, and produced artwork and poetry.|$|E
60|$|On {{arriving}} at the green {{in front of my}} uncle's house, where we three had agreed to meet, I found that Jacob's outfit was even less than mine. In his grief because of his father's fate, he had thought only of his weapons and ammunition, and by {{the expression on his face}} I knew full well he would use them manfully if we came within striking distance of Lieutenant <b>Wormwood's</b> murderers.|$|R
5000|$|For making génépi liqueur, {{several species}} of Artemisia (the genus of the <b>wormwoods)</b> are {{particularly}} valued, including A. genipi (black génépi) and A. umbelliformis (white génépi) - either of which being {{sometimes referred to as}} A. rupestris. The botanical identification of the plants traditionally collected for use in making génépi liqueur is complicated by significant reclassification work in the genus Artemisia, spurred by advances in molecular assay and cladistics, that has resulted in the obsolescence of names used in older literature. It is likely that a wide range of <b>wormwoods</b> native to the mountainous areas of Spain, France, Switzerland and Italy have been used to make the liqueur, with personal taste, tradition and availability shaping the selection. Other species known to have been used {{at one time or another}} in producing génépi are A. glacialis, A. pontica and A. borealis. Flowers of [...] "Alsem der Alpen", the botanically related Achillea erba-rotta subsp. moschata known in English as musk milfoil, are sometimes added or used to substitute entirely for one or more of the génépi species. Collectively, these various Alpine plants that blossom at high altitudes during July and August are known in German as “Edelraute”.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{have drawn}} {{attention}} to the similarities between Rowling's works and those of Roald Dahl, particularly in the depiction of the Dursley family, which echoes the nightmarish guardians seen in many of Dahl's books, such as the <b>Wormwoods</b> from Matilda, Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker from James and the Giant Peach, and Grandma from George's Marvellous Medicine. Rowling acknowledges that there are similarities, but believes that at a deeper level, her works {{are different from those}} of Dahl; in her words, more [...] "moral".|$|R
5|$|The shingle ridge {{that protects}} the reserve from the sea and extends to Blakeney Point attracts biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift, bird's foot trefoil and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat. In the damper areas, sea <b>wormwood,</b> sea {{lavender}} and scrubby sea-blite also thrive. The saltmarsh contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The uncommon spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other saltmarsh specialists. The upper saltmarsh {{has a number of}} scarce species including lesser centaury, curved hard-grass and sea pearlwort, with soft hornwort in the dykes.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{entertaining}} {{old friends}} {{who came to}} visit her in her home, Cameron also met with younger occultists, such as the Thelemite William Breeze and the industrial musician Genesis P-Orridge. Cameron aided Breeze in co-editing a collection of Parsons' occult and libertarian writings, which were published as Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword in 1989. Cameron was acquainted with the experimental film-maker Chick Strand and appeared in the latter's 1979 project Loose Ends, during which she narrated {{the story of an}} exorcism. In 1989, an exhibition of her work titled The Pearl of Reprisal was held at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery. It included a selection of her paintings and a screening of Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome and The <b>Wormwood</b> Star, while Cameron attended to provide a candle-lit reading of her poetry. In the mid-1990s, Cameron was diagnosed with a brain tumor and underwent radiotherapy treatment, which she supplemented with alternative medicines. The tumor was cancerous and metastasized to her lungs. She {{died at the age of}} 73 in the VA Medical Center on July 24, 1995, and underwent the Thelemic last rites, carried out by a high priestess of the Ordo Templi Orientis. Her body was cremated and its ashes were scattered in the Mojave Desert. A memorial event was held at Venice's Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center in August.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{origin of}} absinthe is unclear. The medical use of <b>wormwood</b> {{dates back to}} ancient Egypt, and is {{mentioned}} in the Ebers Papyrus, c.1550BC. <b>Wormwood</b> extracts and wine-soaked <b>wormwood</b> leaves were used as remedies by the ancient Greeks. Moreover, {{there is evidence of}} the existence of a wormwood-flavoured wine, absinthites oinos, in ancient Greece.|$|E
40|$|Roald Dahl’s Matilda (1988) {{is one of}} {{the most}} entrancing {{accounts}} in children’s literature of the changes that passionate educators, good literature, and an intrepid disposition can bring to the life of a child whose home environment is not conducive to learning. However, the novel rests on a denunciation and caricature of a specific socioeconomic category and its practices: the petty bourgeoisie. This class-based antipathy, this article argues, goes mostly unnoticed because it is filtered through an alluring portrayal of Matilda’s giftedness that justifies condescension toward the <b>Wormwoods</b> and what they stand for...|$|R
50|$|The FBI finally uncovers enough {{evidence}} to prosecute Harry, and the <b>Wormwoods</b> prepare to flee to Guam. They stop by Miss Honey's house to pick up Matilda, but she refuses {{to go with them}} and suggests Miss Honey adopt her. In that moment, a remorseful Zinnia laments over not understanding her daughter and regrets that she didn't treat her better. She and Harry subsequently sign the adoption papers that Matilda had kept for a long time. They escape and Matilda lives a happy life with Miss Honey, who becomes the new principal of Crunchem Hall.|$|R
60|$|The plants found {{close to}} the snow were minute primroses, Parnassia, Draba, tufted <b>wormwoods</b> (Artemisia), saxifrages, gentian, small Compositae, grasses, and sedges. Our ponies unconcernedly scraped away the snow with their hoofs, and nibbled the scanty herbage. When I mounted mine, he took the bit between his teeth, and scampered back to Palung, over rocks and hills, through bogs and streams; and though the snow was so {{blinding}} that no object could be distinguished, he {{brought me to the}} tents with unerring instinct, as straight as an arrow.|$|R
25|$|It {{was once}} widely {{promoted}} that excessive absinthe drinking caused effects that were discernible from {{those associated with}} alcoholism, a belief {{that led to the}} coining of the term absinthism. One of the first vilifications of absinthe followed an 1864 experiment in which Magnan simultaneously exposed one guinea pig to large doses of pure <b>wormwood</b> vapour, and another to alcohol vapours. The guinea pig exposed to <b>wormwood</b> vapour experienced convulsive seizures, while the animal exposed to alcohol did not. Magnan would later blame the naturally occurring (in <b>wormwood)</b> chemical thujone for these effects.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wormwoods</b> (Artemisia species) {{from the}} génépi group are, along with Edelweiss, iconic plants of the Alpine region and true symbols of inaccessibility {{because of their}} rarity and their habitat, largely limited tomoraines of glaciers and rock crevices. Infusions and liqueurs {{prepared}} from génépis have always enjoyed a panacea status in folk medicine, especially as thermogenic agents and remedies for fatigue, dyspepsia, and airway infections. In thewake of the successful cultivation ofwhite génépi (Artemisia umbelliformis Lam.) {{and the expansion of}} its supply chain, modern studies have evidenced the occurrence of unique constituents, whose chemistry, biological profile, and sensory properties are reviewed along with the ethnopharmacology, botany, cultivation and conservation strategies of their plant sources...|$|R
50|$|When Miss Trunchbull becomes {{ready to}} {{discipline}} Matilda, she uses her abilities by writing on a chalkboard, posing as {{the ghost of}} Miss Honey's deceased father Magnus, who died a mysterious death (which Miss Trunchbull {{may have been involved}} in). In the film, she also protects the other children from Miss Trunchbull's wrath and also uses her telekinesis to pelt her with food and garbage. A petrified Miss Trunchbull is compelled by Matilda's prank to leave Miss Honey her proper inheritance before suddenly vanishing. After her family flees the country on the run from the police because of Mr. <b>Wormwood's</b> deceit in the automotive industry, Matilda is adopted by Miss Honey, thus providing her with a more loving home. In addition, with Miss Trunchbull gone for good, Miss Honey becomes the new headmistress in addition to her teaching duties.|$|R
50|$|Harry finally relents to letting Matilda go {{to school}} after meeting a client named Miss Trunchbull, the tyrannical {{principal}} of a rundown elementary school, Crunchem Hall. There, Matilda befriends several children and learns of Trunchbull's violent nature and overtly harsh punishments of the students. Thankfully, Matilda's teacher, Jennifer Honey, is a kind woman who adores her class and takes an immediate liking to Matilda's gentle and humble nature despite her incredible genius. She requests to Trunchbull that Matilda be moved up to a higher class, but Trunchbull refuses. That night, Miss Honey pays the <b>Wormwoods</b> a visit {{to encourage them to}} spend more time with Matilda, but they snub her. Meanwhile, Matilda discovers that her family is under surveillance by FBI agents Bob and Bill due to her father's illegal dealings, but her parents refuse to believe her, as Zinnia thinks they are speedboat salesmen.|$|R

25|$|Within the Oubliette {{the hero}} finds Corvus, {{who had been}} {{captured}} by the Gittish Empire {{when they returned to}} <b>Wormwood</b> Creek. Upon freeing Corvus, the main character learns that he attacked Realm of the Almighty and revived the Gittish Empire, having developed an intense hatred for mortalkind during his three-hundred-year captivity and concentrating it into a powerful force. Corvus attacks the main character and escapes the Oubliette, with Serena appearing soon after his departure. She explains that when the Gittish Empire returned to <b>Wormwood</b> Creek, Corvus tried to defend the town again despite his injuries. To keep him safe, Serena fed Corvus a sleeping potion, but Serena's father delivered Corvus to the Gittish Empire, leading Corvus to believe that Serena betrayed him.|$|E
25|$|The two land in an {{isolated}} village called <b>Wormwood</b> Creek, whose residents have come to despise outsiders after an attack by the Gittish Empire hundreds of years ago. The main character is met with hostility {{by all of the}} town's residents except for the mayor's nephew, Wallace, who sympathizes with the main character and helps him/her recover. Thinking he/she may be an accomplice of Barbarus, the townspeople kick the main character out of town, despite Wallace's protests. Wallace then suggests that the main character travel to the town of Upover and enlist the help of Barbarus' mortal enemy: Greygnarl, the legendary dragon that lives atop a volcano called the Magmaroo. In order to open the path to Upover, Wallace directs the main character to a sealed cave known as the Bowhole. Along the way, the main character and Stella meet a ghost named Serena who is searching for Corvus, the former guardian Celestrian of <b>Wormwood</b> Creek and Aquila's mentor. Serena reveals that she was the daughter of <b>Wormwood</b> Creek's elder who nursed Corvus back to health after he fell from the Observatory. When the Gittish Empire invaded the town and tried to take Serena, Corvus fought back in her defense and forced them to retreat, only for them to return later and kill her.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wormwoods</b> {{known as}} génépi are endemic to the Alps and Pyrenees, {{but can also}} be found in the Apennines and other mountainous regions in the western and central north Mediterranean. However, in the strictest sense the name génépi applies only to those members of the genus Artemisia growing in the Savoy region known as Genepi. While the name clearly {{reflects}} a geographical origin, the European Union does not protect French génépi liqueur under its Protected Geographical Status system. Instead, as of 2008, while génépi is recognized as a category of spirit to be regulated by the EU, only génépi of Italian origin (from Val d’Aosta and Piemonte) is protected. Under the EU legislation, the name génépi is limited in use to those Italian products, but unlike under systems of appellation, there are few regulations or limitations on how the product is produced or what ingredients are used in making it. A beverage may be labelled and sold as génépi only if it complies with general EU requirements for liqueur, such as a minimum sugar content (expressed as invert sugar) of 100 grams per litre.|$|R
40|$|The {{first scene}} shows a country couple {{entering}} Steeplechase Park. They proceed to amuse {{themselves on the}} steeplechase, rope bridge, the "Down and Out" and riding the bulls. The scene then changes to a panorama of Luna Park, showing Rube and Mandy doing stunts on the rattan slide, riding on the miniature railway, shooting the chutes, riding the boats in the old mill, and visiting Professor <b>Wormwood's</b> Monkey theatre. They next appear on the Bowery, visiting the fortune tellers, striking the punching machine and winding up with the frankfurter man.
