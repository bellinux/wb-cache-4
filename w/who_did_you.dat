2500|$|Qualitative {{psychological}} research emphasizes fieldwork, {{and this}} emphasis {{has been offered}} as a distinguishing mark. Qualitative psychological research is also described as holistic. That is, qualitative researchers believe in studying phenomena in its context rather than concentrating on narrow aspects of the phenomena. This means that they either observe or participate in the phenomena they are studying, e.g. attending a football game to understand the behaviours of fan, and/or they ask open-ended questions about the behaviour of fans at football games. These questions are holistic because {{they are designed to}} understand the context of behaviour—they will usually follow a pattern that replicates the experience, e.g. [...] "What did you do when you arrived? <b>Who</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come with? What did you do then?" [...] However, similar methods are used by quantitative researchers.|$|E
