5|$|A <b>water</b> <b>mill</b> and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water power was in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills. The {{one at the}} hall was once used to churn butter. The foundations of {{what could have been}} a mill opposite Mill Hill Cottages on Rivington Lane, mill ponds, and a smithy were shown on the 1848 first edition Ordnance Survey map. Names such as Mill Hill and Mill Dam Wood also provide evidence of the former mill.|$|E
5|$|The Rivière des Prairies hydro {{complex is}} a set of three dams: one from Montreal I. to Île de la Visitation (west of the Papineau-Leblanc Bridge), which {{includes}} a footpath; another between Île de la Visitation and Île du Cheval de Terre; and the longest span between Île du Cheval-de-Terre and Île Jésus. Île de la Visitation is joined to Montreal by another two small bridges: a road bridge, which also serves as a dam (historically, a <b>water</b> <b>mill)</b> and a footbridge.|$|E
5|$|A plaque {{placed on}} the miller's house in 1973 to {{celebrate}} the 100th birthday of miller Gerardus van Hoorn commemorates both fires. Van Hoorn had known the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, who lived in nearby Nuenen from 1883 until 1885. Van Gogh painted several paintings around the mill, including an 1884 painting of the mill itself, <b>Water</b> <b>Mill</b> at Opwetten (F48). In a video interview in 1973, Van Hoorn {{said that he had}} seen Van Gogh paint and had supplied him with bird nests for his paintings.|$|E
50|$|Although other Western artists had {{depicted}} <b>water</b> <b>mills</b> before, Ruisdael was {{the first}} to make it the focal subject in a painting. Meindert Hobbema, Ruisdael's pupil, started working on the <b>water</b> <b>mills</b> subject in the 1660s. Today Hobbema is more strongly associated with <b>water</b> <b>mills</b> than his teacher.|$|R
5000|$|The {{painting}} is known by various names. The {{painting is}} called Two <b>Water</b> <b>Mills</b> with an Open Sluice in Seymour Slive's 2001 catalogue raisonné of Ruisdael, catalogue number 119. In his 2011 book on Ruisdael's <b>mills</b> and <b>water</b> <b>mills</b> Slive calls it Two Undershot <b>Water</b> <b>Mills</b> with an Open Sluice. The Getty Museum calls it Two Watermills and an Open Sluice on their website, object number 82.PA.18.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>Water</b> <b>Mills</b> with an Open Sluice, {{also known}} as Two Watermills and an Open Sluice, Two Undershot <b>Water</b> <b>Mills</b> with an Open Sluice is a 1653 {{painting}} by the Dutch Golden Age painter Jacob van Ruisdael. It is {{in the collection of}} the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.|$|R
5|$|Outside {{the park}} boundary, the area's {{industrial}} heritage {{is represented by}} the Mining Museum at Matlock Bath where it is possible to tour the Temple Lead Mine, the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site and Brindley <b>Water</b> <b>Mill</b> at Leek. The preserved steam railway, Peak Rail between Matlock and Rowsley, the National Tramway Museum at Crich and the Cromford Canal chart the area's transport history. The Life in a Lens Museum of Photography & Old Times in Matlock Bath presents the history of photography from 1839. Other attractions on the fringes of the region include the theme parks at Alton Towers and Gulliver's Kingdom, and the Peak Wildlife Park.|$|E
5|$|Balfour {{also gave}} the island its most {{noticeable}} landmark when he recruited an Edinburgh architect, David Bryce, to transform Cliffdale House into the Scottish Baronial Balfour Castle. Other buildings he {{added to the}} island include the porter's lodge (now a public house called The Gatehouse), a <b>water</b> <b>mill,</b> a school, and a gasworks that remained operational until the 1920s. The gasworks {{is in the form}} of a round tower with a corbelled parapet of red brick and carved stones—including one possibly removed from Noltland Castle on Westray, which is inscribed with the year 1725. The structure appears to be fortified, in accordance with Balfour's intention to give the village a medieval appearance. David Balfour was also responsible for the construction of Mill Dam, a wetland which was once the water supply for the mill and is now an RSPB nature reserve.|$|E
5|$|The Anglican Church St Andrews {{has held}} {{services}} since the 1840s. For some time the town {{also had a}} Wesleyan Chapel. A private school opened in 1843 and a government one in the 1870s. By the late 1930s both schools had closed. Carrick hosts Agfest, the state's largest single event and one of Australia's largest agricultural field days. The 1848 Anglican church, 1833 hotel {{and a few other}} establishments serve the townspeople. A brewery, steam and <b>water</b> <b>mill,</b> butcher, schools and other hotels are all long since closed. Carrick has a long association with horse racing, starting prior to the race course's formation in 1848. For a time the town held the oldest horse race in Australia. Today regular harness racing, speedway racing and cycling events have replaced this.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} head of {{the canal}} was at Blackbridge Wharf, Winchester, just {{to the south of}} Wharf Mill, a grade II listed <b>water</b> <b>mill</b> dating from 1885, and College Walk, which spans the river at Blackbridge, an eighteenth-century stone bridge which is also grade II listed. Below the bridge, the channel splits, with the river flowing to the west and the navigation to the east. Blackbridge Wharf was accessed by Wharf Bridge, the oldest surviving bridge over the navigation, dating from the 1760s. Close by, the manager's house, a warehouse and some stables have also survived. The navigation flows past the grounds of Winchester College, which uses the waterway for rowing practice. The rowing eights use a winding basin just above the remains of St Catherine's Hill Lock, which now contains a modern sluice mechanism, and was the location of a water-powered sawmill, located {{to the west of the}} lock.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} the canal is just {{to the north of}} the river, and a public {{footpath}} follows it through Uffington Park until it reaches the Uffington to Barnack road. The adjacent bridge over the River Welland has three arches and dates from the seventeenth century but the canal bridge has been filled in to protect its structure. There were three locks in open countryside on this section before the canal reached Tallington where Tallington Village Lock was located just to the north of St Lawrence Church, parts of which date from the 12th to 15th centuries, with later additions. Remains of bridge piers were uncovered during archaeological excavations carried out in 1998 when a water pipeline running from Tallington to West Deeping was installed. No details of the bridge have survived, but the levels suggest that it was probably a movable bridge. The canal then passed close to Tallington Mill, a <b>water</b> <b>mill</b> dating from around 1700, to reach Horse Holmes Lock. A railway line crossed the tail of the lock, but after the demise of the canal, the line was widened, and the lock is thought to be buried beneath the embankment.|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} {{concentration of}} mechanical power was the Barbegal <b>water</b> <b>mill</b> complex in southern France, {{constructed in the}} early 2ndcenturyAD. Sixteen overshot water wheels fed by an arcaded aqueduct branch from the main conduit to Arles produced an estimated 4.5t of flour per 24 hours – an output sufficient to feed 12,500 people or {{the majority of the}} population of Arles. <b>Water</b> <b>mill</b> batteries are also known from Amida in Asia Minor, the Janiculum hill in Rome, and a number of other places throughout the empire.|$|E

50|$|The {{painting}} shows two working undershot <b>water</b> <b>mills,</b> {{with the}} major one being half-timbered with a cob-facade construction, tie beams, and vertical plank gable. This is characteristic of the <b>water</b> <b>mills</b> in the Bentheim area in Germany, to where Ruisdael had travelled in the early 1650s. This painting is one of six known variations on this theme {{and the only one}} that is dated.|$|R
50|$|The Iazu Morilor River {{is an old}} {{artificial}} canal, {{built for}} a succession of <b>water</b> <b>mills.</b> It originates in the Prahova River near the locality of Floreşti and flows into the Cricovul Dulce River in Romania.

25|$|Dronningmølle <b>water</b> <b>mill</b> was rebuilt in the National Romantic {{style for}} Ferdinand Andersen {{and is now}} known as Dronningmølle Slot. The {{building}} has later been converted into holiday apartments. Ferdinand Andersen is also associated with other buildings in the area, such as the beach house Skansen which he constructed at the mouth of Esrum Å in 1899. The house takes its name after a protected defensive structure located on the estate. The now wingless wind mill next to the <b>water</b> <b>mill</b> was built in 1878 and remained in use until 1934. Dronningmølle Avlsgård from 1923 was designed by the architect Henning Hansen.|$|E
