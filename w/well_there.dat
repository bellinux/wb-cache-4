5|$|As of 2013, Schafer {{is still}} {{interested}} in a sequel to Brütal Legend, but would require appropriate funding and resources {{to make it happen}} as an independent developer. Since then, Double Fine launched a successful crowd-funded drive for Psychonauts 2 in December 2015; Schafer said that if that game does <b>well,</b> <b>there</b> is a good chance that a sequel to Brütal Legend would be possible. Brutal Legend will eventually get a sequel, Tim Schafer of developer Double Fine said June 13 during an appearance at E3 2017.|$|E

5|$|Spartan {{citizens}} used helots, {{a dependent}} group collectively {{owned by the}} state. It is uncertain whether they had chattel slaves as <b>well.</b> <b>There</b> are mentions of people manumitted by Spartans, which was supposedly forbidden for helots, or sold outside of Lakonia: the poet Alcman; a Philoxenos from Cytherea, reputedly enslaved with all his fellow citizens when his city was conquered, later sold to an Athenian; a Spartan cook bought by Dionysius the Elder or by a king of Pontus, both versions being mentioned by Plutarch; and the famous Spartan nurses, much appreciated by Athenian parents.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} superstition that is {{prevalent among}} many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist the Campbell (Western Conference champion) or Prince of Wales (Eastern Conference champion) trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus {{it should be the}} only trophy that they should be hoisting. Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as <b>well.</b> <b>There</b> have been other teams, however, that have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophy and then {{went on to win the}} Cup anyway.|$|E
5|$|Even as the XF-108 {{program was}} {{progressing}} <b>well,</b> <b>there</b> were signs that would {{ultimately lead to}} its eventual cancellation. Unconfirmed Soviet bomber threats, the overwhelming trend toward offensive and defensive nuclear missiles in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as well as rising costs, contributed to the termination of the XF-108. The cancellation was announced on 23September 1959. North American continued refining the design through 1960 in hopes that the program might be revived. Despite the extra money and time spent on the Rapier, it was not wholly in vain; the North American A-5 Vigilante supersonic carrier-based nuclear strike bomber developed for the U.S. Navy, which was later modified into a carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft, retained the fuselage/weapon package and systems design of the Rapier. In many ways the Vigilante {{could be seen as}} the successful application of the Rapier design principles in a Mach 2 supersonic design.|$|E

5|$|Ireland's {{geologic}} history covers {{everything from}} volcanism and tropical seas {{to the last}} glacial period. Ireland was formed in two distinct parts and slowly joined together, uniting about 440 million years ago. As a result of tectonics {{and the effect of}} ice, the sea level has risen and fallen. In every area of the country the rocks which formed {{can be seen as a}} result. Finally, the impact of the glaciers shaped the landscape seen today. This variation in the two areas along with the differences between volcanic areas and shallow seas gives Ireland a range of soils as <b>well.</b> <b>There</b> are wide bogs and free-draining brown earths. The mountains are granite, sandstone, limestone with karst areas, and basalt formations.|$|E
5|$|The war {{had also}} led to {{political}} tensions, revolution and turmoil. In Russia, the conflict resulted in revolution and civil war between 1917 and 1923, and the rise to power of the Communist Bolshevik government. The German Empire had seen revolution break {{out at the end}} of the war, with vicious street fighting in the major cities, including Berlin; some Germans felt that this experience was too quickly forgotten in the post-war years. Romania almost descended into revolution as <b>well.</b> <b>There</b> was turmoil in Ireland; 210,000 Irish served in the war as part of the British forces, but the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916 led in turn to the Irish War of Independence and the later civil war. Elsewhere the war exposed simmering ethnic and religious divisions. In Canada, for example, the distinctions between the English, largely Protestant, and French speaking, predominantly Catholic, parts of the country become increasingly apparent, with conscription becoming a major political issue.|$|E

5|$|An apex predator, Smilodon {{primarily}} hunted large mammals. Isotopes {{preserved in}} the bones of S.fatalis in the La Brea Tar Pits reveal that ruminants like bison (Bison antiquus, which was {{much larger than the}} modern American bison) and camels (Camelops) were most commonly taken by the cats there. In addition, isotopes {{preserved in the}} tooth enamel of S.gracilis specimens from Florida show that this species fed on the peccary Platygonus and the llama-like Hemiauchenia. In rare cases, Smilodon may have also targeted glyptodonts, based on a Glyptotherium skull that bears elliptical puncture marks consistent with the size and diameter of its canine teeth. This was a juvenile glyptodont with an incompletely developed cephalic shield (head armor). Isotopic studies of dire wolf (Canis dirus) and American lion (Panthera leo atrox) bones show an overlap with S.fatalis in prey, which suggests that they were competitors. The availability of prey in the Rancho La Brea area was likely comparable to modern East Africa. As Smilodon migrated to South America, its diet changed; bison were absent, the horses and proboscideans were different, and native ungulates such as toxodonts and litopterns were completely unfamiliar, yet S.populator thrived as <b>well</b> <b>there</b> as its relatives in North America. The differences between the North and South American species {{may be due to the}} difference in prey between the two continents. Smilodon probably avoided eating bone and would have left enough food for scavengers. Smilodon itself may have scavenged dire wolf kills. It has been suggested that Smilodon was a scavenger that mainly used its canines for display to assert dominance over carcasses, but this theory is not supported today as no modern terrestrial mammals are pure scavengers.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{anatomy of}} Heterodontosaurus tucki has been well-described, {{although}} H. tucki {{is generally considered}} the most derived of the Early Jurassic heterodontosaurids, so {{it is impossible to}} know how many of its features were shared with other species. The forelimbs were long for a dinosaur, over 70% of the length of the hindlimbs. The well-developed deltopectoral crest (a ridge for the attachment of chest and shoulder muscles) of the humerus and prominent olecranon process (where muscles that extend the forearm were attached) of the ulna indicate that the forelimb was powerful as <b>well.</b> <b>There</b> were five digits on the manus ('hand'). The first was large, tipped with a sharply curved claw, and would rotate inwards when flexed; Robert Bakker called it the 'twist-thumb'. The second digit was the longest, slightly longer than the third. Both of these digits bore claws, while the clawless fourth and fifth digits were very small and simple in comparison. In the hindlimb, the tibia was 30% longer than the femur, which is generally considered an adaptation for speed. The tibia and fibula of the lower leg were fused to the astragalus and calcaneum of the ankle, forming a 'tibiofibiotarsus' convergently with modern birds. Also similarly to birds, the lower tarsal (ankle) bones and metatarsals were fused to form a 'tarsometatarsus.' There are four digits in the pes (hindfoot), with only the second, third, and fourth contacting the ground. The tail, unlike many other ornithischians, did not have ossified tendons to maintain a rigid posture and was probably flexible. The fragmentary skeleton known for Abrictosaurus has never been fully described, although the forelimb and manus were smaller than in Heterodontosaurus. Also, the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb each bear one fewer phalanx bone.|$|E
