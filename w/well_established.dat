5|$|A 1994 {{analysis}} of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B. Young concluded that his medical symptomsmdash&including his past relapses, fevers and hepatic conditionsmdash&were {{much closer to}} those resulting from hepatic amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery before he left India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then <b>well</b> <b>established.</b> Amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease at the time.|$|E
5|$|Although Poore's Brickworks was <b>well</b> <b>established,</b> Jones {{believed}} there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking. Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10million bricks a year. It was decided that 5million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network. Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.|$|E
5|$|By 1903 {{the synagogue}} was <b>well</b> <b>established</b> on Rivington Street, and, {{due to its}} {{capacity}} and prominence, was often the site of significant or mass meetings.

At the latter service, which was boycotted by Orthodox rabbis, Herzl was not eulogized, nor was his name mentioned.|$|E

Also, during a contemporary music festival in April 1970, produced by the Japanese composer himself ("Iron and Steel Pavilion"), Takemitsu met among the participants Lukas Foss, Peter Sculthorpe, and Vinko Globokar. Later that year, {{as part of a}} commission from Paul Sacher and the Zurich Collegium Musicum, Takemitsu incorporated into his Eucalypts I parts for international performers: flautist Aurèle Nicolet, oboist Heinz Holliger, and harpist Ursula Holliger.|$|E
5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} {{has been}} done {{in many parts of the}} world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the classical period. However, the practice was already <b>well</b> <b>established</b> by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While African elephants are significantly larger than Asian elephants, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Herring, a fish {{which takes}} well to salting, became a <b>well</b> <b>established</b> catch; the busiest harbour was Aberystwyth, which {{reportedly}} took up to 1,000 barrels of herring {{in a single}} night in 1724. Many other villages also fished for herring, generally between late August and December. Herring, along with mackerel, trout, salmon and sea trout, were the main fishes found in Welsh cuisine. Salmon was abundant and therefore a staple for the poor. Trout, which would dry out quickly when cooked, would be wrapped in leek leaves for cooking, or covered in bacon or oatmeal. Many fish would be served with fennel, which grew wild in abundance in Wales.|$|E
