5000|$|January 7, 2013: Having {{finalized}} {{the process}} of <b>lifting</b> <b>cables</b> of coverage, works reach 87% completion.|$|R
50|$|The Mount Roland {{cable car}} is a {{proposed}} aerial <b>lift</b> (<b>cable</b> car) at Mount Roland, near Sheffield, Tasmania, Australia.|$|R
50|$|The lift was {{the subject}} of a general {{overhaul}} in 1980 and the <b>lifting</b> <b>cables</b> were renewed in 1984/85.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A worker {{attaches}} a <b>lifting</b> <b>cable</b> to {{a concrete}} sewer pipe section. Note the retracted stabilizers on this Case backhoe ...|$|R
50|$|The park {{is divided}} into {{separate}} sections for families, women and children. A zoo, river <b>lifts,</b> <b>cable</b> cars and river boats are there.|$|R
5000|$|The drum/winch {{mechanism}} that operates the <b>lift</b> <b>cable</b> is 17 feet wide by 9 {{feet in diameter}} — {{the size of a}} rental moving truck; ...|$|R

25|$|When {{the load}} is partly {{supported}} by a <b>lifting</b> <b>cable</b> {{and there is a}} sudden variation on the tension in the cable due to vessel movement or cable slip.|$|R
50|$|Nizhny Novgorod Cableway (Нижегородская канатная дорога) is a 3660 metres long gondola <b>lift</b> <b>cable</b> car link {{across the}} Volga River in Russia {{connecting}} {{the city of}} Nizhny Novgorod with the town of Bor.|$|R
5000|$|Xtreme Skyflyer {{is mainly}} {{made up of}} 5 parts. The first part is the [...] "arch". This is where the cables holding the riders are {{attached}} to. The second parts are the two towers which hold the <b>lift</b> <b>cables.</b> When riders are ready to release the cable, {{they are at the}} top of either tower. The third part is the scissor lift which brings up and down riders from the cables. The fourth parts are the cables that hold the riders during the entire cycle. The final part is the <b>lift</b> <b>cable</b> which brings riders {{to the top of the}} ride giving riders the maximum experience.|$|R
50|$|Divers {{exit the}} bell and ascend on the <b>lifting</b> <b>cable.</b> Management of umbilicals to limit {{snagging}} risk. Umbilicals {{may not be}} long enough to allow divers to reach surface, so surface standby diver {{may be needed to}} assist.|$|R
40|$|Slider release {{mechanism}} reusable. Bears heavy loads while latched, yet gives smooth release motion. Release effected by explosively driving perpendicular slider out of engagement with load-bearing shank. Device has potential industrial {{applications such as}} emergency release of <b>lifting</b> <b>cables</b> from helicopters, cranes and hoists...|$|R
50|$|The term {{is used as}} {{an analogy}} for locking out of a closed bell, {{but there is no}} {{pressure}} tight lock involved. The working diver will lock out of a wet bell on instruction from the supervisor, with a short length of umbilical, and make an integrity check of the bell. This will normally include a check that the main <b>lifting</b> <b>cable</b> is secure, the bell umbilical is clear and secure, the guide wires (clump weight <b>lifting</b> <b>cable)</b> are clear and secure, and the bell {{does not appear to be}} at risk of fouling on any nearby structure or feature. The diver will report back that the bell integrity is OK and that they are leaving the bell to go to the work site.|$|R
5000|$|Another of {{his major}} {{achievements}} was the [...] "torretta butoscopica", (direct translation: exploration turret), a one-man atmospheric pressure underwater observation chamber deployed by a <b>lifting</b> <b>cable</b> from a ship, provided with a telephone, and supplied with breathing air from the surface, which he designed, built and tested.|$|R
50|$|Before Ajax arrived divers {{had already}} dug a tunnel under O-5's bow for Ajax's <b>lifting</b> <b>cables.</b> Ajax arrived around midnight. Drives {{completed}} the cable install under the sub by early morning. Sheppard J. Shreaves was the {{supervisor of the}} salvage crew. Sheppard was a qualified diver, had been working himself all throughout the night helping to dig the tunnel under the submarine. Ajax was hooked to the cables run under the sub and worked to hoist the sub up. But the <b>lift</b> <b>cables</b> broke. Shreaves and his crew installed another cable under the bow. Shreaves and his men had been in their diving suits nearly 24 hours working on the rescue. The next <b>lift</b> the <b>cable</b> broke again. Near midnight on the 29th Ajax did its third lift, this lift worked as the divers has pumped air into the sub's flooded Engine Room. The bow of the O-5 broke the surface. The salvage team opened the torpedo room hatch, and two trapped sailors, Henry Breault and Lawrence T. Brown emerged.|$|R
2500|$|At 10:50 A.M. {{the lifting}} of the {{stricken}} Pisces III began. It caused immense jolting of the submersible which further disorientated the crew. At [...] the lift was halted to disentangle the CURV-III. The lift was temporarily halted again at [...] so that heavier <b>lifting</b> <b>cables</b> could be fixed by divers.|$|R
50|$|The valley {{station is}} the lower {{terminal}} of an aerial <b>lift,</b> <b>cable</b> car, gondola <b>lift,</b> chairlift, rack railway or ski lift. The valley station is the counterpart of a top station. Cable cars may be boarded at both stations. The valley station is always {{at a lower}} elevation than the top station.|$|R
5000|$|Components: resistor, inductor, capacitor, transformer, battery, alternators, synchronuous machines, {{induction}} machines, {{direct current}} machines, generators, direct Park, reverse Park, rectifiers, inverters, choppers, gradators, wires, fuses, relays, fans, blowers, lamps, <b>window</b> <b>lift</b> systems, magnetic coils, airgaps, leakages, piezoelectric actuators, ...|$|R
2500|$|A $3 million ($million in [...] dollars) {{upgrade to}} the <b>lift</b> <b>cables,</b> {{expansion}} joints, and a deck repaving {{was completed in}} 1990. The diesel generator used to power the lift was replaced in 1995 {{at a cost of}} $150,000. In 1999, the bridge was repainted at a cost of $17million. [...] A $10.8million electrical upgrade was completed in mid-May 2005.|$|R
50|$|Chiaphua Components Limited (CCL) is a motor {{supplier}} {{for home}} appliance, floor care & HVAC, healthcare & mobility products, industrial products. Chiaphua Components Automotive Limited (CCAL) is mainly focus on supporting automotive {{applications such as}} fuel pumps, <b>window</b> <b>lifts,</b> wipers, car roofs etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{front of}} the {{interior}} {{was the same as}} the TA22 GT except for a different fabric pattern on the seats.Electric <b>window</b> <b>lifts</b> were used (optional but rare on the TA22 GT) but the TA22 GT's optional air conditioning was not present.|$|R
50|$|Automotive devices {{from the}} XC800 family {{can be found}} in safety and {{powertrain}} applications like motorcycle BCM, lighting, <b>window</b> <b>lift,</b> low end airbags, steering angle sensors, pumps, cooling fans and valve/throttle controls. All devices are compliant with the AEC Q100 standards for automotive electronics.|$|R
5000|$|April 7: Southern Ontario was {{affected}} by winds gusting up to 110 km/h. Among the consequences were Power failures from Windsor to Belleville, 7 people being stranded in a lift at the Skylon Tower at the Niagara Falls when the <b>lift</b> <b>cables</b> were twisted {{in the wind and}} the wind combined with pack ice on the Welland Canal to block the canal stopping shipping traffic.|$|R
5000|$|The scene wherein Paulie {{attempts}} to make conversation with the locals on the waterfront was not scripted; Tony Sirico was simply filmed interacting with passers-by. When Paulie tells a passer-by that he is from America, the Italian man asks Paulie if he is from NATO and if his planes cut their ski <b>lift</b> <b>cable.</b> This is {{a reference to the}} 1998 Cavalese cable car disaster.|$|R
6000|$|O all ye fair ladies {{with your}} colours and your graces, [...] And your eyes clear in flame of candle and hearth, Toward {{the dark of}} this old <b>window</b> <b>lift</b> not up your smiling faces, [...] Where a Shade stands forlorn from the cold of the earth.|$|R
60|$|I {{lifted the}} paper {{up and saw}} that the chest was divided into two compartments. Lying on the top of one was a small, square, inlaid box. This Mrs. DeLisle took up and carried to the <b>window.</b> <b>Lifting</b> up the cover she laid it in my lap.|$|R
50|$|Divers {{worked to}} tunnel under O-5s bow so <b>lifting</b> <b>cables</b> could be attached. Ajax arrived about midnight, and by early morning, the cable tunnel had been dug, the cable run, and a lift was attempted. Sheppard J. Shreaves, {{supervisor}} of the Panama Canal’s salvage crew and himself a qualified diver, had been working continuously throughout the night to dig the tunnel, snake the cable under the submarine, and hook it to Ajax’s hoist. Now the lift began. As the crane took a strain, the <b>lift</b> <b>cables</b> broke. Shreaves and his crew worked another cable set under the bow and again Ajax pulled. Again, the cable broke. All through the day, the men worked. Shreaves {{had been in his}} diving suit nearly 24 hours. As midnight on the 29th approached, the crane was ready for another lift, this time with buoyancy being added by blowing water out of the flooded Engine Room. Then, just after midnight, the bow of O-5 broke the surface. Men from the salvage force quickly opened the torpedo room hatch, and Breault and Brown emerged into the fresh air.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cable</b> <b>lift</b> {{utilizes}} a <b>cable</b> loop {{in place}} of the traditional chain, which is attached to a short section of chain that engages the trains chain dog. Because a cable is much lighter than a chain, <b>cable</b> <b>lifts</b> are much faster than chain lifts and can be used on much steeper hills - even vertical. A cable also requires far less maintenance than a chain. Another advantage to park guests is that a <b>cable</b> <b>lift</b> is very quiet, partly because the main drive winch is located directly beneath the top of the lift, a location which will normally be relatively far from guest-accessible areas.|$|R
25|$|The 2.4km Awana Skyway is {{an aerial}} tramway type cable car {{connecting}} Awana/Sri Layang and Genting Grand Hotel, Genting Highlands in Malaysia, {{was built in}} 1975 and was then Malaysia’s very first aerial <b>lift</b> <b>cable</b> car transport system before Genting Skyway is officially opened on 21 February 1997. It has ceased operations on 1 April 2014 {{to make way for}} the construction of a new cable car system using gondola lift type.|$|R
50|$|The station {{itself is}} an L-shaped steel {{latticework}} structure {{with the long}} end running {{parallel to the ground}} for 30 feet (10 m) at a height of 10 feet (3 m). In the middle a substructure below supports the wide bullwheel around which the <b>lift</b> <b>cable</b> is looped. It drew its energy from another pulley system connected to the engine formerly in the 20-foot-high (6 m) short section, based below the lift's grade.|$|R
50|$|Steel, on {{the other}} hand, can freeze himself to {{absolute}} zero which gives him the ability to destroy 'ghosts', which are in actuality remnants of Time. He apparently possesses immense strength (in Adventure 3 he ties knots in <b>lift</b> <b>cables</b> to prevent the lift from being used) and a degree of invulnerability. He also exhibits telekinetic abilities, being able to paralyse people with a look, weld metal {{with his bare hands}} or undo deadbolts with a gesture.|$|R
2500|$|Divers {{worked to}} tunnel under O-5s bow so <b>lifting</b> <b>cables</b> could be attached. Ajax arrived about midnight, and by early morning, the cable tunnel had been dug, the cable run, and a lift was attempted. [...] Sheppard J. Shreaves, {{supervisor}} of the Panama Canal’s salvage crew and himself a qualified diver, had been working continuously throughout the night to dig the tunnel, snake the cable under the submarine, and hook it to Ajax’s hoist.

50|$|Due to {{the steep}} sided river valley, {{production}} workers spent {{a large amount}} of time walking up from the town to the mines, there by reducing productivity. In 1954 an extensive cable car system was installed to transport workers around the valley and up to the mines. Still utilising the same infrastructure installed originally in the 1950s, today some 17 separate aerial <b>lift</b> <b>cable</b> car systems still exist around the town. Some of the most interesting lines are just outside the city.|$|R
6000|$|Joscelyn {{rose and}} went to the <b>window.</b> <b>Lifting</b> back the curtain, she stood in the splendour of the moonlight, and sang the grand old hymn. At first Aunty Nan beat time to it feebly on the counterpane; but when Joscelyn came to the verse, [...] "With mercy and with judgment," [...] she folded her hands over her breast and smiled.|$|R
60|$|After {{reading for}} perhaps a half-hour {{he seemed to}} {{come to the end of}} a chapter and quietly laid away the book. He then rose and taking the reading-stand from the floor carried it into a corner of the room near one of the <b>windows,</b> <b>lifted</b> the candle from it and {{returned}} to the empty fireplace before which he had been sitting.|$|R
5000|$|Riders {{first step}} onto a scissor lift, {{where they are}} raised into the loading position. Operators then hook the riders onto a cable that brings the riders {{to the top of}} the tower and a cable that holds the riders during the free-fall. Once the riders are {{securely}} attached to the cable and the operators say it is safe to operate, the scissor lift is brought down and the riders are pulled {{to the top of the}} tower. Once the riders reach the top, they must wait until the operator at the bottom says to [...] "pull the cord". The operator will usually say [...] "tower one / two: 3, 2, 1, fly." [...] At this point, the rider at the far right (unless there is a single rider) must pull the cord releasing them from the <b>lift</b> <b>cable.</b> During the first drop, riders experience about 3 to 4 seconds of free-falling. After about 10 swings, an operator will <b>lift</b> a hydraulic <b>cable</b> with a loop at the top which then a rider will have to grab and hold on to. After grabbing the cable, the riders will come to a stop just above the scissor lift. The next riders will step onto the lift where the previous riders will be unloaded and they will be attached to the <b>lift</b> <b>cable</b> where the cycle begins again. One cycle can last anywhere between 3 and 5 minutes.|$|R
