It is endemic to the island of Waigeo in Indonesia, and consequently the spelling Waigeo cuscus is often used instead of <b>Waigeou</b> <b>cuscus.</b> Unlike all {{other members of the}} genus Spilocuscus, both genders are whitish with black spots. It remains fairly common, but its small range makes it vulnerable to habitat loss and hunting.|$|E
