5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. <b>We</b> <b>respond</b> to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how <b>we</b> <b>respond</b> to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E

2500|$|Methodism was endowed by the Wesley {{brothers}} with worship characterised by a twofold practice: {{the ritual}} liturgy of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer {{on the one}} hand and the informal preaching service on the other. Similar to most historic Christian churches, the Methodist Church has official liturgies for services such as Holy Communion, Baptism, Ordination and Marriage. These and other patterns of worship are contained in the Methodist Worship Book, the most recent Methodist service book. It states that worship is [...] "a gracious encounter between God and the Church. God speaks to us, especially through scripture read and proclaimed and through symbols and sacraments. <b>We</b> <b>respond</b> chiefly through hymns and prayers and acts of dedication." [...] Methodism has generally allowed for freedom in how the liturgy is celebrated—the Worship Book serves as a guideline, but ministers, preachers and other worship leaders are not bound to use it. The Methodist Church follows the Revised Common Lectionary, in common with other major denominations in Britain.|$|E

His suggestion “to not raise walls but bridges" [...] was widely interpreted by the media as addressed to President Trump, and repeated by Francis with regards to Trump's immigration policy. [...] Francis has said that “to speak properly of our own rights, we need to broaden our perspective and to hear the plea of other peoples and other regions than those of our own country” (EG 190). More broadly he is concerned that [...] "a globalization of indifference has developed; ... the culture of prosperity deadens us; ... those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere spectacle; they fail to move us" [...] (EG 54).He suggests that we should find Jesus in others, in their faces, voices, pleas – redoubling our efforts to live in fraternity (EG 90). Lay ministries must go beyond serving our own community and show real commitment to transform every aspect of life in society with Jesus' values (EG 94). Only in this way can <b>we</b> <b>respond</b> to the evangelical mandate that we have God's love in us, if we do not refuse help to those in need (1 Jn 3:17 in EG 187).|$|E

To Noel and Mooka, alone on the barrens, the sun was no dimmer than before; the heavy gray bank of clouds still held sullenly to its place on the horizon; and no eyes, however keen, would have noticed the tiny dark spots that centered and glowed upon them over the rim of the little hollow where the wolves were watching.

6000|$|On Friday--our Sunday--a drunken crier {{goes about}} the town, {{threatening}} the bastinado {{to all who}} neglect their five prayers. At half-past eleven a kettledrum sounds a summons to the Jami or Cathedral. It is an old barn rudely plastered with whitewash; posts or columns of artless masonry support the low roof, and the smallness of the windows, or rather air- holes, renders its dreary length unpleasantly hot. There is no pulpit; the only ornament is a rude representation of the Meccan Mosque, nailed like a pothouse print to the wall; and the sole articles of furniture are ragged mats and old boxes, containing tattered chapters of the Koran in greasy bindings. I enter with a servant carrying a prayer carpet, encounter the stare of 300 pair of eyes, belonging to parallel rows of squatters, recite the customary two-bow prayer {{in honor of the}} mosque, placing sword and rosary before me, and then, taking up a Koran, read the Cow Chapter (No. 18.) loud and twangingly. At the Zohr or mid-day hour, the Muezzin inside the mosque, standing before the Khatib or preacher, repeats the call to prayer, which the congregation, sitting upon their shins and feet, intone after him. This ended, all present stand up, and recite every man for himself, a two-bow prayer of Sunnat or Example, concluding with the blessing on the Prophet and the Salam over each shoulder to all brother Believers.
