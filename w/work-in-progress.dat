5|$|The Unearthed Arcana title {{has been}} used for a monthly column at the {{official}} D website that began in February 2015 and presents new, <b>work-in-progress</b> content such as class archetypes, playable races, and rule variants, similar to the playtest that preceded the release of 5th edition.|$|E
5|$|Debuting {{first in}} a <b>work-in-progress</b> version at the 1991 New York Film Festival before its November 1991 wide release, Beauty and the Beast, {{directed}} by Kirk Wise & Gary Trousdale, was an unprecedented critical and commercial success, and would later be seen {{as one of the}} studio's best films. The film earned six Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture, a first for an animated work, winning for Best Song and Best Original Score. Its $145 million box office gross set new records and merchandising for the film– including toys, cross-promotions, and soundtrack sales– was also lucrative.|$|E
5|$|After 2008, Detroit's {{front office}} and {{coaching}} personnel were essentially overhauled {{by the team}} ownership. Matt Millen, the team's incumbent general manager and CEO since 2001, was terminated on September 28, 2008. His replacement, Martin Mayhew, ultimately terminated head coach Rod Marinelli in the off-season. Marinelli was replaced by Jim Schwartz, then defensive coordinator of the Tennessee Titans. Schwartz ultimately revamped the entire Detroit offensive (and defensive) philosophieshiring Scott Linehan and Gunther Cunningham, respectively. Detroit held the first pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, and selected quarterback Matthew Stafford out of the University of Georgia. Stafford was named the team's starting quarterback out of training camp, but he battled various injuries throughout the season. Much of the 2008 Detroit roster was released by the new regime, and the 2009 team was viewed as somewhat of a <b>work-in-progress,</b> but Johnson still finished the 2009 season with 67 receptions, 984 yards, and five touchdowns, while missing two games.|$|E
5|$|An earlier, longer, <b>work-in-progress</b> {{version of}} the film was {{rejected}} for competition by the Cannes Film Festival, which offered that cut of Mr. Nobody an out-of-competition berth. Producer Philippe Godeau turned that down. The decision by the Cannes Film Festival not to exhibit the film created a national controversy. Eventually, the studio held the film's world premiere at the 66th Venice International Film Festival on 12 September 2009. Six days later, Mr. Nobody screened as a special presentation during the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Additionally, the film was screened at the Sitges Film Festival and the Stockholm International Film Festival before its theatrical release. Mr. Nobody had its American premiere on 25 June 2011, at the Los Angeles Film Festival, nearly two years since its original debut. It was among more than 200 feature films, short projects, and music videos, from more than 30 countries, to be shown at the festival. The Consul General of Belgium, Geert Criel, held a second United States screening of Mr. Nobody on 21 December 2011, at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team began {{development}} {{of the game in}} 2006, after having begun work on the core technology, the Hedgehog Engine, in 2005. The title was first brought to public attention when the Sonic Unleashed name was trademarked by Sega on March 12, 2008. Screenshots of cut scenes, artwork, and a video were leaked ten days later, with the title then officially confirmed by Sega on April 3, 2008 with a small selection of screenshots and an updated video. The game was developed internally by Sonic Team in Japan. It was originally intended to be the third installment of the Sonic Adventure series and subsequently, at an early development stage, had the working title Sonic World Adventure, complete with <b>work-in-progress</b> logo. However, the development team began to introduce enough new innovations to separate it from the Sonic Adventure titles, and so a new title, Sonic Unleashed, was decided upon. It was then later revealed that the game's name in Japan would in fact remain Sonic World Adventure for its release there.|$|E

25|$|According to Ivan Spassky, {{there are}} eight genuine Constantine rubles of two {{different}} types. Five are proof coins complete with edge lettering. A hypothetical sixth coin of this type was probably minted in December 1825 and disappeared without trace. Three coins of the so-called Schubert ruble type have no edge lettering. They are, most likely, intermediate <b>work-in-progress</b> proofs illegally removed from the Mint.|$|E
25|$|Three Constantine rubles are {{currently}} preserved at the Hermitage Museum and the State Historical Museum in Russia and the Smithsonian Institution in the United States. The Hermitage also possesses the three genuine sets of press dies, in {{different stages of}} completion, seventeen tin <b>work-in-progress</b> samples and Jacob Reichel's original design on parchment. All other genuine Constantine rubles are in private collections outside of Russia.|$|E
25|$|In 1874 Afanasy Bychkov (1818–1899) {{reported}} {{a detailed description}} of two tin pressings of Constantine ruble from his collection. Bychkov's proofs, according to Valentin Yanin, were genuine <b>work-in-progress</b> samples retained by Cancrin. Their existence explains the difference between the number of tin proofs recorded in 1825 (nineteen) and in 1884 (seventeen). Yanin theorized that Bychkov could have inherited from Cancrin the hypothetical sixth Constantine ruble, and that it was resold in Europe in 1898.|$|E
25|$|Today, Colonial Williamsburg is Virginia's largest tourist {{attraction}} (based upon attendance) {{and is the}} cornerstone of the Historic Triangle with Jamestown and Yorktown joined by the Colonial Parkway. In the 21st century, Williamsburg has continued to update and refine its attractions. There are more features designed to attract modern children and to offer better and additional interpretation of the African-American experience in the town. A century after Dr. Goodwin's work began, this masterpiece of Virginia and United States history remains a remarkable <b>work-in-progress.</b>|$|E
25|$|Parable of the Sower {{was adapted}} as Parable of the Sower: The Concert Version, a <b>work-in-progress</b> opera written by American folk/blues {{musician}} Toshi Reagon {{in collaboration with}} her mother, singer and composer Bernice Johnson Reagon. The adaptation's libretto and musical score combine African-American spirituals, soul, rock and roll, and folk music into rounds to be performed by singers sitting in a circle. It was performed as part of The Public Theater's 2015 Under the Radar Festival in New York City.|$|E
25|$|Emin {{was interviewed}} about the Venice Biennale by the BBC's Kirsty Wark in November 2006. Emin showed Wark some <b>work-in-progress,</b> which {{included}} large-scale canvases with paintings of Emin's legs and vagina. Starting with the Purple Virgin (2004) acrylic watercolour series with their strong purple brush strokes depicting Emin's naked open legs, leading to Emin's paintings in 2005-6 such as Asleep Alone With Legs Open (2005), the Reincarnation (2005) series and Masturbating (2006) amongst others, these works were a significant new development in her artistic output.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, Elizabeth Cady Stanton {{travelled}} through Europe gathering support for, and inviting participation in, her <b>work-in-progress</b> The Woman's Bible. One evening, Stanton {{spoke to a}} crowd at Clark's home {{about the state of}} the suffrage movement in America. Local clergymen present questioned Stanton about the Bible's position of woman in relation to man, and Stanton described at length how equality among the sexes was supported by Bible verse, but that the Bible could be selectively quoted to support conflicting arguments. Because of this, said Stanton, it should be limited in its authority. Clark, though sympathetic to Stanton's views, expressed to Stanton her fear that some of the strictest of those in attendance might have been shocked by her ultra-liberal opinions.|$|E
25|$|Exley {{traveled}} to the Hawaiian island of Lanai, where he began work on the final novel of his semi-autobiographical trilogy, Last Notes From Home. In May 1977, Rolling Stone publisher and co-founder Jann Wenner paid Exley $20,000 to publish up to six excerpts of the <b>work-in-progress.</b> The magazine published three excerpts, in June 1977, October 1978 and February 1979. The following year, Exley's papers were acquired by collector Robert C. Stevens and donated to the University of Rochester. In 1984, Exley's major debt was temporarily relieved when he received a Guggenheim Foundation grant of $21,000. Frank Gifford, who was portrayed as a hero and object of Exley's envy in A Fan's Notes, invited Exley to attend Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, California, where the New York Giants defeated the Denver Broncos.|$|E
25|$|University of Rochester is {{also home}} to a number of student {{exhibition}} spaces. The AsIs Gallery in the Sage Art Center showcases rotating exhibitions of student works from studio classes in U of R. As a <b>work-in-progress</b> critique space, this exhibition space provides students the opportunity to develop their work in a semi-professional space. The Gallery at the Art and Music Library that features work from students and local artists in the highly trafficked Rush Rhees Art and Music Library. Hartnett Gallery, located in Wilson Commons, is a student supported gallery that showcases international and professional contemporary artists as well as an annual juried student exhibition. The pasSAGE is annex of Sage Art Center which features long term exhibition selected by a faculty committee. There is also a Senior Thesis Gallery located in the Sage Arts Center that features senior undergraduate works.|$|E
25|$|A <b>work-in-progress</b> build of {{the game}} was shown on September 7. Activision {{announced}} several features new to the game, including a continuous day/night cycle, a more populated city than the Los Angeles of Streets of LA, a darker palette than the first game, more cars and vehicles, the ability to travel by taxi or subway, {{and the ability to}} enter buildings beyond those related to plot. The following week, the main cast was announced, including Laurence Fishburne, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, Mariska Hargitay, Esai Morales, and Traci Lords. Marcus Reed would be voiced by Avery Waddell. Details of the soundtrack were released a week later. The soundtrack's headliner was Redman, who was recording an original song for the game, and would also be an unlocakble character with his own minigame, much as Snoop Dogg had in Streets of LA.|$|E
500|$|The {{exhibition}} highlights {{consist of}} <b>work-in-progress</b> sketches from various Pixar productions, clay sculptures of their characters, and an autostereoscopic short showcasing a 3D {{version of the}} exhibition pieces which is projected through four projectors. Another highlight is the Zoetrope, where visitors of the exhibition are shown figurines of Toy Story characters [...] "animated" [...] in real-life through the zoetrope.|$|E
500|$|Frise {{chatted with}} the {{frequent}} {{visitors to the}} office. [...] He worked at his own pace and often tore up <b>work-in-progress</b> in dissatisfaction and submitted his strips at the last moment. [...] Frise's tardiness caused such delays in production and distribution that editorial director HarryC. Hindmarsh once demanded JosephE. Atkinson have something done about it. [...] Atkinson replied, [...] "Harry, The Star Weekly does not go to press without Mr. Frise." ...|$|E
500|$|Instead, at {{an early}} stage of the war Paraguay's wooden vessels, only one of which had been built as a warship, were {{defeated}} by a Brazilian wooden flotilla at the Battle of the Riachuelo; hence the River Paraguay was blockaded by the Brazilian navy; and so the armoured ships he had ordered could neither be delivered nor paid for. [...] Brazil negotiated with the shipbuilders to transfer and complete the <b>work-in-progress,</b> and, eventually, used these selfsame ironclads to defeat Humaitá.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} for Nil Battey Sannata commenced in May 2014 at Agra, and {{was completed}} {{by the end of}} November. At several locations in Agra, the crew found it difficult to manage an [...] "over-enthusiastic crowd". The editing process began immediately after, and was supervised by Chandrashekhar Prajapati of the Pixon Studios. The editor's cut was submitted for the <b>Work-in-Progress</b> Lab at the NFDC Film Bazaar. Distributed by Eros International in India, Nil Battey Sannatas final cut ran for a total of 104 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Work on carving a {{replacement}} for Warriors figurehead, which was destroyed in the 1960s, began in 1981 using photographs of the original as a guide. The [...] <b>work-in-progress</b> was displayed at the 1982 London International Boat Show with the carvers still at work; it dominated coverage of the show. Before it was finished in mid-1983, the figurehead appeared on the BBC children's television programme Blue Peter. For much of 1984 it was displayed at the Main Gate of the Portsmouth Royal Dockyard. It was mounted on the ship on 6 February 1985.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1928 Sibelius {{made one}} of his regular visits to Berlin, to imbibe the city's musical life and to compose. He sent {{positive}} <b>work-in-progress</b> reports to Aino: the symphony, he said, will be [...] "wonderful". Back home in Ainola in September, he told his sister that he was [...] "writing a new work, which {{will be sent to}} America. It will still need time. But it will turn out well." [...] In December 1928, however, when his Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen asked him how the work was developing, Sibelius was less forthcoming; the symphony existed, he said, only in his head. Thereafter Sibelius's reports of the symphony's progress became equivocal, sometimes contradictory, and difficult to follow.|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} attention {{mainly because of}} its emergent gameplay, text-based graphics, complexity, poor interface and difficulty. Many reviewers described the game as unusually difficult to learn. It {{has been compared to}} other simulation games like SimCity and The Sims, Dungeon Keeper, and roguelike games like NetHack. The game has not had much influence on the mainstream gaming industry because of its non-commercial nature. However, reviewers praised Adams' independence and attention to detail. Gamasutra said, [...] "There have been few indie gaming success stories as big as Dwarf Fortress." [...] Wired magazine, following one of its updates, described it as an [...] "obtuse, wildly ambitious <b>work-in-progress</b> [...] mashes the brutal dungeon crawling of roguelikes with the detail-oriented creativity of city-building sims." ...|$|E
500|$|Thomas Jefferson was {{a natural}} subject for Brodie's fourth biography. [...] One of her courses focused on the United States from 1800 to 1830, and her seminar in {{political}} biography could serve as an appropriate forum for a <b>work-in-progress.</b> [...] Throughout this period, Brodie was attracted to Mormon studies and was importuned by several publishers to write a biography of Brigham Young. [...] The LDS entrepreneur, O.C. Tanner (1904–1993), offered Brodie $10,000 in advance to produce a manuscript. [...] Dale Morgan told Brodie that Madeline Reeder McQuown, his closer friend, had nearly completed a huge manuscript on Young. [...] At the time, McQuown’s biography {{was little more than}} rough drafts of a few early chapters, but Brodie was dissuaded and abandoned Brigham Young for Thomas Jefferson.|$|E
500|$|On 28 October, Harrison and Boyd {{arrived in}} New York, {{where he and}} Spector carried out final {{preparation}} for the album's release, such as sequencing. Harrison harboured doubts about whether all the songs they had finished were worthy of inclusion; Allan Steckler, Apple Records' US manager, was [...] "stunned" [...] {{by the quality of}} the material and assured Harrison that he should issue all the songs. Spector's signature production style gave All Things Must Pass a heavy, reverb-oriented sound, which Harrison came to regret with the passage of time. Outtakes from the recording sessions became available on bootlegs in the 1990s. One such unofficial release, the three-disc The Making of All Things Must Pass, contains multiple takes of some of the songs on the album, providing a <b>work-in-progress</b> on the sequence of overdubs onto the backing tracks.|$|E
500|$|One {{novel that}} did not appear in Startling was Isaac Asimov's Pebble in the Sky, which Merwin had {{commissioned}} from Asimov in the early summer of 1947. [...] After {{the unusual step of}} allowing the editor to twice read the <b>work-in-progress</b> and receiving nothing but approval, Asimov delivered a completed draft in September. This time, Merwin asked for revisions: Leo Margulies, Merwin's boss, had decided that Startling needed to focus more on action and adventure in the style of Amazing, and less on cerebral stories in the style of Astounding. [...] Asimov, [...] "for the first and only time of [...] life...openly lost [...] temper with an editor", stalked out of the room with his manuscript and never submitted anything to Merwin again, though he later expressed a softening of feeling and admitted Merwin had been within his rights.|$|E
500|$|A film {{adaptation}} of The Disaster Artist {{was announced in}} February 2014, produced by Seth Rogen and scheduled to be directed by James Franco. Franco stated The Disaster Artist was [...] "a combination of Boogie Nights and The Master". The film will star Franco as Wiseau, his brother Dave Franco as Sestero, and be written by The Fault in Our Stars screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. On October 15, 2015, it was announced Seth Rogen would play a role and cinematographer Brandon Trost would serve as the DP for The Disaster Artist. On October 29, 2015, {{it was announced that}} Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema would distribute The Disaster Artist. Shooting began December 7, 2015. A <b>work-in-progress</b> version was screened at South by Southwest in March 2017 with the wide release set on December 8, 2017.|$|E
500|$|The first {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Idlewild South {{took place in}} mid-February 1970 at the newly built Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon. Subsequently, the band moved to Criteria Studios in Miami in mid-March, where Dowd felt more comfortable producing albums; he viewed the then-new Capricorn studio as still a <b>work-in-progress</b> and unfit to record in. The band was constantly on the road while Idlewild South was developed, leading to a fractured recording process completed in fits and stops. They reconvened with Dowd during short breaks from shows. In addition, group leader Duane Allman still received invitations to play as a session musician elsewhere; on the [...] "rare instances when [...] could return to Macon for a short break", Allman would hit the road for New York, Miami, or Muscle Shoals to contribute to other artists' sessions. On days that the band would be available, manager Walden phoned Dowd to inform him; he would often catch their show and {{spend the rest of}} the night in the studio. After nearly half a year and over three different recording studios, production wrapped up by July 1970.|$|E
500|$|Mike Reagan, a music {{composer}} {{noted for}} his work in video games such as Darkwatch and God of War, was hired by THQ to write the music for Conan. [...] To begin, he wanted to compose simple but powerful melodies, and looked to Basil Poledouris's score for the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian for inspiration. [...] As Reagan played development copies of the game, he was influenced by two other works: Igor Stravinsky's barbaric and sensual ballet music The Rite of Spring, and Bernard Hermann's score from the 1958 action film The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. [...] Each week, Nihilistic and Reagan updated each other with copies of their <b>work-in-progress,</b> synchronizing their efforts. Reagan also studied with noted percussion artists Denny Seiwell, Emil Richards, and Michael Duffy to gain further insight on the use of drums to accompany the game's bloody and violent plot. [...] After mastering the soundtrack, he brought the music of Conan to an October 2007 Video Games Live show, performing it live in Los Angeles, United States.|$|E
500|$|With the {{intention}} of creating a book-length work based on his father's recollections of the Holocaust Spiegelman began to interview his father again in 1978 and made a research visit in 1979 to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where his parents had been imprisoned by the Nazis. [...] The book, Maus, appeared one chapter at a time as an insert in Raw beginning with the second issue in December 1980. [...] Spiegelman's father did not live to see its completion; he died on 18 August 1982. [...] Spiegelman learned in 1985 that Steven Spielberg was producing an animated film about Jewish mice who escape persecution in Eastern Europe by fleeing to the United States. [...] Spiegelman was sure the film, An American Tail (1986), was inspired by Maus and became eager to have his unfinished book come out before the movie to avoid comparisons. [...] He struggled to find a publisher until in 1986, after the publication in The New York Times of a rave review of the <b>work-in-progress,</b> Pantheon agreed to release a collection of the first six chapters. [...] The volume was titled Maus: A Survivor's Tale and subtitled My Father Bleeds History. [...] The book found a large audience, {{in part because it}} was sold in bookstores rather than in direct-market comic shops, which by the 1980s had become the dominant outlet for comic books.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of their debut album, Since I Left You, the Avalanches {{continued}} to produce music and were touring until 2003. At least one track from the album's final cut had begun taking shape in 2000. One of the group's earliest collaborations was with Luke Steele in 2003, creating [...] "tripped out rock 'n' roll" [...] with both Steele and Di Blasi singing. Remnants of this project {{are reflected in the}} track [...] "Colours" [...] (2016). Until the mid-2000s, the group continued producing new music, although there was no coherent theme between the tracks nor any plans for a studio record. Robbie Chater was ill for three years during this time with two auto-immune diseases which left him unable to produce music. He underwent a treatment using ibogaine, a potent hallucinogenic drug. In February 2005, Darren Seltmann said the album was a <b>work-in-progress</b> and described it as [...] "ambient world music". He also stated the album would include both sampling and live music. In August 2006, Modular Recordings issued a press release stating [...] "it's sounding like everything we dared not hope for, and so much more. They've made the record of their lives basically". This was in response to a joke email which had reached the music press, in which Modular claimed it had rejected the group's new album. In January 2007, the band stated via its website that roughly 40tracks were being considered for the record, but no estimated arrival date could be provided. Subsequent announcements and rumors were circulated {{for the next few years}} promising release dates and blaming sample clearance for the album's delay; however no new material was released during this time.|$|E
500|$|Agni's Philosophy is a tech demo {{created by}} Square Enix {{to show off}} the {{capacities}} of Luminous Studio. The demo was a collaboration between the cinematic Visual Works division—a section of the company generally associated with CGI movie production for the company's video games—and Square Enix's R department, Advanced Technology Division, with a goal to create a real-time graphics tech demo that has a quality coming {{as close as possible to}} pre-rendered CGI. Development of the demo took approximately half a year. Unlike previous technology demos created by the company, which were based on pre-existing games, Square Enix decided to create something completely original. The demo was themed around the Final Fantasy series: during discussions, the team asked the question [...] "What is Final Fantasy?", broke down its basic components and used them, along with added unusual elements, in the demo. A focus during the demo's development was the creation of Agni, the central character. For the demo, as it was a <b>work-in-progress,</b> they optimized it for graphical performance. While the story and themes were created by the Japanese staff, many of the character designs were done by staff from their western subsidiaries. The technology to create the demo was all sourced from then-existing high-end PCs. An initial mock up of Agni's hair was created using a mannequin and wig styled by a professional make-up artist. Each character's face was constructed around mo-capped footage of live actors, then tweaked and expanded in post-production. The entire development process, from conception through development, took approximately a year. Agni's Philosophy was first shown at E3 2012 as part of a special presentation by Square Enix. As part of the presentation, guest speakers paused the demo and adjusted elements of the characters on the fly {{to show off the}} engine's customization features. It was also shown at SIGGRAPH 2012.|$|E
500|$|On 30 August 1942, at {{the time}} when Stanley was {{preparing}} the draft drawings of the murals, the Japanese began an action which would become known as the Selarang Barracks Incident. It was an incident concerning seventeen thousand Anglo-Australian POWs, who were forced to vacate their buildings and be exposed for nearly five days in the open without water or sanitation for refusing to sign a [...] "No Escape Pledge". Against this backdrop, Stanley began to paint the murals. No one had asked the Japanese for permission to draw and at no stage did they interfere with his work. Considering the purpose of the murals, Stanley felt that the Chapel was basically dedicated to peace and reconciliation, and so he choose universal themes for the murals which would embrace all mankind. Paint was not readily available in the camp, but with the aid of the other prisoners, who unquestionably put themselves at great risk, materials to make the paint were gradually acquired—brown camouflage paint, a small amount of crimson paint, white oil paint and billiard chalk were found and brought for Stanley use. Despite still being very ill, Stanley set to work on the murals in early September 1942. His illness meant that he could only paint for a limited period each day, for perhaps 15 minutes at a time followed by a rest. To compensate {{as much as he could}} for the lack of coloured paint, Stanley resorted to using large brush strokes and big areas of solid colour when painting. In September 1942, a few weeks after Stanley began painting the murals, he was informed that his work party was to be sent north to Thailand to work on the Thai-Burma Railway. A colonel in charge of the hospital, who knew of his <b>work-in-progress</b> murals, intervened to have Stanley transferred back to the hospital so that he could continue on his work in the Chapel. Most of Stanley's unit who went to the Thai-Burma Railway never returned. Stanley recounted: [...] "Had I gone with them, most certainly, I would have died. So the murals very directly saved my life in the way I could never have foreseen... It's a terrible sense of debt... that one feels to the chapel." ...|$|E
