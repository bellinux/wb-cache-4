2500|$|To {{understand}} {{the principle of}} a heat sink, consider Fourier's law of heat conduction. [...] Fourier's law of heat conduction, simplified to a one-dimensional form in the x-direction, shows that {{when there is a}} temperature gradient in a body, heat <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>from</b> the higher temperature region to the lower temperature region. The rate at which heat is transferred by conduction, , is proportional to the product of the temperature gradient and the cross-sectional area through which heat is transferred.|$|E
2500|$|A {{negative}} {{temperature is}} experimentally achieved with suitable radio frequency techniques that cause a population inversion of spin {{states from the}} ground state. As the energy in the system increases upon population of the upper states, the entropy increases as well, as the system becomes less ordered, but attains a maximum value when the spins are evenly distributed among ground and excited states, after which it begins to decrease, once again achieving a state of higher order as the upper states begin to fill exclusively. At the point of maximum entropy, the temperature function shows {{the behavior of a}} singularity, because the slope of the entropy function decreases to zero at first and then turns negative. Since temperature is the inverse of the derivative of the entropy, the temperature formally goes to infinity at this point, and switches to negative infinity as the slope turns negative. At energies higher than this point, the spin degree of freedom therefore exhibits formally a negative thermodynamic temperature. As the energy increases further by continued population of the excited state, the negative temperature approaches zero asymptotically. [...] As the energy of the system increases in the population inversion, a system with a negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero, but rather it has a higher energy than at positive temperature, and may be said to be in fact hotter at negative temperatures. When brought into contact with a system at a positive temperature, energy <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>from</b> the negative temperature regime to the positive temperature region.|$|E

50|$|The chief {{cause of}} cork taint is the {{presence}} of the chemical compounds 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA) or 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA) in the wine, which in many cases <b>will</b> have <b>been</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>from</b> the cork, but which also can have <b>been</b> <b>transferred</b> through the cork rather than from it. TCA is a compound which does not occur naturally. It is created when some fungi are treated with chlorinated phenolic compounds, which are a type of antimicrobial agent used in the processing of wood. This compound is one of the chief factors responsible for the problem associated with mold liable to be found in cork. Very small amounts of this compound, on the order of nanograms, can be responsible for this defect. Corked wine containing TCA has a characteristic odor, variously described as resembling a moldy newspaper, wet dog, damp cloth, or damp basement. In almost all cases of corked wine the wine's native aromas are reduced significantly, and a very tainted wine is quite unpalatable, although harmless. While the human threshold for detecting TCA is measured in the single-digit parts per trillion, this can vary by several orders of magnitude depending on an individual's sensitivity. Detection is also complicated by the olfactory system's particularly quick habituation to TCA, making the smell less obvious on each subsequent sniff.|$|R
30|$|Zinc ferrite is a {{promising}} microwave absorber; however, {{it is quite}} heavy due to high density, which restricts its utilization in applications requiring lightweight materials [4]. ZnFe 2 O 4 /CNTs composites may provide immediate advantage over ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles because of the relatively low density of the composites. In addition, it has been demonstrated that encapsulation of paramagnetic particles into CNTs leads to paramagnetic needles whose movements can be controlled [5]. Despite these advantages, encapsulating ferrites inside the nanotubes lead to effects which are not yet fully understood and explored. For example, in addition to ambiguous electronic and magnetic effects of the catalyst used to prepare the CNTs, it is unclear if there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> electron <b>transfer</b> <b>from</b> the host CNTs to the encapsulated ferrites or vice versa. Also, it is anticipated that stress in CNTs with small inner diameters (IDs) causes deformation of the encapsulated particles, consequently affecting their magnetic properties. In addition to that, the nanoparticles can adopt the internal shape of the CNTs and accommodate themselves along the tubes axis leading to enhancement of the magnetic anisotropy, which affects the blocking temperature of the composite system. Furthermore, the tendency of nanoparticles to agglomerate inside the tubes can influence the magnetic properties rendering them similar properties of large particles.|$|R
