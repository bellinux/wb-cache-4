5|$|Another {{influence}} of the Liao cultural tradition {{is seen in the}} Yuan dynasty's zaju (杂剧) theater, its associated orchestration, and the qu (曲) and sanqu (散曲) forms of Classical Chinese poetry. One documented way in <b>which</b> <b>this</b> influence occurred was through the incorporation of Khitan officers and men into the service of the Mongol forces during the first Mongol invasion of 1211 to 1215. This northern route of cultural transmission of the legacy of Liao culture was then returned to China during the Yuan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Another {{narrative}} on the constellations, three paragraphs long, {{is from a}} Latin writer whose brief notes {{have come}} down to us {{under the name of}} Hyginus. It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, <b>which</b> <b>this</b> source ascribes to Callimachus and Aristomachus, and sets the location at Thebes or Chios. Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon; a modern critic suggests this is the original version.|$|E
5|$|As {{coenzyme}} Q {{is reduced}} to ubiquinol {{on the inner side}} of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by <b>which</b> <b>this</b> occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.|$|E

5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at <b>which</b> <b>this</b> occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E
5|$|Divergent {{evolution}} of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease superfamilies have evolved from one nucleophile to another.

Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by <b>which</b> <b>this</b> happen are still unclear.|$|E

5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named after the Hawaiian volcanoes with <b>which</b> <b>this</b> eruptive type is hallmark.

The volume of ejected material from Hawaiian eruptions {{is less than half}} of that found in other eruptive types. Steady production of small amounts of lava builds up the large, broad form of a shield volcano. Eruptions are not centralized at the main summit as with other volcanic types, and often occur at vents around the summit and from fissure vents radiating out of the center.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems.

By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition or a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer.
