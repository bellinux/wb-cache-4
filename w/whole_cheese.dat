40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The unique {{flavor of}} high quality Swiss cheese is {{difficult}} to reproduce in commercial market cheese. Swiss cheese flavor has never been duplicated or thoroughly understood. New techniques and advances in flavor research have enabled better definition and understanding of food flavors. Therefore, it was desirable to make a detailed investigation of Swiss cheese flavor. Neutral volatile flavor compounds were isolated from Swiss cheese fat by low-temperature low-pressure distillation. The compounds were separated by temperature programmed gas chromatography. Direct analysis of cheese fat and <b>whole</b> <b>cheese</b> from four domestic and two imported good flavored cheeses by gas entrainment and on-column trapping provided a further means of isolation of volatile flavor compounds in Swiss cheese. Gas chromatography in conjunction with rapid scan mass spectrometry and relative retention time data were used to identify compounds. Compounds positively identified by the distillation and on-column trapping techniques were as follows: methanol, ethanol, 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol, 2 -pentanol, trans- 2 -hexene- 1 -ol, 2 -phenylethanol, acetaldehyde, 2 -methyl propanal, 2 -methyl butyraldehyde, benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, acetone, butanone, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, 2 -pentadecanone, hexane, octane, 1 -octene, nonane, 1 -nonene, dodecane, pentadecane, toluene, α-pinene, methyl acetate, methyl hexanoate, methyl octanoate, methyl decanoate, ethyl propionate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, butyl acetate, 3 -methyl butyl acetate, γ-valerolactone, γ-dodecalactone, δ-octalactone, δ-decalactone, δ-dodecalactone, dimethyl sulfide, diacetyl, benzothiazole, o-dichlorobenzene, 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene, di-isobutyl adipate, and chloroform. Compounds tentatively identified include an aromatic hydrocarbon, pinane, α-fenchene, ethyl benzene, a di-methyl benzene, methyl benzoate, 2 -phenyl- 2 -methyl butane, 5 -methyl- 5 -ethyl decane, 3 -methyl butyl octanoate, 2, 5 -dimethyl tetra decane, methyl vinyl ether and 2 -methyl propenal. The concentration of selected volatile compounds identified by the on-column trapping technique were determined by relating their peak heights to known quantities of compound. Average concentrations calculated from the mean values for all the six cheeses and expressed in parts per million were as follows: dimethyl sulfide. 0. 107; diacetyl, 0. 8; acetaldehyde, 1. 4; acetone, 1. 6; butanone, 0. 3; 2 -methyl butyraldehyde, 0. 42; 2 -pentanone, 0. 98; 2 -heptanone, 0. 45; ethanol, 16. 3; 2 -butanol, 0. 3; 1 -propanol, 2. 9; 1 -butanol, 0. 7; methyl hexanoate, 1. 5; and ethyl butanoate, 0. 6. Liquid-liquid partition chromatography and gas chromatography were utilized to determine quantitatively the major free, fatty acids in the six Swiss cheeses. 2 -Methyl butyric acid was detected in all cheeses and varied from 9. 0 to 100. 0 mg/kg cheese. The other isomeric acid, 3 -methyl butyric, was detected in only two cheeses. Formic acid was detected in only one cheese. No n-valeric or 2 -methyl propionic acids were detected.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{elaborate}} methods for the detailed examination of proteolysis pathways in cheese (reviewed in Chapter 1) and to demonstrate their usefulness. Many techniques, including solvent fractionation, chromatographic separation and electrophoresis have been used previously and were revisited in this study. Gel electrophoresis can be a powerful technique and was examined in detail. The methods investigated were: 1) a slab gel system using the apparatus of the E-C Apparatus Corporation and a polyacrylamide gel in a Tris-EDTA-borate buffer at alkaline pH and containing urea; 2) a mini-slab gel system using the Bio-Rad mini-Protean II apparatus, a polyacrylamide stacking and resolving gel with a discontinuous (Tris-chloride/Tris-EDTA-borate) buffer system that contained urea; 3) a mini-slab gel system using the Bio-Rad mini-Protean II apparatus, a polyacrylamide stacking and resolving gel and acetic acid-ammonium acetate buffers at acidic pH that contained urea; 4) a mini-slab gel system using the Bio-Rad mini-Protean II apparatus, a polyacrylamide gel with a stacking and resolving gel in Tris-HCl buffers containing sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and a Tris-chloride-glycine electrode buffer. The mini-slab alkaline urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) method was considered to be the most suitable for monitoring the loss of intact casein during cheese ripening. However, SDS-PAGE gave good resolution of para-κ-casein, β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin and it could therefore be used for the analysis of cheese in which whey proteins have been incorporated or for monitoring the breakdown of para-κ-casein (Chapter 4) in cheese. Two-dimensional PAGE revealed the presence of more bands than were visible using any single method of electrophoresis. Traces of protein were found to lie beneath the α 31 -casein band and this explained why, even after considerable proteolysis, some α 31 -casein appeared to remain. Storing cheese samples in such a way that there is a minimum of further change was examined using several different storage methods and temperatures, including storage as: freeze-dried powder at 4 °C in the dark, frozen at - 9, - 16, - 35,- 75 and - 100 °C, and dissolved in 6 M urea solution and stored at 4 and - 16 °C. The trial ran for 6 months and involved the multiple sampling and detailed analysis of three Cheddar cheeses by reversed phase fast protein liquid chromatography (RP-FPLC) for the water-soluble fraction (WSF) and alkaline urea-PAGE for the protein fraction. None of the methods used to store the cheese samples was completely satisfactory. Cheese stored at temperatures of - 9 and - 16 °C was unstable, with proteolysis discernible after 66 days. Storage of cheese samples at these temperatures is, therefore, not recommended. Cheese stored at temperatures of - 35, - 75 and - 100 °C was unstable after 94 days, although the samples stored at - 100 °C were more stable. This lack of stability probably arose during thawing as well as during storage of the frozen cheese samples. Storage of freeze-dried samples at 4 °C in the dark was equivalent to storing the frozen cheese at - 100 °C. Storage of samples in alkaline urea sample buffer was better at - 16 °C than at 4 ° but should be for no longer than 1 month. An indication of the differences to be expected within the normal range of Cheddar cheese was determined using three very similar Cheddar cheeses ripened at 5 and 13 °C (Chapter 3, part II). Cheeses ripened at 5 °C for 6 months were similar to those ripened at 13 °C for 2 months and the proteolytic pathways appeared to the same at both temperatures. The proteolytic pathways in Cheddar and Mozzarella cheeses, manufactured according to standard protocols, ripened at 13 °C and sampled at regular intervals over a six month period were examined using a variety of techniques: total nitrogen (TN), non- protein nitrogen (NPN), water-soluble nitrogen (WSN), alkaline urea-PAGE, low molecular weight (LMW) SDS-PAGE, RP-FPLC and size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC). The TN and NPN analyses were done at the time of sampling whereas the other assays were done on samples that had been stored at <- 75 °C so that they could be analysed simultaneously. The increase in WSN and NPN was greater in Cheddar cheese than in Mozzarella cheese and reflected the greater microbial enzyme activity in this cheese type. Alkaline urea-PAGE revealed that there was more α 31 -casein hydrolysis (with the formation of α 31 -casein-I) in Cheddar cheese than in Mozzarella cheese, indicating that rennet activity was greater in Cheddar cheese. The presence of peptides believed to be β-I- (β-casein fl- 189 / 192) and β-II-casein (β-casein fl- 165) indicated that rennet may have hydrolysed β-casein. The amount of β-casein hydrolysis (and γ-casein formation) was greater in Mozzarella cheese, reflecting the greater plasmin activity in this cheese type. Both LMW SDS-PAGE and SE-HPLC of the <b>whole</b> <b>cheese</b> provided little additional information. Examination of the WSF of each cheese by PAGE analysis showed that many of the larger peptides may have been present in both cheese types. The different concentrations of these peptides in each cheese type were consistent with different rennet and plasmin activities and suggested that they may have been products of these enzymes. RP-FPLC and SE-HPLC analysis of the WSF of Cheddar cheese revealed that, although the larger peptides continued to accumulate during ripening, there was also a large increase in the amount of small peptides and amino acids in the cheese. In the Mozzarella cheese, the larger peptides accumulated and there was little evidence of their further hydrolysis to small peptides and amino acids. The present studies indicate that SE-HPLC using a Toyo-Soda SW 2000 column and a 36 % acetonitrile/ 0. 1 % trifluoroacetic acid solvent system is a promising new technique that may be useful in determining cheese type and maturity and in relating changes in the molecular weight distribution of the peptides to changes in the textural, functional and flavour characteristics of cheese. It was concluded that the results are consistent with the concept that differences in the manufacture of Cheddar and Mozzarella cheeses result in the formation of two cheeses, each with different amounts of similar enzymes (rennet, plasmin, and the enzymes of the starter and non-starter lactic acid bacteria), and that these differences in enzyme concentration, combined with the modifying effect of pH, temperature, moisture content and S/M, result in different enzyme activities and patterns of proteolysis in the two types of cheese and these,in turn, result in cheeses with different functional properties...|$|E

The guests throw food at each other while Andy, Woody and the mouse stuff themselves—that is, until Wally starts using a shotgun. This breaks up the party and is a great help in sending Woody hopping madly over the hill.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES. This {{research}} used food frequency data {{to investigate}} dietary patterns associated with fat intake. METHODS. Data from the 1987 National Health Interview Survey of 20, 143 adults {{were used to}} determine correlations between fat (adjusted for kilocalories) and both nutrient and food group intakes. Median food and nutrient intakes were determined within quartiles of percentage of kilocalories from fat. RESULTS. Intakes of vegetables, fruits, cereals, fish/chicken, low-fat milk, alcoholic beverages, vitamin C, percentage of kilocalories from carbohydrates, carotenoids, folate, dietary fiber, carbohydrates, and vitamin A decreased as percentage of kilocalories from fat increased. Intakes of salty snacks, peanuts, processed and red meats, <b>whole</b> milk and <b>cheese,</b> desserts, eggs, fried potatoes, table fats, cholesterol, vitamin E, sodium, protein, and energy increased with percentage of kilocalories from fat. Results by demographic subgroups showed few differences from those found in the total population. CONCLUSIONS. Fat intake is consistently associated with specific dietary patterns. Such patterns need to be evaluated concurrently in studies of diet and chronic disease...|$|R
40|$|There is some {{evidence}} that dietary factors may modify the risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin, but the association between food intake and SCC has not been evaluated prospectively. We examined the association between food intake and SCC incidence among 1, 056 randomly selected adults living in an Australian sub-tropical community. Measurement-error corrected estimates of intake in 15 food groups were defined from a validated food frequency questionnaire in 1992. Associations with SCC risk were assessed using Poisson and negative binomial regression to the persons affected and tumour counts, respectively, based on incident, histologically confirmed tumours occurring between 1992 and 2002. After multivariable adjustment, none of the food groups was significantly associated with SCC risk. Stratified analysis in participants with a past history of skin cancer showed a decreased risk of SCC tumours for high intakes of green leafy vegetables (RR = 0. 45, 95 % CI = 0. 22 - 0. 91; p for trend = 0. 02) and an increased risk for high intake of unmodified dairy products (RR = 2. 53, 95 % CI: 1. 15 - 5. 54; p for trend = 0. 03). Food intake was not associated with SCC risk in persons who had no past history of skin cancer. These findings suggest that consumption of green leafy vegetables may help prevent development of subsequent SCCs of the skin among people with previous skin cancer and that consumption of unmodified dairy products, such as <b>whole</b> milk, <b>cheese</b> and yoghurt, may increase SCC risk in susceptible persons...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of dietary}} {{patterns}} to assess dietary intake {{has become increasingly}} common in nutritional epidemiology studies due to the complexity and multidimensionality of the diet. Currently, two main approaches {{have been widely used}} to assess dietary patterns: data-driven and hypothesis-driven analysis. Since the methods explore different angles of dietary intake, using both approaches simultaneously might yield complementary and useful information; thus, we aimed to use both approaches to gain knowledge of adolescents’ dietary patterns. Food intake from a cross-sectional survey with 295 adolescents was assessed by 24 h dietary recall (24 HR). In hypothesis-driven analysis, based on the American National Cancer Institute method, the usual intake of Brazilian Healthy Eating Index Revised components were estimated. In the data-driven approach, the usual intake of foods/food groups was estimated by the Multiple Source Method. In the results, hypothesis-driven analysis showed low scores for Whole grains, Total vegetables, Total fruit and Whole fruits), while, in data-driven analysis, fruits and whole grains were not presented in any pattern. High intakes of sodium, fats and sugars were observed in hypothesis-driven analysis with low total scores for Sodium, Saturated fat and SoFAA (calories from solid fat, alcohol and added sugar) components in agreement, while the data-driven approach showed the intake of several foods/food groups rich in these nutrients, such as butter/margarine, cookies, chocolate powder, <b>whole</b> milk, <b>cheese,</b> processed meat/cold cuts and candies. In this study, using both approaches at the same time provided consistent and complementary information with regard to assessing the overall dietary habits that will be important in order to drive public health programs, and improve their efficiency to monitor and evaluate the dietary patterns of populations...|$|R
