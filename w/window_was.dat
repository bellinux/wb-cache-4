50|$|The Perpendicular <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> {{mostly of}} the 3-light variety, {{though there is}} a 4-light east window. A traceried Perpendicular <b>window</b> <b>is</b> located above a doorway while other traceried <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> located at the church's upper stage. The chancel's east <b>window</b> <b>is</b> adorned with bosses.|$|R
50|$|The Engadin <b>window</b> <b>is</b> not {{the only}} place where penninic units are exposed within the austroalpine. The Tauern <b>window</b> <b>is</b> the largest one and lies east of the Engadin window. The Gargellen <b>window</b> in Vorarlberg <b>is</b> the {{smallest}} one. The Rechnitzer <b>window</b> <b>is</b> the easternmost tectonic window.|$|R

5|$|Carte died at his London {{home from}} dropsy {{and heart disease}} in 1901, just short of his 57th birthday. He is buried in the churchyard of St. Andrew's church in Fairlight, East Sussex, near his parents' graves.

5|$|The Lady Chapel {{has five}} windows, of which four date from 1325–30 and include {{images of a}} local saint, Dunstan. The east <b>window</b> <b>was</b> {{restored}} to a semblance of its original appearance by Thomas Willement in 1845. The other windows have complete canopies, but the pictorial sections are fragmented.|$|E
50|$|The direct {{children}} of the root <b>window</b> <b>are</b> called top-level <b>windows.</b> These <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> usually drawn with a decorative frame and a title bar (which are actually added by the window manager). The top-level <b>windows</b> <b>are,</b> informally, the regular windows in the terminology of most GUIs. The <b>windows</b> that <b>are</b> not top-level are used for buttons, textboxes, etc.|$|R
30|$|When {{the basic}} {{windows and the}} lengths of the basic <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> all the same, we get self-multiplication window in section  2.1.

50|$|Double-hung sash <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> {{traditionally}} often {{fitted with}} shutters. Sash <b>windows</b> can <b>be</b> fitted with simplex hinges that let the <b>window</b> <b>be</b> locked into hinges on one side, while the rope {{on the other}} side <b>is</b> detached—so the <b>window</b> can <b>be</b> opened for fire escape or cleaning.|$|R

The original launch <b>window</b> <b>was</b> 6min 57secs and the countdown had begun on schedule. The crew was on board when the postponement was called at the T-minus 5minute mark at approximately 7:51am EST (12:51UTC).|$|E
5|$|Two barns and a {{warehouse}} were destroyed, {{and a large}} stained-glass <b>window</b> <b>was</b> shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries {{were associated with the}} storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1million.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's first signing in the {{transfer}} <b>window</b> <b>was</b> Cameroon international Lauren Etame Mayer from Mallorca {{for an estimated}} fee of £7 million. Robert Pirès moved to Arsenal in July 2000 and was later joined by Brazilian Edu; both players were transferred from Marseille and Corinthians respectively. Striker Guy Demel signed for Arsenal a month later and after weeks of transfer speculation, Sylvain Wiltord joined on a club-record fee from Bordeaux, believed to be £13 million. Defenders Igors Stepanovs and Sebastian Svärd were purchased during the season, as well as forward Tomas Danilevičius, who impressed on a trial spell.|$|E
5000|$|In the X Window System, every <b>window</b> <b>is</b> {{contained}} within another window, called its parent. This makes the windows form a hierarchy. The root <b>window</b> <b>is</b> {{the root of}} this hierarchy. It is {{as large as the}} screen, and all other <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> either children or descendants of it.|$|R
5000|$|While Modular <b>Windows</b> <b>was</b> discontinued, other modular, {{embedded}} {{versions of}} <b>Windows</b> <b>were</b> later released. These include Windows CE and Windows XP Embedded.|$|R

5|$|Decay {{had set in}} and {{the roof}} of the eastern limb {{collapsed}} during a gale on 4 December 1637. In 1640 the General Assembly ordered Gilbert Ross, the minister of St Giles kirk, to remove the rood screen which still partitioned the choir and presbytery from the nave. Ross was assisted in this by the Lairds of Innes and Brodie who chopped it up for firewood. It is believed that the destruction of the great west <b>window</b> <b>was</b> caused by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers sometime between 1650 and 1660.|$|E
5|$|Digital Devil Saga {{was officially}} {{announced}} {{for the west}} at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo for release {{in the winter of}} that year. It was subsequently delayed into 2005, and a delux edition which would include a box for containing both Digital Devil Saga games was announced as a consolation. The second game's release <b>window</b> <b>was</b> officially announced at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo, to be published in North America by Atlus USA. The game arrived in stores in North America a week earlier than originally scheduled. Both Digital Devil Saga games were published in Europe by Ghostlight.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} {{hour of the}} fire it spread onto the 23rd and 24th floors. Heavy smoke was {{building}} up in the stairwells and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned {{to go to the}} top level to ventilate the stairwell. The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down. Permission to break the <b>window</b> <b>was</b> given and a search and rescue effort was initiated.|$|E
500|$|Two-piece <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> {{located at}} each seat row.

50|$|A Stained glass <b>window</b> <b>is</b> a <b>window</b> {{composed}} {{of pieces of}} colored glass, transparent, translucent or opaque, frequently portraying persons or scenes. Typically the glass in these <b>windows</b> <b>is</b> separated by lead glazing bars. Stained glass <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> popular in Victorian houses and some Wrightian houses, and are especially common in churches.|$|R
5|$|Executive {{producer}} R. W. Goodwin recalls {{being on}} {{location for the}} episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a window. The room used for the scene had two windows side-by-side, and one had been replaced with sugar glass for the stunt. When the false <b>window</b> <b>was</b> blown out to simulate someone being thrown through it, the crew found that the glass window beside the false one had also accidentally been blown out. The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside his body to explain the second window breaking.|$|E
5|$|Fixtures {{include a}} marble font which is {{contemporary}} with the church. There is much stained glass: the oldest, {{in the form}} of heraldic emblems in cartouches, dates from 1562 and is visible in the Diocletian window in the east wall and in another window on the southwest side. The east <b>window</b> <b>was</b> erected in memory of Sir Frank Stapleton, rector of Mereworth 1832–74. Other similar glass dates from the 17th and 18th centuries. Another, depicting the Raising of Lazarus, was designed by Frederic Shields for the Heaton, Butler and Bayne firm in 1889.|$|E
5|$|It is {{currently}} occupied by an office development, also called Greyfriars, {{and parts of}} Bristol Dental School. Traces of the abbot's house were discovered during building works in 1989 and a small oval <b>window</b> <b>was</b> incorporated into the new building. Archaeological investigations have found graves with human remains, dating to the thirteenth to fifteenth century, and a medieval conduit, similar to one excavated at Saint Augustine's Abbey in Bristol.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Windows</b> <b>are</b> all of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Larger <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> double-pane, but the {{box frame}} {{construction}} {{does not allow}} for wall pockets for sash weights. <b>Windows</b> must <b>be</b> propped open with a stick. Upper story <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> fixed sash. Interior and exterior <b>window</b> surrounds <b>are</b> all rough-sawn cedar. <b>Window</b> sills <b>are</b> cedar. Attic rafters are rough-sawn 2"x6" [...] cedar. Roof shakes were 3 ft-long straight-split cedar. Remnant shakes remain in the attic space, but the roof was replaced with metal in the 1960s. Interior and exterior door surrounds are all 1"x5" [...] rough-sawn cedar. Hinges and most interior locksets are original.|$|R
50|$|All <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> replacements. They <b>are</b> {{aluminum}} <b>windows</b> with horizontal lights, {{the lower}} light being operable. First floor windows sit within arched wood frames and rest on bracketed stone sills with paneled spandrel beneath. Second floor <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> ornamented by a flat limestone lintel with keystone. Third floor <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> ornamented by limestone keystones.|$|R
5|$|Life's Shop <b>Window</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} film produced, rather than simply distributed, by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company, the {{corporate}} predecessor to Fox Film. Several reviewers approved of the film's expurgated treatment of the novel's plot, although opinions {{of the quality of}} the film itself were mixed. It proved very popular upon its initial release in New York, and that success was used to advertise the film elsewhere. Like many of Fox's early works, it was likely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the windows}} contain clear leaded glass, but some have stained glass. In 2010, a two-panel stained glass window {{depicting}} {{the work of the}} RAF Search and Rescue units at RAF Valley was dedicated by the RAF's Chaplain-in-Chief, Ray Pentland. The window, which also commemorates the work of the Royal National Lifeboat Institute and the RAF Mountain Rescue Service, was created by Karen Newby– wife of a former RAF Valley station commander– and Lindsey Abbott. Karen Newby also designed a window dedicated in 2001 to mark the work of 208 Squadron at RAF Valley. Another stained glass <b>window</b> <b>was</b> added in 2012 to mark the 100th anniversary of 4Squadron.|$|E
5|$|St Peter's {{is made up}} {{of three}} parts, {{including}} a mid-19th-century west tower, which replaced the original in 1859–60 after it fell down. The perpendicular clerestory is decorated with shields in quatrefoils and is lit with closely set three-light windows. The tall decorated chancel has very large windows. The side windows have reticulated tracery. The large east <b>window</b> <b>was</b> partly rebuilt in 1875–76, and is composed of six lights with two large mouchettes nodding to each other, as well as a very large reticulation unit.|$|E
5000|$|Two-piece <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> {{located at}} each seat row. Each <b>window</b> <b>is</b> 24 by 66 in. Integral blinds were {{rejected}} {{in favor of}} curtains on maintenance grounds.
