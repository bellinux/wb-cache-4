5|$|Elected {{a fellow}} of Trinity in 1884, Whitehead <b>would</b> <b>teach</b> and write on {{mathematics}} and physics at the college until 1910, spending the 1890s writing his Treatise on Universal Algebra (1898), and the 1900s collaborating with his former pupil, Bertrand Russell, on {{the first edition of}} Principia Mathematica.

5|$|After {{getting his}} degree, O'Donnell moved to Chicago, where he {{expected}} that he <b>would</b> <b>teach</b> at the American Conservatory of Music. The job fell through, and instead {{he worked as}} a grip in the film and television business. O'Donnell began his musical career in the field after one of his colleagues who knew of his music background approached him to write for his film. O'Donnell talked to his friend Michael Salvatori, who had his own recording studio, and offered to split the profits from the job with him; the two became constant partners.|$|E

5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} to be the primary domain of schools, even after they had become more common. Most education was carried out by a child's parents or foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that a foster family <b>would</b> <b>teach</b> the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also {{played a central role in}} a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.|$|E

5|$|In 1950 while {{teaching}} {{political science and}} serving as dean of students at Willamette, Hatfield began his political career by winning election to the Oregon House of Representatives as a Republican. He defeated six others for the seat {{at a time when}} state assembly elections were still determined by county-wide votes. He served for two terms representing Marion County and Salem in the lower chamber of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. At the time he was the youngest legislator in Oregon and still lived at his parents' home. Hatfield <b>would</b> <b>teach</b> early-morning classes and then walk {{across the street to the}} Capitol to legislate.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Belgrano {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{politicians}} to advocate the development of an important educative system. He did so at the first report he made as head of the Consulate of Commerce, suggesting the creating of schools of agriculture and commerce. A school of agriculture <b>would</b> <b>teach</b> about important topics such as crop rotation, the specific ways to work with each crop, methods of seeding and harvesting, preservation of seeds, and identification of pests. Until that time, the only previous attempts to teach agriculture was done by the Jesuits, who were banished in 1767.|$|E
5|$|The {{spectacular}} play {{died out}} with the Restoration period, but spectacle would continue on the English stage as the splendours of Italian grand opera hit London in the early 18th century. The dangerous Restoration economic spiral of the ever-more-expensive machine plays <b>would</b> <b>teach</b> 18th- and 19th-century theatrical entrepreneurs to dispense with playwrighting altogether and minimise the cast, utilising any number of surprising effects and scenes in the dumbshow of pantomime and Harlequin, without attendant costs in music, dramatists, and cast.|$|E

5|$|Jack Black and Kyle Gass {{initially}} met in Los Angeles in 1985, both {{members of}} the theatre troupe, The Actors' Gang. Black admits the duo did not {{see eye to eye}} due to animosity between the two as Gass was the main musician for the Actor's Gang and felt threatened by Black. The Actor's Gang travelled to Edinburgh, Scotland for Edinburgh Fringe in 1989. They were performing Tim Robbins' and Adam Simon's play Carnage. After arriving home from the trip, the two became close friends and Black would regularly visit Gass's Cochran Avenue studio apartment in the deal that Gass <b>would</b> <b>teach</b> Black guitar in return for food, mainly from fast-food chain Jack in the Box.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he <b>would</b> <b>teach</b> to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them to do what you want.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 August the Immigration Department issued 2,180 passes to workers and agents to collect visas and submit {{applications}} to work in Hong Kong, promising to handle all applications submitted. Offices opened one hour earlier than usual, added staff and extended their hours to guarantee that all 2,180 cases would be processed. The Philippine consulate also expected a large workload {{as a result of}} the rehiring provisions. Chinese newspapers published articles calculating how households could maximise their benefits under the waiver rules. Street protests on 3 August decried the waiver's unfairness and its burden on the Immigration Department. According to one protester, the waiver <b>would</b> <b>teach</b> households how to use legal loopholes.|$|E

5|$|That year, Chisholm {{revived the}} South African College of Music where he {{eventually}} <b>would</b> <b>teach</b> composer Stefans Grové and singer Désirée Talbot.

25|$|In Jerusalem, {{foundations}} {{were laid}} for a Jewish University (the Hebrew University), one that <b>would</b> <b>teach</b> only in Hebrew {{and that the}} Zionists hoped would help them prove their usefulness to the Turks (this {{did not come to}} fruition until 1918).
