5|$|We tried {{a similar}} {{approach}} for The Little Shop of Horrors, dropping {{in and out of}} various downtown dives. <b>We</b> <b>ended</b> up at a place where Sally Kellerman (before she became a star) was working as a waitress, and as Chuck and I vied with each other, trying to top each other’s sardonic or subversive ideas, appealing to Sally as a referee, she {{sat down at the table}} with us, and the three of us worked out the rest of the story together.|$|E
25|$|Herbert Sutcliffe {{needed some}} getting out. He {{was a great}} battler for England and for Yorkshire. He never gave his wicket away unless he was {{satisfied}} he had made enough already. With Percy Holmes he formed just about the finest opening partnership I bowled against. I got him out cheaply a few times, but he scored a few hundreds against my bowling, so I reckon <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> up just about square.|$|E

500|$|Liliom was {{a tragedy}} {{about a man}} who cannot learn to live with other people. [...] The way Molnár wrote it, the man ends up hitting his {{daughter}} and then having to go back to purgatory, leaving his daughter helpless and hopeless. [...] We couldn't accept that. [...] The way <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> Carousel it may still be a tragedy but it's a hopeful one because in the final scene {{it is clear that the}} child has at last learned how to express herself and communicate with others.|$|E
500|$|American post-rock band Explosions in the Sky {{scored the}} film with music {{composer}} Steve Jablonsky. The band had previously scored Berg's 2004 film Friday Night Lights, and Jablonsky had previously scored Battleship. Jablonsky {{said of the}} collaboration, [...] "It was great. I didn't work directly with them because they're in Austin, Texas and I'm in L.A. I spoke {{to them on the}} phone and I think sixty, sixty‑five percent of the scores is them. <b>We</b> <b>ended</b> up doing our own things. We tried to not have two totally different sounding scores." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, the game's protagonists Juno and Vela were {{designed}} as {{younger and more}} cartoon-like with large heads, but were ultimately changed to a more mature version at Nintendo's request. The game's controls {{were one of the}} main concerns during development. The idea was to retain a character-based game, where players could see the character they were playing, while keeping the tightness and accuracy of first-person shooters. Rare initially attempted to automate the change of view and targeting mode based on the context of the action, but this idea was eventually replaced with a manual system. According to Mountain, [...] "The solution <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> with is a beautiful thing. It feels very old-school to me; difficult, unforgiving, but ultimately precise." ...|$|E

500|$|Unusual filming {{techniques}} were also used. Visual Effects Supervisor John Wash recalls, [...] "We devised a laser effect where a device {{is going into}} his mouth and some other weird lens effects that were going over the scene to give it an alien, other-world-like quality." [...] On the subject of using not only a challengingly minuscule method of filming but also additional sound effects, supervising producer Paul Rabwin recounts, [...] "I had to set up a very, very highly magnified lens to try to get this little device coming right at us. It was very, very scary. <b>We</b> <b>ended</b> up putting some really cool sound effects in there, little servos and motors." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{process of}} putting {{together}} All the Way... A Decade of Song was laborious for all involved, from balancing {{the number of}} hits and new songs to ensuring {{that each of the}} latest tracks showed a new side of Dion. [...] "We had hourly conversations, back and forth, about what the combination should be," [...] said John Doelp, the album's co-executive producer. [...] "We wanted to make sure we had some new sounds and {{that we were able to}} go to new places." [...] Co-executive producer Vito Luprano added: [...] "The first idea was to record three new songs, then Dion said, 'Let's go for five,' her lucky number. But we had so many great songs coming in that <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> up recording nine. Out of that, we decided to go with seven." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers have {{questioned}} the character's sexuality {{since the end of}} the series. Curve magazine speculated that Yar was a [...] "closeted" [...] lesbian. In the book Science Fiction Audiences: Watching Doctor Who and Star Trek, the authors describe her as [...] "an obvious bisexual", but that [...] "she should be a lesbian". Referring to the events in [...] "The Naked Now", the authors explain [...] "when they decided to straighten her, they used an android. So <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> up heterosexualizing two perfectly wonderful characters". The authors of the book Deep Space and Sacred Time: Star Trek in the American Mythos also thought that having Data and Yar consummate sexually was a means to state early on in the series the heterosexuality of the two most androgynous characters in the show.|$|E

500|$|In the band, Joseph {{covered a}} lot of the {{keyboard}} parts that Yanni could not for lack of hands in the shows. He assisted with the task of managing the 30 or more synthesizers onstage, and helped layer with the orchestra to create a [...] "full-bodied, live-effect sound". [...] He did have to adjust some parts that did not work well in a live situation and worked extensively on programming sounds for all keyboardists. [...] Joseph said that [...] "Yanni gave us musicians a great deal of freedom to expand the music as well. If you listen to the original recordings he did and what <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> up with in our live recordings, you can really hear the musician's input." [...] He readily credits Yanni's role in his professional development, and for five years of irreplaceable experiences and memories.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} in her career, Beckinsale began to seek work in the United States, {{something}} she has said wasn't [...] "a conscious decision...My boyfriend was in a play on Broadway so that's why <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> up in New York, and my auditions happened to be for American films." [...] She starred opposite Chloë Sevigny in 1998's The Last Days of Disco. The Whit Stillman film focused {{on a group of}} Ivy League graduates socializing in the Manhattan disco scene of the early 1980s. Beckinsale's attempt at an American accent was widely praised. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt her role as the bossy Charlotte was [...] "beautifully played." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety was unimpressed by the film but noted that [...] "compensations include Beckinsale, looking incredible in a succession of black dresses, whose character can get on your nerves even if the actress doesn't." [...] Her performance earned her a London Critics' Circle Film Award. The film grossed $3million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The other {{material}} on Eat a Peach comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, [...] "When we recorded At Fillmore East, <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> up with almost {{a whole other}} album's worth of good material, and we used [...] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I {{was listening to the}} last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him". He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a [...] "special thanks." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the issue}} of whether {{competitive}} curlers would be offended by the episode, LaZebnik said [...] "When you hear The Simpsons is going to do their take on your sport, you naturally get a little alarmed, But <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> up being respectful I would say, even, surprisingly respectful. Both Homer and Marge take it seriously." [...] Some curlers, including the Clarks and Patzke, felt that the exposure the sport received was beneficial. Cristin Clark said [...] "Although Homer Simpson probably isn't the ideal athlete I would want to see representing our sport, I just think it's great exposure." [...] Canadian curler Randy Ferbey, a four-time world champion, said [...] "I'm sure they're going to somehow make a mockery of it like they do every other thing, but I think you need to take it with a grain of salt. It brings attention to our sport and I think it's wonderful. The more curling on TV, whether it's in an animated form or real form, the better." ...|$|E
500|$|Wolfgang's {{original}} intention {{with the}} album {{was to create a}} collection of previously released b-sides along with three reworked demos, with Eddie saying: [...] "It would [...] a record of our more hardcore songs and none of the pop stuff. That was the initial plan, but the deeper we dug, the more we found. At the same time I was writing new songs. Dave got very excited about that. We all did. <b>We</b> <b>ended</b> up recording demos for 35 songs." [...] After deliberating over whether to self-produce the album or choose a producer from a list that included Rick Rubin and Pat Leonard, Roth suggested John Shanks. Shanks liked the first three songs, and agreed to produce the album, working alongside Wolfgang to pick the demos that would be developed into the album's tracks. While all of Van Halen's albums since 1984 had been produced inside 5150, Roth persuaded the band to work at Henson Recording Studios—where he had been recording for over a decade.|$|E
500|$|For guest roles, puppets {{were mainly}} {{recycled}} from their previous appearances in Thunderbirds Are Go, although the Captain Foster puppet {{was a new}} addition. Puppeteer Wanda Webb recalls that Thunderbird 6 maintained a high standard in the appearance of its cast, commenting on a shot which depicts Lady Penelope asleep on board Skyship One, [...] "I had placed the sleeping eyelids in Plasticine and made the eye shadow a little too blue. <b>We</b> <b>ended</b> up re-shooting the whole sequence." [...] One-use puppets appear in what Supermarionation historian Stephen La Rivière describes as [...] "a contender for the most horrific scene ever produced by Century 21": in the opening scene, the characters of the NWAC executives present gaping mouths and teeth, complete with dental fillings, when Brains' plan to design an airship sends them into howls of laughter. The decision to begin the film with a cold open and delay the title sequence and opening credits was one of Century 21's efforts to distinguish Thunderbird 6 from the preceding film.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{incarnation of}} [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{developed during the}} recording sessions for Achtung Baby. While working in Hansa Ton Studios in Berlin, guitarist The Edge and lead singer Bono created the verse. The track was given the working title [...] "Sinatra" [...] {{in reference to the}} artist whose music inspired it. The group reworked it in preparation of Zooropa. The Edge noted [...] "it came to us in installments". Bassist Adam Clayton said [...] "it was hard to figure out how we would do it. I mean, {{no one is going to}} mistake us for Frank Sinatra's backing band. A very humble little combo sound is what <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> up with and that really worked." [...] The Edge added [...] "I was playing around on piano with some old-school chord progressions trying to summon up the spirit of Frank Sinatra. It's definitely not from a rock and roll tradition." [...] He worked out a chord progression based on old Tin Pan Alley songs.|$|E
500|$|Ultima Underworld II was {{developed}} in nine months. It was originally slated for a February 1993 release, but the date was later moved up to December 1992. The game underwent {{two and a half}} months of playtesting by Origin and Looking Glass employees, and by remote testing firms. According to Church, the testing phase took more time than expected because of complaints from playtesters and the presence of numerous bugs. Church went to Origin's headquarters in Texas during the final stages of development. The team [...] "tried desperately to make Christmas", and the game was completed around December 18. Church compiled the final version on his laptop in Spector's office. However, the game was held back for further playtesting even though it could have shipped on schedule. Church later commented, [...] "here was one bug we couldn't reproduce, and everyone really wanted to go home for Christmas. <b>We</b> <b>ended</b> up taking a few days off, checking it a few more days and using that version anyway." [...] The delay caused the game to miss the holiday season. It was shipped in January 1993.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Wild Night", {{a hybrid of}} R, soul and country music influences, which {{utilizes}} a moderate 4/4 time signature and features the lead guitar playing of Ronnie Montrose. The song's intro was created, according to Montrose, [...] when [...] "One afternoon I was messing around with {{what is now the}} intro on the record, [...] stopped me and ... said ' ... that thing you just played ... that's the intro, don't forget it'". This guitar driven intro in Clinton Heylin's opinion made it one of Morrison's most memorable singles. [...] "Wild Night", which has been described by biographer Ken Brooks as [...] "a great start to the album", was first recorded after the Astral Weeks sessions in Autumn 1968 and was re-recorded numerous times before its eventual release on Tupelo Honey. Morrison recalled during an interview that the song was originally [...] "a much slower number, but when we got to fooling around with it in the studio, <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> up doing it in a faster tempo." ...|$|E
