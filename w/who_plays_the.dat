5|$|Most of {{the cast}} in Vampyr were not {{professional}} actors. Jan Hieronimko, <b>who</b> <b>plays</b> <b>the</b> village doctor, was found on a late night metro train in Paris. When approached {{to act in the}} film, Hieronimko stared blankly and did not reply. Hieronimko later contacted Dreyer's crew and agreed to join the film. Many of the other non-professional actors in the film were found in similar fashion in shops and cafes. The only professional actors in the film were Maurice Schutz, <b>who</b> <b>plays</b> <b>the</b> Lord of the Manor, and Sybille Schmitz, who plays his daughter Léone. Many crew members of Vampyr had worked with Dreyer on his previous film The Passion of Joan of Arc. Returning crew members included cinematographer Rudolph Maté and art director Hermann Warm.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the other}} actors {{that appear in}} the film are Thora Hird, Gordon Jackson, David King-Wood, Harold Lang, Lionel Jeffries and Sam Kydd, many of whom {{appeared}} regularly in films directed by Val Guest.

5|$|Larry Wilmore, <b>who</b> <b>plays</b> <b>the</b> {{sensitivity}} trainer Mr. Brown, is {{a writer}} for the show. At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part yet and Daniels had Wilmore read for the role to fill in. After the read, producer Greg Daniels thought he was perfect for the role. However, because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild, producers still had to have Wilmore formally audition with other actors for the role. Daniels was also not sure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen in the series until the point came in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. Her character in this episode, however, is far from the bubbly, chatty character that Kelly later becomes.|$|E
5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} version {{of that kind of}} dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer <b>who</b> <b>plays</b> <b>the</b> part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.|$|E

40|$|An {{examination}} {{was carried}} out of the influences of concealing academic achievement on self-esteem in an academically relevant social interaction {{based on the assumption}} that concealing socially devalued characteristics should influence individuals' self-esteem during social interactions.

5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{meets his}} girlfriend Elisa's {{grandmother}} (Teresa Yenque). The grandmother {{does not like}} Jack because he reminds her of the Generalissimo, the antagonist from her favorite Mexican telenovela Los Amantes Clandestinos. Jack buys Los Amantes Clandestinos and tries to kill the Generalissimo off, but the actors on the show refuse to cooperate. Jack then meets Hector Moreda (also played by Baldwin), the actor <b>who</b> <b>plays</b> <b>the</b> Generalissimo, and asks why he will not follow the script. According to Hector, {{his role as the}} Generalissimo allows him to cut in line at Disney World, among other perks. Jack shows him a picture of Elisa, explaining that he wants to kill off the character for her. Understanding Jack's feelings, Hector agrees to help Jack by making the character fall in love with an elderly Hispanic woman, thereby winning the affection of Elisa's grandmother. The grandmother subsequently accepts Jack as Elisa's boyfriend, but makes one more request of him: to make NBC News less depressing. Jack responds by airing a montage of pictures of Puerto Rican babies to the music of Tito Puente on The Today Show, much to the displeasure of Matt Lauer.|$|E
