5|$|In 2010, Emanuel was {{reported}} to have conflicts with other senior members of the president's team and ideological clashes over policy. He was also the focal point of criticism from left-leaning Democrats for the administration's perceived move to the center. By September 2010, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> anticipating heavy losses in midterm elections, this was said to precipitate Emanuel's departure as chief of staff.|$|E
5|$|Kemp co-founded the AFL Players Association with Tom Addison of the Boston Patriots, and {{was elected}} its {{president}} five times.

5|$|According to the National Journal, Specter {{voted with}} Democrats 90% {{of the time}} after {{switching}} parties, while, as a Republican, he split his votes between both parties. According to FiveThirtyEight, during January–March 2009 Specter voted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> 58% of the time. Following {{the support of the}} stimulus package and the entrance of Pat Toomey in the Republican primary, Specter began to vote 16% with Democrats. When switching to become a Democrat, he voted 69% with his new party initially, until Joe Sestak entered the Democratic primary and Specter started to vote 97% of the time.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned to run for {{president}} a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech), she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Despite the loss, Weaver still {{believed}} the Populist cause would triumph. He {{agreed to be}} nominated one last time for his old 6th district House seat on a Democratic-Populist fusion ticket. As he had ten years earlier, Republican John Lacey defeated Weaver. In 1900, Weaver attended a convention of fusionist Populists in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the party having split {{on the issue of}} cooperation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b> The fusionists backed Bryan, the Democratic nominee, but he lost again to McKinley, this time by a greater margin. The following year, Weaver was elected to office for the last time as the mayor of his hometown, Colfax, Iowa.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E

5|$|Minton {{received}} a death {{threat in the}} form of an envelope containing a shotgun shell and a message advising him to not vote for the court packing plan. Many Democrats, fearing their re-election prospects, joined with Republicans and defeated the bill. Minton was unhappy with the loss and it cost him considerable support among his voters, but as a result of his close connection with the bill and the leaders of his party, he gained more influence <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{he assumed}} his Senate seat in 1855, Crittenden was sixty-nine years old, the eldest {{member of that}} body. The Whig Party had {{practically}} dissolved by this time, and he joined many of his fellow Kentuckians in associating with the Know Nothing Party. Although he {{did not agree with}} all of the party's principles, he would not associate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> the party he had spent much of his career denouncing, nor would he associate with the new Republican Party because of their stance against slavery. Despite his misgivings about some of the party platform, he campaigned on behalf of Millard Fillmore, the party's candidate in the 1856 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} tumultuous primary {{election}} seasons ever began as the Tet Offensive was launched, followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the New Hampshire primary; it concluded with the assassination {{of one of the}} Democratic candidates, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, just moments after his victory in the California primary. On the Republican side, Nixon's main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney, though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention. Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot. He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{coalition}} {{was successful}} in taking control of both houses of the legislature; with the Senate election to be held just over a week later, intense politicking took place. Some lawmakers went into hiding for fear they would be pressured by the other side. The coalition decided on McKisson as their candidate {{the day before the}} balloting began. Three Republican state representatives who had voted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> to organize the legislature switched sides and voted for Hanna, who triumphed with a bare majority in both the short and long term elections. Bribery was alleged; legislative leaders complained to the United States Senate, which took no action against Hanna. McKisson lost a re-election bid as mayor in 1899; Hanna remained a powerful figure in the Senate until his death in 1904.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic party {{continued}} {{to criticize the}} Sangkum and Sihanouk in their newspaper, much to Sihanouk's consternation. In August 1957 Sihanouk finally lost patience, calling out Democrat leaders for a debate. Five of them attended. At the debate, held at the royal palace, Sihanouk spoke in a belligerent tone, challenging the Democrat leaders to present evidence of malfeasance in his government and inviting them to join the Sangkum. The Democrat leaders gave hesitant responses, and according to American historian David P. Chandler, it gave the audience {{the impression that they}} were disloyal to the monarchy. The debate led to the effective demise of the Democratic party, as its leaders were subsequently beaten up by government soldiers, with Sihanouk's tacit approval. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> vanquished, Sihanouk focused on preparing for general elections, slated to be held in March 1958. He drafted left-wing politicians, including Hou Yuon, Hu Nim, and Chau Seng, to stand as Sangkum candidates, with a view to winning left-wing support from the Pracheachon. The Pracheachon on their part fielded five candidates for the elections. However, four of them withdrew, as they were prevented by the national police from holding any election rallies. When voting took place, the Sangkum won all seats in the national assembly.|$|E
5|$|The Greenbackers {{nominated}} Weaver {{for president}} in 1880, but he received only 3.3 {{percent of the popular}} vote. After several more attempts at elected office, he was again elected to the House in 1884 and 1886. In Congress, he worked for expansion of the money supply and for the opening of Indian Territory to white settlement. As the Greenback Party fell apart, a new anti-big business third party, the People's Party ("Populists"), arose. Weaver helped to organize the party and was their nominee {{for president in}} 1892. This time he was more successful and gained 8.5 {{percent of the popular vote}} and won five states, but still fell far short of victory. The Populists merged <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> by the end of the 19th century, and Weaver went with them, promoting the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896, 1900, and 1908. After serving as mayor of his home town, Colfax, Iowa, Weaver retired from his pursuit of elective office. He died in Iowa in 1912. Most of Weaver's political goals remained unfulfilled at his death, but many came to pass in the following decades.|$|E

5|$|The Ohio {{legislature}} had elected Garfield to the Senate in 1880, {{and when}} he was elected President before taking his seat, they elected Sherman in his place. Sherman's position in the Senate changed after his four-year absence. He rejoined the Finance Committee, but Justin Smith Morrill, his old House colleague, now held the chairmanship. When Sherman re-entered the Senate in the 47th United States Congress, the Republicans were not in the majority. The Senate was divided among 37 Republicans, 37 Democrats, one independent (David Davis) who caucused <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> and one Readjuster (William Mahone), who caucused with the Republicans. Arthur's tie-breaking vote as Vice President left the Republicans with a narrow hold on the chamber. Even so, the special session convened in March 1881 remained deadlocked for two months over Garfield's nominations because of Conkling's opposition to some of them, resulting in the resignation of Conkling and the other Senator from New York, Thomas C. Platt, in protest of Garfield's continuing opposition to their faction. Sherman sided with Garfield on the appointments and was pleased when the New York legislature declined to reelect Conkling and Platt, replacing them with two less troublesome Republicans.|$|E
25|$|Sanders {{was only}} the third senator from Vermont to caucus <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> after Jeffords and Leahy.
