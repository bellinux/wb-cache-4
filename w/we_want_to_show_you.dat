40|$|This {{chapter is}} about getting started with mod_perl, {{for the very}} impatient. If all you want is to run your {{existing}} CGI scripts in a mod_perl-enabled environment, we’ll try to make this as easy for you as possible. Of course, we hope that you’ll read {{the rest of the}} book too. But first, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how simple it is to harness the power of mod_perl. On a decent machine, it should take half an hour or less to compile and configure a mod_perl-based Apache server and get it running. Although there are binary distri-butions of mod_perl-enabled Apache servers available for various platforms, we rec-ommend that you always build mod_perl from source. It’s simple to do (provided you have all the proper tools on your machine), and building from source circum-vents possible problems with binary distributions, such as those reported for the RPM packages built for Red Hat Linux. The mod_perl installation that follows has been tested on many mainstream Unix and Linux platforms. Unless you’re using a very nonstandard system, you should have no problems when building the basic mod_perl server. For Windows users, the simplest solution is to use the binary package available fro...|$|E
40|$|Documentation and {{measurements}} on historical buildings are mostly connected with close-range photogrammetry for high resolution {{in order to}} analyse the detailed structure of the objects. Classical flight campaigns are expensive, limited by the resolution or restricted. An alternative with immediate access to the data {{is the use of}} a helium-balloon based platform with digital camera. For a project {{in the southern part of}} Turkey has been developed a system with a He-Balloon, a digital camera, a control-monitor and a mechanic stabilization. As digital camera was chosen an Olympus Camedia 4040 with 4 Mega-Pixels, which has been calibrated. The Camera was fixed in a triangle frame on 2 axes, so that it had always nadir view. The triangle frame was fixed with 6 ropes below the balloon, and to the ground with 3 ropes, one carried a video and control wire. The video signal of the cameras view was sent to a monitor and the remote control of the camera was also solved by wires. Then a flight-campaign in August 2002 was made over an excavated historical theatre in the former city of Patara, the former major port of Lycia, located at the mouth of the Xanthos River. In the presentation <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> the technical solution and the results of this campaign. The accuracy of the aerial images was better than 4 cm in position and height, the digitising however complex, related to the objects structure. The 3 D-Vector data built the base of a fine DTM. Orthophotos have been created in order to add information the digitised results. 1...|$|E
