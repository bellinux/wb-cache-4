500|$|Mother's Milk {{features}} {{an array of}} musical styles in its thirteen tracks. Among the songs that surfaced from the Hully Gully sessions in early 1989, [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] {{became one of the}} most radical shifts in style for the band. The introspective lyrics, which analyze the death of Hillel Slovak and the devastating effect drugs can have on life, were a new approach for Kiedis, who primarily wrote of sexual intercourse and a hedonistic lifestyle. The vocalist did not, however, want the track to be associated with [...] "anti-drug" [...] sentiments, claiming, [...] " [...] is about letting your friends know that you need help and then being willing to accept the help of others <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> whether it's from drugs, or from a number of other personal problems." [...] According to music journalist Jeff Apter, the song [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was [...] "clearly the most important track the band had ever laid down; it proved that these Peppers were more than knuckleheads with socks hanging off their cocks." [...] Musically, the track integrates the Chili Peppers' typical punk influences, but asserts heavier emphasis on melody and harmonics that lead into more alternative territory. [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was originally recorded to be a duet between Kiedis and Frusciante, but the song was remixed before being released as a single; the new mix accidentally highlighted the guitarist's voice instead of Kiedis'.|$|E
2500|$|Christmas {{clubs are}} savings programs, {{the first of}} which were offered by various banks in the United States during the Great Depression. The concept is that bank {{customers}} deposit a set amount of money each week into a special savings account, and receive the money back {{at the end of the}} year for Christmas shopping. For decades, financial institutions competed for the holiday savings business, offering enticing premiums and advertising items such as tokens. The Dime Saving Bank of Toledo, Ohio, issued a brass token [...] "good for 25 cents in opening a Christmas account" [...] for 1922-1923. There were also numbered tokens issued by the Atlantic Country Trust Co. in Atlantic City, New Jersey, inscribed on the reverse: [...] "Join our Christmas Club and Have Money <b>When</b> <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>It</b> Most." [...] In the February 2006 issue of Forbes magazine, business writer James Surowiecki summarized the accounts' appeal: [...] "The popularity of Christmas club accounts isn't a mystery; if their money was in a regular account, people assumed they'd spend it." ...|$|E

Nobody knows of it except you and Mr. Kenyon and my own family for the reason I told you. I sent off that poem to the press piece-meal, as I {{never in my life}} did before with any poem. And since I wrote to you I have heard of Mr. Eagles, one of the first writers in 'Blackwood' and a man of very refined taste, adding another name to the many of those who have preferred it to anything in the two volumes. He says that he has read it at least six times aloud to various persons, and calls it a 'beautiful sui generis drama.' On which Mr. Kenyon observes that I am 'ruined for life, and shall be sure never to take pains with any poem again.' ...|$|E

Now, supposing that {{an educated}} scholar and {{draughtsman}} had drawn {{each of these}} blocks, {{and that they had}} been cut with as much average skill as that employed in the wood-cuts of Punch, each of these vignettes of coins might have been an exquisite lesson, both of high Art treatment in the coin, and of beautiful black and white drawing in the representation; and this just as cheaply--nay, more cheaply--than the present common and useless drawing. The things necessary are indeed not small,--nothing less than well educated intellect and feeling in the draughtsmen; but intellect and feeling, as I have often said before now, are always to be had cheap if you go the right way about it--and they cannot otherwise be had for any price. There are quite brains enough, and there is quite sentiment enough, among the gentlemen of England to answer all the purposes of England: but if you so train your youths of the richer classes that they shall think it more gentlemanly to scrawl a figure on a bit of note paper, to be presently rolled up to light a cigar with, than to draw one nobly and rightly for the seeing of all men;--and if you practically show your youths, of all classes, that they will be held gentlemen, for babbling with a simper in Sunday pulpits; or grinning through, not a horse's, but a hound's, collar, in Saturday journals; or dirtily living on the public money in government non-offices:--but that they shall be held less than gentlemen for doing a man's work honestly with a man's right hand--you will of course find that intellect and feeling cannot be had when you want them. But if you like to train some of your best youth into scholarly artists,--men of the temper of Leonardo, of Holbein, of Dürer, or of Velasquez, instead of decomposing them into the early efflorescences and putrescences of idle clerks, sharp lawyers, soft curates, and rotten journalists,--you will find that you can always get a good line drawn <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>it,</b> without paying large subscriptions to schools of Art.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{represents}} {{a shift in}} style from the delicate, erotic, dancefloor-friendly pop of their earlier records and contains a more eclectic mix of styles as well, from the Spanish-influenced [...] "L'Esqualita" [...] (inspired by the drag bar in New York City of the same name- the actual real name being [...] "La Escuelita") to the rockabilly-tinged [...] "Down in the Subway". The thematic elements of the songs are also noticeably darker, even for Soft Cell, and center around self-destruction and the breakdown of innocence. [...] "Meet Murder My Angel", according to Almond, is about {{the mind of a}} murderer before he slaughters his victim, while [...] "Where Was Your Heart (<b>When</b> <b>You</b> <b>Needed</b> <b>It</b> Most)" [...] centres on a girl who loses all self-esteem after being raped while intoxicated. The first single from the album was [...] "Soul Inside", which reached number 16 on the UK charts in September 1983. [...] "Down in the Subway" [...] was released as the second single, peaking at number 24 in March 1984.|$|R
