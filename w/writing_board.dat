Teaching texts that have survived from the Middle Kingdom were written on papyrus manuscripts. No {{educational}} ostraca from the Middle Kingdom have survived. The earliest schoolboy's wooden <b>writing</b> <b>board,</b> {{with a copy}} of a teaching text (i.e. Ptahhotep), dates to the Eighteenth dynasty. Ptahhotep and Kagemni are both found on the Prisse Papyrus, which was written during the Twelfth dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. The entire Loyalist Teaching survives only in manuscripts from the New Kingdom, although the entire first half is preserved on a Middle Kingdom biographical stone stela commemorating the Twelfth dynasty official Sehetepibre. Merykare, Amenemhat, and Hardjedef are genuine Middle Kingdom works, but only survive in later New Kingdom copies. Amenemope is a New Kingdom compilation.|$|E

2500|$|As part of Emperor Wenzong's and Song's {{plans to}} {{eliminate}} the eunuchs' power, in 831, Song recommended Wang Fan (王璠) to be the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (京兆, i.e., the Chang'an region) and secretly informed Wang Fan of Emperor Wenzong's plans. [...] However, Wang Fan then leaked it, and Wang Shoucheng and Zheng became aware of it. [...] In response, Zheng had the Shence Army officer Doulu Zhuo (豆盧著) falsely accuse Song and Emperor Wenzong's brother Li Cou the Prince of Zhang of plotting to overthrow Emperor Wenzong and replace him with Li Cou. [...] When Wang Shoucheng then reported Doulu's accusations to Emperor Wenzong, Emperor Wenzong was shocked and believed it to be true, and immediately ordered investigations. [...] Wang Shoucheng wanted to send Shence Army soldiers to immediately slaughter Song's household, but {{at the urging of}} the eunuch Ma Cunliang (馬存亮), this immediate slaughter was not carried out. [...] Rather, Emperor Wenzong ordered that the chancellors immediately be summoned. [...] When the chancellors — Song, Lu Sui, Li Zongmin, and Niu Sengru — arrived at the palace gate, a eunuch announced, [...] "Song Shenxi is not summoned!" [...] Song realized that he was being accused of a crime, and, after knocking his <b>writing</b> <b>board</b> on his head, withdrew back to his household to await punishment. [...] When he arrived at his mansion, his wife asked him, [...] "You, Lord, are a chancellor, the pinnacle of what a subject can reach. [...] Why do you wrong the Son of Heaven and rebel?" [...] He responded, [...] "My entire life I have received the emperor's grace, and I was promoted to be chancellor. [...] I could not remove the wicked, and was instead accused by them. [...] You, Lady, should know that I, Song Shenxi, am no rebel." [...] They wept together.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{function}} of the Giza <b>writing</b> <b>board</b> remains unclear. In normal cases, royal scribes used such writing boards for calligraphic and dictional practices. Or they used them as blueprints for later relief decorations. However, the hieroglyphic design and the depictions of the animals on the Giza <b>writing</b> <b>board</b> are way too detailed and professionally exercised to be a simple blueprint or writing test. For this reasons, some scholars think {{it was possible that}} Mesdjerw created his <b>writing</b> <b>board</b> as some kind of notebook for the afterlife. Such things were similar to the offering stelae inside tomb chambers of royal officials and their popularity grew during the New Kingdom period. Old Kingdom examples, however, are extremely rare and in case of the Giza <b>writing</b> <b>board</b> unique in its design.|$|E

50|$|The {{royal library}} {{consists}} of approximately 30,000 tablets and <b>writing</b> <b>boards</b> {{with the majority}} of them being severely fragmented. It can be gleaned from the conservation of the fragments that the number of tablets that existed in the library at the time of destruction was close to two thousand and the number of <b>writing</b> <b>boards</b> within the library can be placed at a total of three hundred. The majority of the tablet corpus (about 6,000) included colloquial compositions in the form of legislation, foreign correspondences and engagements, aristocratic declarations, and financial matters. The remaining texts contained divinations, omens, incantations and hymns to various gods, while others were concerned with medicine, astronomy, and literature. For all these texts in the library only ten contain expressive rhythmic literary works such as epics and myths. The Epic of Gilgamesh, a masterpiece of ancient Babylonian poetry, was found in the library, as was the Enûma Eliš creation story, and the myth of Adapa the first man, and stories such as the Poor Man of Nippur.|$|R
