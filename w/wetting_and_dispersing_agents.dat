40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a systematic approach to select optimum stabilizer for {{the preparation of}} nano-crystalline suspensions of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The stabilizer can be either a dispersant {{or a combination of}} dispersant and wetting agent. The proposed screening method is a quick and efficient way to investigate a large number of stabilizers based on the principles of physical-chemistry and employs a stepwise approach. The methodology has been divided in two main parts; the first part being focused on the qualitative screening with the objective of selecting the best candidate(s) for further investigation, the second part has been focused on quantitative screening with the objective to optimize the ratio and amount of <b>wetting</b> <b>and</b> <b>dispersing</b> <b>agents,</b> based on wettability, surface charges measurement, adsorption evaluation, process-ability evaluation and storage stability. The results showed clearly that SDS/PVP 40 / 60 % (w/w) (sodium dodecyl sulfate/poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)) at a total concentration of 1. 2 % was the optimum stabilizer composition, at which the resulting nanosuspensions were stable for more than 50 days at room temperature.

It includes requirements for thorough data review of all pesticides 1 before registration for use in California, safety training of all pesticide handlers and field workers, and ongoing monitoring of people and the environment to detect potential for pesticide exposure. Mandatory reporting of pesticide illnesses has been part of this comprehensive program since 1971. The U. S. General Accounting Office (GAO, 1993) noted that "California had by far the most effective and well-established monitoring system in place " and that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S.

" 1 "Pesticide " is used to describe many substances that control pests. Pests may be insects, fungi, weeds, rodents, nematodes, algae, viruses or bacteria [...] almost any living organisms that cause damage or economic loss, or transmit or produce disease. Therefore, pesticides include herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, rodenticides, disinfectants, as well as insect growth regulators.

Many studies have reported the occurrence of alkylphenols in different environmental matrices, though none of these studies have yet to establish a comprehensive overview of such compounds in the water cycle within an urban environment. This review summarizes APE concentrations for all environmental media throughout the water cycle, from the atmosphere to receiving waters. Once the occurrence of compounds has been assessed for each environmental compartment (urban wastewater, wastewater treatment plants [WWTP], atmosphere, and the natural environment), data are examined {{in order to understand}} the fate of APE in the environment and establish their geographical and historical trends. From this database, it is clear that the environment in Europe is much more contaminated by APE compared to North America and developing countries, although these APE levels have been decreasing in the last decade. APE concentrations in the WWTP effluent of developed countries have decreased by a factor of 100 over the past 30  years. This study is aimed at identifying both the correlations existing between environmental compartments and the processes that influence the fate and transport of these contaminants in the environment. In industrial countries, the concentrations observed in waterways now represent the background level of contamination, which provides evidence of a past diffuse pollution in these countries, whereas sediment analyses conducted in developing countries show an increase in APE content over the last several years.

Conductive pastes consist of conductive fillers, organic binders, solvents and additives. Metal powders, such as Au, Ag, Ni, Cu, etc. are used for conductive filler. Filler dispersion is a very important and yet a difficult process in conductive paste manufacturing. Meanwhile, there are some metal powders such as copper, nickel etc that are used for pastes which have serious surface corrosion problems. This problem leads to change of the color and decrease in conductivity and affect storage stability of conductive pastes. To overcome these problems, we adopted two kinds of surface modification method. One is a method involving coating of silane coupling agent to conductive metal powders to overcome the corrosion stability and the other is a method involving addition of a <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent</b> to increase the degree of dispersion of metal powders.
