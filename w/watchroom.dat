5|$|The Avery Point Light was {{designed}} by Alfred Hopkins and Associates to be a 41-foot (12m) octagonal tower. Construction of the tower was completed in March 1943; it is built of brown concrete blocks and topped with an octagonal wooden lantern. During the restoration effort, {{it was discovered that}} six different types of concrete blocks were used in the construction. The tower has a total of five windows, with two facing south and one for the north, east and west. The lantern gallery deck is constructed of concrete and lined with thirty two Italian marble balusters, originally imported from Italy around 1900. The interior has an iron ladder, originally wooden, that leads up to the <b>watchroom</b> level. The lighthouse design and masonry tower have Colonial Revival elements. It is the last lighthouse built in the state of Connecticut as an official navigational aid.|$|E
5|$|At the Delaware Breakwater East End Lighthouse in Lewes, strong waves {{destroyed}} the lower {{deck of the}} lighthouse, while powerful winds blew out the <b>watchroom</b> window. A group of eight volunteers quickly repaired the damage. Moderate wind gusts knocked down numerous trees, tree limbs, and power lines, causing widespread power outages in the state. Conectiv Energy reported the power outage associated with the hurricane {{as one of the}} worst in its history. At least 15,300 were left without power during the worst of the hurricane, including 2,500 in the capital city of Dover. Due to the power outages, only one traffic light north of the city of Wilmington was operational. The strong winds also resulted in the Delaware River and Bay Authority to reduce the speed limit on the Delaware Memorial Bridge to 40mph (65km/h). 62roads throughout the state were initially closed due to flooding, downed trees, or downed power lines. Eight roads, including U.S. Route 13A remained closed for several days, primarily due to flooding. Flooding affected the cities of Seaford, Blades, Bayview, and Augustine Beach, with residents in the latter two being forced to evacuate due to severe flooding conditions. Several state parks reported downed trees and damage. Damage in the state totaled $40million (2003USD, $44million 2006USD), and there were no deaths in the state {{as a result of the}} storm.|$|E
500|$|The plain {{prefabricated}} features {{underwent a}} period of development of which the Greens Ledge Light {{was part of a}} second phase. Templeton describes, [...] "the brackets which support the <b>watchroom</b> gallery and covered deck [...] a simplified classical detailing and [...] rectilinear window sashes are enclosed in shallower, plainer cast-iron surrounds." [...] A deck encircles the light on above the first story, the <b>watchroom</b> and lantern. The original roofing and some cast-iron stanchions of the decks are able to be seen atop the riprap. The cast-iron door to the lighthouse faces south and at the time of nomination the windows were sealed with plywood. The first floor of the lighthouse serves as the kitchen. The second level has two rooms split by a partition with the smaller room being a bathroom. The third level was not divided, but did not have a description in the National Historic Register of Places survey. [...] The fourth floor has six porthole windows and has had much of its woodwork removed and part of the cast-iron floor and brick wall are exposed. The lighthouse's lantern measures [...] in diameter. Once active, the Sheffield Island Light was discontinued.|$|E
60|$|The {{noise of}} the tumult in {{the square of the}} convent aroused the whole town of Worcester. Alarm bells were rung; and the burgesses, hastily arming themselves, poured into the streets. Directed by the sound, they {{made their way to the}} square, and were {{astonished}} at finding it entirely deserted, save for some twenty men, lying dead or dying in front of the gate of the convent, pierced with long arrows. They speedily found that Sir Rudolph and his troop had departed; and further inquiry revealed the fact that the burgher guard at one of the gates had been overpowered and were prisoners in the <b>watchroom.</b> These could only say that they were suddenly seized, all being asleep save the one absolutely on guard. They knew nothing more than that a few minutes later there was a great clatter of horsemen and men on foot leaving the city. Unable to find any solution to this singular circumstance, but satisfied that Sir Rudolph had departed, and that no more disturbance was likely to arise that night, the burgesses again betook themselves to their beds, having closed the gates and placed a strong guard over them, determining next morning to sift the affair to the bottom.|$|E
50|$|The College Township {{station is}} a {{sub-station}} {{housed in the}} basement of the College Township Building at 1481 E College Ave. This station has a <b>Watchroom,</b> Office, Lounge, Bunkroom, Live-in rooms, and a Kitchen. Engine 5-3 and Quint 5 are housed here.|$|E
50|$|The {{cast-iron}} {{structure is}} still a working lighthouse operated by the United States Coast Guard and is not open to the public. The 54 ft lighthouse is painted white with a brown band in the middle. Inside, the structure has three stories of living space along with a basement with cisterns for rainwater storage, all below a <b>watchroom</b> and lantern.|$|E
50|$|A 16 ft square, 10 ft <b>watchroom</b> {{sits on the}} top of the lighthouse, {{topped with}} an {{octagonal}} cast iron lantern with a red roof. The lantern originally contained a flashing white fourth order Fresnel lens manufactured by Sautter & Cie of Paris. It currently contains a 200 mm acrylic lens. The lighthouse also contained compressed air diaphone fog signal. The Poe Reef Light, built in 1929, is a duplicate of this lighthouse.|$|E

50|$|Rectangular in plan, {{the ground}} floor {{contains}} an engine room, <b>watchroom,</b> dormitory, kitchen, bathroom and recreation room. Tall, vertical, timber, bifold, counterweighted doors to School Road open into the engine room around which the other rooms are arranged in an L-shape. The concrete floor to the engine room has been painted green but the red fire engine guide tracks are evident {{in areas where the}} paint has worn. The <b>watchroom</b> is {{at the front of the}} Station off the engine room and opens into the adjacent dormitory. The fireman's pole terminated in a small hall in the centre of the building to the rear of the engine room. The pole has been removed. The kitchen, bathroom and dormitory open off this hall. The recreation room is to the rear of the Station off the engine room and opening to the rear yard. All ground floor rooms are lined with tongue and groove boarding and have fibro sheeted battened ceilings. The dormitory contains built-in timber cupboards and tilting fanlights to the engine room wall. The bathroom could not be unlocked but a terrazzo floor was evident under the closed door. A serving hatch has been cut into the wall between the kitchen and the recreation room.|$|E
5000|$|The present [...] "old" [...] One Fathom Bank Lighthouse is {{essentially}} a 27 m high concrete-pile lighthouse. Built on a circular-like arrangement of piles, the lighthouse is generally designed as an octagonal structure: Both the two storey keeper's house standing on the piles and the skeletal cast iron tower above that houses and supports the lantern, gallery, and <b>watchroom</b> are octagonal; the tower supporting the lantern tapers towards the top. The lighthouse tower was also painted with red and white horizontal bands, which has since faded and repainted white.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} stands 47 ft tall, {{and contains}} three levels {{that were used}} as living quarters and a <b>watchroom.</b> The lantern room held a fourth order Fresnel lens, first lighted on September 15, 1871. To protect the structure, 100 tons of stones were placed around the base in 1886. A [...] water cistern was added in 1900. The lighthouse was automated in 1964 and the keepers were removed. A modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. Over {{the next two decades}} the light fell victim to much vandalism and seabirds made themselves a home in the interior. It was refurbished in the 1980s and in 2001, and continues to serve as an aid to navigation.|$|E
5000|$|Within the {{tapering}} skeletal structure an 8 ft diameter cylindrical {{stair tower}} {{rises to the}} underside of the lantern. The shell is composed of two [...]25 in plates overlapped and offset by 3 in, so when stacked they interlock. A small iron-plate vestibule forms the entrance at the base. A curved inner door (now removed) rolled sideways at the cylinder. The cylinder is lined with wood, with the stairway spiraling up within around a 9 in diameter central column. The topmost section of the cylinder contains a <b>watchroom,</b> from which the lantern may be reached by a ladder. The lantern contained a second-order fixed white light that operated 24 hours a day.|$|E

50|$|The TV {{show was}} a weekly episodic drama that began on 20 February 1988. Paul Knight was the show's producer. Knight {{appointed}} writers such as Anita Bronson, David Humphries, Simon Sharkey, and Tony Hoare. Directors included Gerry Poulson, Gerry Mill, John Reardon, Keith Washington and Alan Wareing. The camera crews had to be committed and cautious when working with fire. Emergencies—or 'shouts'—would not only be fires, but included a range of incidents from cats up trees to major road accidents. Each episode ran for 50 minutes (one hour with advertisement breaks). The first series (1988) consisted of five episodes while the second series (1989) and the third series (1990) consisted of eight episodes. These series episodes were mostly filmed at Dockhead fire station, and used actual firefighters working shifts as extras for the programme. A studio near the station was used for crowded mess scenes, but they also used the fire station's actual mess, bay and <b>watchroom</b> throughout the series.|$|E
50|$|The {{ground floor}} of the Fire Station {{accommodates}} the engine room, watch office, locker room and ablutions area, dormitory, kitchen, laundry and duty officer bedroom. The timber pole connecting the residence to the engine room has been sawn off at the first floor level and the pole cupboard is now used for storage at ground level. The locker room contains intact purpose built lockers for the firemen's uniforms and personal effects. The concrete floor to the engine room is marked with red wheel tracks and a concrete footpath crossing connects to the street. The interiors are lined with tongue and groove boarding and the ceilings are sheeted and battened, except the <b>watchroom</b> which is plastered. A brass plaque commemorating {{the opening of the}} station is on the engine room wall outside the watch office. The rear external timber stairs have been replaced with metal stairs and the laundry now accommodates an additional shower. Windows to the ground level are shaded by horizontal timber hoods on cantilevered timber brackets and fixed aluminium louvre screens have been added around the windows.|$|E
