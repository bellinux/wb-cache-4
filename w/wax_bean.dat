5000|$|The {{common bean}} {{is a highly}} {{variable}} species that {{has a long history}} of cultivation. All wild members of the species have a climbing habit, but many cultivars are classified as [...] "bush beans" [...] or [...] "pole beans", depending on their style of growth. These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, and the <b>wax</b> <b>bean.</b> The other major types of commercially grown bean are the runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus) and the broad bean (Vicia faba).|$|E
5000|$|The three {{commonly}} known types of green beans are: string or snap beans, {{which may be}} round or have a flat pod; stringless or French beans, which lack a tough, fibrous [...] "string" [...] running {{along the length of}} the pod; and runner beans, which belong to a separate species, Phaseolus coccineus. Green beans may have a purple rather than green pod, which changes to green when cooked. Wax beans are P. vulgaris beans that have a yellow or white pod. <b>Wax</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars are commonly grown; the plants are often of the bush form.|$|E
50|$|Compared to dry <b>beans,</b> {{green and}} <b>wax</b> <b>beans</b> provide less starch and protein and more vitamin A and vitamin C. Green <b>beans</b> and <b>wax</b> <b>beans</b> are often steamed, boiled, stir-fried, or baked in casseroles.|$|R

Two diets actually limit the well-cooked vegetables to yellow squash without seeds, green <b>beans,</b> <b>wax</b> <b>beans,</b> spinach, pumpkin, eggplant, asparagus, beets, and carrots.

The study was carried out through a factorial experiment in a randomized complete block design with three factors. The experimental factors included: ZnO NPs (0, 0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 2 mg kg- 1), two substrate types (cow manure and SMC) and VC (2. 5, 5 and 7. 5 weight percentages). To the substrate types, adult earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were added. Specifically, after three months, the prepared VC was soaked in ZnO NPs solutions, mixed with soil (according to cultivation substrate weight), then employed in wet plantation of <b>wax</b> <b>beans.</b> The obtained results showed that with increasing ZnO NPs, leaves’ chlorophyll, grains number per pod, stem length, hundred grains weight, grain yield, and the grain protein content significantly decreased. In general, the usage of these NPs in the applied amounts could curb the undesired growth of this species...|$|R

40|$|Intercropping {{systems are}} seen as {{advantageous}} as they can provide higher crop yield and diversity along with fewer issues related to pests and weeds than monocultures. However, plant interactions in intercropped crop species and between crops and weeds in these systems are still not well understood. The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate interactions between onion (Allium cepa) and yellow <b>wax</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris) in monocultures and intercropping with and without the presence of a weed species, either Chenopodium album or Amaranthus hybridus. Another objective {{of this study was to}} compare morphological traits of C. album from two different populations (conventional vs. organic farms). Using a factorial randomized block design, both crop species were planted either in monoculture or intercropped with or without the presence of one of the two weeds. The results showed that intercropping onion with yellow <b>wax</b> <b>bean</b> increased the growth of onion but decreased the growth of yellow <b>wax</b> <b>bean</b> when compared to monocultures. The relative yield total (RYT) value was 1. 3. Individual aboveground dry weight of both weed species under intercropping was reduced about 5 times when compared to the control. The poor growth of weeds in intercropping might suggest that crop diversification can help resist weed infestations. A common garden experiment indicated that C. album plants from the conventional farm had larger leaf area and were taller than those from the organic farm. This might be associated with specific evolutionary adaptation of weeds to different farming practices. These findings contribute to the fundamental knowledge of crop-crop interactions, crop-weed competition and adaptation of weeds to various conditions. They provide insights for the management of diversified cropping systems and integrated weed management as practices in sustainable agriculture...|$|E
40|$|An assay {{based on}} the early {{stimulation}} of protein synthesis in lymphocytes {{has been used as}} an in vitro measure of cellular immune competence. 3 H-labelled leucine incorporation into human peripheral lymphocytes (PBL) stimulated by the mitogens phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), <b>wax</b> <b>bean</b> agglutinin (WBA) and Concanavalin A (Con A) was measured after one day in culture. This assay offers a technical advantage over the analogous 3 H-labelled thymidine incorporation assay, because of the short incubation time required and the absence of homologous serum in the assay system. Newborn infants and patients with Down's syndrome as a group had normal responses, whereas those suffering from recurrent infections demonstrated normal or hyper-reactive responses. Patients with lymphoproliferative disorders, ataxia telangiectasia, and some patients under steroid therapy had diminished immune proliferative reactions. These results are in agreement with most previously reported studies using other assay systems...|$|E

40|$|Distinguishable {{populations of}} lipid {{particles}} isolated from chloroplasts of yellow <b>wax</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv Kinghorn Wax) leaves {{have been found}} to contain plastid-lipid-associated protein (J. Pozueta-Romero, F. Rafia, G. Houlné, C. Cheniclet, J. P. Carde, M. -L. Schantz, R. Schantz [1997] Plant Physiol 115 : 1185 – 1194). One population is comprised of plastoglobuli obtained from sonicated chloroplasts by flotation centrifugation. Higher density lipid-protein particles isolated from chloroplast stroma by ultrafiltration constitute a second population. Inasmuch as the stromal lipid-protein particles contain plastid-lipid-associated protein, but are distinguishable from plastoglobuli in terms of their lipid and protein composition, they appear to be plastoglobuli-like particles. Of particular interest is the finding that plastoglobuli and the higher density lipid-protein particles both contain catabolites of the thylakoid protein, cytochrome f. These observations support the view that there are distinguishable populations of plastoglobuli-like particles in chloroplasts. They further suggest that the formation of these particles may allow removal of protein catabolites from the thylakoid membrane that are destined for degradation as part of normal thylakoid turnover...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for the preparation, from a subcellular particulate fraction of <b>wax</b> <b>bean</b> cotyledons, of a soluble enzyme {{system that is}} capable of converting β-alanine to ethylene. In the presence of ATP, CoA, thiamine pyrophosphate, MgSO 4, and pyridoxal phosphate, ethylene production is maximum at a 0. 5 mm concentration of β-alanine. The system exhibits a pH optimum at 7. 0 but when the pH is raised above 8, evolution of the volatile again increases and continues to do so up to pH 12. The enzyme system is stimulated by either NADPH or NADH; the concentration of NADPH necessary to obtain maximum activity is twice that of NADH. The requirement for a reducing agent is in agreement with the proposal that malonate semialdehyde, formed by an aminotransferase reaction from β-alanine, is reduced to β-hydroxypropionate. Both malonate semialdehyde and β-hydroxypropionate are better stimulators of production of the volatile in the soluble system than is β-alanine, and β-hydroxypropionate is a better stimulator than malonate semialdehyde. This system is also able to incorporate tritium from tritiated water into ethylene; this supports the proposal that ethylene is formed by the decarboxylation of acrylate, the latter being formed from β-hydroxypropionate...|$|E

Addition of colchicine to the cell suspensions reverses this effect and allows Con A receptors as well as other receptors to form patches and caps. Capping of Con A receptors, and beta 2 -microglobulin in the absence of ligands specific for these receptors. Receptors binding Limulus hemagglutinin and <b>wax</b> <b>bean</b> agglutinin, as well as those interacting with carbohydrate-specific antibodies, were partially co-capped with Con A but receptors for wheat germ agglutinin were not co-capped, excluding the possibility that restriction of receptor mobility by Con A resulted simply from cross-linkage of mobile receptors to immobilized glycoproteins (Con A receptors). Latex beads and platelets coupled to Con A were bound to lymphocytes under the same conditions as free Con A. Binding of these particles to local regions of the cell surface resulted in restriction of the mobility of those receptors that could be co-capped with free Con A. In contrast to the findings with free Con A, however, addition of colchicine resulted in capping of the bound particles but did not cause co-capping of either the unbound Con A receptors or other receptors. These findings support the hypothesis that modulation occurs via a submembranous assembly containing microtubules, and they further suggest that the transitions of this assembly induced locally by Con A may be propagated via cooperative processes...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondria {{isolated}} from cotyledons of germinating <b>wax</b> <b>beans</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) showed fairly good respiratory control on days 1 and 2 after planting. The respiratory control was completely lost from days 3 to 5. During this period mitochondria {{were shown to}} be very leaky, losing about 88 % of their total nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to the suspending medium in a short time. The respiratory control was partially recovered by day 7, after which it completely disappeared again. By the use of differential centrifugation, the mitochondria were divided into subfractions by sequential centrifugation: 10, 000 g for 5 minutes, 25, 000 g for 5 minutes, and 40, 000 g for 5 minutes. The 10, 000 g subfraction {{was responsible for the}} recovery of mitochondrial activity (respiratory control value, adenosine diphosphate to oxygen ratio, and rate of oxygen utilization), on day 7. Activities of succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome oxidase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase from different mitochondrial subfractions of aging cotyledons were determined.

In this study, the effect of substrate quality and predator density on nymphal development of O. laevigatus fed on E. kuehniella eggs, honeybee pollen or an egg yolk based artificial diet was assessed using several types of substrates as shelter materials in the rearing containers (<b>wax</b> paper, <b>bean</b> pod or no extra substrate). In general, E. kuehniella eggs proved to be a nutritionally superior food compared to pollen and artificial diet. Pollen supported nymphal development of O. laevigatus better than the artificial diet. Overall, increasing nymphal density resulted in higher mortality, which may be due in part to cannibalism. The addition of a bean pod compensated for the nutritionally suboptimal artificial, but had a negative effect when O. laevigatus was fed on pollen.

In this study, the effect of epicuticular waxes of leaves of broad bean, Vicia faba, on wasp response to footprints of N. viridula females are investigated. Plants with intact waxes layer were used (1) without host chemical contamination, or (2) contaminated by host female footprints. Mechanically de-waxed plants were tested (3) without host chemical contamination, or (4) de-waxed a few minutes after being contaminated, or (5) de-waxed about 30 min before being contaminated by host female footprints. And, finally, female wasps were tested on the side of the gum arabic film that had been appressed to (6) the adaxial leaf surface of plants without host chemical contamination, and (7) to plants contaminated by host footprints. Direct contact solid-phase microextraction of the adaxial leaf surface of broad bean plants analyzed by GC/MS showed that epicuticular waxes contained high concentrations of hydrocarbons and alcohols, and low concentrations of aldehydes and esters. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the epicuticular waxes occurred as a film densely crystallized as irregularly shaped platelets with spherical granules randomly distributed. These findings demonstrated that epicuticular <b>waxes</b> of broad <b>bean</b> leaves can mediate the foraging behaviour of T. basalis females by absorbing host adult footprints contact kairomone...|$|R
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1963. Bibliography: l. [69]- 73. v, 73, [1] leaves mount. ill., diagrs., tables (part fold.) Indoleacetic acid is {{a normal}} plant product which has been {{established}} to be a plant growth regulator. Indoleacetic acid when applied to plants will cause various growth responses. One response, promotion of cell elongation, is {{used as the basis}} of a very sensitive method for the detection of indoleacetic acid (1). Initiation of cell division has also been observed after the application of indoleacetic acid as in the formation of parthenocarpic fruit, adventitious roots, activation of cambial growth. and the formation of callus tissue. Cases where the application of indoleacetic acid causes inhibition of growth have also been observed. Probably the best known of these responses are the inhibition of elongation of root length and the prevention of lateral budding due to the production of indoleacetic acid by the apical bud. The enzyme, indoleacetic acid oxidase, which catalyses the oxidative degradation of indoleacetic acid, is also found in plant tissues. The function of this enzyme might be in the regulation of hormone level within the plant. However the regulation of hormone level within the plant is a complicated matter, since indoleacetic acid oxidase, with its necessary cofactors, the inhibitor(s) of indoleacetic acid oxidase, and the enzyme responsible for the formation of indoleacetic acid, may all be found in the same tissue. Despite the amount of work that has been done with the enzyme, indoleacetic acid oxidase, relatively little is known about it. Proposals have been made that the enzyme system consists of a flavo-protein and peroxidase (2), a copper protein (3), and an oxidase-peroxidase (4). Indoleacetic acid oxidase activity free from peroxidase activity has never been observed. However, it has been shown (5), that purified preparations of horseradish peroxidase can oxidize indoleacetic acid if Mn++ ion and certain diphenols are present. Also, crystalline turnip peroxidase (6) and two crystalline wheat germ peroxidases (7) have been shown to catalyze the oxidation of indoleacetic acid. In the cases, where known peroxidase activities have been checked for indoleacetic acid oxidase activity there is only one report (8) of a failure to observe the oxidation of indoleacetic acid. McCune (9) has reported on the separation by electrophoresis of six peroxidases from extracts of corn seedlings and showed that at least the four components that moved toward the cathode all displayed indoleacetic acid oxidase activity. The first conclusive evidence of the enzymatic destruction of indoleacetic acid was reported by Larsen in 1936 (10). He worked with an "auxin inactivation substance" obtained from the juice of pressed Phasiolus seedlings. This material was thermolabile and could be purified by precipitation with 607. ethyl alcohol. It possessed the ability to inactivate indoleacetic acid as well as auxin extracted from corn. The reaction was also shown to require oxygen. Tang and Bonner in 1948 (11), working with extracts of etiolated pea seedlings, studied an indoleacetic acid oxidase system. The inactivation of the indoleacetic acid was followed by observing the decrease in biological activity in the Avena curvature test (12) and by a chemical method (13) utilizing the color produced by the indole nucleus in the presence of FeCl 3 (Salkowski test). They found that one molecule of O 2 was consumed for each molecule of indoleacetic acid that was inactivated and that one molecule of CO 2 was released. The enzyme system was inhibited by KCN and CO. This inhibition would seem to indicate the involvement of a heme protein. In 1950 Wagenknecht and Burris (3), working with a cell-free extract of yellow <b>wax</b> <b>bean,</b> studied an indoleacetic acid oxidase system. On the basis of their experiments involving the effects of inhibitors, they concluded that the enzyme was a copper protein. Galston and Baker in 1952 (14) using pea seedling homogenates, suggested that the indoleacetic acid system as it occurs in pea seedlings consisted of two portions; a heavy metal enzyme plus a light activated flavo-protein. Galston, Bonner and Baker (2) later reported that the indoleacetic acid oxidase of pea seedlings consisted of a light-activated flavo-protein coupled, through H 202, to a peroxidase. Their system was inhibited by catalase and Mn++ ions. The activity of the system was increased by the addition of H 2 O 2. An analog of the system could be formed by combining xanthine oxidase from cream and horseradish peroxidase. Kenton in 1955 (5) reported the oxidation of indoleacetic acid by' 02 in the presence of purified horseradish peroxidase. He found that certain monophenols as well as Mn++ ions increased the rate of oxidation of the indoleacetic acid and that some of the peroxidase substrates acted as inhibitors. He also demonstrated the presence of a thermostable fraction in <b>wax</b> <b>bean</b> extracts which acted as an activator for both the indoleacetic acid oxidase system of <b>wax</b> <b>bean</b> and for purified horseradish peroxidase. A 1 / 1 ratio of O 2 consumed to indoleacetic acid oxidized and to CO 2 released was also found. He concluded from his evidence that the oxidation of indoleacetic acid by peroxidase systems was not dependent on the presence of a flavo-protein. Ray reported in 1956 (15) on the indoleacetic acid oxidase of the fungi Omphalia flavida. 1 'bis enzyme was found to have a pH optimum of 3. 5. Its activity was not enhanced by the addition of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol but was moderately stimulated by the addition of Mn++ ions. the addition of Mn++ ions also prevented the enzyme activity from declining during the course of. the reaction. The enzyme was very sensitive to the addition of cyanide. He also showed that one mole of O 2 was used for the oxidation of one mole of indoleacetic acid and that one mole of CO 2 was released. Later, 1960 (16) Ray reported on the relationships between peroxidase action and indoleacetic acid oxidation in the Omphali flavida enzyme. In this work he showed that the peroxidase activity had a pH optimum of 3. 5 - 3. 7, which was similar to the pH optimum of the oxidizing activity. He also found that the indoleacetic acid oxidizing activity and the peroxidase activity paralleled each other through a three-step purification procedure involving an eleven fold increase in activity. The activity ratios were also closely parallel {{during the course of a}} heat inactivation experiment. The conclusion drawn from these results was that both activities were caused by the same enzyme. Using Lupinus albus as a source material, Stutz in 1957 (4) reported on the purification of an indoleacetic acid oxidase-peroxidase system that had been purified until it was homogeneous by starch-block electrophoresis. the enzyme functioned both as a peroxidase and as an oxidase. When functioning as an oxidase it showed an obligate requirement for a phenolic cofactor and a stimulation by the addition of Mn++ ions. Both the oxidase and peroxidase activities of the enzyme were inhibited by the addition of heme inhibitors. However, the lack of sufficient purified material to physically characterize the enzyme limits the value of this work. Gortner and Kent (17) reported in 1953 on the presence of an indoleacetic acid oxidase system in pineapple stem tissue. They also suggested the presence of an inhibitor in the crude extracts. The crude enzyme homogenate showed a pH optimum close to pH 3. 5 and required Mn++ ions for activity. They showed that the enzyme was inhibited by cyanide but not by 8 -hydroxy-quinol 1 ne. ibis would suggest that the enzyme might be a peroxidase and that it does not require copper. A later report by Gartner and Kent (18) showed that the natural inhibitor was probably ferulic acid or an ester of ferulic acid. They also showed that the naturally-occurring coenzyme for pineapple indoleacetic acid oxidase was probably p-coumaric acid or a quiny 1 -p-coumarate [...] both of which were found to be present in pineapple tissue. The objective of this research was to extend the work initiated by Gortner and Kent. Where they were primarily concerned with the coenzyme requirements and inhibitors of the enzyme, this study was concerned with the isolation, purification, crystallization, and study of certain properties of the purified enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{footprints}} {{left behind}} by true bugs are perceived as contact kairomones by scelionid egg parasitoids. Female wasps encountering a contaminated artificial substrate display a characteristic arrestment posture, holding the body motionless and antennating the surface. In the system Nezara viridula (L.) and its egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston), previous {{studies have shown that}} the kairomone mediating such behavior is part of N. viridula’s cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) and furthermore that the wasp’s ability to discriminate host male and female footprints is mainly based on the presence/absence of nonadecane (nC 19). In this study, the effect of epicuticular waxes of leaves of broad bean, Vicia faba, on wasp responses to footprints of N. viridula females were investigated. Approximately 20 % of T. basalis females displayed an arrestment posture when released on the adaxial leaf surfaces of broad bean plants with intact wax layer and without host chemical contamination; whereas ∼ 70 % of wasps displayed the arrestment posture when intact leaves were contaminated by host female footprints. Adaxial leaf surfaces of broad bean plants dewaxed with an aqueous solution of gum arabic and afterwards contaminated by N. viridula females induced arrestment responses in about 10 % of female wasps; the same percentage of arrestment (10 %) was observed when the wasps were released on leaves contaminated by host females and subsequently dewaxed. The side of the polymer film that was appressed to the leaf surface, peeled from the contaminated leaves, induced an arrestment posture in about 95 % of observed wasps.

40|$|Until recently, most market gardens {{were located}} on the {{outskirts}} of cities and, in a few cases, even within. They have now spread to rural areas but their viability there is threatened if transportation and marketing systems are not improved. If rural producers are to succeed, both agronomic and economic solutions to their problems need to be found. The success of market gardens depends primarily on the initiative of these new entrepreneurs, whose numbers have increased dramatically over the last few years. Different production systems and objectives, as well as varying results, combine to make generalizations difficult in this field. It can be said, however, that if vegetable production in cities is designed to satisfy the large demand of consumers, in rural areas it reflects primarily the objectives of the producers themselves. Market gardeners have flourished in African cities because their crops can produce large quantities from small areas. Using sewage sludge to enrich their compost and grey or used water for watering, such gardeners often exploit any available land, even in the centre of urban areas. Increasing construction in urban areas, however, is slowly pushing them out to suburban plots or land even further away from the city. Even so, many market gardeners are still producing on small plots ranging in size from less than ten to up to 100 square metres which are intensively cultivated by hand. In Kinshasa, more than 6000 urban farmers were identified in the business of supplying both the city and surrounding towns. Such producers are very diverse: they include women seeking financial independence; civil servants who want to supplement their incomes; young people who are attracted by such 'modern' agriculture; and the unemployed. Increasingly, however, it is men who make their full-time living out of market gardening because it can be very lucrative. They specialize in European type vegetables (potatoes, cabbage, tomatoes, carrots, squash, and so on) leaving their wives the responsibility of growing African vegetables. But despite the spectacular growth of market gardening in urban and suburban areas the supply of cities generally remains inadequate. In Brazzaville, of the 18, 000 t of vegetables consumed annually, only 3000 t are produced locally. Projects like Agricongo are attempting to modernize and increase production around urban centres. Families in rural areas have always grown their own 'sauce ingredients'. These consist of various local crops (okra, pimento, tomato, leafy vegetables) produced in small backyard plots, or in association with other food crops in more humid areas. What is new is the appearance in the countryside of market gardens whose produce is destined to be sold elsewhere. The revenue from such sales is generally used to buy cereals thereby ensuring local food security. By improving living conditions in rural areas, NGOs and some governments also hope to limit emigration towards the cities (see SPORE No. 2). Market gardening is also well received by local farmers because it does not compete with their cereal crops, which remain the first priority. Produced during the off-season, vegetable crops can be used to exploit both idle hands and abandoned lands. Furthermore, although they require intensive care, {{there is no need for}} expensive equipment or specialized techniques to succeed. Such initiatives have been rapidly developed not only in the droughtstricken Sahel but also in more humid regions where they can generate considerable revenues. One indication of this is the considerable amount of land now dedicated to market gardening. Collective gardens have sprung up around wells and vegetables now occupy increasing space in irrigated fields. Lands that were abandoned, such as easily-irrigated lowlands or sandy soils unsuitable for cereals, have now been brought back into production. Growing methods have also changed: cultivation is now more intensive, green manure is being used, and improved seeds are being introduced. Enthusiasm but little experience For the first few years, the enthusiasm of farmers and some NGOs disguised the problems inherent to this kind of production. The multiplication of these projects throughout sub-Saharan Africa also tended to ignore the fact that to succeed, crops must not only grow well but sell well. Unfortunately, very little was done in the beginning to ensure production and commercialization of such cross. One of the main difficulties is that there is no regular supply of inputs. From time to time it is difficult to get the right seeds as improved varieties for foreign vegetables are rarely produced locally. Imports are either insufficient or arrive too late, especially in remote areas. Furthermore, there is the problem of hybrid seeds that cannot be reproduced at all and must be bought every year. This is particularly crucial for potatoes, an up-and-coming new crop. Local production of seed potatoes is often impossible because the tubers are difficult to store under tropical conditions. They are supplied from Europe but often arrive too late. The organization of seed production is one of the main priorities in order to increase the output of market gardens. Furthermore, the plants themselves are not always adapted to the local climate or cultivation techniques. Improved varieties are more sensitive to drought and pests. Finally, it is unfortunate that so little work has been done on local vegetables that are more resistant and which can be grown during the hot and humid season. Such crops require more stringent protection measures, all the more important because they grow during the dry season and thus are a prime target for insects that have nothing else to eat at that time. That explains why cotton pests such as Heliothis become major problems for out-ofseason tomatoes, why thrips attack onions, or diamond-back moths threaten cabbages. To limit such damage, growers treat their beds with insecticides which they find on the local market, often designed to be used on cotton crops. Unfortunately, they are poorly trained in the use of pesticides and have little choice other than, as one of them explained, the 'white powder bought in bulk at the market'. Excessive treatments are common especially in suburban areas. This leaves toxic residues on the produce and builds up resistance in the pest themselves. The growers also have to deal with other, more dreaded problems such as nematodes or Pseudomonas solanacearum, a bacterium that infects the soil and makes it unfit for growing tomato crops. Researchers are now working on improved varieties to help overcome such difficulties. Plant problems are particularly serious in humid, tropical zones with relatively little direct sunlight. On the other hand, tropical uplands which have lower temperatures are much more suited to producing a large variety of vegetables. If such regions are well exploited, it seems that they could supply large areas. Generally speaking, research on market garden crops remains inadequate. Current work deals with the selection of new varieties and crop protection. In view of the increasing importance of such crops, however, national and foreign research organizations are renewing their interest in these long-forgotten crone. Commercialization is lacking The sale of market garden produce essentially takes place through the traditional systems which usually rely on women. These networks involve numerous intermediaries, except for the very small producers who sell directly on the local markets. Transportation systems that are often inadequate or poorly adapted, and poor packaging and storage methods, result in heavy losses. Furthermore, those producers who are far removed from markets depend entirely on local merchants for information about current prices and supply conditions on the market. Those who are not near major transportation routes or urban areas are faced with considerable problems in selling their produce. Sacks of onions and crates of tomatoes often rot by the roadside because of poor collection and transportation systems. Another problem is that many of these vegetables mature at the same time. In the Sahel, they all arrive at the same time on both rural and urban markets, usually between January and March. Sales during such periods of glut are often impossible and the bottom can fall out of the market. This has happened much more frequently during the last few years with the increase in the area cultivated. Villagers outside Matam in the Senegal River valley, for example, are no longer able to sell their produce on the saturated local markets For farmers, sales are often the only reason for growing such crops. If they cannot make sufficient profit this way, they prefer to find a more lucrative activity that requires less effort. With the good results of the past few years, their financial needs are less pressing. In some areas there has already been a movement away from market gardening towards other activities that are considered to be more profitable such as gold panning or jobs in the city. The question that remains is how to increase sales. Several answers are possible but there are no easy solutions. An increase in the consumption of vegetables in rural areas is encouraged, primarily to improve the local diet, which is often inadequate. The consumption of fresh vegetables in rural areas is far behind that in urban areas and European vegetables are eaten only as a last resort. In Mauritania, for example, the average annual consumption of vegetables is about 24 kg but villagers eat only 6 kg. Modification of traditional eating habits is necessary. Spreading out the production period is another way of ensuring better sales. This could involve the development of tomato varieties that grow during the winter and others that can be planted early. African vegetables that can be grown throughout the year also enable farmers to spread out their production In order to ensure more regular supply for markets, attention must also be given to better storage methods. In this respect, onions and potatoes are receiving research attention designed to find varieties that keep better. For highly perishable produce, such as tomatoes, processing techniques are recommended. Solar drying is a simple solution available to all but it alone cannot handle large excesses. The development of small industrial units to process tomatoes into concentrate seems promising but, in order to make such investments cost-effective, there needs to be good organization of production and collection systems. At one point, export crops were hailed as the way of the future and this resulted in the development of numerous plantations outside urban areas. Markets for such products however, became more and more difficult to find and maintain. Today only green <b>wax</b> <b>beans</b> still find sufficient buyers. Produced in Senegal and Burkina Faso, they demand careful cultivation and harvesting, thus farmers have little room for error. Furthermore, shipping methods often require production dates that simply cannot be respected. At the moment, the absence of guaranteed markets is the biggest obstacle to the success of market gardening. Efforts must therefore be made to give these crops the place they deserve in the local diet and economy of rural regions. It would be unfortunate if the enthusiasm of the farmers is not matched by equally energetic efforts of others to ensure that such hopes for the future are realized BIBLIOGRAPHY 3 rd Seminar of CIRAD/DSA on Amenagements hydro-agricoles et systemes de production.
