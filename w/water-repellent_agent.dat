40|$|Although {{the use of}} {{insulated}} concrete sandwich panels {{results in}} more energy-efficient buildings, {{the presence of this}} insulation layer can induce thermal cracks. As cracks form a preferential path for aggressive agents to enter and degrade the concrete matrix, and as they are not wanted in this application from an aesthetical point of view, they need to be treated. The aim {{of this study was to}} seal the cracks in concrete sandwich panels invisibly in an autonomous way. Therefore, the efficiency of various encapsulated healing agents was compared by inducing thermal cracks in concrete sandwich panels, thus causing capsule breakage and the release of the agents into the cracks. It was shown that encapsulation of both polyurethane and a <b>water-repellent</b> <b>agent</b> can result in a reduction in the water uptake by cracks. However, only when a <b>water-repellent</b> <b>agent</b> was released cracks were healed in an almost invisible way. This study has shown that the self-healing approach involving encapsulated polymer-based healing agents can also be applied to concrete sandwich panels, although more research will be needed to meet the specific healing requirements of this application...|$|E
40|$|Pozzolana–lime mortars {{modified}} with water-repellent admixtures {{were designed}} and studied to obtain mortars for restoration application. Powdered silane and calcium stearates were mixed with pozzolana, lime and sand and the chemical–physical {{properties of the}} resulting mortars were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy (SEM-EDX), thermogravimetric analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy. The mechanical behavior, the pore structure and the hygric behavior were measured. The resistance of water-repellent mortars to the salt crystallization was evaluated. Both calcium stearates and powdered silane allowed good water-repellent protection even if the <b>water-repellent</b> <b>agents</b> and their dosage modified some physical properties and the hydration kinetic...|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle Orbiter's silica tile Thermal Protection System (TPS) is {{beset by}} the {{moisture}} absorption problems inherently associated with low density, highly porous insulation systems. Attention is presently {{given to the}} comparative success of methods for the minimization and/or prevention of water ingestion by the TPS tiles, covering the development of <b>water-repellent</b> <b>agents</b> and their tile application techniques, flight test program results, and materials improvements. The use of external films for rewaterproofing of the TPS tiles after each mission have demonstrated marginal to unacceptable performance. By contrast, a tile interior waterproofing agent has shown promise...|$|R
40|$|Superhydrophobictextile {{material}} having self-cleaning {{function was}} developed by employing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and <b>water-repellent</b> <b>agents.</b> Hydrophobic fabrics were prepared on 100 % polyester woven fabrics withvarious yarn diameters and yarn types. The wetting behavior of fabrics withdifferent treatments was compared for: siloxanerepellent, fluorocarbon repellent, and CNT added fluorocarbon repellent. Drawn textured yarn (DTY) fabrics exhibited higher contactangle (CA) than filament yarn fabrics due to the larger surface roughness contributed by the textured yarn. Fabrics treated with fluorocarbon presentedlarger CA and lower shedding angle than those treated with siloxane,because of the lower surface energy of fluorocarbon repellent. Specimens madeof 50 denier DTY and treated with CNT-Teflon AF® showed the mostsuperhydrophobic characteristics in the study, producing the static contactangle> 150 ° and the shedding angle< 15 °. CNT on fabric surface contributedto the nano-scale surface roughness to hold the air traps like papillae oflotus leaf, giving superhydrophobic characteristics. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} of air lime-based mortars is now {{growing in the}} scientific community {{as well as in the}} companies devoted to construction materials. Air lime mortars were used for centuries and many architectural monuments show this type of mortars. Modern renders and coating mortars can also be made of air lime as the main binding phase. The use of several admixtures to improve different characteristics of these mortars is now explored and discussed in the current presentation. Insights into the action mechanisms are addressed. <b>Water-repellent</b> <b>agents,</b> such as sodium oleate and calcium stearate, increase the durability of air lime mortars in the face of ageing processes. Two water retainers (hydroxypropylguar and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose) have also been proven to increase the viscosity in the fresh mixtures and the durability of the hardened mortars. The role of a starch derivative is also discussed: the influence of the dosage of the admixture is presented. Shrinkage cracks were minimized in starch-bearing render mortars applied onto an absorbent substrate. Strength of air lime mortars can be increased upon the addition of pozzolanic additives: nanosilica and metakaolin. The combined use of these pozzolans along with superplasticizers shows an outstanding overall improvement of strength and durability of lime mortars...|$|R
