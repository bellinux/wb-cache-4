5|$|<b>When</b> <b>George</b> III died in 1820, the Prince Regent, then aged 57, {{ascended the}} throne as George IV, {{with no real}} change in his powers. By {{the time of his}} accession, he was obese and {{possibly}} addicted to laudanum.|$|E
5|$|Alexandra again {{looked after}} her grandchildren <b>when</b> <b>George</b> and Mary {{went on a}} second tour, this time to British India, over the winter of 1905–06.

5|$|Carl Meissner demoted Eubanksia to {{sectional}} rank in his 1856 classification, {{and divided}} it into four series, with B.brownii placed in series Dryandroideae. <b>When</b> <b>George</b> Bentham published his 1870 arrangement in Flora Australiensis, he discarded Meissner's series, placing all the species with hooked styles {{together in a}} section that he named Oncostylis. This arrangement would stand for over a century.|$|E
50|$|Alain Poher, {{president}} of the senate, became interim {{president of}} the Republic until the next elections, <b>when</b> <b>Georges</b> Pompidou came to power.|$|R
50|$|Simultaneously, <b>when</b> <b>Georges</b> Pompidou {{replaced}} Michel Debré as Prime minister, the center-right parties (MRP and CNIP) {{left the}} majority due to de Gaulle's eurosceptic declaration. Like the Left, they denounced the presidentialization of the regime.|$|R
5000|$|<b>When</b> <b>George's</b> {{book club}} meets, he remarks that Holly Golightly got {{together}} with her neighbor Paul [...] "Fred" [...] Varjak. Since this happened in the movie, not the book, George's girlfriend realizes that he didn't read it.|$|R
5|$|Darejan and {{her party}} were resolutely opposed to George XII's renewed {{quest for the}} Russian protection. In 1800, one of Darejan's sons, Alexander, openly broke with his {{half-brother}} and attempted a coup {{with the help of}} his Avar and Iranian allies. The relations in the royal family hit the nadir in July 1800, <b>when</b> <b>George</b> XII forced Queen Dowager Darejan into confinement at her palace in Avlabari, prompting Darejan's sons to mobilize their loyal forces around Tbilisi.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} a new arrangement for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram {{significantly different from}} George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B.brownii in series Spicigerae, placing it in B.subser. Occidentales along with B.occidentalis (red swamp banksia), B.seminuda (river banksia), B.verticillata (granite banksia) and B.littoralis (swamp banksia). This arrangement stood until 1999, <b>when</b> <b>George</b> effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} a new arrangement for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram {{significantly different from}} George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B.menziesii in series Banksia, placing it in B.subser. Cratistylis along with nine other species. This arrangement stood until 1999, <b>when</b> <b>George</b> effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months before}} the 1997 election, the party gained an MP in the House of Commons <b>when</b> <b>George</b> Gardiner, the Conservative MP for Reigate, {{switched}} allegiance to the Referendum Party after his local Conservative branch deselected him due to critical comments {{that he had made}} about Major.|$|E
5000|$|Paul Ehrlich's {{research}} {{gave rise}} to the [...] "magic bullet" [...] concept; using antibodies to specifically target a disease. The production of pure monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic use became available in 1975 <b>when</b> <b>Georges</b> J. F. Köhler and Cesar Milstein produced hybridoma technology.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>George’s</b> {{father died}} in 1877 he {{inherited}} Toxteth Park but did not move to the property until 1881 because he wanted major alterations made to the building. Under {{the supervision of the}} architect George Arthur Mansfield he added a third storey, a tower and a ballroom.|$|R
25|$|Thiele and Ladiges' {{arrangement}} remained current {{only until}} 1999, <b>when</b> <b>George's</b> {{treatment of the}} genus for the Flora of Australia series of monographs was published. This was essentially a revision of George's 1981 arrangement, which took into account some of Thiele and Ladiges' data, but rejected their overall arrangement, including B.subser. Banksia.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} in New York on 20 June, George Washington {{was greeted by}} the unfurling of the {{official}} banner of the League of Peace from the Singer Building, and docked at 18:30 at the North German Lloyd piers in Hoboken, New Jersey.

5|$|As a child, Patton had {{difficulty}} {{learning to read}} and write, but eventually overcame this and was known in his adult life to be an avid reader. He was tutored from home {{until the age of}} eleven, when he was enrolled in Stephen Clark's School for Boys, a private school in Pasadena, for six years. Patton was described as an intelligent boy and was widely read on classical military history, particularly the exploits of Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, Julius Caesar, Joan of Arc, and Napoleon Bonaparte, {{as well as those of}} family friend John Singleton Mosby, who frequently stopped by the Patton family home <b>when</b> <b>George</b> S. Patton was a child. He was also a devoted horseback rider.|$|E
50|$|Reggie's mother Ella {{works as}} a {{housekeeper}} for architect George Latimer. The Latimers are an old aristocratic family who has started to get financial problems.

50|$|<b>When</b> Alex <b>George</b> {{reviewed}} the genus in 1991 he retained Meissners description.|$|R
50|$|A decisive {{time of its}} {{development}} occurred {{during the summer of}} 1911, <b>when</b> <b>Georges</b> Braque and Pablo Picasso painted side by side in Céret in the French Pyrenees, each artist producing paintings that are difficult—sometimes virtually impossible—to distinguish from those of the other. In 1912, they began to experiment with collage and Braque invented the papier collé technique.|$|R
5|$|B.spinulosa var.collina: Known as {{the hill}} banksia, {{it was first}} {{published}} as Banksia collina by Robert Brown in 1810, and retained species rank until 1981, <b>when</b> <b>George</b> demoted it {{to a variety of}} B.spinulosa. It differs from B.spinulosa var.spinulosa in having broader leaves 3–8mm in width that have serrate margins. The leaf undersides have more prominent venation. Its flower spikes are usually gold, or sometimes gold with red styles, especially in New South Wales. It is found in inland gorges and tablelands such as Carnarvon Gorge, Expedition National Park, Isla Gorge and Dicks Tableland in a remote part of Eungella National Park, in Central Queensland but coastal on the New South Wales Central- and north coast.|$|E
5|$|Between April 1947 and December 1948, <b>when</b> <b>George</b> C. Marshall was Secretary of State, Kennan {{was more}} {{influential}} {{than he was}} at any other period in his career. Marshall valued his strategic sense and had him create and direct what is now named the Policy Planning Staff, the State Department's internal think tank. Kennan became the first Director of Policy Planning. Marshall relied heavily on him to prepare policy recommendations. Kennan {{played a central role}} in the drafting of the Marshall Plan.|$|E
5|$|Edward's unorthodox {{approach}} to his role also {{extended to the}} coinage that bore his image. He broke with the tradition that the profile portrait of each successive monarch faced in the direction opposite to that {{of his or her}} predecessor. Edward insisted that he face left (as his father had done), to show the parting in his hair. Only a handful of test coins were struck before the abdication, and all are very rare. <b>When</b> <b>George</b> VI succeeded to the throne he also faced left to maintain the tradition by suggesting that, had any further coins been minted featuring Edward's portrait, they would have shown him facing right.|$|E
50|$|He {{served under}} Charles de Gaulle as Minister of Health, and then, until 1962, as Minister of Justice. <b>When</b> <b>Georges</b> Pompidou became prime minister, Chenot {{replaced}} {{him on the}} Constitutional Council for two years. He then went into business for some time, returning to public service in 1971 as the vice-president of the Conseil d'Etat, retiring in 1978.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>Georges</b> Brassens {{discovered}} this poem, he asked Antoine Pol {{for permission to}} set it to music, which the latter granted. Brassens, wanting to meet him, arranged for a meeting to take place after a month, but Pol died away a week before he could meet him. One of Brassens' greatest regrets was never to have met him.|$|R
5000|$|He {{joined the}} Richemont Group, the Swiss luxury goods corporation, in 2000. Following the Group’s {{acquisition}} of A. Lange & Söhne, Jaeger-LeCoultre and International Watch Company, he {{was active in}} the integration of these three brands. <b>When</b> <b>Georges</b> Kern joined IWC Schaffhausen early in 2002, at the age of 36, he became the youngest CEO within Richemont.|$|R
5|$|Full {{meetings}} of the Privy Council are held only when the reigning sovereign announces {{his or her own}} engagement (which last happened on 23 November 1839, in the reign of Queen Victoria); or when there is a demise of the Crown, either by the death or abdication of the monarch. A full meeting of the Privy Council was also held on 6 February 1811, <b>when</b> <b>George,</b> Prince of Wales was sworn in as Prince Regent by Act of Parliament. The current statutes regulating the establishment of a regency in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign also require any regents to swear their oaths before the Privy Council.|$|E
5|$|George, {{although}} increasingly {{reliant on}} Walpole, could still have replaced his ministers at will. Walpole was actually {{afraid of being}} removed from office {{towards the end of}} George I's reign, but such fears were put to an end <b>when</b> <b>George</b> died during his sixth trip to his native Hanover since his accession as king. He suffered a stroke on the road between Delden and Nordhorn on 9 June 1727, and was taken by carriage to the Prince-Bishop's palace at Osnabrück where he died {{in the early hours of}} 11 June 1727. He was buried in the chapel of Leine Castle but his remains were moved to the chapel at Herrenhausen after World War II.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Beebe {{traveled}} to Georgetown {{in pursuit of}} his earlier goal of establishing a permanent field research station in Guiana. After following several leads which came to nothing, his goal was realized <b>when</b> <b>George</b> Withers, who owned a rubber plantation on the Mazaruni River, offered him {{the use of a}} large house on his property for this purpose. Soon after Beebe and his researchers moved into the plantation house, which was known by the name of Kalacoon, they were paid a visit by Theodore Roosevelt and his family. Roosevelt subsequently wrote an article about the station for Scribner's Magazine, which helped to build public support for the station.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>George's</b> letter reached home, we {{may fancy}} that it created no small {{excitement}} in the little circle round Madam Esmond's fireside. So he was in love, and wished to marry! It was but natural, and would {{keep him out of}} harm's way. If he proposed to unite himself with a well-bred Christian young woman, Madam saw no harm.|$|R
