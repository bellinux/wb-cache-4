40|$|Various {{methods for}} water or soil {{humidity}} conservation {{include the use}} ofchemicals (synthetic matter) and plastic or asphalt layer at certain depthunder soil profile to hold irrigation or rain water entering into the soil toprevent rapid disappearance from root zone. The present study observedthe role of fine texture soil (clay fraction) in increasing water capacity, andreleasing power of water for the need of plantation in marginal soil <b>withsand</b> easily pressed structure, and sensitive to water and wind erosion. The study {{was carried out in}} Glagah Coast, Kulon Progo, Yogyakarta. Theresults conclude that the addition of 10 cm of clay layer at the depth of 20 - 30 cm may optimally increase the humidity of sandy soil...|$|E
40|$|Beaches occur {{throughout}} the coastal {{regions of the}} world. Ridges found on beachescan {{be used as indicators}} of past climatic and oceanographic conditions. Sea-levelchanges can also be extrapolated from these landforms, if the correct conditions occur, when the facies between eolian and intertidal sediments can be found. Groundpenetrating radar and fieldwork has been used to investigate the origins, processes, and the connection with sea-level fluctuations on a beach and the associated berm-ridge, located at Tönsneset in Kongsfjorden, northwestern Spitsbergen. The beach has a moderately simple internal structure, with the stratigraphy of the beachrevealing layers with a low gradient towards the sea on the foreshore, and overwashlayers with an inclination landwards on the backshore. Layers alternate mostly <b>withsand</b> and gravel, and a majority of them having low angle cross laminationcharacteristics. Previous datings, together with preliminary datings from this study, signify an origin from late Holocene for the berm-ridge. The berm-ridge at Tönsnesetdoes not indicate any clear-cut evidence of a former sea-level and it cannot be used asevidence for a suggested recent transgression...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} experimentalresearches on sanded wooden surfaces. The goalwas to determine {{the relationship between the}} grit ofthe sanding belt and the obtained roughness of thesurface. The processed wood species was beech(Fagus sylvatica L.). Processing was done <b>withsanding</b> papers of three different grits, strictly on theradial plane of the wood samples, using identicalprocessing conditions (cutting speed, feed rate,sanding depth and pressure). The results reflect (onceagain) the heterogeneity of wood as material and aretechnologically interesting...|$|R
