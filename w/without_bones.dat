6000|$|At Sharmá {{we saw the}} crescent, {{when the}} Englishmen turned their money in their pockets, and the Egyptian offficers muttered a blessing upon the coming moon. Every day we waxed more weary of the place; {{possibly}} {{the memories of the}} first visit were not pleasant. Many in camp still suffered; and an old Bedawi, uncle to Shaykh 'Alayan, died and was buried at 'Aynúnah. The number of servants also made us uncomfortable. The head Dragoman, whose memory was confined to his carnet, forgot everything; and, had we trusted to him, half the supplies would have returned to Suez, probably for the benefit of his own shop at Zagázig. I soon found his true use, and always left him behind as magazine-man, storekeeper, and guardian of reserve provisions. He was also a dangerous, mischief-making fellow; and such men always find willing ears that ought to know better. Petros, the Zante man, was the model of a tipotenios (an [...] "anybody"), who seemed to have been born limp, <b>without</b> <b>bones</b> or brains. He was sent back as soon as possible to Cairo. The worst point of these worthies was, that they prevented, for their own reasons, the natives working for us; while they preferred eternal chatter and squabbles to working themselves. So the Greek element was reduced to George the cook, a short, squat, unwashed fellow, who looked like a fair-Hercules out of luck; who worked like three, and who loudly clamoured for a revolver and a bowie-knife. His main fault, professionally speaking, was that he literally drenched us with oil till the store happily ran out. His complexion was that of an animated ripe olive, evidently the result of his own cookery. His surprise when I imperatively ordered plain boiled rice, instead of a mess dripping with grease; and when told to boil the fish in sea water and to serve up the bouillon, was high comedy. Doubtless he has often, since his return, astounded his [...] "Hellenion" [...] by describing our Frankish freaks and mad eccentricities.|$|E

30|$|However, {{there are}} still {{unresolved}} problems related to graft materials, such as unpredictable resorption, limited amounts and required donor sites of autologous bone, the inability of alloplastic materials to form bone, and the slow resorption ability of xenograft materials (Hatano et al. 2004; Schlegel et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2014; Iezzi et al. 2012). In addition, {{there is a need}} for a large amount of sinus filling. An average of 5 – 6  cc of autogenous bone is required for one sinus. For a combination graft, an average of 2 – 3  cc of bone is required (Peleg et al. 2004).

30|$|Growth stress {{performs}} essential {{functions for}} the tree; it maintains its huge body {{for a long}} period against the gravitational force [1]. Reaction wood formation participates in this function, especially when a drastic response is needed. Growth stress becomes extremely high in reaction wood, whereas it is reduced in the opposite side, which causes an upward or downward bending moment in the stem. Thanks to the capacity to control stem orientation, growth stress in reaction wood allows the newly formed xylem to perform a function analogous to that of muscles in animals. Whereas in animals, the muscles would not be effective <b>without</b> <b>bones,</b> in trees, the wood itself fulfills the supporting function of a skeleton. It will be shown in next section that in addition to the “muscular” function, the stress distribution by itself contributes to the “skeletal” function through enhanced bending strength [2, 3].|$|E

40|$|The {{flavor and}} texture of the final meat, poultry, or game product depends on how the meat is handled {{following}} slaughter. If you slaughter your own meat, contact your county Extension educator for information. Use only meat from healthy, disease-free animals. The meat should be chilled without delay to 40 degrees F (or lower to prevent spoilage. To hold longer than a few days, freeze at 0 degrees F or lower until canning time. Rinse poultry thoroughly in cold water and drain. Handle meat rapidly and keep everything that touches the meat clean. Debone red meats. Trim off all gristle, bruised spots, and excess fat before canning. Any fat left on the meat may affect sealing. Meat, poultry, and game are low-acid foods and must be processed in a pressure canner at 10 to 15 pounds of pressure per square inch (psi) for safety. See Tables 1, 2, and 3 for processing times for all meat types and stock. Meat can be packed either raw or cooked. Pack meat loosely into clean canning jars. Keep precooked meat hot while packing and cover with boiling liquid. Salt adds flavor, but is not necessary for preservation. When ready to serve, boil canned meat and poultry 10 minutes before you taste it—even if it looks and smells all right. If {{this is your first}} time canning, it is suggested that you read “Canning Basics ” for instructions on filling and processing recommendations. Poultry, Rabbit, or Squirrel Choose freshly killed and dressed, healthy animals. Large chickens are more flavorful than fryers. Dressed poultry should be chilled for 6 to 12 hours before canning. Dressed rabbits or squirrels should be soaked 1 hour in water containing 1 tablespoon of salt per quart, then rinsed. Remove excess fat. Cut the poultry, rabbit, or squirrel into suitable sizes for canning. Can with or <b>without</b> <b>bones.</b> Hot Pack Boil, steam, or bake meat until about two-thirds done.

It produces various injuries in the knee joint and may need a total knee replacement surgery of the affected knee with artificial components. Geometric complexity and non-linearity of the biomaterials of the knee make the logical solutions of the mechanical conduct of the knee joint difficult. In this study, 3 D modeling software,SolidWorks is used for modeling of knee implant and finite element method software ANSYS 15. 0 is used for numerical estimation of equivalent stress, equivalent strain and total deformation. This study explains a human knee implant model using ANSYS 15. 0 which shows multiple contact pairs working together. The objective {{is to find out}} the FEM results considering various loading state of knee implant with and <b>without</b> <b>bone</b> for various biomaterials,different meshing state of knee implant <b>without</b> <b>bone</b> for various steps. Also,this study compares these results and suggests the best biomaterial,mesh quality and time step for knee implant analysis for total knee replacement cases. A knee implant <b>without</b> <b>bone</b> static structure was able to sustain a load of 1500 N for material properties of ZrO 2 demonstrating a stable stress value of 736. 52 MPa.

40|$|BACKGROUND:: The most {{controversial}} problem in treating scaphoid fractures is whether bone grafts {{are necessary for}} cystic-type fractures. METHODS:: We treated 105 scaphoid fractures using Herbert screws (1988 - 1997), AO 3. 0 mm cannulated screws (1998 - 2002), and Acutrak screws (2003 - 2006). The patients {{ranged in age from}} 14 years to 67 years (average, 26 years). Our classifications were based on the radiographic findings: linear type (51 cases); cystic type (24 cases); and sclerotic or displaced type (30 cases). Linear and cystic types did not have any displacement more than 2 mm. If the fracture line had a sclerotic zone thicker than 1 mm, it was classified as sclerotic or displaced. The length of time before surgery did not affect the classification. Osteosynthesis was performed-without bone graft in all linear cases, with a bone graft in 7 and <b>without</b> a <b>bone</b> graft in 17 cases in cystic type, and with all bone graft in sclerotic or displaced type. RESULTS:: Bone union was achieved in all cases in linear type. There were one failure (AO) in 7 cases with bone graft and 3 failures (1 Herbert and 2 AO) in 17 cases <b>without</b> <b>bone</b> graft in cystic type. All 10 cases achieved <b>bone</b> union <b>without</b> <b>bone</b> graft in cystic type using Acutrak screw. There were two failure cases (2 AO) in sclerotic or displaced type.
