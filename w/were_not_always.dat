5|$|The big {{dance was}} the film's most {{sustained}} and elaborate sequence, so two cameras were used, with frequent recourse to hand-holding and telephoto zooming in order both {{to sustain the}} documentary-style look and feel and to take pressure off the performers, who <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> sure whether they were being included in the shots.|$|E

5|$|Deligiannis mobilized the Hellenic Army, and the British Royal Navy {{blockaded}} Greece. The admiral {{in charge}} of the blockade was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who had been the first choice of the Greeks to be their king in 1863, and the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time was Lord Ripon, whose brother-in-law had been murdered in Greece 16 years before. This was not the last time that King George discovered that his family ties <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> to his advantage. Deligiannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between 1882 and 1897, Trikoupis and Deligiannis alternated the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.|$|E
5|$|Despite this he {{had neither}} an office nor office staff, {{dealing with all}} the {{correspondence}} himself. Much of the detail of his works were held in his memory. He travelled with a personal valet and later had a cashier. But all his letters were written by him; it is recorded that on one occasion after {{the rest of his}} party had gone to bed, 31 letters had been written by Brassey overnight. Although he won a large number of contracts, his bids <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> successful. It has been calculated that for every contract awarded, around six others had been unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} Christianisation of the Rus', however, {{relations}} <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> friendly. The most serious {{conflict between the}} two powers was the war of 968–971 in Bulgaria, but several Rus' raiding expeditions against the Byzantine cities of the Black Sea coast and Constantinople itself are also recorded. Although most were repulsed, they were often followed by treaties that were generally favourable to the Rus', {{such as the one}} concluded {{at the end of the}} war of 1043, during which the Rus' gave an indication of their ambitions to compete with the Byzantines as an independent power.|$|E

5|$|Galveston's {{attitudes toward}} race were at times {{unique in the}} region. The strict segregationalist attitudes {{prevalent}} {{in many parts of}} the U.S. <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> as stark in Galveston's society as in some other parts of Texas. One of the most striking examples of this was the gradual establishment of biracial labor unions of waterfront workers beginning in the 19th century, although eventually this alliance fell victim to segregationist influence. Racist ideology was always an ever-present factor in the city, however, as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras, the Kotton Karnival Kids (KKK, the same initials as the Ku Klux Klan).|$|E
5|$|Royal bodyguards {{served as}} the closest members to the king at court and on the battlefield. They were split into two categories: the agema of the hypaspistai, a type of ancient special forces usually {{numbering}} in the hundreds, and a smaller group of men handpicked by the king either for their individual merits or to honor the noble families to which they belonged. Therefore, the bodyguards, limited in number and forming the king's inner circle, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> responsible for protecting the king's life {{on and off the}} battlefield; their title and office was more a mark of distinction, perhaps used to quell rivalries between aristocratic houses.|$|E

This period also saw a number of side projects, including the live jazz performances of 1996's How Long Has This Been Going On, from the same year , and 2000's The Skiffle Sessions – Live in Belfast 1998, all of which found Morrison paying tribute to his early musical influences.|$|E

5|$|The main {{features}} of late Roman fortification clearly presage those of medieval castles. But the defensibility of late Roman forts {{must not be}} exaggerated. Late Roman forts <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> located on defensible sites, such as hilltops {{and they were not}} designed as independent logistic facilities where the garrison could survive for years on internal supplies (water in cisterns or from wells and stored food). They remained bases for troops that would sally out and engage the enemy in the field.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was originally}} published in 1723 as Hemingi chartularium ecclesiæ Wigorniensis, in two volumes edited by Thomas Hearne. This {{was part of the}} Chronica Anglia series put out between 1709 and 1735, which included many chronicles and records in 20volumes. Hearne printed his edition from a transcription made for the antiquary Richard Graves. This transcript, known as MS Rawlinson B.445, is not a completely accurate transcription of the Cotton Tiberius manuscript, as some items were omitted, and marginalia <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> transcribed. There were also some additions of decorations.|$|E

Postcards, which has songs that range musically from bluegrass, zydeco, flamenco, Irish traditional, country, to Celtic-new-age-Native, and with songs that mix some of the themes, was described as a satisfying example of how far the versatile scope of The Paperboys' music extends.|$|E

5|$|Although motte-and-bailey castles are {{the best}} known castle design, they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> the most {{numerous}} in any given area. A popular alternative was the ringwork castle, involving a palisade being built {{on top of a}} raised earth rampart, protected by a ditch. The choice of motte and bailey or ringwork was partially driven by terrain, as mottes were typically built on low ground, and on deeper clay and alluvial soils. Another factor may have been speed, as ringworks were faster to build than mottes. Some ringwork castles were later converted into motte-and-bailey designs, by filling in the centre of the ringwork to produce a flat-topped motte. The reasons for why this decision was taken are unclear; motte-and-bailey castles may have been felt to be more prestigious, or easier to defend; another theory is that like the terpen in Netherlands, or Vorburg and Hauptburg in Lower Rhineland, raising the height of the castle was done to create a drier site.|$|E
5|$|As in all {{occupied}} {{countries in}} Europe, food, fuel and clothing were strictly rationed by the German authorities. Even with the stringent rationing, {{the food and}} materials which civilians should officially have been entitled to <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> available. A significant black market also existed in the country, supplying food illegally at very high prices to those that could afford it. Information and the press were strictly controlled by the German government and news was greatly restricted. Nevertheless, the sales of collaborationist newspapers like Le Soir and the newspapers of pro-collaborationist political parties like Le Pays Réel remained high. A large number of underground newspapers were also published and distributed – the underground paper La Libre Belgique achieved a circulation of 30,000.|$|E
5|$|Australians <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> {{successful}} however, {{suffering a}} number of heavy losses late in the war. On 12 June 1901, the 5th Victorian Mounted Rifles lost 19 killed and 42 wounded at Wilmansrust, near Middleburg after poor security allowed a force of 150 Boers to surprise them. On 30 October 1901, Victorians of the Scottish Horse Regiment also suffered heavy casualties at Gun Hill, although 60 Boers were also killed in the engagement. Meanwhile, at Onverwacht on 4 January 1902, the 5th Queensland Imperial Bushmen lost 13 killed and 17 wounded. Ultimately the Boers were defeated, and the war ended on 31 May 1902. In all 16,175 Australians served in South Africa, and perhaps another 10,000 enlisted as individuals in Imperial units; casualties included 251 killed in action, 267 died of disease and 43 missing in action, while a further 735 were wounded. Six Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
