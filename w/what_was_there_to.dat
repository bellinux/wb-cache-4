2500|$|Moulton's {{imagination}} was fostered {{during her}} childhood. Her parents {{clung to the}} strictest Calvinistic principles. Games, dances, romances, were forbidden; and, as playmates were few, the child lived {{in a world of}} fancy. [...] "I was lonely," [...] she said, [...] "and I sought companions. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> do but to create them?" [...] Indeed, before she was eight years old, her active mind was creating a world of its own in a little unwritten play, which it pleased her fancy to call a Spanish drama, and with which she spent all summer, filling it with personages. The rigid Calvinism of the family had undoubtedly a very stimulating effect on the emotions of the sensitive child, and to its far-reaching influence may be ascribed the tinge of melancholy found in many of her pages. As a child, Moulton also exhibited a great vitality, especially when she was not burdened with the terrors of [...] "damnation". Running {{in the face of a}} great wind was one of her joys, and she realized the reverse of such emotion in listening to the sound of the wind through an outer keyhole, which seemed to her the calling of trumpets, the crying of lost souls.|$|E

5000|$|Code Switch {{reporter}} Kat Chow {{has also}} described {{the project as}} especially interested in the [...] "second beat" [...] of a story: [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> breaking news, {{we want to take}} a step back and see what this actually means. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> report on that hasn’t already been said?” ...|$|R
5000|$|Even if I {{wanted to}} be patriarch, as many others do, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> covet in the appointment, since so many dioceses of the East have been devastated?

30|$|The {{innovation}} capacity {{of an organization}} as a social system is difficult to analyse as it lacks ontological status—it is so-called construct, “a theoretical creation {{that is based on}} observations but that cannot be observed directly or indirectly” [53]. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> observe? Social systems are accessible for analysis because they consist of the “totality of all communication” [54] taking place and communication is a phenomenon which can be observed.|$|R
5000|$|... "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya" [...] ("I have loved, so <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> fear?") <b>is</b> a {{song from}} the famous Indian movie Mughal-e-Azam (1960), which was {{directed}} by K. Asif. The song was created by Naushad and sung by Lata Mangeshkar and chorus. The song, when the film was first released, was in colour. It is shot in a set inspired by the Sheesh Mahal of the Lahore Fort.|$|R

5000|$|The {{restaurant}} is today considered a Broadway institution, {{to the point}} that composer Stephen Sondheim pointed to it when lamenting the changing climate of New York theater in a 2000 interview. Asked about the Broadway community, Sondheim replied, [...] "There's none whatsoever. The writers write one show every two or three years. Who congregates at Sardi's? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> congregate about? Shows just sit in theaters and last." ...|$|R
40|$|Recently I {{noticed a}} poster {{advertising}} a May Day march which also {{invited us to}} 2 ̆ 7 celebrate socialism 2 ̆ 7. The first thing that came to my mind was the slogan from the bicentennial year: 2 ̆ 7 <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> celebrate? 2 ̆ 7 Because it 2 ̆ 7 s really {{not clear to me}} what 2 ̆ 7 s left of socialism, nor what the Left project is...|$|R

[...] Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad praised it saying [...] "this {{may very well have}} been a perfect hour of television." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{rested her}} chin {{on her hand}} {{and tried to think}} out her position. But <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> think out, seeing that nature and law and custom have conspired {{together}} to put women altogether under the power of jealous and acquisitive men? ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Orlando {{broke down}} here, laid {{his head on}} his little mother's shoulder, and wept for his mind had {{suddenly}} run itself blank. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> find out? what could they do? Nothing, absolutely nothing, except pray; and they did that fervently.|$|E
6000|$|She {{led him to}} talk {{on about}} the future. She loved to hear his clear, {{confident}} voice with its touch of boyish boastfulness. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> stop him? Why should he not climb from power to power till he had reached the end! ...|$|E
40|$|Labour {{lost the}} General Election and the Conservatives appear intent on {{striking}} {{a deal with}} the DUP in order to hold onto power. So <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> celebrate for those on the Left? Lea Ypi argues that the Labour Party is now a reinvigorated force. It is the largest social democratic party in Europe; its members are now at the centre of its values and activity. We should celebrate the movement, and not the individual that happens to speak for it...|$|R
5000|$|Even if I {{wanted to}} be patriarch, as many others do, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> covet in the appointment, since so many dioceses of the East have been devastated? Should I set my heart on Antioch, where sighs and groans will meet me? Or the holy diocese of Gumal, where nobody is left to piss against a wall? Or Aleppo, or Mabbugh, or Callinicus, or Edessa, or Harran, all deserted? Or Laqabin, ʿArqa, Qlisura, Semha, Gubos, Qlaudia and Gargar—the seven dioceses around Melitene—where not a soul remains? ...|$|R
50|$|Taking it as {{established}} {{that a state}} has constitutional power to pass laws giving rights and imposing liabilities for acts done upon the high seas when <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no such rights or liabilities before, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> hinder its doing so {{in the case of}} a maritime tort? Not the existence of an inconsistent law emanating from a superior source, that is, from the United States. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> no such law. The maritime law is not a corpus juris—it is a very limited body of customs and ordinances of the sea.|$|R
60|$|As usual, {{once he was}} at the wicket the paralysed feeling left him. He became {{conscious}} {{again of}} his power. Dash it all, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> be afraid of? He was a jolly good bat, and he would jolly well show them that he was, too.|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> see there! This {{was said}} in a tone which made George feel rather indisposed to {{describe}}, if describe he could, what there was there to be seen.

5000|$|After all, Rong surmises, {{most men}} {{are poor and}} all men will die, so why should he worry himself? This is {{consistent}} with all lives, so instead of waiting with everyone else for it to eventually end, why should he worry himself with anything? Why should he deny himself happiness? Instead of being miserable, waiting for his fate, he chooses to be happy. Says Rong Qiqi: For humans, a life of hardship is the norm and death is the end. Abiding by the norm, awaiting my end, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> concerned about? ...|$|R
40|$|Susan Strayer Deal’s {{collection}} The Dark Is a Door is an austere work born of Nebraska’s dry prairie landscape. The {{ferocity of}} seasons—the bone-dry summer heat, the relentless indifference of winter—and the ever persistent scouring of prairie winds {{lead to a}} land, and a poetry, stripped of adornment. It is a landscape of distances where the animate and inanimate are not easily distinguishable, the hard ground converging with whatever might move upon it. Deal’s poetry pulls shape from this vastness, a quiet attestation of the poet’s commitment <b>to</b> seeing <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>there,</b> <b>to</b> define from dark earth forms and images of concentrated brilliance...|$|R
5000|$|Art {{criticism}} {{is a symptom}} of the obscurity of art, for [...] "an artist, if he is a true artist, has in his work conveyed to others the feelings he has experienced: <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> explain?". Criticism, moreover, tends to contribute to the veneration of [...] "authorities" [...] such as Shakespeare and Dante. By constant unfavourable comparison, the young artist is corralled into imitating the works of the greats, as all of them are said to be true art. In short, new artists imitate the classics, setting their own feelings aside, which, according to Tolstoy, is contrary to the point of art.|$|R

6000|$|Then he did {{not know}} how to go on, for all that he wanted to say was such as he had never even dreamed of writing--things about his {{feelings}} which would look horrible in words; besides, he must not put anything that might not be read, by anyone, so <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> say? ...|$|E
60|$|Both Leopold and Ludwig looked their surprise, {{and to the}} king's eyes came {{a sudden}} look of fear. With the royal blood in his veins, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> prevent this popular hero from some day striving for the throne he had once refused? Leopold knew that the minds of men were wont to change most unaccountably.|$|E
2500|$|Johannes Bronkhorst renders skandha as [...] "aggregates", {{stating that}} the meaning and {{importance}} of the concept is in explaining the non-self concept in Buddhism. The Buddhist texts assert the five aggregates <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> a person and personality, and in each skandha – body, sensations, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness – <b>there</b> <b>is</b> emptiness and no substance.|$|R
