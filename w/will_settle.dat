25|$|In the {{developing}} brain, neural stem cells must migrate from {{the areas where}} they are born to the areas where they <b>will</b> <b>settle</b> into their proper neural circuits. Neuronal migration, which occurs {{as early as the}} second month of gestation, is controlled by a complex assortment of chemical guides and signals. When these signals are absent or incorrect, neurons do not end up where they belong. This can result in structurally abnormal or missing areas of the brain in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, or hippocampus.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the film, the {{narrative}} is intercut with scenes from depositions {{taken in the}} Winklevoss twins' and Saverin's respective lawsuits against Zuckerberg and Facebook. The Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. At the end, Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they <b>will</b> <b>settle</b> with Saverin, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's own callous attitude will make him highly unsympathetic to a jury. After everyone leaves, Zuckerberg is shown sending a friend request to Albright on Facebook and then refreshing the webpage every few seconds as he waits for her response.|$|E

25|$|After a while, {{the king}} sends his nephew Arthofilaus {{to demand that}} Galiene {{surrender}} the castle. She refuses, but they agree that if she can find a suitable knight, they <b>will</b> <b>settle</b> the dispute by single combat. Galiene soon regrets the deal, as she is {{unable to find a}} willing candidate among her men. She therefore sends her attendant, Arondele, to request a knight from Arthur at Carlisle. However, Arthur is unable to provide one because all of his knights are out searching for Fergus. Dejected, Arondele heads back to her mistress. On the way, she passes Melrose and relates the story to Fergus, before returning to Roxburgh. News of the attendant's failure brings Galiene to grief, because the combat must take place the following day. When the time arrives, Galiene prepares to throw herself from the castle tower. However, she catches sight of a shining shield in the distance. The mysterious knight slays Arthofilaus, and the king gives up his claim to Lothian. It is then that Galiene learns the identity of the knight, her lost love Fergus. By then, however, he had already departed.|$|E

500|$|The diet of {{the yellow}} {{stingray}} is poorly documented but includes shrimps, and likely also worms, clams, and small bony fishes. Typically, the ray <b>will</b> <b>settle</b> over a prey item and trap it against the bottom, whereupon it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc. Like the related round stingray (U. halleri), this species sometimes uses undulations of its disc margins to excavate pits and reveal buried prey. It has also been observed raising the front of its disc to create a shaded [...] "cave", to attract shelter-seeking organisms. Known parasites {{of the yellow}} stingray include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium cartagenensis, Phyllobothrium kingae, Discobothrium caribbensis, Rhinebothrium magniphallum, and R. biorchidum, and the monogenean Dendromonocotyle octodiscus.|$|E

500|$|Warm air {{has a lower}} density than cool air, so warmer air rises upwards and cooler air <b>will</b> <b>settle</b> at {{the bottom}} (this effect can be seen with a hot air balloon). Clouds form as {{relatively}} warmer air, carrying moisture, rises within cooler air. The moist air rises, and, as it does so, it cools {{and some of the}} water vapor in that rising air condenses. When the moisture condenses, it releases energy known as latent heat of vaporization, which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than the cooler surrounding air continuing the cloud's ascension. If enough instability is present in the atmosphere, this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form and produce lightning and thunder. Meteorological indices such as convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the lifted index can be used to assist in determining potential upward vertical development of clouds. Generally, thunderstorms require three conditions to form: ...|$|E
