40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} design and {{development}} of the drill bit sharpening jigs for bench grinder. The objective of this thesis is to design the drill bit sharpener jig that enhance the better outcome rather than manual sharpening operation. The thesis follows with the development of the drill bit sharpening jig that can be attached to the bench grinder. The structural three-dimensional solid modeling of drill bit sharpening jig was developed using the computer-aided drawing software which is CATIA V 5 R 21. The strategy of validation of the model design was developed. The generative part structural analysis was then performed using simulation in CATIA V 5 R 21 to detect the Von Mises distribution. The design and suitable material will be validated. The fabrication of the jig may undergoes in various machining process such as milling, turning, electrical discharge <b>wirecut</b> and grinding. The assembled part shall be tested on the bench grinder. Besides, several dull drill bits will be sharpen using the jig. These assessment results are significant to improve the component design at the early developing stage. Further analysis will be conducted by testing the drilling process on the workpiece. The resharpen drill bits and the new drill bits will results on the difference surface roughness. Thus, the surface roughness analysis is performed to distinguish hole surface roughness outcomes for both drill bits. The results shows the difference of surface roughness between both hole surface is small and insignificant. Thus, it means that the outcomes is relatively same. The jig can also significantly reduce the cost and time to market, and improve product reliability and customer confidence...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} measurements of surface roughnessof clear, colorless sapphire (Al 2 O 3 – corundum modification,aluminum oxide) crystal cut by diamond wire. The diamond <b>wirecutting</b> machine RTS 440 was used for research. Only verticalfeedrate of wire was varied while the wire speed, tension, cuttingmethod and cutting angle were constant. Results are presentedas graphs of dependence of arithmetic average surface profiledeviation Ra on feedrate of the diamond wire. Sapphire plateflatness measurement results are presented as well. Sapphire platecutting time dependence on feedrate of the wire was established. The most optimal feedrate range was obtained...|$|R
2500|$|Although CCXXXI Brigade {{thought that}} its <b>wirecutting</b> was successful, {{the results of}} this {{bombardment}} were patchy. The Germans reported that in this area their 'front trenches were levelled and the wire shot away' but their casualties had been few because of their deep dugouts, and when the attack went in on 1 July their men emerged to receive the attack with heavy machine-gun and rifle fire. During the attack the 18-pounders fired a covering barrage, which was lifted onto each enemy trench line in turn, but the infantry were unable to keep up with these lifts: artillery observation during the attack was difficult due to the smokescreen and confusion. 139 Brigade broke into the first German trench and some parties reached the second, but overall the attack was a bloody failure, as was the whole Gommecourt action. Attempts to reinforce 139 Brigade during the [...] afternoon broke down and the Germans retook the positions lost.|$|R
5000|$|British Expeditionary Force [...] "GHQ Artillery Notes No. 5 Wire-cutting" [...] {{was issued}} in June 1916. It {{prescribed}} {{the use of}} shrapnel for <b>wirecutting,</b> with HE used to scatter the posts and wire when cut. However, there were constraints: the best ranges for 18-pdr were 1800-2400 yards, a narrow band. Shorter ranges meant the flat trajectories might not clear the firers' own parapets, and fuzes could not be set for less than 1000 yards. The guns had to be overhauled by artificers and carefully calibrated. Furthermore, they needed good platforms with trail and wheels anchored with sandbags, and an observing officer had to monitor the effects on the wire continuously and make any necessary adjustments to range and fuze settings. These instructions were repeated in [...] "GHQ Artillery Notes No. 3 Artillery in Offensive Operations", issued in February 1917 with added detail including the amount of ammunition required per yard of wire frontage. The use of shrapnel for wire-cutting was also highlighted in RA [...] "Training Memoranda No 2 1939".|$|R
40|$|Characterization of {{the three}} {{different}} as- received TiAl powders, namely Tax 1, Tax 2 and Tax 3 produced by Titanox development Ltd has been done. Predominate TiAl phase was observed in all the three compositions. The powder particles were very fine with average particle size of 12 μm, 5 μm and 10 μm respectively for Tax 1, Tax 2 and Tax 3. Chemical analysis of the powders showed high oxygen content in all the three compositions of the powders. Bulk samples were produced from Tax 1, Tax 2 and Tax 3 powders by hot isostatic pressing at 1200 C under a pressure of 200 Mpa for two hours. The pressurization gas used for the process was argon. The relative density of Tax 1, Tax 2 and Tax 3 HIPped samples was 96 %, 86 % and 93 %and respectively. The characterization of the HIPped samples showed that the predominate phase was γ-TiAl phase in all the three HIPped samples. A small fractions of Ti 3 Al and TiAl 3 was also observed in tax 1 and Tax 3 HIPped material. Also some of the dark Al rich phases was Al 2 O 3 phase in Tax 1 and Tax 3 HIPped samples. High oxygen content of the powder and air leaking in the can {{during the process of}} press-seal and welding {{of the end of the}} tube of the can prior to HIPping lead to poor consolidation of Tax 2 which eventually resulted in high porosity and formation of Ti 2 O and Al 2 O 3. Half of the Tax 2 HIPped sample was canned and heated to 1160 C and was subjected to open die hammer forging with a high strain and a total reduction of height by 66 %. The forging produced a pancake shaped sample without breaking of the sample. Tensile specimens were cut from the Tax 1 and Tax 3 HIPped sample and one from the Tax 2 forged sample using electrical discharge machine (EDM) <b>wirecutting.</b> Tax 1 HIPped material showed the average fracture strength of 204 MPa, 256 MPa and 197 MPa at room temperature, 800 C and 900 C respectively., Whereas Tax 3 HIPped material showed average fracture strength of 103 MPa and 234 MPa respectively at room temperature and 800 C respectively. The HIPped and the forged Tax 2 sample showed low fracture strength of 91 MPa because of the micro-cracks produced during forging...|$|R
