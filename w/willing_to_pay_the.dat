5|$|In December 1990, the NHL held {{a meeting}} in Palm Beach, Florida, to {{consider}} expansion applications. The NHL executives were reportedly impressed by the Ottawa presentation, including Finnigan's participation, the several hundred fans and the marching band who traveled to Palm Beach, but apparently were more impressed {{at the fact that}} the group {{was one of the few}} applicants <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> $50 million franchise fee without reservations. On December 6, 1990, the Terrace group was approved to purchase one of the two franchises (along with the Tampa Bay Lightning) to start play in the 1992–93 season.|$|E
5|$|Reckless {{was kept}} by Pedersen's {{family for a}} brief time before moving to a more {{permanent}} home with the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton. A second article about Reckless appeared in The Saturday Evening Post on October 22, 1955. These two articles and the book Reckless: Pride of the Marines (1955) were written by the commander of the 2nd Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Geer, who kept notes about Reckless during the war. She made several public appearances, including Art Linkletter's show House Party, but had to cancel an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show due to the typhoon. Ed Sullivan had wanted her to appear on his November 7 show and was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> costs to get her there right after the scheduled, and delayed, November 5 arrival. Reckless never did appear on Sullivan's show.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the current}} process, when the NPB team notifies the MLB Commissioner of a posting, it also sets the posting fee, {{which is now}} capped at a maximum of $20million. Once the MLB Commissioner announces the posting and the fee, the player has 30days to sign with an MLB team. Unlike the past system, in which only the team that won the bidding process had {{negotiating}} rights, the current system allows the posted player to negotiate with any MLB team <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> posting fee. As in the previous process, if the player signs with an MLB team during the negotiating window, the signing team will pay the posting fee; otherwise, his rights revert to his NPB team. Also mirroring the past system, an unsuccessfully posted player can request a posting in a later year, with the process repeated.|$|E

5|$|Leeds {{finished}} {{just five}} points above the Second Division relegation {{zone in the}} 1960–61 season and Taylor resigned; his replacement, Don Revie, was promoted from the United first team, and initially he was not fond of Charlton. Revie played Charlton up front {{at the start of}} the 1961–62 season, but he soon moved him back to centre-half after he proved ineffective as a centre-forward. He soon became frustrated and difficult to manage, feeling in limbo playing for a club seemingly going nowhere whilst his younger brother was enjoying great success at Manchester United. Revie told Charlton that he was prepared to let him go in 1962, but never actually transfer listed him. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly failed to meet the £30,000 Leeds demanded for Charlton and though Manchester United manager Matt Busby was initially <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> fee he eventually decided to instead try an untested youngster at centre-half. During these discussions Charlton refused to sign a new contract at Leeds, but felt frustrated by Busby's hesitance and so signed a new contract with Leeds whilst making a promise to Revie to be more professional in his approach.|$|E

25|$|Consumers often aren't <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> extra {{price for}} fair trade cocoa {{because they do}} not know what fair trade is. Activist groups are vital in educating {{consumers}} about the unethical aspects of unfair trade and promoting demand for fairly traded commodities. Activism and ethical consumption not only promote fair trade but also act against powerful corporations such as Mars, Incorporated that refuse to acknowledge the use of forced child labor in the harvesting of their cocoa.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} copy a concept from Stockholm, where the trams were run fast and frequently without trailers. However, Oslo Sporveier soon decided to prioritize operating costs and instead run trams and trailers. At first the company operated Class SS trailers, but these proved unsuitable {{in combination with the}} MBOs. Oslo Sporveier was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> price for new trailers and therefore chose a combination whereby new bodies were built atop existing undercarriages. Two such contractions were built at Sagene Depot in 1953, designated TO52 and the first unit can into revenue service on 23 November. A major issue with the trailers were doors which would not shut properly, often resulting with the trams running with open doors.|$|E
25|$|During his spell at PSV, Ronaldo {{attracted}} the attention of both Inter Milan and FC Barcelona. It was Barcelona that was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> then world record fee of $19.5million. During the 1996–97 season, Ronaldo scored 47 goals in 49 games in all competitions, with his goal celebration invariably the same with his arms outstretched like the statue of Christ the Redeemer that watches over his native Rio de Janeiro. He led the Catalan side to UEFA Cup Winners' Cup triumph where he capped the season with the winning goal in the cup final, and to Copa del Rey and Supercopa de España wins. He also won La Liga top scorer award in 1997 with 34 goals in 37 games, and the European Golden Shoe. Until the 2008–09 season, Ronaldo remained the last player to score more than 30 goals in La Liga.|$|E

25|$|Consumers {{typically}} have positive attitudes for {{products that are}} ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often are not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say {{they would be willing}} to pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. Once enough consumers begin purchasing fair trade, companies are more likely to carry fair trade products. Safeway Inc. began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.|$|E
25|$|To {{assist the}} ships, 14 lighthouses were built at various navigational hazards along the river. Six of them besides Tarrytown remain, from Peter's Hook in Manhattan to Hudson–Athens south of Albany, {{between those two}} communities. The shoals a half-mile (1km) off Tarrytown and Ossining (then known as Sing Sing) on the east {{bank of the river}} at the {{southern}} end of Haverstraw Bay were particularly dangerous as mariners preferred to use that side. In 1847 a location for a light was identified at Teller's Point, the southern tip of Croton Point just north of Ossining, at the north end of the shoal. That land was then used as a vineyard and its owner asked a higher price than the government was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> <b>The</b> following year Congress appropriated $4,000 ($ in modern dollars) to acquire a different site near Tarrytown, at the end of Tarrytown Point, the peninsula created by the outflow of sediment from the Pocantico River. Steamboat captains consulted by the government suggested that the light should instead be located at Beekman's Point, two miles (3.2km) away. Its owner likewise asked $3,000, which would not have left enough money to build the actual lighthouse.|$|E

The line was therefore only extended to Østerås, which could be reached using the existing fleet. The [...] extension was opened in 1972. Since 1978, Holmenkolbanen has had sufficient trams to operate an extension, but since then the municipality has not been interested in extending the line further.|$|E

500|$|It is {{believed}} that the system of patroonships was originally suggested by Van Rensselaer himself. He was reportedly {{one of the first}} of the Company to perceive that the building up of New Netherland could not be carried on without labor, and that labor could not be procured without permanent settlers. [...] "Open up the country with agriculture: that must be our first step," [...] was his urgent advice. The Company was not inclined to involve itself in further expense for colonization, and matters threatened to come to a halt, when someone — very likely Van Rensselaer himself — evolved the plan of granting large estates to men <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> cost of settling and operating them.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{immediately}} after {{the establishment of the}} new system, conflict arose. The American Revolutionary War drove potential settlers away from Prince Edward Island. This caused two problems - firstly, it made it difficult for proprietors to fulfill an obligation attached to their grants, to settle one person per [...] within ten years of the system's commencement, and secondly, it meant that the proprietors were not being paid much rent, as there were not many tenants to pay it. This meant that the proprietors were unable, or at least not <b>willing,</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> required quitrent to the Crown. Conflict also arose between the tenants and the proprietors. As the lottery for Prince Edward Island land was held in London, and most of the proprietors were important figures from the United Kingdom, most of the proprietors did not actually live in British North America. This meant that many neglected their obligations to the settlers.|$|E
500|$|Under this system, when an NPB {{player is}} [...] "posted", his NPB team notifies the MLB Commissioner and sets a posting fee not {{exceeding}} $20million. The player is then given 30days {{to negotiate with}} any MLB team <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> NPB team's set posting fee. If the player agrees on contract terms with a team before the 30-day period has expired, the NPB team receives the posting fee from the signing MLB team as a transfer fee, and the player is free to play in MLB. If no MLB team comes to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee is paid, and the player's rights revert to his NPB team. The current process replaced one in which MLB held a silent auction during which MLB teams submitted sealed, uncapped bids {{in an attempt to}} win the exclusive negotiating rights with the posted player for a period of 30days. Once the highest bidding MLB team was determined, the player could then only negotiate with that team.|$|E

500|$|The British {{were able}} to obtain {{provisions}} after the skirmish but they were slightly more expensive. English sinologist Arthur Waley theorised that given {{the corruption of the}} Canton Navy, Chinese patrol boats tried to obtain bribes from the peasants by offering to turn a blind eye on their trading activities during the embargo. Since the bribes were larger than they were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> <b>the</b> embargo was enforced and the British were cut from the supplies. But after the battle, the Chinese were disinclined to risk another naval confrontation and accepted a smaller bribe from the peasants, resulting in food supplies being available again but at a slightly higher price. The Chinese commander Lai sent a disingenuous report of victory, claiming to have sunk a two-masted English ship and inflicted at least 40 or 50 casualties. This is the first of what Chinese accounts later called the [...] "Six Smashing Blows" [...] against the British navy. However, these accounts were fabricated and the official misreporting of events were repeated throughout the war.|$|E
500|$|In the 1870s and 1880s, public {{interest}} {{grew in the}} low-mintage gold dollar. [...] Collecting coins was becoming more popular, {{and a number of}} numismatists put aside some gold dollars and hoped for increases in value. The Mint most likely channeled its production through some favored Philadelphia dealers, though proof coins could be purchased for $1.25 at the cashier's window at the Philadelphia facility. Banks charged a premium for circulation strikes. [...] They were popular in the jewelry trade, mounted into various items. [...] The coins were often exported to China or Japan, where such jewelry was made. [...] The dollars were often damaged in the process; the Mint refused to sell into this trade and did its best to hinder it. Nevertheless, Mint officials concluded that jewelers were successful at getting the majority of each issue. Proof mintages exceeded 1,000 by 1884, and remained above that mark {{for the remainder of the}} series, numbers likely inflated by agents of jewelers, <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> Mint's premium of $.25 per coin. Another use for the gold dollar was as a holiday gift; after its abolition the quarter eagle became a popular present.|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} {{for the first}} Old Firm match of the season on 18 September 2011, but was substituted {{towards the end of}} the match after suffering a further recurrence of the injury. Neil Lennon said after the match that Brown had been one of Celtic's best players, as he had been involved in both of their goals during the 4–2 defeat. Celtic announced after the match that Brown would have to go and see a specialist and would be out of action for several months. Brown made his return on 30 November, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 loss against Atlético Madrid. The next day, he was able to talk with other clubs about signing a pre-contract agreement. However, Brown signed a new three-year deal on 3 December, with Celtic having the option of extending his contract for a further season. The deal had been delayed for so long because Celtic were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> fee demanded by Brown's advisors. Brown continued his comeback by scoring in a 2–0 away win against St Mirren on 21 January 2012. He then scored a penalty against Falkirk, in a 3–1 League Cup semi-final win, on 30 January. [...] He followed this up with another penalty in Celtic's 2–0 win over Inverness five days later. Brown was then named Player of the Month for January 2012. On 25 March 2012, Brown scored a penalty in Celtic's 3–2 loss to Rangers.|$|E
