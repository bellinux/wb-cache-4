40|$|Analyzing event history {{data from}} the 2010 China Family Panel Studies and 13 {{qualitative}} interviews, we examine the complex and gendered relationship between family relations and remarriage in China. Distinct roles are played {{by the presence of}} pre-school, school-age and adult children in configuring the remarriage of women and men after divorce and after widowhood. The remarriage of widows but not divorcées is positively associated with the presence of parents and siblings respectively. Remarriage is more likely in the presence of large extended families. Whereas single and remarried divorcé(e) s equally provide care to their children, such care provision is less likely among remarried than single <b>widow(er)</b> <b>s.</b> Compared with their single counterparts, remarried divorcé(e) <b>s</b> and particularly <b>widow(er)</b> <b>s</b> are less likely to receive care from their children. We underline the importance of considering the “linked lives” of family members and comparing distinct life-course circumstances in the study of remarriage. We demonstrate that remarriage is far from an “individualized” institution, and that the state’s privatization of marriage seems to reinforce the “familialization” of remarriage practices in China...|$|R
40|$|Aims and objectives. To {{evaluate}} a feasible, best practice mental health screening and referral clinical pathway for generalist community nursing care of war veterans and war <b>widow(er)</b> <b>s</b> in Australia. Background. War veterans commonly experience mental health difficulties {{and do not}} always receive required treatment, as can also occur for war <b>widow(er)</b> <b>s.</b> Whenever opportunity arises, such as during community nursing care, {{it is vital to}} identify mental health problems in a health promotion framework. Design. A clinical pathway was developed by literature review and consultation and then trialled and evaluated using mixed methods – quantitative and qualitative. Methods. Community nurses who trialled the pathway completed an evaluation survey and attended focus groups. General practitioners responded to an evaluation survey. Results. Most nurses found the pathway clear and easy to understand but not always easy to use. They emphasised the need to establish trust and rapport with clients prior to implementing the pathway. It was sometimes difficult to ensure effective referral to general practitioners for clients who screened positive for a mental health problem. When referral was accomplished, general practitioners reported adequate and useful information was provided. Some general practitioners also commented on the difficulty of achieving effective communication between general practitioners and nurses. Conclusions. Nurses and some general practitioners found the pathway useful for their practice. They offered several suggestions for improvement by simplifying the trialled pathway and accompanying guidelines and strategies to improve communication between nurses and general practitioners. This study adds understanding of how community nurses might productively screen for mental health difficulties. Relevance to clinical practice. The trialled pathway, which was modified and refined following the study, is an evidence-based resource for community nurses in Australia and similar contexts to guide practise and maximise holistic care for war veterans and war <b>widow(er)</b> <b>s</b> and possibly other client groups. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study investigates {{whether the}} rate of decline in older persons' hearing status is {{associated}} with {{the rate of}} decrease in their psychosocial health and explores moderation by baseline hearing status, health-related factors, and sociodemographic factors. Method: Multilevel analyses were applied to data of 1, 178 older participants from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), covering 3 to 7 years of follow-up. Results: Faster decrease in speech-in-noise recognition was significantly associated with more increase in loneliness for persons with a moderate baseline speech-in-noise recognition (emotional and social loneliness) and for persons who recently lost their partner (emotional loneliness). No relationship was found with depression.

Specifically, the Article views the publicly held U. <b>S.</b> <b>benefit</b> corporation {{from the perspective}} of litigation risk. It first situates, in Part I, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>benefit</b> corporation in its structural and governance context as an incorporated business association. Corporate purpose and the attendant managerial authority, responsibilities, and fiduciary duties are the key points of reference. Then, in Part II, the Article seeks to identify and describe the salient, unique litigation risks that may be associated with publicly held corporations with the structural and governance attributes of a benefit corporation. These include both state litigation under the ultra vires doctrine and similarly situated statutory causes of action, as well as actions for breach of a corporate law fiduciary duty, and federal law causes of action for securities fraud and misstatements. The reflections in Part III draw conclusions from the synthesis of the observations made in Parts I and II. Specifically, Part III links the importance of a publicly held benefit corporation’s public benefit purpose to litigation risk management from several perspectives.

METHODS: Multinational data on non-fatal suicidal behaviour is derived from 1518 subjects in 16 European centres. Local district data on suicide were available from 10 of the collaborating centres. RESULTS: Stockholm (Sweden), Pontoise (France) and Oxford (UK) had the highest suicide attempts rates. In most centres, the majority of elderly who attempted suicide were <b>widow(er)</b> <b>s,</b> often living alone, who used predominantly voluntary drug ingestion. Non-fatal suicidal behaviour decreased with increasing age, whereas suicide rates rose. The ratio between fatal and non-fatal behaviours was 1 : 2, that for males/females almost 1 : 1.

40|$|Objective. Previous {{research}} suggests that bereavement and adjustment to widowhood are long term and should be studied as processes rather than as static outcomes. We analyze how spousal care giving affects survivors 2 ̆ 7 depressive symptoms 18 and 48 months into widowhood. Method. We use three waves of data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) Survey and estimate OLS regression equations to determine {{the long-term effects of}} spousal care giving on <b>widow(er)</b> <b>s</b> 2 ̆ 7 well-being. Results. At 18 months, more burdensome spousal care giving predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms, while greater caregiver stress predicted lower levels. Specific characteristics of the caregiving situation were no longer significant predictors of well-being 48 months into widowhood, although care giving itself had an ameliorative effect on level of symptoms. Conclusions. The results highlight the dynamic nature of bereavement and suggest that the effects of spousal care and characteristics of the care situation on depressive symptoms during widowhood are not linear over time. We discuss the implications of our findings for the conceptualization of the relationship between care giving and bereavement...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] The Railroad Retirement and Survivors’ Improvement Act of 2001 (P.

40|$|Abstract: Social {{enterprise}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly popular and profitable venture in the United States {{and around the world}} today. In the United States, the benefit corporation model leads this movement, offering incorporating companies a positive image, a platform to build consumer trust, and the flexibility to pursue social good. However, though the benefit corporation form comes with the aforementioned branding advantages, states’ benefit corporation laws as they currently exist generally lack adequate oversight mechanisms. Consequently, third parties like B Lab play an important role as the primary enforcement entities ensuring that benefit corporations adhere to their stated purposes. The U. <b>S.</b> <b>benefit</b> corporation could gain from a close analysis of the U. K. community interest corporation, as the latter model places greater emphasis on impacts to local community and operates under strict government oversight. Simultaneously, U. K. community interest corporations could enhance their efficacy by incorporating benefit corporations’ emphasis on global branding. By gaining from the other’s strengths, U. <b>S.</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations and U.

METHODS: We carried out a randomized cross-sectional population-based study of the urban population of Catanduva with individuals above 18 years of age (688 individuals accounting for 0. 9 % of the referred population). We interviewed study participants to analyze the major qualitative and quantitative variables that could influence the hypertensive scenario and the risk for systemic hypertension. Blood pressure was measured through the indirect method according to the III Consenso Brasileiro de Hipertensão (III Brazilian Consensus on Hypertension), which established blood pressure levels > or = 140 / 90 mm Hg as hypertensive.

40|$|Introduction: Experiencing {{the death}} of a spouse during late life is {{associated}} with an increased risk of developing debilitating mental health problems. Healthy lifestyle practices, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and good sleep hygiene are promising strategies to influence the mental health and associated physical symptoms of late-life spousal bereavement. Objective: This paper describes the design and rationale of an intervention development study addressing selective and indicated prevention of depression, anxiety, and/or complicated grief disorder(s) among adults 60 years and older who are grieving the recent loss (within 8 months) of a spouse or partner. Methods: In Phase I, now complete, we developed and standardized behavioral self-monitoring of daily lifestyle choices via an electronic diary (BSM) and the combined BSM + motivational interviewing-based lifestyle coaching (BSM + MI) to be administered to participants grieving the loss of loved one. In Phase II, we have been implementing the interventions in a randomized controlled trial and addressing challenges related to recruitment.

This study explores the considerations taken into account by these patients in decision-making regarding renal replacement therapy. Method: In-depth interviews were conducted to gain an enhanced understanding of the considerations in treatment decision-making. Fourteen patients aged 65 years or older participated in the interviews, of whom 8 patients had made the decision to start, and 6 patients the decision to decline, dialysis. Results: All participating patients had a variety of health problems, but appeared to have normal cognitive functions. Patients who declined dialysis were older and more often men and <b>widow(er)</b> <b>s</b> compared with patients who accepted dialysis. Patients chose to start dialysis because they enjoyed life, were not prepared to face the end of life, felt they had no other choice or had care-giving responsibilities for family members. Patients declined dialysis because of the speculated loss of autonomy, their age-associated decrease in vitality, distance from dialysis center and reluctance to think about the future.
