5|$|On September 27, 2013, Morris {{signed with}} the Philadelphia 76ers. As the September 28 {{training}} camp date approached, Morris was expected to battle with Tony Wroten for the backup point guard position behind Michael Carter-Williams. When Carter-Williams missed games, it was Wroten who moved into the starting lineup. On November 16, 2013 he scored a NBA regular season career high 20 points along with 2 assists in a 13598-point loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. On November 20, 2013, he was waived by the 76ers as part of roster moves that included signing Elliot Williams and Lorenzo Brown and waiving Kwame Brown. In December, {{he was one of}} several guards to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the Memphis Grizzlies. That month, he was also considered by the Los Angeles Lakers when Kobe Bryant was injured since point guards Blake, Nash and Jordan Farmar were all injured. The Lakers, however, decided to sign Kendall Marshall who was averageing 19.4 points and 9.6 assists in the D-League at the time.|$|E

25|$|Incognito {{was part}} of an {{offensive}} line that allowed 45 sacks. Although this was still among the league's 10 worst in terms of sacks allowed, it was the fewest allowed by the Rams since 2003. Following the 2008 season, Incognito became a restricted free agent, although he continued to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the Rams during the off-season.|$|E
500|$|The cast {{included}} Norman Reedus as Judas, while Gaga {{played the}} part of Mary Magdalene. Gibson and Gaga {{wanted to make sure}} the video's direction was perfect—so they directed it themselves. Gibson explained that while working with Nick Knight on the music video for [...] "Born This Way", they had felt that the ideas presented did not execute in a way they wanted. But with the music video of [...] "Judas", the whole idea and the inspiration was clear enough. They had initially approached a director, but the dates did not <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> him, so Gaga's manager asked her and Gibson to direct the video instead.|$|E
500|$|After redshirting his {{freshman}} year in 1980–81 {{because he could not}} yet get clearance from the NCAA to play, Olajuwon played sparingly as a redshirt freshman in 1981–82, and the Cougars were eliminated in the Final Four by the eventual NCAA champion, North Carolina Tar Heels. Olajuwon sought advice from the coaching staff about how to increase his playing time, and they advised him to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> local Houston resident and multiple NBA MVP winner, Moses Malone. Malone, who was then a center on the NBA's Houston Rockets, played games every off season with several NBA players at the Fonde Recreation Center. Olajuwon joined the workouts and went head to head with Malone in several games throughout the summer. Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving his game: [...] "The way Moses helped me is by being out there playing and allowing me to go against that level of competition. He was the best center in the NBA at the time, so I was trying to improve my game against the best." ...|$|E

500|$|The Astros traded Caminiti to the San Diego Padres {{before the}} 1995 season. With Caminiti no longer {{blocking}} his {{path to the}} major leagues, Nevin hoped he would be named the Astros' starting third baseman. But the Astros did not invite him to spring training. Nevin attributed the snub to his refusal to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> replacement players during the work stoppage. Not wanting {{to be seen as}} [...] "scabs" [...] by the Major League Baseball Players Association, minor league players who felt they would play in MLB after the resolution of the strike felt pressure to avoid playing with replacement players, while career minor-leaguers were happy to get a taste of the major leagues. When prospects including Nevin and Billy Wagner refused to play with the replacement players, Astros' general manager Bob Watson issued an ultimatum, saying anyone who refused to play in the team's first exhibition game would be sent out of camp until further notice and be held in breach of contract. The Astros sent Nevin back to Tucson to start the 1995 season, while Dave Magadan started at third base on Opening Day. The Astros also planned to use Shipley and Chris Donnels at third base.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked by}} TV Guide if he would've {{remained}} on General Hospital had the show's producers [...] "tried harder" [...] to accommodate his personal life, Burton stated: [...] "I don't {{want to point}} fingers. I {{know there are a}} lot of disappointed fans. They don't really understand what goes on behind the doors. They don't understand why I wouldn't go back to play Jason if I'm ready to work again. But what happens at GH should stay at GH." [...] Phelps dismissed rumors that she has [...] "lured" [...] Burton away from General Hospital. While clarifying rumors about him leaving General Hospital because of Phelps' appointment as executive producer of The Young and the Restless, Burton described them as [...] "interesting". He told On-Air On-Soaps that he knew people would try to put [...] "two and two together", but it was never his intention to leave General Hospital purposely, as he just couldn't reach a contractual agreement with the show. [...] "It’s just like a sports player...when a deal does not <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> his team, there might be another team out there that might want him," [...] Burton said. During the week Burton debuted on the series as Dylan, the show experienced an increase of over 105,000 viewers, averaging 4.7 million viewers. Michael Fairman, during an interview with Burton, noted the [...] "significant increase" [...] in viewers, which Burton was a [...] "big reason" [...] for.|$|E

There were many issues that they had to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Germany in the months after the occupation.

By {{the end of the}} month, he {{was allowed to}} participate in minor league games. In order for this to happen, the Rays had to run Hamilton through waivers, making him available for any team for $20,000. No team put a claim in for him. He played 15 games with the Hudson Valley Renegades {{at the end of the}} 2006 season. [...] In addition to returning to baseball, Hamilton also served as a cautionary tale for his young teammates with the Renegades.|$|E
2500|$|After the 1942 season, Daley {{enlisted in}} the United States Navy.

[...] He stayed in Ann Arbor for only six months while waiting for an opening in the program at Columbia. [...] While in Ann Arbor, recruits were required to remain in good physical shape and were given two choices: either participate in Navy fitness classes or <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the Michigan football team. [...] Michigan's football coach Fritz Crisler took advantage of the opportunity and convinced Daley to play for his football team, as Daley had one year of eligibility remaining.|$|E

Her spokesperson released the following statement: [...] "All I can really say, {{because of the}} confidentiality issues, {{is that it was}} in Charlotte's financial interests to do so before the agreement entered the second year of its term. This is typical for these type of deals, which are investment deals rather than record deals. I can also say that the decision to terminate the term early, which suited both parties, was made well before the commercial release of the album". A spokesperson from the record label also released a statement saying [...] "It didn't <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Charlotte and that's fair enough. There was no falling out. It was a mutual decision. They decided to exit the deal".|$|E

6000|$|Marian {{asked if}} she would be read to, and took up a serious book, with which she had put her to sleep {{two or three times}} before, but nothing of the kind would she hear; and as the best chance of at least quieting her, Marian went on a voyage of {{discovery}} among the club books down stairs, and brought up a book of travels, and a novel. Mrs. Lyddell chose the novel; it was a very exciting story, and caught the attention of all three. Marian grew eager about it, and was well pleased to go on; and so it occupied them most of the afternoon and evening, driving out a great deal of care, as Marian could not help gratefully acknowledging, though she would willingly have had space to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> herself the question, whether care had best be driven out or grappled with. Mrs. Lyddell was indeed in no state to grapple with it, and {{there was nothing to be}} done but to take the best present means of distracting her attention; yet it was to be feared that, though put aside, the enemy was not conquered,--and might there not be worse to come? ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} that blame is to be {{attached}} to any one. I at least attach no such blame. Probably it might be easy now to show that the road might have been made with sufficient accommodation for ordinary purposes without some of the more costly details. The great tubular bridge, on which was expended 1,300,000 pounds, might, I should think, have been dispensed with. The Detroit end of the line might have been left for later time. As it stands now, however, it is a wonderful operation carried to a successful issue as far as the public are concerned; and one can only grieve that it should be so absolute a failure to those who have placed their money in it. There are schemes which seem to be too big for men to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> any ordinary regard to profit and loss. The Great Eastern is one, and this is another. The national advantage arising from such enterprises is immense; but the wonder is that men should be found willing to embark their money where the risk is so great and the return even hoped for is so small.|$|E

60|$|Another {{incident}} briefly {{related to}} Mrs. Gladstone brings us {{on to more}} serious ground: “Hawarden, Sept. 12.—Cobden came early. Nothing could {{be better than the}} luncheon, but I am afraid the dinner will be rather strong with local clergy. I have had a walk and long talk with Cobden who, I think, pleases and is pleased.” This was the garden walk of which we have just heard, where Cobden, the ardent hopeful sower, scattered the good seed into rich ground. The idea of a commercial treaty with France was in the air. Bright had opened it, Chevalier had followed it up, Persigny agreed, Cobden made an opportunity, Gladstone seized it. Cobden’s first suggestion had been that {{as he was about to}} spend a part of the winter in Paris, he might perhaps be of use to Mr. Gladstone in the way of inquiry. Conversation expanded this into something more definite and more energetic. Why should he not, with the informal sanction of the British government, put himself into communication with the Emperor and his ministers, and <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> them the scheme of a treaty that should at once open the way to a great fiscal reform in both countries, and in both countries produce a solid and sterling pacification of feeling? Cobden saw Palmerston and tried to see Lord John Russell, and though he hardly received encouragement, at least he was not forbidden to proceed upon his volunteered mission.(14) “Gladstone,” wrote Cobden to Mr. Bright, “is really almost the only cabinet minister of five years’ standing who is not afraid to let his heart guide his head a little at times.” The Emperor had played with the idea of a more open trade for five or six years, and Cobden, with his union of economic, moral, and social elements, and his incomparable gifts of argumentative persuasion, was the very man to strike Napoleon’s impressionable mind. Although, having alienated the clericals by his Italian policy, the ruler of France might well have hesitated before proceeding to alienate the protectionists also, he became a convert and did not shrink.|$|E
60|$|Within {{the last}} minute seven new {{citizens}} were born into that great English-speaking community which is scattered under various flags and governments throughout the world. And according {{to the line of}} thought developed in the previous paper we perceive that the real and ultimate business, so far as this world goes, of every statesman, every social organizer, every philanthropist, every business manager, every man who lifts his head for a moment from the mean pursuit of his immediate personal interests, from the gratification of his private desires, is, as the first and immediate thing, to do his best for these new-comers, to get the very best result, so far as his powers and activities can contribute to it, from their undeveloped possibilities. And in the next place, as a remoter, but perhaps finally more fundamental duty, he has to inquire what may be done individually or collectively to raise the standard and quality of the average birth. All the great concerns of life <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a very little analysis to that, even our wars, our orgies of destruction, have, at the back of them, a claim, an intention, however futile in its conception and disastrous in its consequences, to establish a wider security, to destroy a standing menace, to open new paths and possibilities, {{in the interest of the}} generations still to come. One may present the whole matter in a simplified picture by imagining all our statesmen, our philanthropists and public men, our parties and institutions gathered into one great hall, and into this hall a huge spout, that no man can stop, discharges a baby every eight seconds. That is, I hold, a permissible picture of human life, and whatever is not represented at all in that picture is a divergent and secondary concern. Our success or failure with that unending stream of babies is the measure of our civilization; every institution stands or falls by its contribution to that result, by the improvement of the children born, or by the improvement in the quality of births attained under its influence.|$|E
6000|$|The first {{interference}} {{should be}} in education. In order that men {{may be able to}} support themselves when they are grown, their strength must be properly developed while they are young; and the state should always see to this--not allowing their health to be broken by too early labour, nor their powers to be wasted for want of knowledge. Some questions connected with this matter are noticed farther on under the head [...] "Trial Schools:" [...] one point I must notice here, that I believe all youths of whatever rank, ought to learn some manual trade thoroughly; for it is quite wonderful how much a man's views of life are cleared by the attainment of the capacity of doing any one thing well with his hands and arms. For a long time, what right life there was in the upper classes of Europe depended in no small degree on the necessity which each man was under of being able to fence; at this day, the most useful things which boys learn at public schools, are, I believe, riding, rowing, and cricketing. But it would be far better that members of Parliament should be able to plough straight, and make a horseshoe, than only to feather oars neatly or point their toes prettily in stirrups. Then, in literary and scientific teaching, the great point of economy is to give the discipline of it through knowledge which will immediately bear on practical life. Our literary work has long been economically useless to us because too much concerned with dead languages; and our scientific work will yet, for some time, be a good deal lost, because scientific men are too fond or too vain of their systems, and waste the student's time in endeavouring to give him large views, and make him perceive interesting connections of facts; when there is not one student, no, nor one man, in a thousand, who can feel the beauty of a system, or even take it clearly into his head; but nearly all men can understand, and most will be interested in, the facts which bear on daily life. Botanists have discovered some wonderful connection between nettles and figs, which a cowboy who will never see a ripe fig in his life need not be at all troubled about; but {{it will be interesting to}} him to know what effect nettles have on hay, and what taste they will give to porridge; and it will give him nearly a new life if he can be got but once, in a spring time, to look well at the beautiful circlet of the white nettle blossom, and <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> his schoolmaster the curves of its petals, and the way it is set on its central mast. So, the principle of chemical equivalents, beautiful as it is, matters far less to a peasant boy, and even to most sons of gentlemen, than their knowing how to find whether the water is wholesome in the back-kitchen cistern, or whether the seven-acre field wants sand or chalk.|$|E
