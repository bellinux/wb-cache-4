5|$|Most of the Daddies' studio albums {{are written}} to varying extents as concept albums, {{featuring}} either recurring lyrical themes or an abstract progressive narrative. According to Perry, this lyrical interconnectedness is intended as means of providing an album with threads of thematic stability against <b>wildly</b> varying musical styles.|$|E
5|$|On land, their {{movements}} become very erratic. They crawl awkwardly {{in these situations}} and can become quite aggressive, striking <b>wildly</b> at anything that moves, although {{they are unable to}} coil and strike in the manner of terrestrial snakes.|$|E
5|$|Though silk was {{exported}} to foreign countries in great amounts, sericulture remained {{a secret that}} the Chinese carefully guarded. Consequently, other peoples invented <b>wildly</b> varying accounts {{of the source of}} the incredible fabric.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being one}} of the oldest {{surviving}} examples of Spanish architecture in California, the house gained much prominence by association with Helen Hunt Jackson's <b>wildly</b> popular 1884 novel Ramona. The Casa de Estudillo is one of three National Historic Landmarks in Southern California that were closely tied to Ramona, a novel of Californio life shortly after the American acquisition of California; the other two are Rancho Camulos and Rancho Guajome.|$|E
5|$|Chaco endures {{remarkable}} climatic extremes: temperatures {{range between}} , and may swing 60°F (33°C) {{in a single}} day. The region averages fewer than 150frost-free days per year, and the local climate swings <b>wildly</b> from years of plentiful rainfall to prolonged drought. The heavy influence of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation contributes to the canyon's fickle climate.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, {{aircraft}} development became increasingly expensive, resulting in major projects often becoming mired in {{political and economic}} concerns. The development of TSR-2 saw increasing cost overruns, combined {{with the presence of}} a potentially cheaper alternative then under development in the United States, the F-111. The P.1154 was subject to the ongoing inter-service rivalry between the Royal Navy and RAF, which led to two <b>wildly</b> differing specifications being submitted for the aircraft that were impossible to fulfill with a single airframe.|$|E
5|$|From the start, {{the film}} moves {{continuously}} between Barton's subjective {{view of the}} world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera pans down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering <b>wildly</b> for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E
5|$|Lost Luggage is {{an action}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} skycap porters who are attempting to collect falling luggage from a <b>wildly</b> unpredictable baggage carousel. The objective is to collect all the suitcases that fall from the carousel before they hit the ground. The player starts with three suitcases, which act as lives, and whenever a suitcase hits the floor, the player loses one. If all of the player's suitcases are lost, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Over the Bering Sea, {{the three}} B-29s {{maintained}} radio contact with each other, communicating positions hourly as they navigated independently. Near the Arctic Circle, the magnetic compasses fluctuated <b>wildly,</b> and the fliers ignored them, relying {{instead on the}} radio compass. In Number 2, the radio compass stopped working as well, but it resumed working later in the flight.|$|E
5|$|The Custer Trail, {{named for}} General George Armstrong Custer, {{was created in}} 1917 along a series of roads between Grand Rapids and Ft. Wayne, Indiana that {{included}} the modern M-37. Custer commanded the Michigan Cavalry Bridge during the Civil War, and he was <b>wildly</b> popular in the state after the war. The road {{that bears his name}} never achieved that level of popularity. By 1930, the name had already fallen out of use.|$|E
5|$|We {{were trying}} to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews. These days there's so much paper to fill, or digital paper to fill, that whoever writes the first few things gets cut and pasted. Whoever gets their opinion in first has all that power. Especially for a band like ours, it's totally {{the luck of the}} draw whether that person is into us or not. It just seems <b>wildly</b> unfair, I think.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Milan Ćirković and colleagues {{extended}} {{the notion of}} a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics. The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate <b>wildly</b> with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a punctuated equilibrium in which habitable planets are more likely at some times than at others. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way, the team found that the number of habitable planets is likely to increase with time, though not in a perfectly linear pattern.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas, {{armed with a}} Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the {{aircraft}} {{was still in the}} climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving <b>wildly,</b> the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Before {{each game}} and single-player Conquest, players choose between Sports and Action camera views. Action view is a {{trailing}} third-person shot similar to {{looking over the}} player-character's shoulder, while Sports view is a spectator perspective similar that of a televised basketball game. Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports view. The camera view cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view camera swings <b>wildly</b> and can be pulled back slightly in the menus.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the {{regional}} policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period; but this view was shown to be <b>wildly</b> optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.|$|E
5|$|Davis, Hill, and Mitchell {{find him}} {{rumbling}} {{around in the}} power plant. Davis tries to kill him, but Steiner resists his bullets, so Hill again tries to persuade Steiner {{to return to the}} laboratory. Steiner is eventually convinced, so he goes with them, but when he arrives, he tricks them and begins destroying things. With the laboratory on fire and the projection device <b>wildly</b> out of control, Steiner is hit by the projection device's laser, causing him to disappear as the fire rages on.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{production}} struggles, Toy Story 2 {{opened on}} November 24, 1999 to <b>wildly</b> successful box office numbers, eventually grossing over $497 million, and received critical acclaim, with a rare100% ratingon the websiteRotten Tomatoes.Toy Story 2 {{has been considered}} by critics {{to be one of}} few sequel films to outshine the original, and it continues to be featured frequently on lists of the greatest animated films ever made. The film has seen multiple home media releases and a theatrical 3-D re-release in 2009, 10 years after its initial release. Toy Story 3 was released in 2010, which was also critically and commercially successful.|$|E
5|$|Elements of {{the canvas}} refer to Grünewald's c. 1512–16 Isenheim Altarpiece and Peter Paul Rubens's c. 1612–14 Descent from the Cross. According to the art critic Hugh Davies, the open mouth of the victim and the {{predator}} leaning over the cross link the painting to Rubens' Descent. The mouth in Rubens' painting is loosely opened, but in Bacon's it is taut. The main figure's legs are folded out of view and the figure's left arm is passive in Rubens' painting, but in the Bacon's painting the chimera's legs and arms are in violent motion, seemingly <b>wildly</b> flailing up and down.|$|E
5|$|Furious, Presto {{tries to}} attack Alec, {{but in an}} act to defend himself, Alec puts an offstage ladder into the wizard hat, and Presto is hit between his legs. Presto {{attempts}} to hit Alec with it, but it misses and hits a backstage door, and Presto ends up getting pushed across the stage. Presto antagonizes Alec again, covering the carrot with a cloth before smashing it into a pulp {{with a piece of}} the ladder. Alec furiously retaliates by aiming the opening of the wizard's hat towards an electrical socket which Presto's fingers go into, shocking Presto into dancing <b>wildly</b> to bluegrass music.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels was {{involved}} in planning the staging of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started {{having an affair with}} the actress Lída Baarová, whom he continued to see until 1938. A major project in 1937 was the Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved <b>wildly</b> popular, attracting over two million visitors. A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year. Meanwhile, Goebbels was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} rushing offense, {{the two teams}} {{differed}} <b>wildly.</b> Virginia Tech, led by Vick, ran for 278rushing yards. Florida State, meanwhile, ran for just 30yards. The Seminoles were led on the ground by Chaney, who carried the ball four times for 43yards, and Minor, who carried the ball nine times for 35yards. Much of these two players' rushing total was negated by Chris Weinke, who lost 41yards on seven carries. Virginia Tech, bolstered by Vick's 97rushing yards, also saw André Kendrick accumulate 69yards and two touchdowns with 12carries and Shyrone Stith pick up 68yards on 11carries.|$|E
5|$|On patrol, Riley notices {{shadows in}} the belfry and goes to investigate. Buffy finds two of The Gentlemen's minions, kills one and runs after the other. Riley fights {{his way into the}} belfry and while he's embattled, Buffy crashes through a window, fighting. He turns to attack and finds himself face to face with Buffy. She fights while he stares, unmoving. When a minion pins her down she sees and recognizes the box from her dream and gesticulates <b>wildly</b> for Riley to destroy it. When he does so, the stolen voices escape. Buffy screams until the heads of The Gentlemen and their minions explode.|$|E
5|$|Once in control, {{however, the}} group allows power {{to go to}} their heads. At first they {{efficiently}} implement their ideas for Springfield, which include banning green traffic lights and playing only classical music at the dog races, which elevates Springfield past East St. Louis on the list of America's 300 Most Livable Cities. However, they begin to internally fight over other ideas such as having theaters for shadow puppets and a broccoli juice program, and their <b>wildly</b> unpopular plans at a public meeting (including the banning of all contact sports and Comic Book Guy's plan to limit breeding to every 7 years) further expose the rifts inside the group.|$|E
5|$|Reports of {{this first}} contact between {{opposing}} forces outside St. Jean were often <b>wildly</b> exaggerated, with many local reports claiming it {{as some kind of}} victory. The Quebec Gazette, for example, reported that 60 Indians had driven off 1,500 Americans, killing 30 and wounding 40. Following this news, General Carleton issued orders for all of the nearby parishes to call up ten percent of their militia. Officers of the militia reported to Montreal, but many militia men stayed home. By September 7, a troop of about 120 men was raised, which was sent to Fort St. Jean.|$|E
5|$|The {{daughter}} of a book salesman and homemaker, O'Neill was raised in rural Nebraska. She exhibited interest in the arts at an early age, and sought a career as an illustrator in New York City at age fifteen. Her Kewpie cartoons, which made their debut in a 1909 issue of Ladies' Home Journal, were later manufactured as bisque dolls in 1912 by J. D. Kestner, a German toy company, followed by composition material and celluloid versions. The dolls were <b>wildly</b> popular {{in the early twentieth}} century, and are considered {{to be one of the}} first mass-marketed toys in the United States.|$|E
5|$|A. V. M. Rajan portrayed Shanmugasundaram's brother Thangarathnam. According to playwright Crazy Mohan, Gopulu's {{caricature}} {{of the character}} Vaithi in Subbu's novel was similar to Nagesh, who portrayed Vaithi in the film. Manorama played the <b>wildly</b> expressive, loud-talking but tender-hearted folk dancer Karuppayi, who has to contend with living under the shadows of landlords; she changes her identity {{every now and then}} to escape from them. In an interview with Maalai Malar, Manorama stated that she was initially nervous acting in front of Ganesan and Balaiah, but Nagarajan assured her that whenever her character appeared she would be the centre of attention, which gave her the confidence to play her role. Serial and theatre artist M. L. Bhanumathi played the nurse who treats Shanmugasundaram. Other supporting actors included K. Sarangkapani, S. Ramarao, M. K. Murthy, Balusundaram, T. N. Sivadhanu, S. R. Dasarathan, Sivasooriyan, Senthamarai, Kallapart Natarajan, Gundu Karuppaiah, Chandranbabu, S. V. Rajagopal, A. M. Maruthappa, Udayachandrika, Ambika and Kalpalatha.|$|E
5|$|Books were expensive, {{since each}} copy {{had to be}} written out {{individually}} on a roll of papyrus (volumen) by scribes who had apprenticed to the trade. The codex—a book with pages bound to a spine—was still a novelty {{in the time of}} the poet Martial (1st century AD), {{but by the end of}} the 3rd century was replacing the volumen and was the regular form for books with Christian content. Commercial production of books had been established by the late Republic, and by the 1st century AD certain neighbourhoods of Rome were known for their bookshops (tabernae librariae), which were found also in Western provincial cities such as Lugdunum (present-day Lyon, France). The quality of editing varied <b>wildly,</b> and some ancient authors complain about error-ridden copies, as well as plagiarism or forgery, since there was no copyright law. A skilled slave copyist (servus litteratus) could be valued as highly as 100,000 sesterces.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{problems}} of the press launch day, a more positive response was expected from the 20,000 members of the public who attended the remaining two days of the launch event to try out the C5 on the Alexandra Palace test track. Sinclair reported the day after the event that its switchboard had been overwhelmed by enquirers, and it expected that all 2,700 units from the first production run would be sold by the following Monday. Setting a pattern that would be repeated throughout the C5's short commercial life, this prediction was <b>wildly</b> optimistic; less than 200 were sold during the Alexandra Palace event. However, sales picked up as mail order forms – which had been sent to all of Sinclair's computer customers – were returned with fresh orders. Within four weeks, 5,000 C5s had been sold.|$|E
5|$|Edgardo {{was visited}} {{by his father}} several times under the {{supervision}} of the rector of the Catechumens, Enrico Sarra, from mid-August to mid-September 1858. The <b>wildly</b> divergent accounts of what happened during these encounters grew into two rival narratives of the entire case. Momolo's version of events, favoured by the Jewish community and other backers, was that a family had been destroyed by the government's religious fanaticism, that helpless Edgardo had spent the journey to Rome crying for his parents, and that the boy wanted nothing more than to return home. The narrative favoured by the Church and its supporters, and propagated in the Catholic press throughout Europe, was one of divinely ordained, soul-stirring redemption, and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years—the neophyte Edgardo had faced a life of error followed by eternal damnation but now stood to share in Christian salvation, and was distraught that his parents would not convert with him.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{emerged as}} a leading {{political}} figure in Boston just as tensions with Great Britain were increasing. In March 1765, he was elected as one of Boston's five selectmen, an office previously held by his uncle for many years. Soon after, Parliament passed the 1765 Stamp Act, a tax on legal documents, such as wills, that had been levied in Britain for many years but which was <b>wildly</b> unpopular in the colonies, producing riots and organized resistance. Hancock initially took a moderate position: as a loyal British subject, {{he thought that the}} colonists should submit to the act, even though he believed that Parliament was misguided. Within a few months, Hancock had changed his mind, although he continued to disapprove of violence and the intimidation of royal officials by mobs. Hancock joined the resistance to the Stamp Act by participating in a boycott of British goods, which made him popular in Boston. After Bostonians learned of the impending repeal of the Stamp Act, Hancock was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in May 1766.|$|E
5|$|Hardcore, punk, and garage rock {{were the}} roots of {{alternative}} rock, a diverse grouping of rock subgenres that were explicitly opposed to mainstream music, and that arose from the punk and post-punk styles. In the United States, many cities developed local alternative rock scenes, including Minneapolis and Seattle. Seattle's local scene produced grunge music, a dark and brooding style inspired by hardcore, psychedelia, and alternative rock. With {{the addition of a}} more melodic element to the sound of bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains, grunge became <b>wildly</b> popular across the United States in 1991. Three years later, bands like Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid, Bad Religion, and NOFX hit the mainstream (with their respective then-new albums Dookie, Smash, Let's Go, Stranger than Fiction and Punk in Drublic) and brought the California punk scene exposure worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Hokies {{have had}} limited success. From 1892 to 1921, Tech competed as a {{football}} independent. The Hokies won several games against larger, better-funded teams during this time, but did not compete in many games outside the American South. From 1921 to 1964, Tech {{was a member of}} the Southern Conference and won the conference championship in 1963. The membership of the Southern Conference fluctuated <b>wildly</b> at times during Tech's tenure. When the conference was created in 1921, it boasted 23 teams. This number was reduced when the Southeastern Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference split away in 1932 and 1953, respectively. By the time Tech won the conference championship in 1963, the conference's membership had shrunk to less than 10 teams. Tech administrators, wanting to expand the football program, chose to leave the conference and become a football independent once more.|$|E
5|$|In 1695 Parliament {{failed to}} renew the Licensing Acts, and as a result, the press were free to print {{material}} attacking the government. Although there were eight attempts to force a new Licensing Act through Parliament between 1697 and 1713, none of them succeeded. Despite {{the freedom of the}} press from censorship by the government, the judiciary held a different view; it regularly tried people for seditious libel if they printed material attacking the government. From 21 November 1768, letters written by a man under the pseudonym of Junius were published in the Public Advertiser, a London newspaper run by Henry Sampson Woodfall. In them, Junius attacked many political leaders, including Lord Granby and Mansfield. As his letters were <b>wildly</b> popular, the circulation of the Public Advertiser doubled in just five months.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, American {{director}} George Lucas had released Star Wars, a <b>wildly</b> successful {{science fiction}} film influenced by Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, among other works. Lucas, {{like many other}} New Hollywood directors, revered Kurosawa and considered him a role model, and was shocked {{to discover that the}} Japanese filmmaker was unable to secure financing for any new work. The two met in San Francisco in July 1978 to discuss the project Kurosawa considered most financially viable: Kagemusha, the epic story of a thief hired as the double of a medieval Japanese lord of a great clan. Lucas, enthralled by the screenplay and Kurosawa's illustrations, leveraged his influence over 20th Century Fox to coerce the studio that had fired Kurosawa just ten years earlier to produce Kagemusha, then recruited fellow fan Francis Ford Coppola as co-producer.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing <b>wildly</b> in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E
