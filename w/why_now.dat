500|$|Production on {{the season}} began on July 21, 2016, in Los Angeles. Whedon made his directorial debut with [...] "Self Control". Whedon noted he had decided {{at the end of}} season three to direct an episode in season four after doing some second unit work on [...] "Spacetime" [...] under Kevin Tancharoen. He {{credited}} his brother and series creator Joss Whedon along with Tancharoen, and his [...] "years working with S.H.I.E.L.D.s directors from a showrunning perspective and his close relationship with the cast and crew" [...] for <b>why</b> <b>now</b> was the right time for him to direct an episode. The cast expressed enthusiasm with Whedon directing [...] "Self Control", given he also wrote the episode, with Bennet feeling, [...] "The vision is so clear. There's a lot more room to play, like 'what about this?' and the enthusiasm because he wrote these words, he knows what's coming next. It's been so much fun." [...] Ahead of filming the final episode of the season, Wen injured her leg in an on set accident with [...] "a fairly severe injury". Wen noted the production was able to work around her injury with no delay and that she would still be involved with the episode. Production {{on the season}} concluded on April 17, 2017.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2010, Sonya's younger sister, Jade (Gemma Pranita) was {{introduced}} to the serial. A reporter from the Herald Sun stated that Jade's arrival would see her expose [...] "a dark secret" [...] held by Sonya. Before Jade arrived in Erinsborough, she and Sonya had been estranged from each other for seven years. Jade contacts Sonya out of the blue, leaving her [...] "mortified" [...] by the call. Pranita told Jackie Brygel from TV Week, [...] "Sonya's response is 'Why are you calling me? <b>Why</b> <b>now?</b> Don't come anywhere near me!' But Jade keeps ringing and harassing Sonya and then rocks up on her doorstep." [...] Pranita explained that Jade and Sonya share a bad history and that Jade has been holding on to one of Sonya's darkest secrets, which the people in Sonya's life know nothing about. The actress thought that Jade's appearance would [...] "completely rock the boat", especially as she has the potential to cause trouble for her sister and expose her for lying to everyone.|$|E
2500|$|Hello Folks, Donna Deegan here. For {{those of}} you who haven't been {{watching}} this past week, where've you been? Seriously, if you haven't had the time to tune in, I have changed my name to, well, my name. So many of you have e-mailed to say [...] "Hey Donna, it's about time!" [...] Well, fortunately the station thought so too. Tim and I have been married for more than five years, and I have been Deegan everywhere but on the air since then. So <b>why</b> <b>now?</b> Well, there is no great strategy here. For some time now the station has been putting together a new look for our news opens, graphics etc. That's a big deal and very expensive so it's not done very often. While making those plans they very graciously asked if I would like to change my on-air name. I talked it over with my kids and with Tim and everyone said [...] "go for it" [...] so I did. That simple. The decision {{had nothing to do with}} my recent recurrence. It will be fun to see if I can actually call myself the correct name every day. Between chemo and my normal space cadet nature, I think the betting pool is in full swing.|$|E
