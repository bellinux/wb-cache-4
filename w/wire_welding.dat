Identical heat input (2. 75 kJ/mm) was used to weld one side of the plates, while various heat inputs (single wire: 3. 03 kJ/mm and 3. 43 kJ/mm; tandem wires: 4. 11 kJ/mm and 4. 56 kJ/mm) were used for the second side. The weld properties were evaluated using visual inspection, ultrasonic inspection, hardness measurements, tensile and fatigue testing, weld bead geometry measurement, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results obtained showed that heat input affected the microstructure, hardness and weld bead geometry of ASTM A 709 Grade 50 steel welds appreciably, but had little effect on the tensile and yield strengths. Increase in heat input slightly reduced the amount of acicular ferrite within the weld metal zone, and resulted in coarser microstructures in the coarse-grained heat-affected zone. The hardness of the coarse-grained heat-affected zone and the weld metal zone increased with increasing heat input. The penetration depth, heat affected zone size, bead width, bead reinforcement, penetration area, and nugget area of the weld increased with increasing heat input for both single wire and tandem <b>wire</b> <b>welding,</b> but the contact angle decreased. Electrode melting efficiency increased with increasing heat input for single <b>wire</b> <b>welding,</b> but the plate melting efficiency only changed within 4 % between single wire and tandem <b>wire</b> <b>welding.</b> Percent dilution remained practically unchanged with increasing heat input.

40|$|Twin wire {{submerged}} {{arc welding}} (SAW) is widely used in the joining of oil or gas pipe lines because of its high productivity. However, when it is applied to join the high strength steel pipe, the heat affected zone (HAZ), especially the coarse grain zone, becomes very brittle. To investigate the strength and toughness of HAZ, thermal cycles in HAZ due to twin wire SAW must be studied. In present studies, theoretical equations of twin <b>wire</b> <b>welding</b> thermal cycles for thick plate, thin plate are developed by authors and the critical thicknesses for both thick plate and thin plate are determined. The welding thermal cycles for intermediate thickness are predicted by linear interpolation using results of both thick plate and thin plate.

Good agreement among theoretical results, FEM and experimental results was achieved.

40|$|Multi-pass {{fusion welding}} by a filler <b>wire</b> (<b>welding</b> electrode) is {{normally}} {{carried out to}} join thick steel sections used in most engineering applications. Welded joints in an installation, is the area of critical importance, since {{they are likely to}} contain a higher density of defects than the parent metal and their physical properties can differ significantly from the parent metal. Fusion arc welding process relies on intense local heating at a joint where a certain amount of the parent metal is melted and fused with additional metal from the filler wire. The intense local heating causes severe transient thermal gradients in the welded component and the resulting uneven cooling that follows produces a variably distributed residual stress field. In multi-pass welds, multiple thermal cycles resulted in a variably distribution of residual stress field across the weld and through the thickness. These complex thermal stresses generated in welds are undesirable but inevitable during fusion welding. Presence of such tensile residual stresses can be detrimental to the service integrity of a welded structure. In addition to a complex distribution of residual stress state, multi-pass welds also forms dendritic grain structure, which are repeatedly heated, resulting in segregation of alloying elements. Dendritic grain structure is weaker and segregation of alloying elements would result in formation of corrosion microcells as well as reduction in overall corrosion prevention due to depletion of alloying elements...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{introduces}} {{an experimental}} work {{carried out in}} multi-pass laser welding with cold filler wire and laser-arc hybrid welding of thick section austenitic stainless steel. As it has been demonstrated earlier, hybrid and cold <b>wire</b> <b>welding</b> with a keyhole-mode can offer very efficient way to produce multi-pass welds in narrow gap thick section joints. However, when multi-pass welding is applied to one pass per layer method without e. g. scanning or defocusing, the used groove width needs to be very narrow {{in order to ensure}} the proper melting of groove side walls and thus to avoid lack of fusion/cold-run defects. As a consequence of the narrow groove, particularly in thick section joints, the accessibility of an arc torch or a wire nozzle into the very bottom of a groove in root pass welding can be considerably restricted. In an alternative approach described in this paper, a power density of a laser beam spot was purposely dispersed by using a defocusing technique. In groove filling experiments, a power density of defocused laser beam was kept in the range, which led the welding process towards to conduction limited regime and thus enabled to achieve broader weld cross-sections. The object was to study the feasibility of defocusing as a way to fill and bridge wider groove geometries than what can be welded with focused keyhole-mode welding with filler addition.

40|$|Installation of new {{pipelines}} {{is predicted}} to grow at a rapid rate over the next twenty years, {{due in part to}} the increase use worldwide of combined cycle power generation plant using natural gas a fuel. The need to construct large diameter pipelines over long distances has led to an increased demand to improve the productivity of pipeline girth welding. Many novel techniques have been tried in the past to achieve productivity gains, including laser welding, flash butt welding, homopolar welding, and radial friction welding. In spite of the failure to gain wide acceptance, there is still current development aimed at achieving their eventual implementation. Single wire mechanised gas metal arc welding (GMAW) remains the dominant pipe girth welding technique, and has been optimised in the past to produce the maximum productivity possible with this process. Continued development of GMAW with dual torch, tandem GMAW welding and novel techniques for GMAW roots is leading to further significant gains in arc welding productivity. This paper describes a new development, the CAPS project, (Cranfield Automated Pipe-welding System), where tandem GMAW in a narrow groove has been applied to pipeline girth welding with two tandem torches in a single welding head.
