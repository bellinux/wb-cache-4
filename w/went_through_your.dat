5000|$|Chanakya {{then took}} Chandragupta to conquer Pataliputra, {{the capital of}} Nanda. He {{assembled}} an army using the wealth he had acquired through alchemy (dhatuvada-visaradan). The army suffered a severe defeat, forcing Chanakya and Chandragupta to flee the battlefield. They reached a lake while being pursued by an enemy officer. Chanakya asked Chandragupta {{to jump into the}} lake, and disguised himself as a meditating ascetic. When the enemy soldier reached the lake, he asked the 'ascetic' if he had seen Chandragupta. Chanakya pointed at the lake. As the soldier removed his armour to jump into the lake, Chanakya took his sword and killed him. When Chandragupta came out of the water, Chanakya asked him, [...] "What <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> mind, when I disclosed your location to the enemy?" [...] Chandragupta replied that he trusted his master to make the best decision. This convinced Chanakya that Chandragupta would remain under his influence even after becoming the king. On another occasion, Chanakya similarly escaped the enemy by chasing away a washerman, and disguising himself as one. Once, he cut open the belly of a Brahmin who had just eaten food, and took out the food to feed a hungry Chandragupta.|$|E

Ford began her lecture by asking the class “What <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> mind when you decided what you were going to wear today?” This question opened up the class to discover what fashion means to them personally and how it shapes who they are as people. This personalized focus on fashion shifted to how Blacks felt in the 1970 s and how it drove their desire to focus on their own personal brand and {{what it meant to be}} Black in the 1970 s...|$|E

40|$|Self-ratings {{of health}} are central {{measures}} of health status that predict outcomes such as mortality and declines in functional ability. Qualitative and quantitative data {{are used to}} test the hypothesis that definitions of health that are narrowly biomedical are associated with underestimates of self-ratings relative to respondents ’ medical histo-ries, while definitions that are broad and inclusive are related to relatively better self-ratings. A sample of 159 elderly African Americans rates their health and reports “what <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> mind. ” Analysis of variance shows that respondents who overestimate their health are more likely to report ratings based on social activities and relationships, or psychological, emotional, or spiritual characteristics, rather than biomedical criteria. The authors conclude that inclusive definitions of health facilitate more positive self-ratings of health, given a fixed health status; methodologically, they conclude that this is a promising method for exploring self-ratings of health. Self-ratings of health have become an increasingly important topic of study, particularly for elderly populations. For one thing, their ability to predict mortality in long-term follow-up studies has been demon-strated so repeatedly now that it is almost becoming a cliché (Idler and Benyamini 1997). Even when more objective measures of health status are included in the study, simple, global self-ratings predict sur-vival during short follow-up periods of just 2 years (Ho 1991; Rakowski, Mor, and Hiris 1991) and long periods of up to 13 year...|$|E
