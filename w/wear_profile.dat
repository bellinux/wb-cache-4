5000|$|During use, the {{cylinder}} {{is subject to}} wear from the rubbing action of the piston rings and piston skirt. This is minimized by the thin oil film which coats {{the cylinder}} walls and also by a layer of glaze which naturally forms as the engine is run-in, but eventually the cylinder becomes worn and slightly oval in shape, usually necessitating a rebore to an oversize diameter and the fitting of new, oversize pistons. The cylinder does not wear above the highest point reached by the top compression ring of the piston, which {{can result in a}} detectable ridge. If an engine is only operated at low rpm for its early life (e.g. in a gently driven automobile) then abruptly used in the higher rpm range (e.g. by a new owner), the slight stretching of the connecting rods at high speed can enable the top compression ring to contact the wear ridge, breaking the ring. For this reason it is important that all engines, once initially run-in, are occasionally [...] "exercised" [...] through their full speed range to develop a tapered <b>wear</b> <b>profile</b> rather than a sharp ridge.|$|E

In the case examined both leading and trailing wheels <b>wear</b> to <b>profiles</b> having greater effective wheel conicity. The leading worn wheels exhibit flange and tread wear and the <b>worn</b> <b>profile</b> has highly non-linear conicity having little vertical displacement over the middle range of lateral displacement. A large vertical displacement is still achieved by the <b>worn</b> leading wheel <b>profile</b> in the last section of the flangeway clearance. The worn trailing wheels have only tread wear with near linear effective conicity across the flangeway. The hunting instability performances of the vehicle with the uni-directional wheel <b>wear</b> <b>profiles</b> is shown {{to have a higher}} critical speed than new wheel profiles due to the mismatch of the leading and trailing wheel profiles. The leading wheels of the bogie hunt with a wavelength of 26 - 30 m whilst the trailing wheels hunt at a wavelength of 12 - 16 m. Because of the differing frequency responses in the front and rear wheelsets of each bogie, lateral instability is damped for the <b>worn</b> wheel <b>profiles.</b> The <b>worn</b> profiles’ curving performance is also improved due to increases in the total profile conicity. Individually the leading wheel <b>worn</b> <b>profile</b> with its non-linear conicity across the flangeway has lower critical speed than a new wheel profile, the non-linear shape leading to chaotic lateral instability. The trailing wheel profile with its highly linear conicity across the middle of the flangeway has classic sinusoidal hunting at a much reduced critical speed and much reduced wavelength. The <b>worn</b> wheel <b>profiles</b> by themselves for both leading wheel and trailing wheel are found to have critical speeds 80 % of the new wheel profile critical speed.

40|$|One area in AG/SAG milling field {{which has}} {{received}} a great attention is the optimum liner design for any application to increase the availability of mills. Since the <b>wear</b> <b>profile</b> is not uniform, the modified version of a specially designed measuring device was introduced which accurately determines the <b>wear</b> <b>profile</b> at any given point along the liner length. The procedure to build the 3 -D liner <b>wear</b> <b>profile</b> was also outlined. Upon finding appropriate models, which accurately described the wear rate of the liners, {{with the objective of}} arriving at the uniform liner profile at the liner removal time, new liner designs were proposed. These not only increased the liner life time but they also decreased the scrap metal content. For any new liner design the charge behavior was studied to evaluate the location of the ball impacts. Application of the proposed method in a 9. 75 × 4. 88 m SAG mill indicated that the liner <b>wear</b> <b>profile</b> along the liner length was non-uniform and the highest wear occurred between 1. 25 m and 2. 75 m of the mill length. The liners {{of the first half of}} the mill from the feed end showed more wear (19. 1 g/t) compared to that of the second half (17. 1 g/t). The proposed liners unlike the pervious type did not have a uniform shape and the lifter height was increased from 152 mm to 187 mm at the section where the wear rate was high. It was believed that this new profile could arrive at a uniform profile at the liner change out time. The simulation of charge motion indicated that the impact position of charge will change only one degree due to an increase of 10 to 35 mm in the lifter height. It was predicated that the amount of scrap metal will reduce to 30 % from the current value of 47 % and on average the liner life time will increase by 1500 h...|$|E

Charge motion {{is one of the key}} parameters affecting grinding efficiency and mill power draw. Although there have been numerous investigations on the effect of liner design on charge motion, the effect of charge profile due to liner wear during mill operation along the mill length has not received much attention. In this research, Powell’s analytical approach to calculate the charge trajectory with respect to the liner profile was used to develop a software based on Microsoft Excel©. As a case study, the liner <b>wear</b> <b>profile</b> of the Sarcheshmeh copper complex SAG mill was used to model the liner wear rate and calculate the changes of lifter face angle and lifter height during mill operation. Results were then used to determine charge motion in the SAG mill at any given operation time.

Modeling charge motion in the mill after 3000 h of operation showed 34 ° difference between the maximum and minimum of angles of impact along the mill length due to the nonuniform <b>wear</b> <b>profile.</b> It was also found that the variation in the pattern of the charge motion depends on the mill working hours and the distance of the desired point from the feed end.
