50|$|R.B. {{introduced}} cornets soon afterward. The Super Olds line of trombones, trumpets and cornets {{was introduced}} in about 1932 and soon became legendary. Other models introduced in the 1930s include the Special, Military, Symphony and French models. All but the Super models could be ordered <b>with</b> a distinctive <b>hammered</b> <b>finish</b> on the bell. This was the standard finish for the Military line. The Super bass trombone could be had with two valves, both actuated by levers. This is likely the first production bass trombone with two valve levers. There were also some french horns made in the late 1930s, although they didn't appear in the catalogues at that time. The Recording model trumpet and cornet were probably designed shortly before the war halted production. During World War II, the government had Olds produce saxophones along with the more standard strategic production. Today these are very rare as they were not generally {{available to the public}} and a large number of them went down with a supply ship in the Mediterranean. By 1941 Olds held al least six patents for trumpet and trombone design.|$|R

However, marks left a small hard hammer can leave similar marks to a soft hammer.|$|R
