He eventually accepted Rutgers' scholarship offer.|$|E
5|$|In 1655 Wheelwright {{moved back}} to England with his family, and preached {{near his home in}} Lincolnshire. While in England he was entertained by two of his very {{powerful}} friends, Oliver Cromwell, who became England's Lord Protector, and Sir Henry Vane, who occupied several key positions in the government. The political tide turned markedly during the more than six years he <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> following Cromwell's death and Vane's execution, Wheelwright returned to New England to become the minister in Salisbury, Massachusetts, where he spent the remainder of his life. He was characterized as being contentious and unbending, but also forgiving, energetic and courageous. His sincere piety was never called into question, even by those whose opinions differed greatly from his.|$|E

5|$|In January 1448, {{the terms}} of the {{previous}} Captains and Defenders ended, and in the following election the Guelphs rose to political prominence. Being especially adverse to Sforza, they entered peace negotiations with Venice, which, also threatened by Sforza's growing power, was willing to come to terms, albeit dictated by herself. Two of the Ghibellines who helped to found the Republic, namely Lampugnano and Bossi, stirred the populace against the Guelphs in a massive demonstration before the Court of Arengo. The Council of Nine Hundred was forced to abandon its plans for peace, and Sforza was given the go-ahead for his next campaign to seize the Adda River. However Sforza's plans were voted down by the Republic in favor of more traditional tactics, namely besieging Lodi directly. While this happened, the Venetian fleet under Andrea Quirini assaulted the bridge of Cremona. However, Sforza's wife Bianca <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> led the defense until her husband relieved the city. The Venetian fleet withdrew and entrenched while it waited for the arrival of the Venetian army. Sforza trapped the fleet behind its defenses and, with his unorthodox use of artillery, utterly destroyed or captured every one of the seventy ships. This victory was celebrated in Milan, but the leaders of the Republic still feared Sforza, and sent him off to occupy himself with the Ghiarad'adda region while Lodi and Caravaggio were besieged, hoping that their fall would end the war.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, Garza's {{half-brother}} Moya {{testified against}} him and said Garza admitted he had received US$3,000 for Fischer's murder {{while he was in}} Brownsville. Garza's defense tried to discredit Moya's statements by saying he was facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a reduced sentence. Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the clarity of the tapes. The defense attorneys brought in experts to discredit the recordings, and to prove they had been tampered with.|$|E
5|$|Portuguese sappers built a {{pontoon bridge}} over the Guadiana river which united two Portuguese {{quarters}} in Vado del Moro and allowed Mendes de Vasconcelos' troops to cross the river. Having reinforced Santa Engracia, north of San Critsóbal, and fortified a {{bridge over the}} Gévora river, they built, unmolested, an arc of the circumvallation from Gévora to Vado del Moro. Fort del Mayordomo, located near the Guadiana river, had been abandoned by its Spanish garrison shortly after being built. The Portuguese used it to cover {{the construction of the}} circumvallation line to the Guadiana. They also tried to occupy Cerro del Viento, a hill near Vado del Moro, but were repelled by the Spanish garrison that <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> had to build the circumvallation line behind it. Given the strategic importance of Cerro del Viento, the nearby hill of Cerro de las Mayas had been earmarked for an improvised star fortification by the Italian general Ventura de Tarragona, but it had not been built, leaving the Fort of San Miguel vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|The Four Kings {{were very}} popular in Cuba, and the Japanese media were proud of the {{reputation}} they were bringing to judo and Japan. Consequently, on January 8, 1912, the Kodokan promoted Maeda to 5th dan. There was some resistance to this decision because there were those in Japan who did not approve of his involvement in professional wrestling. In 1913, Tokugoro Ito stayed in Cuba while Maeda and Satake went to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In El Salvador, the president was assassinated while Maeda <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> in Panama, the Americans tried to pay him to lose; in response, they kept moving south. In Peru they met Laku, a Japanese jujutsuka who taught the military, and invited him to join them. They were then joined by Okura in Chile, and by Shimitsu in Argentina. The troupe arrived in Brazil on November 14, 1914.|$|E
5|$|The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) {{selected}} Chicago over Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and San Francisco as its candidate city to {{host the}} 2016 Summer Olympics and 2016 Summer Paralympics on April 14, 2007.

5|$|The {{match was}} characterised {{by a large}} number of fouls – 13 by United, 18 by Arsenal – and referee Steve Bennett showed four yellow cards to each team, {{although}} most of those came {{as a result of the}} fracas at the end of the game. Vieira was booked in the 77th minute for a foul on Quinton Fortune, and was shown a second yellow card not long after, in the 80th minute. In challenging for a high ball outside the Arsenal penalty area, Van Nistelrooy jumped up onto Vieira's back. Vieira fell to the ground and kicked out at Van Nistelrooy in retaliation, causing the Manchester United striker to jump backwards. Van Nistelrooy was booked for the original foul, and although Vieira's kick failed to connect with the Dutchman, the referee believed that the intent <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> booked Vieira for the second time, resulting in his dismissal.|$|E

The ISA confirmed he <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> an SBS reconnaissance element carried out reconnaissance of the compound which showed that Dadullah was protected 20 insurgents. That night, with the ISA monitoring the target, the majority of C Squadron were inserted by RAF CH-47D Chinooks whilst covered by Apache helicopters, the troops stormed the compound and a one hour long firefight took place as small groups of Taliban were hunted down and killed. 4 SBS personnel were wounded (one seriously), eventually Dadullah {{was shot in the}} chest and head, quick SSE was conducted and before the assault force was picked up by helicopter. On 24 September 2007, members of C squadron SBS and the Italian SOF unit Col Moschin rescued two Italian intelligence agents who were kidnapped by the Taliban in Herat province near Farah, they had been kidnapped 2 days before. Col Moschin parachuted onto a drop zone and marched overnight to surround the target compound, whilst the SBS were standing by in Lynx and Chinook helicopters to provide cut off groups in-case the insurgents attempted to escape, whilst a US Predator drone supported the British and Italians. The insurgents brought the hostages out of the compound and loaded them into vehicles before the Italians were in position to rescue them, the SBS closed in on the vehicles: aerial snipers using M82A1 antimaterial rifles forced the vehicles to stop. A Chinook dropped off more than a dozen SBS personnel who engaged the Taliban who were disembarking the vehicles, 8 Taliban insurgents were killed and the hostages were rescued, however one died of gunshot wounds.|$|E

25|$|In 1415, Ceuta was {{occupied}} by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast, moved by expanding Christianity with the avail of the Pope and a desire of the unemployed nobility for epic acts of war after the reconquista. Young prince Henry the Navigator <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> became aware of profit possibilities in the Saharan trade routes. Governor of the rich Order of Christ since 1420 and holding valuable monopolies on resources in Algarve, he invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of Mauritania, gathering a group of merchants, shipowners, stakeholders and participants interested in the sea lanes. Later his brother Prince Pedro, granted him a royal monopoly of all profits from trading within the areas discovered. Soon the Atlantic islands of Madeira (1420) and Azores (1427) were reached. There wheat and later sugarcane were cultivated, like in Algarve, by the Genoese, becoming profitable activities. This helped them become more wealthy.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking more}} captives and booty, the raiders left Mindoro {{to return to}} Mindanao. They put into the river of a little {{uninhabited}} island to get water and wood.

He passed so {{near the mouth of}} the river, in three small boats with very few men, that it was a wonder that he was not seen and captured by the enemy. He learned that the enemy <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> then he met with the twelve vessels sent from Manila in search of the raiders. The governor ordered the commander to make more haste and gave him some of his own men to guide him to where he had left the pirates the day before, whereupon they went to attack them. However, the sentinels of the raiders raised the alarm, and they left the river in haste, throwing into the sea goods and slaves in order to flee more lightly.|$|E
25|$|In 1812 Blackford moved west.

Having spent most of his funds on education, Blackford could not to afford to take the stage coach and walked from New Jersey to the Allegany River where he traveled downriver by raft to Cincinnati and then continued on foot to Dayton. He lived only briefly in Dayton and continued further west, moving into the Indiana Territory and first living in Brookville. He carried with him letters of introduction to territorial Judge Isaac Dunn, a friend of George MacDonald. The letter helped him to quickly establish himself among the small legal community in the territory. Brookville was the administrative center of the eastern half of the territory, but Blackford had little chance of making a substantial income as a lawyer there, so he sought work in the civil service. He moved again to Salem where he was appointed by Governor William Henry Harrison to be clerk and recorder in the newly formed Washington County.|$|E
