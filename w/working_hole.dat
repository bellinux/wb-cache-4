This paper presents methods used by the authors to determine the percent of cold working to be applied and to analyze fatigue crack growth of cold worked fastener holes. An elastic, perfectly-plastic analysis of a thick-walled tube is {{used to determine the}} stress field during the cold working process and the residual stress field after the process is completed. The results of the elastic/plastic analysis are used to determine the amount of cold working to apply to a hole. The residual stress field is then used to perform damage tolerance analysis of a crack growing out of a cold worked fastener hole. This analysis method is easily implemented in existing crack growth computer codes so that the cold worked holes can be used to extend the structural life of aircraft. Analytical results are compared to test data where appropriate...|$|R

The method introduces a zone of compressive residual stresses around the hole, which attenuates fatigue crack growth rates by reducing the effective stress intensity factor range. Therefore, the method reduces the tendency for fatigue cracks to initiate and grow under cyclic loading. Aircraft components are subjected to a complicated sequence of variable fatigue loading during service. Residual stresses around cold expanded holes can be relaxed because of the plastic deformation produced by in-service loading.

40|$|The {{conventional}} electronics {{uses the}} charge {{property of the}} electrons and holes. The building blocks are semiconductors which can be tuned to change {{the properties of the}} devices. In the field of spintronics, the spin property of the charge carriers is added to the functionality of the devices. The spin-valve transistor (SVT) is one of the spintronics devices which allows us to study the spindependent transport characteristic of non-equilibrium electrons and holes in semiconductor/ferromagnetic hybrid structures. The SVT uses Schottky barriers to inject and collect hot-carriers. In the metal base of the device, two ferromagnetic metals separated by a nonmagnetic metal are utilized to analyze the spin-dependent transport of the electrons and holes. In this thesis, one of the motivations is to understand the role of interfaces in the hot-electron transport. Another motivation is to study the spin relaxation in metals which is crucial for adding the functionality of spin property. Finally, {{it is important to understand}} the hot-hole transport since the devices <b>working</b> with <b>holes</b> and electrons offer better performances...|$|R

There he joined a choir and, with some friends, formed his first musical ensemble, called The Skyway Band. While at school he discovered the Rastafari movement. At the age of 18 Dube joined his cousin's band, The Love Brothers, playing Zulu pop music known as mbaqanga whilst funding his lifestyle by <b>working</b> for <b>Hole</b> and Cooke {{as a security guard}} at the car auctions in Midrand.

Though Dube was still at school, the band recorded material in Johannesburg during his school holidays. The resultant album was released under the name Lucky Dube and the Supersoul. The second album was released soon afterwards, and this time Dube wrote some of the lyrics in addition to singing. It was around this same time when he began to learn English.|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional {{finite element}} (FE) studies, for plane stress, plane strain and {{axisymmetric}} conditions, were con-ducted to simulate 4 per cent cold working of a 6. 35 mm diameter {{hole in a}} 6 mm thick plate of 2024 T 351 aluminium alloy. The simulations {{were used to assess}} the influence of strain hardening, the role of reversed yielding and through-thickness residual stress distributions. Experiments were also conducted to determine the tensile and com-pressive stress-strain response of the aluminium alloy, revealing a pronounced Bauschinger effect and non-linear strain hardening in compression. The FE simulations and results from several earlier analytical models were com-pared and substantial differences found in the region of reversed yielding. Approximations used to model the compressive deformation behaviour of the material overestimate the compressive residual stresses at the hole edge. From the axisymmetric FE model a residual stress gradient through the plate thickness was found. The plane stress and plane strain assumptions used in the earlier analytical models did not satisfactorily approximate the three-dimensional residual stress fields obtained from the FE simulations.

The main aim of our papaer is to investigate how the circular motion can be converted into a square motion by purely a mechanical linkages; an application {{of which is to}} construct a special tool that drills exact square holes. The geometrical construction that fulfils the laid objective is Reuleaux Triangle. Additionally, for this geometry to work like a rotating drive (such as a drill press) must force the Reuleaux triangle to rotate inside a square, and that requires a square guide to constrain the Reuleaux triangle as well as a special coupling to describe the fact that the center of rotation also in moves within in the constrain.

For osteolysis around a well-fixed cup, the decision is more controversial. The data available data support retention of the cupwith lesional treatment, <b>working</b> through screw <b>holes</b> and access channels for debridement and grafting.

Today {{the only}} way to {{eliminate}} contact with the product during the manufacturing process is to provide a support surface under its support surface air buffer layer formed due to the expiration of the <b>working</b> environment through <b>holes</b> perforated gas distribution grids forms. There proposed the method of contactless formation of products consisting of composite materials by the means of air buffer in the article. The results of theoretical and experimental investigations of hydro-gas-dynamic processes occurring when casting of organic- mineral composite material onto the bearing air buffer expressed in the form of mathematical description realizing original hypotheses reflected in the choice of transformation algorithm and limiting conditions are presented. On the base of obtained mathematical model the algorithm of calculation of optimum parameters of transporting systems with discretely powered gas buffer is developed. The method of deduction of a semi-finished product on the gas buffer, which allows to level the pressure field under the bearing surface of the deduction object due to the usage of devices of pseudo fluidized granular material in pneumatic chambers is offered. The application of this method allows to eliminate the possibility of contact between the composite material and the working surface of the equipment and also to reduce the cost of production of pneumatic devices, to improve operational characteristics of this equipment. Submitted depending allowed to develop the methodology and implementation of engineering calculation device for non-contact casting composite materials on air buffer, semi-industrial and industrial variants were created and put into production...|$|R
