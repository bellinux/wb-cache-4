5|$|Highway27 was {{designated}} as a two lane road travelling north from Highway2 (Lake Shore Boulevard) towards Barrie. As Toronto grew outwards following the annexation of various municipalities, the Ontario Department of Highways (DHO) began planning for a bypass of the city, aptly named the Toronto Bypass. A significant portion of this bypass <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> {{be incorporated into the}} Transprovincial Highway, now Highway401. The remainder <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> follow the existing right-of-way of Highway27 between the QEW and Richview Sideroad (now Eglinton Avenue).|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{training}} period was for six weeks; {{later it was}} changed to eight weeks. General in scope, the program <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> give cadets an overall view of the USCG. Academic study included: administration, correspondence, communications, history, organization, personnel, public speaking, ships, and special lectures and visual aids. The regimental part of {{the training}} <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> help cadets adjust to military life, and to acquaint them with their responsibilities as officers.

5|$|The Valkyrie <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be a high-altitude Mach3 bomber {{with six}} engines.

5|$|The game <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> have a {{sense of}} unpredictability so it can be played without {{confining}} the player to rules. To achieve this, the company added the breaching system, which adds more varieties of combat and gives players more choices when dealing with the artificial intelligence. The breaching system, which originated as a mini-game, <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be simple so it would not interrupt the flow of gameplay. Instead of being purely a first-person shooter, the game features action-adventure elements that allow players to choose their progression and tasks them with solving environmental puzzles.|$|E
5|$|When the LIFE {{project was}} first proposed, it {{focused on the}} nuclear fusion–fission hybrid concept, which uses the fast {{neutrons}} from the fusion reactions to induce fission in fertile nuclear materials. The hybrid concept <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> generate power from both fertile and fissile nuclear fuel and to burn nuclear waste. The fuel blanket <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> use TRISO-based fuel cooled by a molten salt made from a mixture oflithium fluoride(LiF) andberyllium fluoride(BeF2).|$|E

5|$|Although the Mellotron <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> {{reproduce}} {{the sound of}} the original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played. Pressing a key harder allows the head to come into contact under greater pressure, {{to the extent that the}} Mellotron responds to aftertouch.|$|E
5|$|Another {{canceled}} {{proposal to}} orbit Ganymede was the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter. It <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> use nuclear fission for power, ion engine propulsion, {{and would have}} studied Ganymede in greater detail than previously. However, the mission was canceled in 2005 because of budget cuts. Another old proposal was called The Grandeur of Ganymede.|$|E

5000|$|Linda Williams {{argues that}} horror, melodrama, and {{pornography}} all {{fall into the}} category of [...] "body genres" [...] since they <b>are</b> each <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> elicit physical reactions on the part of viewers.
