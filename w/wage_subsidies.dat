[...] Results indicate that the most effective strategies for keeping young people in school are those that build bridges to the world of work while young people are still in school.

[...] There is some evidence that co-operative education programs lead to improved employment outcomes in post-secondary school although the number of work experience placements offered by employers is quite limited. There are a number of concerns regarding the presence of corporations in the school. There is a fear that the active involvement of business will encourage governments to retreat from their role as the primary funders of education (Torjman, 1998). [...] Other issues of corporate involvement in schools reveal disquieting implications of a corporate ideology and ethos entering the learning experience of our young people (Hill and McGowan, 1996). Teachers are concerned that partnerships with corporations involved in military research and development send a clear message to students. The presence of military contractors in classrooms suggests that schools are not concerned with violence and oppression in the world (Hill and McGowan, 1996). Some school boards have developed business-education guidelines which are intended to act as a code that partners can apply to regulate themselves throughout the duration of the partnership but according to the Conference Board of Canada, guidelines and codes of conduct differ significantly (Hill and McGowan, 1996). A code of conduct serves as a screening process to ensure that only socially-responsible businesses are granted access to schools and the partnerships activities would be monitored by an external evaluation committee of parents, community members, teachers and business representatives.|$|E

50|$|The idea of wage {{insurance}} {{has been}} tested as early as 1995 in Canada's Earnings Supplement Project. Robert Litan and Lori Kletzer proposed the idea for wage insurance in United States in a 2001 paper. The basic concept became the United States Department of Labor's Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance for Older Workers (ATAA). The ATAA compliments the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which does not offer a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> or <b>wage</b> insurance. The TAA focuses on retraining workers while the ATAA includes a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> for workers who are considered too old to undergo retraining. The ATAA program includes a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> for laid off workers {{over the age of}} 50 who held a job with wages less than $50,000 a year, and who start a new job within 26 weeks of being laid off.

30|$|This paper reviews {{international}} {{experiences with}} the implementation of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> and develops a policy framework to guide their design in developing countries. The evidence suggests that, if the goal is only to create jobs, <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> are unlikely to be an effective instrument. <b>Wage</b> <b>subsidies,</b> however, could have a role in helping first-time job seekers or those who have gone through long-periods of unemployment or inactivity, to gain some work experience and in the process build skills and improve their employability. If these “learning” effects are large enough, the social benefits of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> could outweigh their cost. When <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> are designed with these objectives in mind, there are important implications in terms of eligibility and targeting, how the subsidy is set, its duration, and the types of conditionalities on employers and beneficiaries. Given uncertainty regarding their impact, in all cases, programs should be piloted and evaluated prior to full scale implementation.|$|E

In general the authors find different results for the two models bearing different implications of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> on skill formation.

In Poland the results were even less encouraging: male beneficiaries of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> {{were less likely to be}} employed.

30|$|We {{also see}} that {{expectations}} were inaccurate for the <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> program, with respondents dramatically underestimating the short-term {{effect of the}} subsidy and overestimating the longer-term effect.

Audiences believed the combination of the <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> voucher and soft skills training was likely to have larger impact than either treatment alone, but this complementarity did not occur in practice. None of the respondents had all six of their expectations lie within the 95  % confidence intervals of the actual impacts. Furthermore, there was considerable heterogeneity among respondents in their relative rankings of the interventions: at the first (second) follow-up, 59 (47)[*]% thought the <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> would have a larger impact than the soft skills training, 11 (14)[*]% that the impact would be the same, and 30 (39)[*]% that the <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> would have less impact than the soft skills training.|$|R
30|$|A more {{promising}} function of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> {{in developing countries}} would be to allow workers to acquire skills that improve their employability and labor market opportunities through work experience and on the job-training.

30|$|Countries {{adopting}} <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> {{would then}} need considered the following issues {{in terms of}} design: 1) {{in order to minimize}} substitution and windfall effects, target <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> to narrow categories of workers who are truly excluded from wage employment; 2) promote self-selection by asking beneficiaries to participate in preparatory activities such as life-skills training; 3) use vouchers to identify beneficiaries but make payments to the employer to increase incentives for take up; 4) set <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> as a percentage of negotiated wages up to a maximum; 5) have in place the right communication campaign; and 5) have in place the necessary systems for enforcement, monitoring and evaluation. In terms of the latter, given considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> on human capital and labor market outcomes, it is important that programs are piloted and evaluated prior to full scale implementation.|$|E

In principle, these agencies can become “one-stop shops” where job-seekers register.
