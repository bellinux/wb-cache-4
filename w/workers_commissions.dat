The organization also defends active and combative unionism, as opposed to the mild tactics of the main unions, specially <b>Workers</b> <b>Commissions</b> and the Unión General de Trabajadores. It has a Galician nationalist and socialist ideology. The CUT has offices in Santiago de Compostela, A Coruña, Vigo, Cangas do Morrazo and Ribeira. In 2009 600 members of the CUT split (including the majority of the militants of A Coruña and Ferrolterra) and formed the Central Obreira Galega (Galician Workers Central).|$|E

5000|$|After leaving prison, {{he moved}} to the Leonesa Region of Laciana, to return to work in the mines. Leaving behind its anarcho-syndicalist influences, the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) {{contacted}} him for the reorganization of its structure in the Spanish interior. Thus, he became the underground communist leader for León and Galicia. His participation in the Mining Strike of 1962 (called [...] "The Huelgona"), sets an important historic precedent, to settle one of the first permanent Workers' Commissions. Since the late 1950s, the trade-union policy of the PCE has marked the over-involvement of the Vertical unions. Various Asturian miners' strikes (1958, 1959, ...), had formed the <b>Workers</b> <b>Commission,</b> which dissolved {{by the end of the}} conflict. The difference from the Laciana case is that, during that strike, the workers managed to introduce 12 representatives into the Company Board controlled by the Ponferrada Mining, Iron and Steel Company and close to the Franco Regime. One of those representatives was Benjamin Rubio, settling a Permanent Work Commission, and whose extension will be the birth of the <b>Workers</b> <b>Commission</b> Union (CCOO), of which he became an important leader.|$|R

In 1973 he participated in the election for the leadership of the Lisbon Metallurgical Workers' Union, dominated by the collaborationists of the regime, a characteristic of the corporativist regime of Salazar.

These essays, and responses by six additional discussants, were presented at a roundtable held in Canberra in May 2011.

While prior studies focused mainly on individual characteristics, the present analysis investigated the impact of work and institutions more closely using the European Social Survey. Multilevel analyses across 21 countries showed that work characteristics increased the benefits from work, hence increasing the likelihood of participation among older workers, and that the generosity of institutions discouraged older workers {{to remain in the}} labor market...|$|R
