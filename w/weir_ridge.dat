2500|$|Despite hearing heavy gunfire {{from the}} north, {{including}} distinct volleys at 4:20pm, Benteen concentrated on reinforcing Reno's badly wounded and hard-pressed detachment rather than continuing on toward Custer's position. Benteen's apparent reluctance to reach Custer prompted later criticism {{that he had}} failed to follow orders. Around 5:00pm, Capt. Thomas Weir and Company D moved out to make contact with Custer. They advanced a mile, to what is today <b>Weir</b> <b>Ridge</b> or Weir Point, and could see in the distance native warriors on horseback shooting at objects on the ground. By this time, roughly 5:25pm, Custer's battle may have concluded. The conventional historical understanding is that what Weir witnessed was most likely warriors killing the wounded soldiers and shooting at dead bodies on the [...] "Last Stand Hill" [...] at the northern end of the Custer battlefield. Some contemporary historians have suggested that what Weir witnessed was a fight on what is now called Calhoun Hill. The destruction of Keogh's battalion may have begun with the collapse of L, I and C Company (half of it) following the combined assaults led by Crazy Horse, White Bull, Hump, Chief Gall and others. Other native accounts contradict this understanding, however, and the time element remains a subject of debate. The other entrenched companies eventually followed Weir by assigned battalions, first Benteen, then Reno, and finally the pack train. Growing native attacks around <b>Weir</b> <b>Ridge</b> forced all seven companies to return to the bluff before the pack train, with the ammunition, had moved even a quarter mile. The companies remained pinned down on the bluff for another day, but the natives were unable to breach the tightly held position.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} <b>Weir</b> <b>Ridge,</b> Weir Point {{is about three}} miles south from where Custer and the {{soldiers}} with him were killed. Weir Point is the location where Captain Weir and those with him realized that Custer was beyond their aid, and that hostile warriors were advancing towards the relief force in substantial numbers. From Weir Point the surviving members of the 7th Cavalry withdrew back to the already-established defensive positions on Reno Hill.|$|E
