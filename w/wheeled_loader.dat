Two main challenges are that sensors are not located with respect to this task and that significant usage disturbances typically occur during operation. The proposed method is based on a combination of several individually simple techniques using signal processing, state automaton techniques, and parameter estimation algorithms.

40|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>loaders</b> in the V-type {{loading cycle}} are {{characterized}} by complicated loading conditions, nonlinear power-train system, and time-variable engine power distribution. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} predict the fuel consumption of <b>wheel</b> <b>loaders</b> in the V-type loading cycle. The static matching methods cannot provide fuel consumption prediction for the loading cycle. In this paper, the prediction method and model of the fuel consumption for <b>wheel</b> <b>loaders</b> in the V-type loading cycle were proposed. Firstly, the hydraulic system data were tested when a <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> loaded three different materials in a typical V-type loading cycle. Secondly, the tested data were filtered by the 8 th-order Butterworth filter and the dimensionless power deduction equations of hydraulic power system for loading three different materials were obtained by Gaussian and linear fitting based on the filtered data in the loading cycle. Finally, fuel consumption was obtained with the compiling dynamic calculation program as well as input parameters of tested vehicle speed, throttle parameter, and the dimensionless equation. The simulation results agreed well with experiment results. Dynamic calculation program is applicable to calculate loading economy and can provide academic guidance for <b>wheel</b> <b>loader’s</b> design and optimization...|$|R

Design and {{analysis}} of multi body system is a challenging task that requires the knowledge of machine design, computer aided design (CAD), finite element analysis and structural dynamics. <b>Wheel</b> <b>loader</b> vehicle {{is a type of}} earth moving machine which falls in the category of multi body system. This project is based on the concepts of reverse engineering where in which the <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> is designed and analyzed to precision. Initially the dimensions of the <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> are documented by using vernier caliper and full scale ruler. These dimensions are vitally implemented in generating the 3 D model of the <b>wheel</b> <b>loader.</b> SolidWorks has been used for 3 D model creation. In order to run the design to real time standards a few design modifications are taken into account. Design of lift arm cylinders, lift arms, tilt/bucket cylinder and connecting rod are modified to real time standards. Kinematics of <b>wheel</b> <b>loader</b> has been analyzed in SolidWorks. For kinetics and structural analysis the model has been exported from SolidWorks to MSC Visual Nastran Desktop 4 D. In order to analyze the structural dynamics, the method of finite element analysis is used.
