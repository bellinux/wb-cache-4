5|$|Benedict Arnold and John André {{finally met}} on September 21 at the Joshua Hett Smith House. On {{the morning of}} September 22, the outpost at Verplanck's Point under command of Col. James Livingston fired on HMS Vulture, the ship that was {{intended}} to carry André back to New York. This action did sufficient damage that she retreated downriver, forcing André to return to New York overland. Arnold <b>wrote</b> <b>out</b> passes for André {{so that he would}} be able to pass through the lines, and also gave him plans for West Point.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold {{continued}} on to Philadelphia, {{where he met}} with members of Congress about his rank. His action at Ridgefield, coupled {{with the death of}} Wooster due to wounds sustained in the action, resulted in Arnold's promotion to major general, although his seniority was not restored over those who had been promoted before him. Amid negotiations over that issue, Arnold <b>wrote</b> <b>out</b> a letter of resignation on July 11, the same day that word arrived in Philadelphia, that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British. Washington refused his resignation and ordered him north to assist with the defense there.|$|E

5|$|It {{was written}} in the {{afternoon}} in the intervals of some other writing. The desk was in an upstairs room, by a window looking down a wooded hill. It {{was written in}} a little notebook in which his father and mother <b>wrote</b> <b>out</b> copies of several of their poems and, in most cases, added the date of composition. On one page the first two lines of 'Trees' appear, with the date, February 2, 1913, and on another page, further on in the book, is the full text of the poem. It was dedicated to his wife's mother, Mrs. Henry Mills Alden, who was endeared to all her family.|$|E
5|$|Kenney {{read this}} Ultra {{intelligence}} {{in the office of}} the Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area – General Douglas MacArthur – on 25 February. The prospect of an additional 6,900 Japanese troops in the Lae area greatly disturbed MacArthur, as they might seriously affect his plans to capture and develop the area. Kenney <b>wrote</b> <b>out</b> orders, which were sent by courier, for Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead, the deputy commander of the Fifth Air Force, and the commander of its Advance Echelon (ADVON) in New Guinea. Under the Fifth Air Force’s unusual command arrangements, Whitehead controlled the Allied Air Forces units of all types in New Guinea. This included the RAAF units there, which were grouped as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, under the command of Air Commodore Joe Hewitt.|$|E
5|$|Instead of an orchestral tutti, the concerto {{opens with}} the almost {{immediate}} entry of the solo violin, playing the very tune in E minor that gave Mendelssohn no peace. Following a bravura of rapidly ascending notes, the opening theme is then restated by the orchestra. There is then a frenetic chromatic transition passage {{as the music}} subsides and modulates into a tranquil second subject theme in G major. The melody is initially played by the woodwinds with the soloist providing a pedal note on an open G string. The tune is played by the solo violin itself before a short codetta ends the exposition section of the opening movement. The opening two themes are then combined in the development section, where the music builds up to the innovative cadenza, which Mendelssohn <b>wrote</b> <b>out</b> in full rather than allowing the soloist to improvise. The cadenza builds up speed through rhythmic shifts from quavers to quaver-triplets and finally to semiquavers, which require ricochet bowing from the soloist. This serves as {{a link to the}} recapitulation, where the opening melody is played by the orchestra, accompanied by the continuing ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. During the recapitulation, the opening themes are repeated with the second theme being played in the E major before returning to E minor for the closing of the movement. The music gathers speed into the coda, which is marked 'Presto', before a variant of the original chromatic transition passage ends the first movement.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} his ethical outlook, Watts felt that {{absolute}} morality {{had nothing to}} do with the fundamental realization of one's deep spiritual identity. He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He <b>wrote</b> <b>out</b> of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape.|$|E

25|$|The {{signalling}} system at Liss Forest was single line telephone and ticket. The block man <b>wrote</b> <b>out</b> the ticket {{even though the}} work train was still in section. The ticket was exchanged for the one engine in steam key which controlled the section from Liss Forest to Liss. This saved the block man the trip of walking up the platform with the ticket after the work train had cleared. It was a misty day and the passenger train armed with the ticket passed the signal at red which then led to the fatal crash.|$|E
25|$|Caresse {{spent some}} of her time while her husband, Bert Young, fell into a drunken stupor every night, {{churning}} out another 200 pages of pornography. In her diary, Nin observed that everyone who wrote pornography with her <b>wrote</b> <b>out</b> of a self that was opposite {{to his or her}} identity, but identical with his or her desire. Caresse grew up amid the social constraints imposed by her upper-class family in New York. She had a doomed and troublesome romanticism with Harry Crosby. She participated in a decade or more of intellectual lovers in Paris during the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Australian {{historian}} Les Carlyon {{wrote that}} while Haig {{was slow to}} adapt to the correct use of artillery in sufficient quantities to support infantry attacks and was generally sceptical that the science of such doctrine had much place in military theory, he was fully supportive of excellent corps and field commanders such as Herbert Plumer, Arthur Currie and John Monash, who seem to best grasp and exercise these concepts, especially later in the war. Carlyon also <b>wrote</b> <b>out</b> that there was a case to answer, for his support of more dubious commanders such as Ian Hamilton, Aylmer Hunter-Weston and Hubert Gough.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Sardar Ibrahim {{had escaped}} to West Punjab, along {{with dozens of}} rebels, and {{established}} a base in Murree. From there, the rebels attempted to acquire arms and ammunition for the rebellion and smuggle them into Kashmir. Colonel Akbar Khan, {{one of a handful}} of high-ranking officers in the Pakistani Army, with a keen interest in Kashmir, arrived in Murree, and got enmeshed in these efforts. He arranged 4,000 rifles for the rebellion by diverting them from the Army stores.

25|$|Some older composers in Naples, notably Zingarelli and Paisiello, were {{inclined}} to intrigue against {{the success of the}} youthful composer, but all hostility was rendered futile by the enthusiasm that greeted the court performance of his Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra, in which Isabella Colbran, who subsequently became the composer's wife, took a leading part. The libretto of this opera by Giovanni Schmidt was in many of its incidents an anticipation of those presented to the world a few years later in Sir Walter Scott's Kenilworth. The opera was the first in which Rossini <b>wrote</b> <b>out</b> the ornaments of the arias instead of leaving them to the fancy of the singers, and also the first in which the recitativo secco was replaced by a recitative accompanied by a string quartet.|$|E
