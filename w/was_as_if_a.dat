500|$|In {{his final}} years, von Stroheim said that [...] "of all my films, only Greed was a fully {{realized}} work, only Greed {{had a total}} validity." [...] In 1926 a British foundation of arts and sciences requested {{a copy of the}} original version of Greed to keep in their archive, but their request was denied by MGM. Henri Langlois screened the studio version of Greed for von Stroheim in 1950. Von Stroheim said, [...] "It was for me an exhumation. It was like opening a coffin in which there was just dust, giving off a terrible stench, a couple of vertebra and a piece of shoulder bone." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> man's beloved was run over by a truck, maimed beyond recognition. He goes to see her in the morgue. Of course, he still loves her but it's only the memory of her that he can love—because he doesn't recognize her anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{ultimately}} an Israeli victory, the Battle of the Chinese Farm has {{an especially}} infamous legacy among Israeli participants, {{and it is}} remembered {{as one of the}} most brutal battles of the war—and for the heavy losses incurred by both the Egyptians and Israelis. After the battle had ended, Dayan visited the area of the battlefield. Reshef, who accompanied him, said, [...] "Look at this valley of death." [...] The minister, taken aback by the great destruction before him, muttered in an undertone, [...] "What you people have done here!" [...] Later, Dayan would recount that: [...] "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have never seen such a sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as the eye could see." [...] Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together. No picture could capture the horror of the scene, none could encompass what had happened there." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} Fantasia sequel was revived {{shortly after}} Michael Eisner became chief {{executive}} officer of The Walt Disney Company in 1984 when Walt's nephew, vice chairman Roy E. Disney, suggested it to him at a lunch, something that first entered his mind ten years earlier. Disney recalled his reaction: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> big light bulb went on over his head. The idea was enticing, but we didn't have the resources to carry it out". Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg showed a lack of interest in the film. He had once asked André Previn to work on a Fantasia film but Previn declined after he learned it was to feature songs by the Beatles rather than classical music. Eisner approached Leonard Bernstein with the same idea, but while he seemed enthusiastic, Bernstein died before production began. It took a further seven years before the film was considered, after the 1990 reissue of Fantasia grossed $25 million domestically and its 1991 home video release prompted 9.25 million pre-orders. Disney saw its commercial success as a sign that there was enough public interest in the Fantasia franchise to make a sequel. Eisner finally gave the green-light to the film in 1991 and agreed to have Disney serve as executive producer on the basis that its production was funded by the proceeds from the video sales. Disney assigned Donald W. Ernst as producer and Hendel Butoy as supervisory director having liked his work with The Rescuers Down Under (1990).|$|E

2500|$|Interpreting God's {{words in}} [...] "I will destroy {{them with the}} earth," [...] Rav Huna and Rabbi Jeremiah in Rav Kahana's name taught that the Flood washed away even the three handbreadths of the Earth's surface that a plough turns. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> prince had a tutor, and {{whenever}} the prince did wrong, the king punished the tutor.

When {{they arrived at}} the swamp, finding the bridge they were to cross destroyed and federal troops on the south bank, Jackson deployed his artillery. They opened fire on the south bank in a terrific bombardment, the sudden furosity of which wreaked havoc on the Union forces there. A Vermont soldier wrote: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> nest of earthquakes had suddenly exploded under our feet."

2500|$|Vertinskaya's 1961 debut was {{successful}} with both cinema fans and critics, {{some of the}} latter hailing the fifteen-year-old a future star of the Soviet cinema. [...] "No other Soviet actress could have played Assol. Her eyes, her profile, her thin arms... her flying gate – she was a real-life dream-girl," [...] actress Natalya Seleznyova remembered. The young girl's slight clumsiness looked natural on screen, while her strengths – 'gracefulness', 'youthful charms' and an 'aura of other-worldliness' – went undisputed, according to critic L.Nekhoroshev. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> young flower blossomed before our eyes in the Soviet cinema," [...] critic Andrei Plakhov recalled years later. Part of Vertinskaya's appeal was her unconventional good looks; the actress has been described variously as [...] "the Soviet Vivien Leigh" [...] and an [...] "anti-Soviet-looking Soviet beauty." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1920 to 1922, Sorge {{lived in}} Solingen, in present-day North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He was joined there by Christiane Gerlach, ex-wife of Dr Kurt Albert Gerlach, a wealthy {{communist}} {{and professor of}} political science in Kiel, who had taught Sorge. Christine Gerlach later remembered about meeting Sorge for the first time: “It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> stroke of lightning ran through me. In this one second something awoke in me that had slumbered until now, something dangerous, dark, inescapable….” Sorge and Christiane married in May 1921. In 1922, he was relocated to Frankfurt, where he gathered intelligence about the business community. In the summer of 1923, he took part in the Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche ("First Marxist Work Week" [...] conference) in Ilmenau. Sorge continued his work as a journalist, and also helped organize the library of the Institute for Social Research, a new Marxist think-tank in Frankfurt.|$|E

2500|$|Howie Morenz {{was one of}} the NHL's superstars of the 1930s. However, his career, and {{eventually}} life, ended in a game between his Montreal Canadiens and the Chicago Black Hawks on January 28, 1937, at the Montreal Forum. In that game, Morenz was checked by Chicago player Earl Seibert into the boards in what seemed like a normal hit. However, as the boards were made of wood at the time, Morenz's leg shattered in five separate locations above the ankle. He was carried off the ice on a stretcher to a hospital, where he would stay for four and a half weeks until his death from a heart attack. At one time, one visitor noted that it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> party was being held inside of Morenz's hospital room, complete with whiskey and beer. Morenz died on March 8 the same year, from, as teammate Aurele Joliat put it, [...] "a broken heart" [...] (Morenz suffered a heart attack the night before). Morenz's #7 sweater, which had been hanging in its usual stall while he was in hospital, was finally retired for good.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Judah contrasted God's {{words to}} Abraham, [...] "walk before Me," [...] in [...] with the words, [...] "Noah walked with God," [...] in [...] Rabbi Judah {{compared}} it to a king who had two sons, one grown up {{and the other a}} child. The king asked the child to walk with him. But the king asked the adult to walk before him. Similarly, to Abraham, whose moral strength was great, God said, [...] "Walk before Me." [...] But of Noah, who was feeble, [...] says, [...] "Noah walked with God." [...] Rabbi Nehemiah compared Noah to a king's friend who was plunging about in dark alleys, and when the king saw him sinking in the mud, the king urged his friend to walk with him instead of plunging about. Abraham's case, however, was compared to that of a king who was sinking in dark alleys, and when his friend saw him, the friend shined a light for him through the window. The king then asked his friend to come and shine a light before the king on his way. Thus, God told Abraham that instead of showing a light for God from Mesopotamia, he should come and show one before God in the Land of Israel. Similarly, [...] says, [...] "And he blessed Joseph, and said: The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk .... Rabbi Berekiah in Rabbi Johanan's name and Resh Lakish gave two illustrations of this. Rabbi Johanan said: It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> shepherd stood and watched his flocks. (Similarly, Abraham and Isaac walked before God and under Gods protection.) Resh Lakish said: It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> prince walked along while the elders preceded him (as an escort, to make known his coming). (Similarly, Abraham and Isaac walked before God, spreading word of God.) The Midrash taught that in Rabbi Johanan's view: We need God's proximity, while in Resh Lakish's view, God needs us to glorify God (by propagating the knowledge of God's greatness). Similarly, a Midrash read the words [...] "Noah walked with God" [...] in [...] to mean that God supported Noah, so that Noah should not be overwhelmed by the evil behavior of the generation of the Flood. The Midrash compared this to a king whose son went on a mission for his father. The road ahead of him was sunken in mire, and the king supported him so that he would not sink in the mire. However, in the case of Abraham, God said in [...] "walk before Me," [...] and regarding the Patriarchs, Jacob said in [...] "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked." [...] For the Patriarchs would try to anticipate the Divine Presence, and would go ahead to do God's will.|$|E
