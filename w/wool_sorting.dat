John Forlonge (died 1834) was a {{merchant}} in Glasgow and decided to send his two surviving sons to New South Wales, several of his children having earlier died from tuberculosis. William Forlonge, his brother Andrew and their mother went to Leipzig with his mother in 1826 where William worked in a <b>wool</b> <b>sorting</b> house for three years. John joined his family in 1828. Eliza chose 98 Saxon sheep from studs, then she and her sons drove them to Hamburg. The sheep were shipped to Hull and were driven from there to Liverpool where they sailed, with William, for Sydney in the Clansman.|$|E

40|$|Allan Waters, a {{communal}} area near Queenstown {{in the former}} Ciskei of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, have about 80 households {{who are involved in}} agriculture. These households were surveyed with two questionnaires. The first was at household level, focusing on the current socioeconomic situations and farming systems. Data were collected from sixty-three households in the village. The socio-economics questionnaire was divided into sections: demographic information, land and agricultural information, income and expenditure. In order to improve the livelihood of the households and to secure food production and food security, a situation analysis of the rural farmers was carried out using typology as a research tool. Typologies were built in order to analyze the diversity of production units (farms) or households (agricultural households). To define household typologies, factors such as land, source of income, modes of farming and composition of the family were used to identify six typology categories and to divide these into two main groups. The two main groups comprised of (a) livestock farming and (b) non-livestock farming or very little farming activities. The six types are as follows: Type 1 : Poverty-stricken households Type 2 : Newly arrived households Type 3 : Households’ depending on old age pensions Type 4 : Households’ main income from old age pensions and supported by substantial farming Type 5 : Households’ revenue generated from business, wages and farming Type 6 : Full time farming Five types had access to grazing and arable land for agricultural purposes, but type two had not yet been granted the rights to graze or the use of arable fields for agricultural purposes by the village. The source of income for the households in type one was made up of welfare grants and remittances. Types three and four, mainly depended on pensions when compared to the other four types. The households in type five mainly received incomes from farming and business. In type six, the main income received was from farming. The most common modes of farming for the types were: garden-poultry- dry land- crop- cattle-sheep-goats. Using the data from the first questionnaire, the three active agricultural types were targeted with a production survey (28 households). The production survey revolved around animal production, but a number of questions had to do with general information concerning agriculture. From the survey, the households reported that the main aim for keeping livestock and chickens was self- consumption and sale of animals, except in the case of sheep, which were kept for wool production. In the case of the wool farmers, the committee controlled activities such as mating of animals, grazing management, shearing, dipping of animals and <b>wool</b> <b>sorting.</b> The other tasks were left to the farmer himself. Wool data obtained for 2001 indicated that the average fleece weight was 3. 88 kg greasy wool per sheep, with an A- to C- length. The fibre diametre of the wool in general fell in a medium class (21. 1 micron). From the survey a number of projects were identified to assist the rural farmers in improving the livelihood of the households and in securing food production and food security...|$|E

50|$|At {{first the}} knitted goods were made largely of native <b>wool</b> which was <b>sorted,</b> scoured and dyed, picked, carded and spun into yarn and knitted into hosiery. Later, cotton goods were knitted. The {{products}} were sold through commission merchants in New York and delivered to retail stores throughout New England by two-horse wagons. Following {{the gold rush}} of 1849 shipments of goods began to sail to San Francisco. As business increased, a small machine shop was started to support the equipment in the factory.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{inhalational anthrax}} was called woolsorters' disease {{because it was}} an {{occupational}} hazard for people who <b>sorted</b> <b>wool.</b> Today, this form of infection is extremely rare in advanced nations, as almost no infected animals remain.The last fatal case of natural inhalational anthrax in the United States occurred in California in 1976, when a home weaver died after working with infected wool imported from Pakistan. To minimize the chance of spreading the disease, the deceased was transported to UCLA in a sealed plastic body bag within a sealed metal container for autopsy.|$|R
50|$|The wool {{processing}} within the mill consisted of various stages: sorting and grading, scouring, drying and dying, carding, combing, spinning, weaving, brushing, and sewing. Each stage {{was carried out}} in a separate area of the mill, with each process flowing onto the next in a hierarchical structure; this was a design feature to facilitate efficiency in the mill. In the two smaller south rooms the <b>wool</b> was <b>sorted</b> and graded to determine how it would be processed; the scouring vats were located in the south west room, and here the wool was cleaned of impurities and steam dried and dyed if required. The remainder of the process {{was carried out in}} the main area of the mill. The mill contained ten carding machines; these large machines broke up the wool and removed impurities. The combing process further organised the woollen fibres. The largest machines in the mill were the spinning mules on which the wool was spun. The wool was then woven into fabrics on the weaving looms. The woven fabric then went through shaving machines to give the cloth a fine finish. Finally, the fabric would be sewn into various products.|$|R
50|$|Omega Metal Processing is an {{abandoned}} chemical processing plant in Monson, Massachusetts on Bliss Street. The two story brick building was built around 1850 for <b>wool</b> storage and <b>sorting</b> and was {{located on a}} 2.5acre property. Starting in 1980, it was leased and operated by the Omega Processing Co. In an April 20, 1989 chemical spill, 2,800gallons of cadmium cyanide were released into the Chicopee Brook, resulting in fish kills in the brook and the downstream Quaboag River. The plant closed {{as a result of}} the heavy costs and penalties incurred because of the spill, and was abandoned prior to the removal of hazardous material. The site was assessed under the Targeted Brownfields Assessment program of the EPA and cleared in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|After greasy <b>wool</b> {{had been}} <b>sorted</b> and classed it was scoured. All {{impurities}} such as grease or yolk, sweat and earthy matter were removed by scouring or washing {{in a solution}} of soap and weak alkali. Carbonizing was necessary when burr, seeds or any other vegetable matter was of such a nature {{that it could not}} be eliminated by carding, combing and subsequent processes. Carding was where fine wire teeth removed foreign matter, smooth and straighten out the fibres. The mesh was then condensed into a soft rope form known as a silver. Backwashing and gilling occurred to straighten out the fibre and sometimes oil was added as a substitute for the lost natural grease. Finally, combing straightened the long fibres and removed all the short and imperfect fibres. The rejected wool collected was known as the Noil. A ball of continuous length known as a ‘top’ was the result which was ready for packing.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{relationship}} between how a fabric of clothing feels, and what the skin registers when {{in contact with the}} fabric, is investigated. The skin registers certain parameters. Different concentrations in these will result in different feelings. The parameters that the skin registers are vertical- and horizontal force, and temperature. In the tests that were executed these parameters were objectively measured. As was information regarding topography and weight, which in this tests were seen as complementary information, and treated as parameters. Simultaneously during the testing, the subjective experience of the test subjects was measured. In this way {{the relationship between}} the concentrations of different parameters and the feeling that correlated to that mix could be mapped. All together there were eight tests, objective and subjective, using 19 test subjects. The tests were done using nine different fabrics in three different materials; silk, cotton and <b>wool.</b> Tests were <b>sorted</b> into the two categories human touching fabric and fabric touching human, to distinguish between the two main ways where fabric and skin are in contact. At the end of the tests cautious conclusions could be drawn for the two categories, where the subjective experience of a fabric could be explained in numbers and values, using objective data...|$|R
