5|$|The Sand Springs Expressway {{comes to}} an end at the {{northwest}} corner of the Inner Disperal Loop (IDL), a ring of freeways surrounding Downtown Tulsa. At a stack interchange there, US-64 and SH-51 split away to the south along I-244; this will be the final intersection US-412 and US-64 <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> Oklahoma. US-412 continues east along I-244. This interchange is also the southern terminus of L.L. Tisdale Parkway. I-244 and US-412 form {{the north side of the}} IDL; at its northeast corner, they interchange with US-75, the east side of the loop; south of the interchange, US-75 also carries the I-444 designation. I-244/US-412 continue east, with exit ramps to local streets, as well as SH-11 and US-169. I-244 ends at I-44/SH-66; US-412 forms a concurrency with the latter two routes as they continue east into Rogers County.|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings <b>will</b> <b>have.</b> <b>In</b> the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E

She co-produced the album with Cranny and Jim Moginie (ex-Midnight Oil); which featured musical contributions from Dave Symes, de Araujo, Moginie and Cranny, and was mixed by Victor Van Vugt. All the tracks were co-written by Blasko with Cranny. The album was released in Australia on 21 October, which debuted at No.7 on the ARIA Albums Charts, and in 2008 it received platinum accreditation.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unknown}} {{if in the}} case of the {{disappearance}} of the “pure” dingo the then existing hybrids will alter the predation pressure on other species. It is also not clear what kind of place these dogs <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the Australian ecosystem and research results on this topic are rare. However, it is considered probable that the dynamics of the various ecosystems will not be disturbed by this. One example in this topic are the bush rats, where it is also seen as unlikely that there could be problems due to the dingo-hybrids, because these rodents had been exposed to the influence of the dingoes for thousands of years.|$|E
25|$|Cannabinoid binding sites exist {{throughout}} {{the central and}} peripheral nervous systems. The two most relevant receptors for cannabinoids are the CB1 and CB2 receptors, which are expressed predominantly {{in the brain and}} immune system respectively. Density of expression varies based on species and correlates with the efficacy that cannabinoids <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> modulating specific aspects of behavior related to the site of expression. For example, in rodents, the highest concentration of cannabinoid binding sites are in the basal ganglia and cerebellum, regions of the brain involved in the initiation and coordination of movement. In humans, cannabinoid receptors exist in much lower concentration in these regions, which helps explain why cannabinoids possess a greater efficacy in altering rodent motor movements than they do in humans.|$|E

25|$|Reverse swing is a {{phenomenon}} that makes the ball swing {{in the opposite direction}} to that usually produced by the orientation of the shiny and rough sides of the ball. When the ball is reverse swinging, the ball will swing towards the shiny side. Balls that reverse swing move much later and much more sharply than those swinging conventionally, both factors increasing the difficulty the batsman <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> trying to hit the ball. At speeds of over 90mph a ball will always exhibit reverse swing, but as roughness increases on the leading side, the speed at which reverse swing occurs decreases. This means that an older ball {{is more likely to be}} delivered with reverse swing as its surface will have been roughened through use.|$|E
500|$|Approximately thirty parables form {{about one}} third of Jesus' {{recorded}} teachings. The parables appear within longer sermons and at {{other places in the}} narrative. They often contain symbolism, and usually relate the physical world to the spiritual. Common themes in these tales include the kindness and generosity of God and the perils of transgression. Some of his parables, such as the Prodigal Son (...) , are relatively simple, while others, such as the Growing Seed (...) , are sophisticated, profound and abstruse. When asked by his disciples about why he speaks in parables to the people, Jesus replies that the chosen disciples have been given to [...] "know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven", unlike the rest of their people, [...] "For the one who has will be given more and he <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> abundance. But the one who does not have will be deprived even more.", going on to say that the majority of their generation have grown [...] "dull hearts" [...] and thus are unable to understand (...)

500|$|Based on the Aufbau principle, {{one would}} expect the 5g {{subshell}} to begin filling at unbiunium. However, the f-block is theoretically expected to begin at lanthanum and actinium, but neither element shows any f-orbital involvement. It is predicted that a similar situation of delayed [...] "radial" [...] collapse might happen for unbiunium, so that the 5g orbitals do not start filling until around element 125. This {{is similar to the}} situation with lanthanum, where the 4f shell has not yet undergone the sudden contraction and lowering in energy to the level it <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the lanthanide series; even in the next element, cerium, this contraction is not yet complete enough to avoid occupation of the 5d orbital. The delay in the contraction of the 5g orbitals is expected to be so large that occupation of the 6f, 7d, and 8p1/2 subshells cannot be avoided in any superactinide. Because of the lack of radial nodes in the 5g orbitals, analogous to the 4f but not the 5f orbitals, the position of unbiunium in the periodic table is expected to be more akin to that of lanthanum than that of actinium among its congeners, and some have proposed to rename the superactinides as [...] "superlanthanides" [...] for that reason. The lack of radial nodes in the 4f orbitals contribute to their core-like behaviour in the lanthanide series, unlike the more valence-like 5f orbitals in the actinides; however, the relativistic expansion and destabilisation of the 5g orbitals should partially compensate for their lack of radial nodes and hence smaller extent.|$|E

It was listed as the 4th greatest managerial quote in the Daily Mail's List of the 'Top 50 Managerial Quotes'. Sports historian, Norman Giller, who has written biographies on both Nicholson and his skipper Danny Blanchflower, traces this quote to Blanchflower. [...] "Bill was a blunt Yorkshireman who just did not use this sort of language," [...] Giller has written in [...] "Danny was the poet of the team and he both said this and wrote it in his newspaper columns when captain of Tottenham. Somehow somebody has put the words into Nicholson's mouth, but it was definitely Danny who said it first." ...|$|E
