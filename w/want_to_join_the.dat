500|$|Árbenz {{was born}} in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, the second-largest city in the country, in 1913. He {{was the son of}} a Swiss German pharmacist, also named Jacobo Árbenz, who immigrated to Guatemala in 1901. His mother was a Ladino woman from a middle-class family. His family was {{relatively}} wealthy and upper-class; his childhood has been described as [...] "comfortable". At some point during his childhood, his father became addicted to morphine and began to neglect the family business. He eventually went bankrupt, forcing the family to move to a rural estate that a wealthy friend had set aside for them [...] "out of charity". Jacobo had originally desired to be an economist or an engineer, but since the family was now impoverished, he could not afford to go to a university. He initially did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> military, but there was a scholarship available through the Escuela Politécnica for military cadets. He applied, passed all of the entrance exams, and entered as a cadet in 1932. His father committed suicide two years after Árbenz entered the academy.|$|E

[...] When asked if that could change Barger replied [...] "Anything can change, I can't predict the future". Tobie Levingston who formed the black motorcycle club East Bay Dragons MC wrote in his book that he and Sonny Barger have a long-lasting friendship and that the Hells Angels and Dragons have a mutual friendship and hang out and ride together.|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Post {{film critic}} Stephen Hunter, a {{historian}} of the era, said: [...] "Any image of the American Revolution which represents you Brits as Nazis and us as gentle folk is almost certainly wrong. It was a very bitter war, a total war, {{and that is something}} that I am afraid has been lost to history....he presence of the Loyalists (colonists who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> fight for independence from Britain) meant that the War of Independence was a conflict of complex loyalties." [...] The historian Richard F. Snow, editor of American Heritage magazine, said of the church-burning scene: [...] "Of course it never happened—if it had do you think Americans would have forgotten it? It could have kept us out of World War I." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (HOS) were reorganized in November 1944 {{to combine}} the units of the Ustaše and Croatian Home Guard. Throughout the war, the {{treatment}} of prisoners from the Croatian Home Guard, was relatively benign [...] Partisans would merely ridicule the captured domobran soldiers and then send them home if they didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> uprising. However, on 13 January 1945, Pavelić ordered the domobrani to merge with the Ustaša military, which put the entire force, estimated at 280,000, at risk of death if captured. By 1945, the Yugoslav Partisans were known as the Yugoslav People's Army, numbering more than 800,000 men organized into five field armies, and were {{in pursuit of the}} remnant of the defeated German and NDH forces.|$|E

2500|$|The Nukak {{have already}} {{suffered}} {{the devastation of}} their population by malaria, measles and pulmonary diseases since their contact with the New Tribes Mission and other outsiders beginning in 1981; now, coca growers, left-wing FARC guerillas, right-wing AUC paramilitaries and the Colombian army have occupied their lands. These aboriginals have therefore become embroiled in Colombia's armed conflict. In 2006, a group of nearly 80 Nukak left the jungle and sought assimilation along with cultural preservation. As one of the migrants, Pia-pe, put it: [...] "We do <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> white family, {{but we do not}} want to forget words of the Nukak." [...] In October 2006, leader and Nukak Spanish speaker Maw-be' committed suicide by drinking poison; friends and the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC) described him as in desperation in his inability to secure supplies or a safe return to their homeland for the Nukak.|$|E
2500|$|Henry {{was taken}} ill almost {{immediately}} upon being {{sworn in as}} governor on July 5, and recuperated at Scotchtown. He returned to Williamsburg in September, and corresponded with General Washington about the military situation. Washington, who was less effective because of the inadequacies of his troops, complained about the state militias, feeling a Continental Army committed {{for the duration of}} the war was needed. Henry helped recruit new troops for Washington, but his efforts [...] were hampered by a number of issues, including [...] the weakness of Henry's office. In December 1776, he procured temporary expanded powers from the House of Delegates, something that Jefferson was still unhappy about years later, feeling that Henry was trying to set himself up as dictator. In March 1777, Henry wrote to Washington seeking permission to recruit soldiers for terms of up to eight months. Washington's anger in his response that such troops were not useful caused Henry to drop the matter, stating that he deferred to Washington's experience in military matters. Recruiting remained a problem; many Virginians were willing to be members of the county militia, but did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> Continental Army lest they be sent out of state or exposed to disease.|$|E
2500|$|The {{organisation}} {{was founded}} in 1860 as [...] "The Winchester College Rifle Volunteer Corps" [...] by various boys in their top year {{as a result of}} the perceived threat of Napoleon III after the Orsini plot, and remained entirely autonomous until it was taken over by the Second Master in 1868. It was enrolled as a Cadet Corps in the 1st Hants Volunteer Battalion. In 1908, the Officer Training Corps was established, and by 1914, through the request of the War Office that Senior Cadets be given appropriate training for the war effort, almost every student became involved in the Corps, though it was never explicitly compulsory. In the Second World War, it was renamed as [...] "The Junior Training Corps", though its function was still to prepare boys for Officer responsibilities. Montgomery remarked on inspecting the Corps in 1946 that there was [...] "latent leadership in all ranks". In 1948, the [...] "Junior Training Corps" [...] became known as the [...] "Combined Cadet Force" [...] (CCF) which incorporated RAF and RN sections. In 1963, [...] "Alternative Service Activities" [...] were introduced for boys who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> CCF. Pupils were made eligible to opt out of the CCF at the end of their second year after starting at the beginning of the year: this is still the school's policy. In 2010, Winchester's Combined Cadet Force received the Queen's Colours, a regimental decoration.|$|E

2500|$|African Americans {{were often}} {{involved}} in the Civil Rights Movement and the antiwar movement. Martin Luther King, Jr., James Bevel of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and Muhammad Ali were prominent opponents of the Vietnam War, and the Black Panther Party vehemently opposed U.S. involvement in Vietnam. In {{the beginning of the}} war, some African Americans did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> war opposition movement because of loyalty to President Johnson for pushing Civil Rights legislation, but soon the escalating violence of the war and the perceived social injustice of the draft propelled involvement in antiwar groups. Black antiwar groups opposed the war for the same reason as white groups, but often protested in separate events and did not cooperate with the ideas of white antiwar leadership. They harshly criticized the draft because poor and minority men were usually most affected by conscription although the Washington Post in a 1986 in depth examination of who actually fought the Vietnam War entitled [...] "The Myth of the Vietnam Vet" [...] contradicted this assertion. According to the Post, [...] "The man who fought in Vietnam is typically depicted as a draftee, unwilling and probably black. In fact, 73 percent of those who died were volunteers and 12.5 percent were black (out of an age group that comprised 13.5 percent of the male population)." [...] African Americans {{involved in the}} antiwar movement often formed their own groups, such as Black Women Enraged, National Black Anti-War Anti-Draft Union, and National Black Draft Counselors. Within these groups, however, many African American women were seen as subordinate members by black male leaders. Many African American women viewed the war in Vietnam as racially motivated and sympathized strongly with Vietnamese women. Such concerns often propelled their participation in the antiwar movement and their creation of new opposition groups.|$|E
2500|$|After the Dynamite tour, {{two of the}} {{original}} members of the band made decisions to leave. Hiizumi left to focus on his activities with jazz ensemble Pe'z, while Hirama left to focus on his activities as a solo musician. Sheena sought new members to replace Hiizumi and Hirama. She had known pianist Ichiyo Izawa since attending a solo concert of his in early 2004, though the pair had not talked together often since meeting. She wanted Izawa to join the band for both his piano and songwriting abilities. Sheena contacted Izawa on February 17, 2005, {{a day after the}} final date of the Dynamite tour, however Izawa finally agreed in late April. Sheena met Ukigumo through her brother Junpei Shiina, and the pair first collaborated in 2002 as a part of Yokoshima, a band formed to cover the Toto song [...] "Georgy Porgy". Ukigumo collaborated with Sheena during the sessions for her album Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana (2003) and Tokyo Jihen's debut album Kyōiku (2004), in which he played the guitars for Sheena's original demos. Sheena liked Ukigumo's guitar playing so much that she left it in for the studio versions of [...] "Meisai" [...] and [...] "Ishiki", and collaborated on the bonus track [...] "Ichijiku no Hana", which was written by him. Ukigumo did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>the</b> band at first, however the band found that Ukigumo was the best fitting of all the potential guitarists. He agreed two to three days before Adults recording sessions began in July 2005. Hiizumi and Hirama's leaving was officially announced on July 1, 2005. [...] Two months later, the [...] "Shuraba" [...] single was announced, and on September 16, 2005, the two new band members, Ichiyo Izawa and Ukigumo were announced officially.|$|E
