500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} captured the sounds of crashing, screaming, and the shattering of glass and plates. Three times {{in a period of}} five seconds there were shouts of pain or distress from a hijacker outside the cockpit, suggesting a hijacker that was standing guard outside the cockpit was being attacked by the passengers. Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10:00:03. Five seconds later, he asked, [...] "Is that it? Shall <b>we</b> <b>finish</b> it off?" [...] Another hijacker responded, [...] "No. Not yet. When they all come, <b>we</b> <b>finish</b> it off." [...] Jarrah once again pitched the airplane up and down. A passenger in the background cried, [...] "In the cockpit. If we don't, we'll die" [...] at 10:00:25. Sixteen seconds later, another passenger, identified as Tom Burnett, yelled, [...] "Roll it!", possibly referring to using the food cart. The {{voice recorder}} did record the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door. Jarrah ceased the violent maneuvers at 10:01:00 and recited the takbir several times. He then asked another hijacker, [...] "Is that it? I mean, shall we put it down?" [...] The other hijacker responded, [...] "Yes, put it in it, and pull it down." [...] The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey!", and then [...] "Give it to me!" [...] repeated eight times in succession, possibly referring to the plane's yoke.|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that i think would be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where <b>we</b> <b>finish</b> telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E

[...] On the lower corniche we have depictions of the Nativity, the Adoration of the Magi and Jesus talking with the lawyers.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, Muse held {{meetings}} with Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, the Crown Prince and Deputy Ruler of Ras al-Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), {{where the two}} leaders signed an agreement on a deal for setting up of a dedicated livestock quarantine facility to facilitate the import of livestock from Somalia to the UAE. In October 2008, Muse also signed a Dh170 million agreement with Dubai's Lootah Group to support {{the construction of an}} airport, seaport and free zone in the coastal city of Bosaso.

2500|$|Hex said, [...] "It takes {{a week of}} {{long hours}} and hard work to put {{together}} a review on the show. Gaming, capturing all the game footage, logging all the footage, writing the review, re-writing, editing, filming, re-editing... the finished product is something I'm really proud of." [...] Bajo described the editing process as [...] "a bit like Machinima". Both he and Hex checked edits remotely during the period of the week when they had finished their filming {{and the rest of the}} crew [...] "shoot field stories and finish off the rest of the show". Hex said that during the playing of games and filming she became quite attached to her avatars and wanted to show off what her own character did. Hex says, [...] "We've tried our best on the show to present both sides of the argument in any stories we've done". Bajo explained: [...] "Mondays <b>we</b> <b>finish</b> of reviews, log footage, swap games, read scripts and sub everything after a production meeting, Tuesdays we make GG and GG: Pocket, Wednesdays are GGSP and any green screen stuff, then Hex and I are off to review for the rest of the week, while the gang shoot field stories and finish off the rest of the show. We check edits remotely usually which is my favourite part of the job. changes week to week but that's the general schedule" [...] Bajo has stated that [...] "often segment ideas are pretty spontaneous". When asked about taking on Good Game: Spawn Point as well as the original show, Bajo responded: [...] "we're busier than ever, but we've got things down to a pretty tight production schedule now".|$|E

5000|$|... "MacHead" [...] was a song {{recorded}} {{during the}} album's sessions, {{but it was}} never completed, so it didn't make the album. Producer Steve Lillywhite named the song, claiming it sounded like a cross between the sound of Paul McCartney and Radiohead. The song's existence is only known from an image on the 1999 fan calendar with a list of the working titles of the other songs on this album and from an alleged meeting in which Jake Vigliotti claims to have heard said recording. [...] "MacHeadis a song that we were working on for [...] These Crowded Streets and it's a song that we just never got to completion before <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> the album. Who knows, maybe one of these days we'll finish it and record it again, but <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> the album before <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> the song." [...] Boyd Tinsley ...|$|R

2500|$|At {{the foot}} of Jesus' cross there is a statue {{depicting}} a kneeling Mary Magdalene. In front of her is the Resurrection scene with Jesus emerging from his Sarcophagus, his right hand raised and giving a blessing and a [...] "Resurrection cross" [...] or [...] "Triumphal cross" [...] in his left hand. A kneeling soldier sleeps on the right hand side of the tomb and another soldier, also sleeping, sits to the right, holding on to a musket, an anachronism {{explained by the fact}} that this part of the scene was by Larhantec. Behind him two other soldiers look on. On the right of the resurrection scene we see Jesus being mocked and ridiculed by four soldiers ("Christ aux outrages") and then a scene showing Jesus being flogged. Next to the depiction of Mary Magdalene at {{the foot of}} the cross is a pietà and around this are the figure of a standing man and John the Evangelist. On the other side of the cross from the pietả, there is an [...] "Ecce Homo". To the right of the pietả there is a depiction of the open mouth of Hell Harrowing of Hell. [...] Adam has already emerged but a demon is stopping Eve from joining him. [...] On the lower corniche the depiction of Jesus' arrest includes Judas Iscariot shown holding a purse, St Peter asleep by the side of a colleague then Peter drawing his sword, Malchus struck and falling to the ground and Judas embracing Jesus. These sculptures are then followed by a depiction of St Yves standing between a depiction of a rich man and a poor man. <b>We</b> <b>finish</b> with a depiction of the Annunciation and finally the Visitation (Christianity) ...|$|E
