5|$|<b>While</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Calgary, Sing {{attended}} numerous Stampede Wrestling {{events with}} her mother. She knew {{she wanted to}} be a wrestler from a young age and frequently beat up the neighborhood children. As a teenager, Sing approached members of the Hart wrestling family and asked to be trained, but she was rejected as they did not train women wrestlers at the time. Bret Hart, however, claims it had more to do with scheduling conflicts. During a trip to Hawaii in 1978, she saw Japanese women's wrestling on television and decided she wanted to pursue the sport. She later wrote to Mildred Burke, after a friend gave her a magazine with Burke's contact information, and sent her a biography and photo. Shortly thereafter, she joined Burke's training facility in Encino, California.|$|E
