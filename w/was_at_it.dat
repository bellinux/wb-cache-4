In the following days, the cartoons received significant attention in other Danish press outlets. According to Jytte Klausen, [...] "most people groaned that the newspaper <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> again, bashing Muslims. The instinct was to split the blame." [...] Berlingske-Tidende criticised the 'gag', but also said that Islam should be openly criticised. Politiken attacked Rose's account of growing self-censorship; it also surveyed Danish cartoonists and said that self-censorship was not generally perceived as a problem. On October 4, a local teenager telephoned the newspaper offices threatening to kill the cartoonists, but he was arrested after his mother turned him in.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Clavering languidly, [...] "I saw him, and bantered him {{a little}} on his prepossessing friends. Asked him why, when he <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> he didn't go to Manitoba for Canadians. Larry didn't take it nicely." ...|$|E

60|$|Undismayed by his {{accident}} the indefatigable captain <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> again, and in face of {{the bustle}} upstairs Prudence Drewitt was afraid to trust herself to say more.

6000|$|... "Now, there's SENSE in that," [...] I says. [...] "Letting on don't cost nothing; letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind letting on we <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{a hundred}} and fifty year. It wouldn't strain me none, after I got my hand in. So I'll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives." ...|$|E
6000|$|During {{all this}} time the Professor went on calmly and {{persistently}} mineralogising. [...] "Wonderful character!" [...] Charles said to me. [...] "He works out his parts so well!

60|$|So it chanced {{that he came}} to Tomlinson's Creek at {{the very}} point where a great slab of Devonian rock bursts through the clay of the bank.

6000|$|... "I <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> myself," [...] he says; [...] "I {{worked at}} the Nelson fields for three months, and spent all I made in buying a salted claim which busted up the second day. I went at it again, though, and struck it rich; but when the gold wagon was {{going down to the}} settlements, it was stuck up by those cursed rangers, and not a red cent left." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{by and by}} {{the thing}} dragged through, and {{everything}} was sold --everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard. So they'd got to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow EVERYTHING.

60|$|Strut, {{the other}} son, was the vainest chick ever seen; {{and the great}} aim of his life was to crow louder than any other cock in the neighbourhood.

It {{is part of a}} sketch in outline {{of the history of the}} past. 'The important thing,' he says, is to 'fix the turning-point of the history of Europe.' While he <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> he might just as well have fixed the equator of the history of Europe and its sparking-plug and the position of its liver. Now, listen-- ...|$|E

60|$|When we got up-stairs to {{his room}} he got me a coarse shirt and a {{roundabout}} and pants of his, and I put them on. While I <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> he asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started {{to tell me about}} a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went out. I said I didn't know; I hadn't heard about it before, no way.|$|E

I’m to let him hear all what you’re to do beforehand, he says; and he gave me this for an arnest’—holding up half a guinea; ‘and I took it, so I did! Strike me sky-blue scarlet?’ says he, adducing the words of the mock oath; and he looked askance at me as he did so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that is {{the dull}} man I was; and yet, though Adam was always saying and doing the things I was making {{up my mind to}} say and do, I think Margaret cared more for me. Nevertheless, there was {{something}} about him that all women seemed to find lovable, a dash that made them send him away and then well-nigh run after him. At any rate, I could have got her after her mother's death if I had been half a man. But I went back to Aberdeen to write a poem about her, and while I <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> Adam married her." ...|$|E
