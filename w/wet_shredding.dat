40|$|Supercapacitors {{are widely}} used in {{electric}} and hybrid vehicles, wind farm and low-power equipment due to their high specific power density and huge number of charge–discharge cycles. Waste supercapacitors should be recycled according to EU directive 2002 / 96 /EC on waste electric and electronic equipment. This paper describes a recycling approach for end-of-life supercapacitors based on shredding and mild thermal treatment. At first, supercapacitors are shredded using a Retsch cutting mill. The shredded mixture is then undergone thermal treatment at 200 °C to recycle the organic solvent contained in the activated carbon electrodes. After the thermal treatment, the mixture is roughly separated using a fluidized bed method to remove the aluminium foil particles and paper particles from the activated carbon particles, which is subsequently put into water for a <b>wet</b> <b>shredding</b> into fine particles that can be re-used. The recycled activated carbon has a BET surface area of up to 1200 m 2 /g and the recycled acetonitrile has a high purity...|$|E
40|$|A <b>wet</b> <b>shredding</b> {{process has}} been {{developed}} for recycling graphene from the electrodes of supercapacitors into polymer composites. At first, supercapacitors are cut open to expose the interior graphene based electrodes. The electrodes are heat-treated at 200 o C to remove the contained solvent, and the heat treatment temperature can be further increased to remove the polymer binder, which binds the graphene on an aluminium foil current collector. After heat treatment, the electrodes are shredded in an epoxy resin to strip off the graphene and the graphene was subsequently dispersed using a high shear mixer. The dispersed graphene is used directly as reinforcing filler for the epoxy resin. A content of 0. 40 % (wt) of the recycled graphene resulted in {{a significant increase in}} both the tensile strength and elongation at break of the epoxy resin. Removal of the binder increases the reinforcing effect of the recycled graphene. However, a compromise can be made to leave the binder in the recycled graphene in order to avoid secondary pollution...|$|E
40|$|Usage {{of natural}} sand as fine {{aggregate}} {{in the concrete}} mixture industry has become too dependent of this natural resource which took time to be produced. At the same time, production of paper has led to cause the dumping of rubbish {{in the world is}} increasing day by day. The objectives of this research are to investigate the properties of mortar using waste newspaper to substitute a portion of fine aggregate. This is one of the approaches to reduce the usage of natural resource and amount of waste paper dump at the landfill. This research used to investigate the effect of different sizes of shredded newspaper on mortar when the specimens were subjected to compression strength test and water absorption test. The mix design used is normal mortar mix which 1 : 2 ratio of cement and water respectively in addition of <b>wet</b> <b>shredded</b> newspaper with comes with two sizes collected from two offices in Universiti Malaysia Pahang. The size of the cube is 100 x 100 mm were cured with two types of method that are inside and outside room temperature before undergoing tests. The finding shows that specimens containing bigger size of shredded newspaper have higher compressive strength than smaller size. It is also observed that specimens with smaller size of shredded newspaper has lower rate of water absorption compared to specimens containing bigger size of shredded newspaper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{prototype}} autodissemination {{station to}} topically contaminate oviposition-seeking container-dwelling mosquitoes with the insect growth regula-tor, pyriproxyfen, {{was developed and}} tested in the laboratory. Our test subject was the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae), an urban species that colonizes small-volume cryptic larval habitats and is a skip ovipositor that visits multiple containers. The station consists of a water reservoir to attract gravid females, which is joined to a transfer chamber designed to contaminate visiting mosquitoes. The unit is easily constructed by moulding <b>wet</b> <b>shredded</b> cardboard using corn starch as a binder. The essential criteria that must be met to prove the efficacy of an autodissemination station require it to demonstrate effectiveness in attracting the target insect, in transferring the toxicant to the insect that will disperse the agent, and in facilitating the subsequent transfer of the toxicant from the insect to target habitats at a lethal concentration. Cage experiments demonstrated that the unit was readily accepted by gravid females as an oviposition site. A powder formulation of pyriproxyfen-impregnated silica particles adhered to visiting Ae. albopictus females (mean: 66 particles/female), although particles were lost over time. In cage (2. 2 m 3) trials, pyriproxyfen-charged stations resulted in 100 % inhibition of adult emergence, whereas in small-room (31. 1 m 3) trials, 81 % emergence inhibition was recorded. The venereal transfer of pyriproxyfen from contaminated males to virgin females was also observed, and pyriproxyfen was subsequently transferred to water-holding contain-ers at concentrations that inhibited emergence. Key autodissemination station features include lack of maintenance requirements, biodegradable construction, low cost and low risk. Key words.
