60|$|JOHNNY. I dont {{set up to}} be able to do {{anything}} but admire him and appreciate him and be proud of him as an Englishman. If it wasnt for my respect for him, I wouldnt have stood your cheek for two days, let alone two months. But what I cant understand is why he didnt lick it out of you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid.</b> For twenty-five years he kept a place twice as big as England in order: a place full of seditious coffee-colored heathens and pestilential white agitators in the middle of a lot of savage tribes. And yet he couldnt keep you in order. I dont set up to be half the man your father undoubtedly is; but, by George, it's lucky for you you were not my son. I dont hold with my own father's views about corporal punishment being wrong. It's necessary for some people; and I'd have tried it on you until you first learnt to howl and then to behave yourself.|$|E

5000|$|During the 2008 World Series, Jackson {{found himself}} {{surrounded}} by controversy after writing a column about Tampa Bay Rays star B.J. Upton. Jackson argued that Upton (who is African-American) {{can be a}} role model to the black community because of his [...] "propensity to be lazy". One writer for a Rays blog later said, [...] "Could you imagine Scoop Jackson's reaction if Peter Gammons had written that paragraph? ... Good lord Scoop. We don't mean to yell, but did you eat paint chips <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid?</b> Of all the positive things Upton does on the baseball field that are worthy of emulating, Jackson picks laziness as why inner-city kids will gravitate to the Rays center fielder." [...] His first contribution to ESPN The Magazine appeared in the May 8, 2006 issue titled [...] "It's Time" [...] which was a short article explaining why he was picking the New Jersey Nets to win the 2005-06 NBA championship.

5000|$|Professor Farnsworth is {{voiced by}} Billy West, using a {{combination}} of impressions of Burgess Meredith and Frank Morgan. He was named after electronic television pioneer Philo Farnsworth, giving him the same first name as University of California Philosophy professor Hubert Dreyfus, of whom writer and producer Eric Kaplan was a former student. Farnsworth's design has been compared to a combination of Mr. Burns, Grampa Simpson, and Professor Frink from Matt Groening's other series, The Simpsons. West has stated that the voice for Farnsworth is meant to be a bit shaky and that when developing the voice he came up with [...] "a combination of all the wizard-type characters you heard <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> Burgess Meredith and Frank Morgan in The Wizard of Oz." [...] There is a direct nod to this in the episode [...] "Anthology of Interest II", in which the Professor portrays the Wizard of Oz. In the initial storyboards of [...] "Space Pilot 3000", Fry presumed that the Professor was descended from a supposed sister and a supposed brother-in-law named Eddie Farnsworth. In the first season, Farnsworth would excuse his unhelpfulness by saying that he was [...] "already in his pajamas". This was an early attempt at a catchprase that was abandoned after the second episode, [...] "The Series Has Landed".|$|E

Classic Goals is a love letter to the game of soccer. [...] " [...] 148Apps said [...] "Essentially, it's a soccer themed puzzle game. Figuring out the best route to take and lining up shots just right is the focus here. While it's not possible to deviate from the original plan, there are still some important physics to take into account. Unlocking Pro mode reinforces this as it takes line drawing speed into account which can change everything. [...] " [...] TouchGen said [...] "Score! Classic Goals is one of those games that I want everyone to try no matter if you are diehard soccer fan, or just a gamer.

Classic Goals is an original and enjoyable take on the football genre that fails to be really great due to a strong repetitiveness and some issues in game design. [...] " [...] VideoGamer wrote [...] "The game's excellent presentation - it's got a vibe of one of those football magazines your friends (or even you, perhaps) used to buy <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> - and responsive, tactile nature make playing it a simple, punchy delight.
