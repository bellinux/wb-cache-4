500|$|On {{taking the}} role of Jigsaw, Bell said - [...] "I did Saw because I {{thought it was a}} {{fascinating}} location for a film to be made. These guys locked in a room, to me, was fresh. I did not anticipate the ending when I read the script, so I was quite caught by surprise and it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that if the filmmakers shot the scene well, the audience would be caught by surprise as well. The film was worth doing for that moment alone." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} Gipsy Danger's {{artificial}} intelligence system. Del Toro secured permission from Valve Corporation to cast McLain in homage to GLaDOS, her homicidal AI {{character in the}} Portal video games. The director stated: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that we needed something beautiful in that voice. My daughter is my wingman, we had done co-op on Portal 2 {{for a long time}} and I did Portal 1 when it came out. It becomes ingrained in you, that voice. I didn't want to use her as a negative force of evil. I called Valve and asked 'Can you give us the filter?' so we went full GLaDOS for the first commercial, but I thought it was too much. If you're a gamer, it's too distracting so we created our own GLaDOS 2.0 filter that's a little less full-on." ...|$|E
2500|$|RC's {{system of}} {{centralised}} control has been deprecated by ex-members {{who would have}} preferred a more accountable leadership. John Heron, once an RC leader and teacher, who left the organization in 1974 to set up his own co-counseling organization, Co-Counselling International, said he parted company with RC because it [...] "systematically conditioned its members to associate {{a certain kind of}} beneficial human development with centralized authoritarian control of theory and community policy. It <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that this was pseudo-liberation." [...] He considered that the authoritarianism of RC derived partly from the Leninist doctrines of central control that Jackins had learned in the Communist Party of America and partly from the autocratic example of his former associate L. Ron Hubbard.|$|E

2500|$|... "In 1946, after {{returning}} to Montreal from service with the Free French Forces, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the crude technique previously used for radioautography had to be improved". In collaboration with Leonard Bélanger, Leblond worked on increasing {{the resolution of the}} autoradiographic technique. They were advised by physicist Pierre Demers to melt the emulsion from Eastman Kodak lantern slides, paint it directly on the sections, and then develop the emulsion while it was still attached to the histologic sections. This resulted in a tenfold improvement in resolution. Subsequently, Leblond and his colleagues developed a technique in which the histologic slides were dipped directly into liquid emulsion. The use of thinner sections and emulsion coats led to further advances in resolution, and the introduction of tritium was a technical milestone.|$|E
2500|$|According to Grist, it was Georgia that {{launched}} the first military strikes against Tskhinvali. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the [...] attack was completely indiscriminate and disproportionate to any, if indeed {{there had been}} any, provocation,” he said. “The attack was clearly, in my mind, an indiscriminate attack on the town, as a town.” Grist's views were echoed by Stephen Young, who was another senior OSCE official in Georgia at the time. According to him, {{there had been no}} extensive shelling of the Georgian villages on the evening or night of August 7. Young added, that if there had been shelling of Georgian villages that evening, the OSCE monitors at the scene would have heard it. According to him, the monitors only heard occasional small arms fire.|$|E

[...] Stating that she had no clue of her son's intentions, she said, [...] "Once I saw his journals, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Dylan entered the school with the intention of dying there." [...] In Andrew Solomon's 2012 book, Far From the Tree, she acknowledged that on the day of the massacre, when she discovered that Dylan was one of the shooters, she prayed he would kill himself. [...] "I had a sudden vision of what he might be doing. And so while every other mother in Littleton was praying that her child was safe, I had to pray that mine would die before he hurt anyone else." ...|$|E
