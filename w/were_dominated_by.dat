5|$|In the 1980s, {{the country}} music charts <b>were</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> pop singers with only {{tangential}} influences from country music, a trend that has continued since. The 1980s saw a revival of honky-tonk-style country {{with the rise of}} people like Dwight Yoakam and the new traditionalists Emmylou Harris and Ricky Skaggs, as well as the development of alternative country performers like Uncle Tupelo. Later alternative country performers, like Whiskeytown's Ryan Adams and Wilco, found some mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|In the 8th and 9th centuries, {{civil service}} {{constituted}} the clearest path to aristocratic status, but, {{starting in the}} 9th century, the civil aristocracy was rivalled by an aristocracy of nobility. According to some studies of Byzantine government, 11th-century politics <b>were</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> competition between the civil and the military aristocracy. During this period, Alexios I undertook important administrative reforms, including {{the creation of new}} courtly dignities and offices.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Johnson (18 September 1709 13 December 1784) was an English author born in Lichfield, Staffordshire. He was {{a sickly}} infant who early on began to exhibit the tics that would {{influence}} how people viewed {{him in his}} later years. From childhood he displayed great intelligence and an eagerness for learning, but his early years <b>were</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> his family's financial strain and his efforts to establish himself as a school teacher.|$|E

5|$|The forests <b>were</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> birds, and {{the lack}} of {{mammalian}} predators led to some like the kiwi, kakapo, weka and takahē evolving flightlessness. The arrival of humans, associated changes to habitat, and the introduction of rats, ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species, including large birds like the moa and Haast's eagle.|$|E
5|$|By the 20th century Fleet Street and {{the area}} {{surrounding}} it <b>were</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> the national press and related industries. The Daily Express relocated to No.121–8 Fleet Street in 1931, into a building designed by Sir Owen Williams. It was the first curtain wall building in London. It has survived {{the departure of the}} newspaper in 1989 and was restored in 2001. The Daily Telegraph was based at No.135–142. These premises are both Grade II Listed. In the 1930s, No.67 housed 25 separate publications; by this time the majority of British households bought a daily paper produced from Fleet Street.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, Philly soul, funk, {{rock and}} most other genres <b>were</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> disco-inflected tracks. During this period, funk bands like The O'Jays and The Spinners {{continued}} to turn out hits. After the death of disco in 1980, soul music survived for a short time before going through yet another metamorphosis. With the introduction of influences from electro music and funk, soul music became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre of music that was again called R, usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as contemporary R.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the gravity}} of this rebellion, the Illyrians went on, {{alongside}} their neighbours the Thracians, to become {{the backbone of the}} Roman army. By the 2nd century, with roughly half the Roman army deployed on the Danube frontier, the auxilia and legions alike <b>were</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> Illyrian recruits. In the 3rd century, Illyrians largely replaced Italians in the senior officer echelons of praefecti of auxiliary regiments and tribuni militum of legions. Finally, from AD 268 to 379, virtually all emperors, including Diocletian and Constantine the Great were Romanised Illyrians from the provinces of Dalmatia, Moesia Superior and Pannonia. These were members of a military aristocracy, outstanding soldiers who saved the empire from collapse in the turbulent late 3rd century.|$|E
5|$|Growth in the Northeast was {{accompanied}} by the creation of moral reform organizations, such as Sunday schools, temperance associations, tract and Bible societies, and orphanages. The proliferation of voluntary organizations was encouraged by postmillennialism, {{the belief that the}} Second Coming of Christ would occur {{at the end of an}} era of peace and prosperity fostered by human effort. The 1815 General Assembly recommended the creation of societies to promote morality. Organizations such as the American Bible Society, the American Sunday School Union, and the American Colonization Society, while theoretically interdenominational, <b>were</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> Presbyterians and considered unofficial agencies of the Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his personal role in Parliament, Bute sought to control the votes {{of members of the}} House of Commons, primarily to ensure the passage of legislation affecting his business interests. Initially, the Isle of Bute had only 21 voters who <b>were</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> his private estate, but it only returned a Member of Parliament in alternate elections, and his estates in Luton were too limited to allow him to influence the electoral process there. The best remaining option for Bute was to control the voting in Cardiff, but even here he had to choose his candidate carefully and apply careful financial pressure through his control of leases and rents to ensure their election.|$|E

5|$|In the Archaic period (before 2000 BCE), {{a number}} of loanwords from Mixe–Zoquean {{languages}} seem to have entered the proto-Mayan language. This has led to hypotheses that the early Maya <b>were</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> speakers of Mixe–Zoquean languages, possibly the Olmec. In {{the case of the}} Xincan and Lencan languages, on the other hand, Mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords. Mayan language specialists such as Campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between Maya and the Lencan and Xinca people, possibly during the Classic period (250–900).|$|E
5|$|Norway was {{prior to}} 1920 {{extremely}} active in gaining {{international support for}} Norwegian sovereignty, but following the treaty, Norwegian interest in the archipelago dwindled. From {{the start of the}} Cold War, Norwegian politicians wanted to avoid bringing the islands into superpower politics. This resulted in a policy of avoiding agitating the Soviet Union, which again resulted in the Norwegian authorities actively working against both Norwegian and foreign activities on Svalbard which could raise tensions. Compared to mainland relations, which <b>were</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> deterring through NATO membership, the Norwegian policy on Svalbard was related to calming the Soviet Union. Similarly, while a foreign presence was encouraged on the mainland, it was strongly discouraged on Svalbard.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} {{the conquest}} the {{highlands}} of Guatemala <b>were</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> several powerful Maya states. In the centuries preceding the arrival of the Spanish the K'iche' had carved out a small empire covering {{a large part of the}} western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the late 15th century the Kaqchikel rebelled against their former K'iche' allies and founded a new kingdom to the southeast with Iximche as its capital. In the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the K'iche'. Other highland groups included the Tz'utujil around Lake Atitlán, the Mam in the western highlands and the Poqomam in the eastern highlands.|$|E

5|$|The East Germanic Goths and Gepids, {{who lived}} in {{sedentary}} communities, were the first new arrivals. The Goths dominated Moldavia and Wallachia from the 290s, and parts of Transylvania from the 330s. Their power collapsed under attacks by the nomadic Huns in 376. The Huns controlled Eastern and Central Europe from around 400, but their empire disintegrated in 454. Thereafter the regions west of the Carpathian MountainsBanat, Crişana, and Transylvaniaand Oltenia <b>were</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> the Gepids. Within a century, the lands east of the mountains became important centers of the Antes and Sclavenes.

Different schools had specific honor and professional societies as well: Phi Delta Phi for the law department, Phi Rho Sigma for medicine, Kappa Delta Mu for chemistry, and many others. A chapter of Theta Tau, an engineering society, was founded in 1923, and Trigon Engineering Society was founded in 1924 as a local fraternity for engineering students. Trigon and Theta Tau dominated student government in the Engineering School during this time, often fielding competing candidates for student office.
