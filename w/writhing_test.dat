40|$|Background Ascorbic acid is amongst {{important}} water-soluble {{vitamins and}} when used orally in high-doses {{it has been}} observed to relieve pain and reduce opioid use in patients. However no controlled trial has compared the antinociceptive effects of ascorbic acid with other analgesic groups on animal models, and investigated the involved mechanisms. Objectives In the present study, the antinociceptive effect of vitamin C on male mice was investigated and compared with morphine and diclofenac. Also, possible mechanisms were assayed. Materials and Methods Male albino mice were used in this study. Antinociception was measured using the <b>writhing</b> <b>test,</b> tail flick and formalin tests. Ascorbic acid was used in three doses (30, 150 and 300 mg/kg, IP) and compared with the antinociceptive effects of 10 mg/kg of morphine as an opioid analgesic agent and 5 - 10 mg/kg of diclofenac as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) analgesic agent. The antinociceptive effect of ascorbic acid (300 mg/kg) was compared before and after treatment with naloxone (4 mg/kg), ondansetron (0. 5 mg/kg), atropine (5 mg/kg) and metoclopramide (1 mg/kg) in the <b>writhing</b> <b>test.</b> Results Vitamin C caused dose-dependent antinociceptive effects in acetic acid <b>writhing</b> <b>test</b> (P < 0. 05). It had no significant effect in the tail flick test. Meanwhile, vitamin C in high doses reduced pain in {{the second phase of the}} formalin test (P < 0. 05). Morphine had higher nociceptive effects in comparison to ascorbic acid in the <b>writhing</b> <b>test</b> (P < 0. 05). In the second phase of the formalin test the antinociceptive effects of vitamin C (300 mg/kg) was not significantly different with morphine at dose of 10 mg/kg. There was not significant difference between vitamin C (300 mg/kg) and diclofenac (10 mg/kg) in the second phase of the formalin test. Metoclopramide and ondansetrone reduced the antinociceptive effects of vitamin C. Conclusions The results obtained from the acetic acid induced <b>writhing</b> <b>test</b> and second phase of the formalin test indicate that vitamin C possess antinociceptive activity especially on inflammatory pain. Ondansetrone and metoclopramide reduced the effects of ascorbic acid, which may be because ascorbic acid produced antinociception through mechanisms that may be involved in dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems...|$|E
40|$|A 1 {{adenosine}} receptors (ARs) {{have been}} identified as a potential target for the development of anti-nociceptive compounds. The present study explores the analgesic effects of a novel A 1 AR positive allosteric modulator, TRR 469, in different models of acute and chronic pain in mice. To evaluate the allosteric enhancement, in vitro binding experiments were performed. The anti-nociceptive properties were investigated in formalin and <b>writhing</b> <b>tests,</b> and in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathic pain model. Rotarod and catalepsy tests were used to identify potential side effects, while the functional effect of TRR 469 was studied using [3 H]-d-aspartate release from synaptosomes. TRR 469 effectively inhibited nociceptive responses in the formalin and <b>writhing</b> <b>tests,</b> with effects comparable to those of the reference analgesic morphine. Isobolographic analysis of the combination of TRR 469 and morphine revealed an additive interaction. TRR 469 was anti-allodynic in the neuropathic pain model and did not display locomotor or cataleptic side effects. TRR 469 enhanced the binding of the agonist radioligand [3 H]-CCPA and induced a 33 -fold increase of adenosine affinity in spinal cord membranes. In mouse spinal cord synaptosomes, TRR 469 enhanced the inhibitory effect of A 1 AR activation on [3 H]-d-aspartate release, a non-metabolizable analogue of glutamate. In conclusion, this research demonstrates the anti-nociceptive effect of the novel compound TRR 469, one of the most potent and effective A 1 AR positive allosteric modulators so far synthesized. The use of TRR 469 allows for the possibility of exploiting analgesic properties of endogenous adenosine, with a minor potential to develop the various side effects often {{associated with the use of}} direct receptor agonists...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackground and purpose: Histamine is a {{neurotransmitter}} {{present in}} the brain of mammals which produces its physiological effects on target cells by stimulation of three types of receptors H 1, H 2 and H 3. Various reports nowadays indicate the role of histamine in reduction of pain transmission. This {{study was designed to}} determine the role of histamine receptors in reduction of pain. Materials and Methods: In this study, effects of different histamine receptor agonists and antagonists on the nociceptive threshold were investigated in mice by thermal (hot plate) and chemical (acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing) stimuli. Results: Intracerebroventricular (I. C. V.) injection of the histamine H 1 receptor agonist HTMT (50 μ g per mouse) produced a significant hypernociceptive response in the hot plate and <b>writhing</b> <b>tests.</b> This dose of HTMT had no significant effect on the motor coordination on rota rod test. Intra peritoneal(I. P) injection of histamine H 1 receptor antagonist, dexchloropheniramine (30 and 40 mg/kg) and diphenhydramine (20 and 40 mg/kg) caused a dose dependent antinociception in both tests. But since all the doses of dephenhydramine in this experiment caused motor impairment in rota rod, it seems that diphenhydramine is not a real pain antagonist. Combined injection of HTMT with dexchlorpheniramine (20 mg/kh, i. p) did not change pain threshold in hot plate teat. The histamine H 2 receptor agonist, dimaprit (50 and 100 μ gm per mouse, I. C.

Additionally, pretreatment with EOX, in mice, also significantly produced (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 001) antinociceptive effect by reduction of nociceptive behavior (in formalin and <b>writhing</b> <b>tests).</b> The EOX showed c-Fos label in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, and periaqueductal gray. Acute administration of EOX exhibited a significant (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 001) anti-inflammatory profile in the carrageenan-induced peritonitis and by the carrageenan-induced hindpaw edema tests in mice. Our results provide evidence {{for the use of}} X. laevigata by traditional medicine practitioners in the management of pain and inflammatory disorders...|$|R
40|$|According to folk {{medicine}} some species {{belonging to the}} genus Cyclamen were used for their biological activities. Early investigation of the different species of the genus resulted in the isolation of triterpenic saponins. No phytochemical and biological data are available on C. repandum. As {{part of a series}} of phytochemical investigations for bioactive compounds from medicinal plants, Cyclamen repandum S. et S. was investigated. The present study sought to find the antiinflammatory and antinociceptive activities of C. repandum tubers in rats and mice. A preliminary screening was conducted with three different extracts in the tests used, particularly the paw edema and the <b>writhing</b> <b>tests.</b> Subsequently some saponins isolated from the ME extract, the more effective one, have been identified. This paper also describes the results of fractionation and bioassay guided chemical studies. Chemical investigation of the active extract afforded the isolation and characterization of six triterpenic saponins. The possible antiinflammatory and analgesic properties were investigated as the saponin content of the fractions allows to speculate on such aspect...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effect of Salvia syriaca L. aerial parts ethanolic extract in male NMRI mice. Antinociceptive activity was done using by formalin, hot plate and <b>writhing</b> <b>tests.</b> The effect of ethanolic extract on acute inflammation was studied by xylene edema test in mice. The Salvia syriaca L. ethanolic extract (1, 10, 50 and 100 mg kg - 1 body wt.) was injected intraperitoneally. The control group administrated with saline. Present results showed that the ethanolic extract decreased only second phase of formalin-induced pain. In hot plate test, the ethanolic extract did not raise pain threshold during 60 mins. The ethanolic extract exhibited antinociceptive activity against writhing-induced by acetic acid. In xylene ear edema test, Salvia syriaca L. ethanolic extract showed significant activity in the mice. The present data indicated that this plant has antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effect on the mice but more works are required to be done in order to elucidate the mechanism (s) involved in antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of the Salvia syriaca L. extract...|$|R
