5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information about what <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E
5|$|Liliʻuokalani helped {{preserve}} {{key elements}} of Hawaii's traditional poetics while mixing in Western harmonies brought by the missionaries. A compilation of her works, titled The Queen's Songbook, was published in 1999 by the Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust. Liliʻuokalani used her musical compositions {{as a way to}} express her feelings for her people, her country, and what <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> political realm in Hawaii. One example of the way her music reflected her political views is her translation of the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant. While under house arrest, Liliʻuokalani feared she would never leave the palace alive, so she translated the Kumulipo in hopes that the history and culture of her people would never be lost. The ancient chants record her family's genealogy back to the origin story of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom proper, {{that is the}} Jaffna peninsula, {{was divided}} into various provinces with subdivisions of parrus meaning {{property}} or larger territorial units and ur or villages, the smallest unit, was administered on a hierarchical and regional basis. At the summit was the king whose kingship was hereditary; he was usually succeeded by his eldest son. Next in the hierarchy stood the adikaris who were the provincial administrators. Then came the mudaliyars who functioned as judges and interpreters of the laws and customs of the land. It was also their duty to gather information of whatever <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> provinces and report to higher authorities. Administrators of revenues called kankanis or superintendents and kanakkappillais or accountants came next in line. These were also known as pandarapillai. They had to keep records and maintain accounts.|$|E

5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly what <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E

25|$|In February 1942 the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{escaped from}} Brest, France in the Channel Dash, undetected {{until they were}} well into the English Channel.

His opponent opined that Nitiwul had served for far too long and believed the constituents needed a new face.|$|E

25|$|By 1873 the Colonial Office in London came to {{perceive}} Ord as incompetent. He was soon replaced by Sir Andrew Clarke and Clarke {{was ordered to}} get a complete picture of what <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Malay states and recommend how to streamline British administration in Malaya. The reason was that London was increasingly aware that the Straits Settlements were increasingly dependent on {{the economy of the}} Malay states, including Perak. After Clarke's arrival in Singapore, many British traders including Read became close to the governor. Through Read, Clarke learned of Raja Abdullah's problem and willingness to accept a British representative in his court if the British assisted the once apparent heir.|$|E
25|$|At WrestleMania IV, Ax and Smash {{defeated}} Strike Force (Rick Martel and Tito Santana) to {{win their}} first WWF World Tag Team Championship. Ax struck Martel {{in the back of}} the neck with Fuji's cane while he had Smash in a Boston crab (Fuji had dropped the cane into the ring while taking a beating from Santana who carried on oblivious to what <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ring). Martel was knocked out and Smash covered him for the pin while Ax hid outside with the cane. As champions, they defeated a number of the top teams of the WWF, which at the time had a very talent-rich and hotly contested tag division, most notably the British Bulldogs and Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart).|$|E

25|$|Oceaan 7 {{was very}} small for the purpose to which it was being put. The cramped living {{accommodation}} and lack of privacy on board soon caused tensions among the personnel. It proved difficult to maintain the vessel in position off Scarborough as the winter storms came. In November 1966 one storm was so severe that waves were breaking over the vessel's deck and water entered the living quarters and studio. The station carried on broadcasting through {{the early part of}} the storm although the presenters were obviously in fear for their lives. Listeners on-shore (including 270 staff member Paul Burnett) were horrified by what <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of the storm, the station went off the air for 8 days while repairs were carried out.|$|E
25|$|Davíð Oddsson was {{a member}} of a group of young conservative-libertarians within the Independence Party who felt that the party should more {{strongly}} support attempts to extend economic freedom in the heavily regulated Icelandic economy. The group included Þorsteinn Pálsson, Geir H. Haarde, Jón Steinar Gunnlaugsson, Kjartan Gunnarsson, Magnús Gunnarsson, Brynjólfur Bjarnason and Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson, and they published the magazine Eimreiðin from 1972 to 1975; they also followed with interest what <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom under Margaret Thatcher and in the United States under Ronald Reagan; they also read books and articles by and about Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek and James M. Buchanan, who all visited Iceland in the early 1980s and whose messages of limited governments, privatisation, and liberalisation of the economy had a wide impact.|$|E

500|$|The garage phenomenon, {{though most}} often {{associated}} with North America, was not exclusive to it.

500|$|All local {{television}} stations were disrupted. Local television stations, and newspapers, {{moved quickly to}} sister locations in nearby cities.
