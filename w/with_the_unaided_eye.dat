50|$|The {{critical}} question {{for all three}} writers was whether the new phenomenon could be explained within the generally-accepted model of the universe, known as the Aristotelian model or the Ptolmaic system. This held that the stars were remote, fixed in their positions and unchanging, while movement and variance were associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> planets, closer to the earth. An unusual event in the sky might take place close to the earth, and could therefore be explained within the standard cosmological model. However if it took place beyond the planets, this indicated that the stars, contrary to what was commonly believed, could not be fixed in a 'firmament'. Astronomers (still working <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>unaided</b> naked <b>eye</b> at this time) took measurements of parallax to determine whether an object was near the earth or far away from it.|$|R
50|$|Celestial {{cartography}}, uranography, astrography or star cartography is {{the fringe}} of astronomy and branch of cartography concerned with mapping stars, galaxies, and other astronomical objects on the celestial sphere. Measuring the position and light of charted objects requires a variety of instruments and techniques. These techniques have developed from angle measurements <b>with</b> quadrants and <b>the</b> <b>unaided</b> <b>eye,</b> through sextants combined with lenses for light magnification, up to current methods which include computer-automated space telescopes. Uranographers have historically produced planetary position tables, star tables, and star maps for use by both amateur and professional astronomers. More recently computerized star maps have been compiled, and automated positioning of telescopes is accomplished using databases of stars and other astronomical objects.|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{methods for}} colour {{quantification}} are {{complicated by the}} fact that colours change depending on illumination, and that different observers often perceive colours differently. Here we describe a new affordable method, which improves methods relying on human observers, to quantify patterns and colour variations. The procedure combines customized software <b>with</b> <b>the</b> use of digital cameras and commercial photofinishing software. The computer routines correct unavoidable illumination changes during image capturing, making all images comparable. Colours are quantified in a continuous scale of the conventional colour models developed for the human vision system, such as HSB, RGB, CMYK, or Lab, amenable for statistical analyses. We illustrate the use of this technique showing a previously unknown sexual dimorphism in the red-legged partridge, Alectoris rifa, undetectable <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>unaided</b> human <b>eye.</b> We also demonstrate that the digital system provides a finer discrimination than human observers for scoring the plumage of partridges belonging to two different subspecies. This method has potential applications in behavioural ecology, physiology, genetics, evolutionary biology, and taxonomy. Peer reviewe...|$|R
500|$|The {{brightest}} {{member of}} this constellation is Aldebaran, an orange-hued, spectral class K5III giant star. Its name derives from [...] , Arabic for [...] "the follower", probably {{from the fact that}} it follows the Pleiades during the nightly motion of the [...] celestial sphere across the sky. Forming the profile of a Bull's face is a V or K-shaped asterism of stars. This outline is created by prominent members of the Hyades, the nearest distinct open star cluster after the Ursa Major Moving Group. In this profile, Aldebaran forms the bull's bloodshot eye, which has been described as [...] "glaring menacingly at the hunter Orion", a constellation that lies just to the southwest. The Hyades span about 5° of the sky, so that they can only be viewed in their entirety <b>with</b> binoculars or <b>the</b> <b>unaided</b> <b>eye.</b> It includes a naked eye double star, Theta Tauri, with a separation of 5.6arcminutes.|$|R

40|$|A {{higher level}} of downy mildew {{resistance}} is needed in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.). One method for doing that would be to combine different mechanisms of resistance into a single cultivar. Disease symptoms are expressed as necrotic spots, chlorotic areas, amount of sporulation on the leaf underside, and stunting of plant growth. Methods for evaluation of necrosis, chlorosis, and sporulation are available, but sporulation {{requires a lot of}} effort to evaluate, requiring spore counts on a hemacytometer under a compound microscope. We evaluated two faster methods: a subjective rating under a dissecting scope, and a subjective rating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>unaided</b> (naked) <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> naked eye was the fastest method, and it also had the lowest error variation in an experiment run using susceptible 'Coolgreen' grown in the field. Leaves sampled {{from the base of the}} plants were sporulating <b>the</b> most compared <b>with</b> those taken from the middle or tip of the plant. A set of 65 diverse cultivars was evaluated in the field for necrosis, chlorosis, sporulation and stunting. Necrosis and chlorosis rating were highly correlated with each other. However, resistance to sporulation and stunting by downy mildew appeared to be relatively independent of necrosis and chlorosis. It may be possible to develop higher resistance by combining genes for low necrosis with those for low sporulation or with low stunting. Cucurbitaceae 2008. IX EUCARPIA Meeting.

5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>unaided</b> <b>eye</b> as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E
5|$|WASP-13 is a sunlike, G-type {{star that}} is {{situated}} approximately 156 parsecs (509 light years) in the Lynx constellation.

The star's effective temperature, at 5826 K, is hotter than that of the Sun. However, its metallicity is similar; this can be seen in how the concentration of iron, or , is approximately 0. WASP-13's surface gravity is measured at 4.04 km/s2, while the rate at which it rotates is at most 4.9 km/s.|$|E
