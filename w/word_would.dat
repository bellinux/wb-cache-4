5|$|Beginning in 1966, Khrushchev {{began his}} memoirs. He {{dictated}} {{them into a}} tape recorder and recorded indoors, after attempts failed to record outdoors due to background noise, knowing that every <b>word</b> <b>would</b> be heard by the KGB. However, the security agency {{made no attempt to}} interfere until 1968, when Khrushchev was ordered to turn over his tapes, which he refused to do. Khrushchev was hospitalized with heart ailments when his son Sergei was approached by the KGB and told that there was a plot afoot by foreign agents to steal the memoirs. Sergei Khrushchev turned over the materials to the KGB since the KGB could steal the originals anyway, but copies had been made, some of which had been transmitted to a Western publisher. Sergei instructed that the smuggled memoirs should be published, which they were in 1970 under the title Khrushchev Remembers. Under some pressure, Nikita Khrushchev signed a statement that he had not given the materials to any publisher, and his son was transferred to a less desirable job. Upon publication of the memoirs in the West, Izvestia denounced them as a fraud. Soviet state radio carried the announcement of Khrushchev's statement, {{and it was the first}} time in six years that he had been mentioned in that medium. In the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Khrushchev was given a short characterization: ″In his activities, there were elements of subjectivism and voluntarism".|$|E

25|$|The lower 15 bits of each {{memory word}} held AGC {{instructions}} or data, with each word being {{protected by a}} 16th odd parity bit. This bit was set to 1 or 0 by a parity generator circuit so a count of the 1s in each memory <b>word</b> <b>would</b> always produce an odd number. A parity checking circuit tested the parity bit during each memory cycle; if the bit didn't match the expected value, the memory word {{was assumed to be}} corrupted and a parity alarm panel light was illuminated.|$|E

At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, Strauss-Schulson said that fans seeing the film in theaters and spreading the <b>word</b> <b>would</b> help convince Sony to produce a sequel. He later stated that the making of a sequel also depends on the box office performance of the film and its profitability to the studio.|$|E

500|$|These games {{raised the}} profile of {{paraplegic}} (spinal cord and polio) athletes in Australia, particularly Western Australia. The Chairman of the Organising Committee, Hugh Leslie, who had lost a leg in World War Two, gave a speech aimed to change public perceptions about disabilities by addressing the power of language. These Games, he told the audience, ‘were designed {{to prove to the}} public that the person who was bodily handicapped was not a cripple, and he hoped that that horrible <b>word</b> <b>would</b> eventually be wiped out of use. He had a slogan which he hoped would be adopted by all disabled: [...] "I can, I will".|$|E
500|$|The {{vernacular name}} [...] "cheetah" [...] {{is derived from}} the Hindi word चीता (cītā), which in turn comes from the Sanskrit word चित्रकायः (...) meaning [...] "bright" [...] or [...] "variegated". The first {{recorded}} use of this word has been dated back to 1610. An alternative name for the cheetah is [...] "hunting leopard". The scientific name of the cheetah is Acinonyx jubatus. The generic name Acinonyx could have originated from the combination of two Greek words: akinetos means motionless, and onyx means claw. A rough translation of the <b>word</b> <b>would</b> be [...] "non-moving claws", a reference to the limited retractability (capability of being drawn inside the paw) of the claws of the cheetah relative to other cats'. The specific name jubatus means [...] "maned" [...] in Latin, referring to the dorsal crest of this animal.|$|E
500|$|This {{was almost}} all fiction, but MacGregor's {{calculation}} that official-looking documents and the printed <b>word</b> <b>would</b> convince many people proved correct. The meticulous {{detail in the}} leather-bound Sketch, {{and the cost of}} having it printed, did much to dispel lingering doubts. Poyaisian land certificates at two shillings and threepence per acre, roughly equivalent to a working man's daily wage at the time, were perceived by many as an attractive investment opportunity. There was enough demand for the certificates that MacGregor was able to raise the price to two shillings and sixpence per acre in July 1822, then gradually to four shillings per acre, without diminishing sales; according to MacGregor, about 500 had bought Poyaisian land by early 1823. The buyers included many who invested their life savings. MacGregor became, to quote one 21st-century financial analyst, the [...] "founding father of securities fraud".|$|E

When early-voting Maine and Vermont went {{strongly}} Republican in September, this meant that McKinley would most likely win the Northeast. [...] These results made the Midwest the crucial battlefield that would decide the presidency. [...] Bryan spent most of October there—160 of his final 250 train stops were in the Midwest. [...] Early Republican polls had shown Bryan ahead in crucial Midwestern states, including McKinley's Ohio. [...] Much of the blizzard of paper the Republican campaign was able to pay for concentrated on this area/ By September, this had its effect as silver sentiment began to fade. [...] Morgan noted, [...] "full organization, [...] party harmony, a campaign of education with the printed and spoken <b>word</b> <b>would</b> more than counteract" [...] Bryan's speechmaking. [...] Beginning in September, the Republicans concentrated on the tariff question, and as Election Day, November 3, approached, they were confident of victory.|$|E
500|$|Butler {{announced}} on 6 March 1963 {{that he was}} going to convene a conference to decide the Federation's future. It would be impossible (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation as the latter, being self-governing, had been co-signatory to the Federal agreement in 1953. According to Smith, Field, Dupont and other RF politicians, Butler made several oral independence guarantees to ensure Southern Rhodesia's attendance and support at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. Field and Smith claimed that Butler justified this to them the day before the conference began by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his <b>word</b> <b>would</b> be against the Commonwealth's [...] "spirit of trust"—an argument that Field eventually accepted. [...] "Let's remember the trust you emphasised," [...] Smith warned, according to Field's account wagging his finger at Butler; [...] "if you break that you will live to regret it." [...] No minutes were made of this meeting. Butler denied afterwards that he had ever made such a promise. Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, held at the Victoria Falls Hotel over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation at the end of 1963.|$|E
500|$|A direct {{consequence}} {{of the end of}} British rule was an economic slump; the Transvaal government almost immediately found itself again on the verge of bankruptcy. The triumvirate spent two months discussing the terms of the Pretoria Convention with the new volksraad—approve it or go back to Laing's Nek, said Kruger—before it was finally ratified on 25 October 1881. During this time Kruger introduced tax reforms, announced the triumvirate's decision to grant industrial monopolies to raise money and appointed the Reverend SJ du Toit to be Superintendent of Education. To counteract the influx of uitlanders, the residency qualification to vote was raised from a year to five years. In July 1882 the volksraad decided to elect a new President the following year; Joubert and Kruger emerged as candidates. Kruger campaigned on the idea of an administration in which [...] "God's <b>Word</b> <b>would</b> be my rule of conduct"—as premier he would prioritise agriculture, industry and education, revive Burgers's Delagoa Bay railway scheme, introduce an immigration policy that would [...] "prevent the Boer nationality from being stifled", and pursue a cordial stance towards Britain and [...] "obedient native races in their appointed districts". He defeated Joubert by 3,431 votes to 1,171, and was inaugurated as President on 9 May 1883.|$|E

500|$|As Southern Rhodesia {{had been}} the UK's {{legislative}} partner in forming the Federation in 1953, {{it would be impossible}} (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation. Field could therefore potentially hamstring the British by refusing to attend the conference until they pledged to grant his country full independence. According to Field, Smith and other RF politicians, Butler made several such guarantees orally to ensure their co-operation at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. The Southern Rhodesians claimed that Butler justified his refusal to give a written promise by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his <b>word</b> <b>would</b> be against the Commonwealth's [...] "spirit of trust"—an argument that Field eventually accepted. [...] "Let's remember the trust you emphasised", Smith warned, according to Field's account wagging his finger at Butler; [...] "if you break that you will live to regret it."

In the House of Commons afterwards, Butler flatly denied suggestions that he had [...] "oiled the wheels" [...] of Federal dissolution with secret promises to the Southern Rhodesians.|$|E
500|$|The four {{withdrawn}} members {{demanded that}} the Council return to the Act of January 8 and omit the mention of any alliance with Germany. After heated debates that lasted for several weeks, on February 15, at 10 o'clock am, the new revision of the Act was ready. It included, with minor stylistic changes, wording of the Act of January 8 and promulgation and notification, drafted on February 1. Promulgation and notification do not carry legal weight and do not change {{the meaning of a}} legal document. The Council, including the withdrawn members, was invited to return the next day for its finalization. On the next day, February 16, 1918, at 12:30 pm, all twenty Council members met in the room of Lithuanian Committee for Support of the War Victims, at 30 Didžioji Street in Vilnius. The building has since been known as the House of the Signatories (...) and houses a museum. The Council first voted to approve the first part, the first two paragraphs up to the word drauge, of the Act. This section was approved unanimously. The second part, however, did not receive support from the four withdrawn members because they were not satisfied with the word [...] "finally" [...] in describing the duties of the Constituent Assembly (in [...] "... the foundation of the Lithuanian State and its relations with other countries will be finally determined by the Constituent Assembly ..."). They were afraid that this <b>word</b> <b>would</b> give a pretext for the Council to usurp the powers of the Constituent Assembly, while the majority argued that the word simply expressed the non-negotiable and non-appealable nature of the future Assembly's decisions. Therefore, the Act was unanimously approved [...] but did not have full-fledged support from all twenty men.|$|E
500|$|Under the {{doctrine}} of [...] "foreign equivalents," [...] a foreign language term used in a foreign country, that is considered generic in that country, cannot be imported into the United States and used as a trademark. In applying {{the doctrine}}, the courts consistently refer to two policy rationales. The first rationale, [...] "the doctrine serves the interests of domestic competition":"Because {{of the diversity of}} the population of the United States, coupled with temporary visitors, all of whom are part of the United States marketplace, commerce in the United States utilizes innumerable foreign languages. No merchant may obtain the exclusive right over a trademark registration if that exclusivity would prevent competitors from designating a product as what it is in the language their customers know best." [...] Otokoyama Co. Ltd. Vs Wine of Japan Import Inc.The second rationale, [...] "the doctrine serves the interests of international comity":"Because United States companies would be hamstrung in international trade if foreign countries granted trademark protection to generic English words, the United States reciprocates and refuses trademark protection to generic foreign words." [...] Enrique Bernat F., S.A. v. Guadalajara, Inc.However, the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure ("TMEP") states that the test for applying {{the doctrine of}} foreign equivalents is [...] "whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the <b>word</b> <b>would</b> denote its English equivalent".The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has, for the purposes of the guide, ruled that an [...] "ordinary American purchaser" [...] refers to the [...] "significant portion of consumers" [...] who speak both English and the relevant foreign language. In the case In re Joint Stock Co. [...] "Baik ," [...] 80 USPQ2d 1305, 1310, 0.22% was accepted as a significant portion of consumers in the United States. Thus the doctrine is generally interpreted by courts as not applying if the generic word is not a word from a foreign language, but one from an English-speaking foreign country.|$|E

500|$|On Day 4, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Big Brother Rave" [...] Have-Not competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were {{required}} to construct a series of pipes to spell out the word [...] "Have" [...] while neon [...] "Rave Juice" [...] flowed through the piping. If done correctly, the pipes would cause the juice to spill onto a wheel and cause it to spin; the last team {{to complete the task}} would be the Have-Nots for the week. The Brains clique lost the competition, meaning Chima, Michele, and Ronnie were the Have-Nots for the week. This greatly upset Chima, who stated on numerous occasions afterwards that she was debating walking from the game. Jessie took an immediate dislike to Laura, and hoped to put her up, though his clique members attempted to convince him that Lydia should be evicted that week. Due to Ronnie refusing to be nominated as a pawn, Chima later agreed to be nominated as a pawn. On Day 5, Jessie chose to nominate Chima and Lydia for eviction, with Lydia being his target for eviction. Worried they might not have the votes to keep Chima, Jessie and Russell formed an alliance with Laura in attempt to get her to evict Lydia. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Russell, Natalie, and Jeff were selected to compete for the Power of Veto; Casey was selected to host. On Day 7, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Pop Goes the Veto!" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to pop [...] "pimples" [...] on an over-sized face, with various Scrabble tiles inside of them. The HouseGuests would collect tiles and attempt to spell a word with their collected tiles; the HouseGuest with the longest correctly spelled <b>word</b> <b>would</b> win the Power of Veto. Russell was the winner of the Power of Veto. Following the competition, Jeff engaged in numerous arguments with Russell and Natalie, causing a rift in their clique. In an attempt to save herself, Lydia attempted to convince Russell and Jessie to backdoor Braden that week by taking her off the block as a way to hurt Jeff. Russell later told Ronnie that this was the plan, with Ronnie telling Braden, Jeff, and Jordan about the plan. On Day 9, Russell chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Lydia from the block, with Braden being nominated in her place. Following Braden's nomination, Jordan and Laura began campaigning to get the votes for him to stay, and appeared to have themselves, Casey, Jeff, Michele, and Ronnie in agreement; Ronnie, however, was playing both sides and had no intention of keeping Braden in the game. On Day 12, Braden became the first HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when Jessie cast the tie-breaker vote in Chima's favor.|$|E
