5|$|Jardine's tactics were {{successful}} in one respect: in six innings against the tourists ahead of the Tests, Bradman scored only 103 runs, causing concern among the Australian public who expected much more from him. At the time, Bradman was in dispute with the Board of Control, who would not allow players to write in newspapers unless journalism was their full-time profession; Bradman, although not a journalist, had a contract to <b>write</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sydney Sun. A particular irritation for Bradman was that Jack Fingleton, a full-time journalist, was allowed to <b>write</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Telegraph Pictorial, although he required permission from the Board to write about cricket. Bradman threatened {{to withdraw from the}} team unless the Board allowed him to write. Fingleton and Bradman were openly hostile towards each other. From their first meeting while playing together for New South Wales, they disliked each other. Fingleton, conscious that Bradman's self-possession and solitary nature made him unpopular with some teammates, kept his distance after a dressing room argument, while Bradman believed the more popular Fingleton had tried to turn the team against him. Later hostility arose from Bradman's public preference for Bill Brown as a batsman, which Fingleton believed cost him a place on the 1934 tour of England. Fingleton's writings on the Bodyline series further soured the relationship. Bradman believed some of the differences stemmed from religion; Fingleton was a Roman Catholic, Bradman an Anglican.|$|E

5|$|Koenig {{first became}} {{involved}} with writing a script for The Animated Series after he asked Susan Sackett, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's assistant, to type up some writing he was working on. After reading it through, {{she thought it was}} good and passed it to Roddenberry, who agreed and asked Koenig if he was interested in writing for the animated show. He accepted the offer, and started working on a plot involving cloning which was inspired by newspaper articles about the subject, becoming the first actor from Star Trek to <b>write</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> franchise.|$|E

5|$|Some science-fiction {{fans have}} speculated that the Quatermass serials in general, and Quatermass II in {{particular}} — with its elements including a conspiracy of silence in the government concerning extraterrestrial life, secret government facilities for alien use, and the silencing of any critic who opposes the government's plans — influenced the successful American series The X-Files (1993–2002). Kneale was invited to <b>write</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> X-Files during the 1990s, but declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|Stearn {{compiled}} a major {{work on the}} life of John Lindley and produced an edited version of the classic book on herbals by Agnes Arber, one of the influences of his Cambridge years, and whose obituary he would later <b>write</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Times.

5|$|Synge's plays {{helped to}} set the {{dominant}} style of plays at the Abbey Theatre until the 1940s. The stylised realism of his writing {{was reflected in the}} training given at the theatre's school of acting, and plays of peasant life were the main staple of the repertoire {{until the end of the}} 1950s. Sean O'Casey, the next major dramatist to <b>write</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Abbey, knew Synge's work well and attempted to do for the Dublin working classes what Synge had done for the rural poor. Brendan Behan, Brinsley MacNamara, and Lennox Robinson were all indebted to Synge.|$|E
5000|$|Michael Hogan <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Telegraph gave The Enfield Haunting {{four stars}} {{out of five}} saying [...] "This Seventies-set chiller was scarily compelling". while Ellen E Jones <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Independent called it [...] "North London meets The Exorcist in eerie {{suburban}} drama" [...] while Grace Dent <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same paper <b>wrote,</b> [...] "The Enfield Hauntings poltergeist was about as scary as a drunk uncle" [...] while Julia Raeside <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Guardian said, [...] "This supernatural account of the famous 1970s London poltergeist is packed with genuine thrills and superb performances from a young cast." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{first new}} series of Doctor Who {{featured}} eight scripts by Davies; the remainder were allocated to experienced dramatists and writers for the show's ancillary releases: Steven Moffat penned a two-episode story, and Mark Gatiss, Robert Shearman, and Paul Cornell each wrote one script. Davies also approached his old friend Paul Abbott and Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling to <b>write</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> series; both declined due to existing commitments. Shortly after he secured writers for the show, Davies stated {{that he had no}} intention of approaching writers from the old series; the only writer he would have wished to work with was Holmes, who died in May 1986.|$|E
5|$|Another death {{brought about}} a {{creative}} renewal. The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity—to <b>write</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol's short story Christmas Eve, a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera Vakula the Smith. The success of Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908—a total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration, but made a third attempt and almost finished it {{in the last four}} years of his life. (His son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov's scientific treatment of orchestration, illustrated with more than 300 examples from his work, set a new standard for texts of its kind.|$|E
5|$|Carter met the then-president of NBC, Brandon Tartikoff, at {{a company}} {{softball}} game in Brentwood, California. Tartikoff and Carter began talking between innings, and when Tartikoff eventually read some of Carter's script work, he brought him over to <b>write</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> network. There, Carter developed a number of unproduced television pilots—Cameo By Night, featuring Sela Ward; Brand New Life, which {{has been described as}} being similar to The Brady Bunch; Copter Cop, a science fiction series that was hampered by Tartikoff's injuries after a car accident; and Cool Culture, influenced by Carter's passion for surfing and experience with Surfing Magazine. During this time Carter would also work as a producer on Rags to Riches, a job he accepted in order to learn more about producing a series.|$|E

5|$|In 1866, {{at the age}} of 29, {{he became}} a fellow of the Linnean Society under the {{sponsorship}} of Charles Darwin, James Veitch, David Moore, and seven other distinguished botanists and horticulturists. Two months later, he left Regents Park to <b>write</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Gardener's Chronicle and The Times, and represented the leading horticultural firm of Veitch at the 1867 Paris Exhibition. He began writing many of his publications, beginning with Gleanings from French Gardens in 1868, The Parks, Gardens, and Promenades of Paris in 1869, and Alpine Flowers for Gardens and The Wild Garden in 1870. In 1871 he launched his own gardening journal, simply named , which over the years included contributions from notables such as John Ruskin, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Gertrude Jekyll, William Morris, Dean Hole, Canon Ellacombe, and James Britten.|$|E
5|$|On Why Don't You?, Davies took on varying jobs, {{including}} researcher, director, illustrator, assistant {{floor manager}} and unofficial publicist for fan-mail. He was offered his first professional scriptwriting job in 1986 by show producer Dave Evans; he had entered Evans's office {{to collect his}} wages and was offered an extra £100 to write a replacement script. Davies' script was positively reviewed in the department and led to increasingly larger roles that culminated in a six-month contract to <b>write</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> show after it relocated to Manchester in 1988. He worked for the show for two more years and eventually became the show's producer. He oversaw an increase in drama which tripled its audience—despite the fact BBC Manchester was not permitted by the corporation to create children's dramas—which reached its climax with his last episode: a drama where the Why Don't You? protagonists, led by the show's longest running presenter Ben Slade, were trapped in a café by a supercomputer that tried to kill them.|$|E
5|$|The Cottingley Fairies {{appear in}} a series of five {{photographs}} taken by Elsie Wright (1901–88) and Frances Griffiths (1907–86), two young cousins who lived in Cottingley, near Bradford in England. In 1917, when the first two photographs were taken, Elsie was 16 years old and Frances was 9. The pictures {{came to the attention of}} writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who used them to illustrate an article on fairies he had been commissioned to <b>write</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Christmas 1920 edition of The Strand Magazine. Doyle, as a spiritualist, was enthusiastic about the photographs, and interpreted them as clear and visible evidence of psychic phenomena. Public reaction was mixed; some accepted the images as genuine, but others believed they had been faked.|$|E
