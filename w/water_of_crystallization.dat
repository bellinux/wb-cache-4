25|$|Sodium acetate is {{also used}} in heating pads, hand warmers, and hot ice. Sodium acetate trihydrate {{crystals}} melt at 136.4°F/58°C (to 137.12°F/58.4°C), dissolving in their <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization.</b> When they are heated past the melting point and subsequently allowed to cool, the aqueous solution becomes supersaturated. This solution is capable of cooling to room temperature without forming crystals. By pressing on a metal disc within the heating pad, a nucleation center is formed, causing the solution to crystallize back into solid sodium acetate trihydrate. The bond-forming process of crystallization is exothermic. The {{latent heat of fusion}} is about 264–289kJ/kg. Unlike some types of heat packs, such as those dependent upon irreversible chemical reactions, a sodium acetate heat pack can be easily reused by immersing the pack in boiling water for a few minutes, until the crystals are completely dissolved, and allowing the pack to slowly cool to room temperature.|$|E

2500|$|If the {{azeotrope}} is {{not considered}} sufficiently pure for use, there exist some techniques to break the azeotrope to give a pure distillate.

2500|$|The chart shows {{solubility}} curves {{for some}} typical solid inorganic salts (temperature is in degrees Celsius i.e. kelvins minus 273). Many salts behave like barium nitrate and disodium hydrogen arsenate, and show a large increase in solubility with temperature. Some solutes (e.g., sodium chloride in water) exhibit solubility that is fairly independent of temperature. A few, such as calcium sulfate (gypsum) and cerium(III) sulfate, become less {{soluble in water}} as temperature increases. This {{is also the case}} of calcium hydroxide (portlandite) whose solubility at 70°C is about half of its value at 25°C. The dissolution of calcium hydroxide in water is also an exothermic process and obeys to the Le Chatelier's principle. A lowering of temperature will thus favour the dissolution heat elimination and increases the equilibrium constant of dissolution of Ca(OH)2, and so increase its solubility at low temperature. This temperature dependence is sometimes referred to as [...] "retrograde" [...] or [...] "inverse" [...] solubility. Occasionally, a more complex pattern is observed, as with sodium sulfate, where the less soluble decahydrate crystal loses <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> at 32°C to form a more soluble anhydrous phase.|$|E
