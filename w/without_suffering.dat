The surviving enemy planes flew down to the water level to evade further radar detection. These planestorpedo bombers and fighterssuccessfully ambushed the formation just minutes later.

5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to phototherapy because {{it produces a}} longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, the main goal is {{to build up the}} patient's tolerance to UVA radiation enough {{so that they can be}} outdoors <b>without</b> <b>suffering</b> an episode of solar urticaria. Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to once or twice per week.|$|E

The brigade was ordered to advance until contact was regained with the Turkish force, which they located around 12:00, to the east of Oghratina. The regiment remained in contact all day, <b>without</b> <b>suffering</b> any casualties. They also located a telephone wire that the withdrawing Turks had failed to disconnect, enabling them to monitor the German and Turkish command issuing orders.|$|E

5|$|The laurels for the day’s action {{went to the}} defenders. The aim of the Luftwaffe was to {{wear down}} the Fighter Command <b>without</b> <b>suffering</b> {{excessive}} losses in the process, and in this it had failed. It cost the attackers five aircrew killed, wounded, or taken prisoner, for each British pilot casualty. In terms of aircraft, it had cost the Luftwaffe five bombers and fighters for every three Spitfires and Hurricanes destroyed in the air or on the ground. If the battle continued at this rate the Luftwaffe would wreck Fighter Command, but it would come close to wrecking itself in the process.|$|E
5|$|At 0630 on July 11, four T-34s {{advanced}} on 3rd Battalion's position, {{passing through}} a minefield <b>without</b> <b>suffering</b> any casualties. Following the tanks, about 1,000 North Korean infantry of the North Korean 3rd Infantry Division conducted a double envelopment of the battalion, setting up roadblocks in its rear to prevent resupply and evacuation of wounded. Simultaneously, heavy mortar fire struck the battalion's command post, destroying its communications center and ammunition stocks, and inflicting heavy casualties. American forward observers were unable {{to communicate with the}} artillery {{due to the lack of}} communications equipment. The attack by the North Koreans was well coordinated, and it is likely that North Korean forces driven from the position in the night had been able to gather intelligence about the battalion's position. In the ensuing fight, American forces were overwhelmed again, fighting in desperate hand-to-hand combat.|$|E

5|$|Lochry's Defeat, {{also known}} as the Lochry massacre, was a battle fought on August 24, 1781, near present-day Aurora, Indiana, in the United States. The battle was part of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), which began as a {{conflict}} between Great Britain and the Thirteen Colonies before spreading to the western frontier, where American Indians entered the war as British allies. The battle was short and decisive: about one hundred Indians of local tribes led by Joseph Brant, a Mohawk military leader who was temporarily in the west, ambushed a similar number of Pennsylvania militiamen led by Archibald Lochry. Brant and his men killed or captured all of the Pennsylvanians <b>without</b> <b>suffering</b> any casualties.|$|E
5|$|That second column, {{commanded}} by Soult and including Gen. Honoré Gazan's VCorps division, was escorting the French siege-train and therefore {{had to take}} a longer, more practicable route into Extremadura. Bad weather and the desertion of the Spanish drivers caused the artillery train to become separated from the escorting infantry, a problem that was further complicated when the column was threatened by 5,000 Spanish troops under Gen. Francisco Ballesteros. When confronted by Marshal Mortier, Ballesteros retreated <b>without</b> <b>suffering</b> serious harm but remained a threat {{to the rear of the}} French column. For this reason Soult directed Gazan's infantry to head off the Spanish force and protect the delayed siege-train, while he himself continued onward to Almendralejo with his cavalry. As a result, Soult finally joined Latour-Maubourg on 6 January with only a fraction of his original column and no heavy artillery.|$|E
5|$|The Mérens, {{like many}} {{mountain}} horses, is calm, docile and hardworking. The {{report of a}} comprehensive study on the heritability of the breed's temperament was published in Equ'idée in 2010. It is a versatile breed, and very hardy, able to live all year outside <b>without</b> <b>suffering</b> from the weather. Mérens {{are known for their}} endurance, agility and sure-footedness. They require very little care, and can survive on poor food, even when working. They are resistant to cold, but react poorly to heat. Mérens foals are often born in the snow, without human intervention, but are usually handled and accustomed to humans from an early age. They show increased resistance to the anticoagulant properties of some varieties of fern, the consumption of which can cause bloody sweats and blood in the urine in other horses.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} of the Canadian Corps was {{to take control of}} the German-held high ground along an escarpment at the northernmost end of the Arras Offensive. This would ensure that the southern flank could advance <b>without</b> <b>suffering</b> German enfilade fire. Supported by a creeping barrage, the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day of the attack. The village of Thélus fell during the second day of the attack, as did the crest of the ridge, once the Canadian Corps overcame a salient against considerable German resistance. The final objective, a fortified knoll located outside the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, fell to the Canadian Corps on 12 April. The German forces then retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no clear}} {{solution}} to combating Britain from the air. Göring {{had not given}} up hope of winning a victory by airborne assault. He discussed the possibility of invading Ireland (Fall Grün, or Operation Green) with Kurt Student in January 1941, in order to surround Britain by land, sea and air. The operation was shelved. Instead, the Luftwaffe, {{with varying degrees of}} success, carried out the strategic bombardment of British industrial cities. The lack of RAF night defences in this stage of the war enabled the German bombers to inflict extensive damage <b>without</b> <b>suffering</b> the heavy losses of the daylight campaign. It is estimated that the Luftwaffe lost around 500 aircrews during the Blitz in comparison to the Battle of Britain in which it lost around 2,800 killed, 340 wounded, 750 captured. Overall losses were cut by one-third of daylight operations.|$|E
5|$|To {{eliminate}} the threat these isolated frigates posed, Hood ordered a squadron under Rear-Admiral John Gell {{to investigate the}} harbour at Genoa. The squadron arrived on 5 October and discovered Modeste and two smaller warships at anchor. Later in the day, three ships of the squadron launched their ship's boats and instigated a boarding action against the anchored ships, in defiance of Genoese neutrality. The French crews resisted, but the British boarding parties successfully captured all three vessels <b>without</b> <b>suffering</b> any casualties. Six days later the detached HMS Captain also seized the abandoned Impérieuse, which had fled to La Spezia. The action had strategic consequences: the Republican faction in Genoa was strong and they successfully barred Austrian reinforcements from sailing to join the Allied garrison at the developing Siege of Toulon. The outnumbered defenders of the port were overwhelmed and driven into the sea by a Republican assault on 17 December.|$|E

5|$|A 300-strong Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) was {{subsequently}} deployed {{to support the}} Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007, including a commando company group, elements of the SASR, and an integral combat service support team. In {{the latter part of}} 2008 the commando company conducted a disruption operation in Helmand province as part of Operation Eagle's Summit, which was a major coalition operation conducted in support of the transport and installation of an additional turbine for the Kajaki Dam hydroelectric facility. In March and April 2009, SOTG killed 80 Taliban fighters in a major four-week operation in Helmand Province, <b>without</b> <b>suffering</b> any casualties. Further operations undertaken include the Battle of Gizab in April 2010, and the Shah Wali Kot Offensive in June 2010, which resulted in heavy insurgent casualties. The bulk of SOTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in late 2013 as part of a drawdown of Australian forces, although some special forces remained after this date as part of the small Australian force maintained in the country. The Regiment lost 12 personnel killed while deployed to Afghanistan, along with one killed during a pre-deployment exercise.|$|E
5|$|In late 1829, with {{construction}} of the railway almost complete, the Rainhill Trials were held on a short level stretch of the completed line near Rainhill, to test how the track withstood locomotives running over it and to determine which type of locomotive would be used, with a £500 prize at stake. The Trials were widely publicised, and 10,000–15,000 people attended the first day on 6October 1829. Of the five entrants Rocket, built by George Stephenson and his son Robert, was the only entrant to complete the trial <b>without</b> <b>suffering</b> a serious failure, and was duly selected as the design to be used. (Although often described as a race, and shown as such in illustrations, the Rainhill Trials were a series of independent trials. Each engine ran on a different day.) At {{around the time of}} the Rainhill Trials the tunnel to the forthcoming Liverpool terminus—the first tunnel ever dug under a major built-up area—was completed. To win over sceptical locals it was whitewashed, fitted with lighting and a band, and the public charged a shilling apiece to walk through it.|$|E
5|$|Norreis went to Rome in {{the company}} of Thomas of Marlborough shortly before 1205 to lay the abbey's case before the papacy. Thomas {{remained}} in Italy, but Norreis returned to England in the middle of 1205. While in Rome, Norreis and Thomas borrowed 400 marks to finance the litigation at the papal curia. Norreis could not repay this sum and for a while was in danger of being imprisoned, but he managed to leave Rome <b>without</b> <b>suffering</b> the fate of one of his companions who was detained for the debt and died while imprisoned. When Norreis made it back to England, Mauger excommunicated the abbot in April 1205.

Later that year the monks became so annoyed by Norreis's abuse that they abandoned the abbey and did not return until they secured the abbot's confirmation of their rights.|$|E
