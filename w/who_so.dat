5|$|The {{designs were}} {{prepared}} in-house at the Philadelphia Mint by Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber, {{who designed the}} obverse and his assistant, George T. Morgan, who prepared the reverse. They did not seek outside artists to submit proposals. Numismatic author Q. David Bowers suggested that this was because Secretary McAdoo had sought non-employees to propose designs for the five Panama-Pacific coins along with those sketches prepared by Barber and his assistants, and the Mint's engravers had prepared {{only two of the}} five, and that because the artist assigned one, Evelyn Longman, had fallen ill. When the McKinley designs were submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts on March 31, 1916, it recommended changes, though Don Taxay, <b>who</b> <b>so</b> stated, does not say what they were. In any event, no alteration was made, and the designs were approved.|$|E

25|$|Regular announcers {{included}} Lee Vines, <b>who</b> <b>so</b> served from 1950 to 1955, Hal Simms, {{who served}} from 1955 to 1961, Ralph Paul, whose tenure {{was confined to}} 1961, and Johnny Olson, perhaps {{the best known of}} Goodson-Todman's television announcers, whose tenure began in 1961 and ran till 1967.|$|E

25|$|Charles de Gaulle had {{an older}} brother Xavier (1887–1955) and sister Marie-Agnes (1889–1983), and two younger brothers, Jacques (1893–1946) and Pierre (1897–1959). He was {{particularly}} close to the youngest, Pierre, <b>who</b> <b>so</b> resembled him that presidential bodyguards often saluted him by mistake when he visited his famous brother or accompanied him on official visits.|$|E
25|$|There were {{occasionally}} men {{and women}} <b>who</b> <b>so</b> longed after the other that some jumped into the river that separated them in a vain attempt to reunite with their loved ones. Unfortunately the currents of the river were too strong and the swimmers were washed down the river, never to be seen again.|$|E

25|$|The chapel {{was built}} in the early 1950s and is {{dedicated}} to Saint Francis, <b>who</b> <b>so</b> inspired Springvale School’s first headmaster, Canon Robert Grinham. It is built of brick, rough plastered and white painted; its internal pillars are gum poles, as are the beams which support the thatched roof. It is a simple building; a no-nonsense expression of the Christian faith.|$|E
25|$|The Quebec {{government}} uses low electricity {{rates to}} attract new business and consolidate existing jobs. Despite its statutory obligation to sell electric power to every person <b>who</b> <b>so</b> requests, the province has reserved the right to grant large load allocations to companies {{on a case by}} case basis since 1974. The threshold was set at 175 MW from 1987 to 2006 and was reduced to 50 MW in the government's 2006–2015 energy strategy.|$|E
25|$|Gabriel Harvey {{was also}} {{critical}} of Kranich. In a marginal note in his copy of Georg Meier's In Iudaeorum Medicastrorum Calumnias (1570), he compared Kranich to the Queen's physician, Doctor Lopez, whom he termed 'none of the learnedest or expertest physicians in the court, {{but one that}} maketh as great account of himself as the best'. Harvey added: 'Doctor Burcot was in a manner such another; <b>who</b> <b>so</b> bold as blind Bayard?'.|$|E

25|$|The {{launching}} {{of a conservative}} weekly journal of opinion in a country widely {{assumed to be a}} bastion of conservatism at first glance looks like a work of supererogation, rather like publishing a royalist weekly within the walls of Buckingham Palace. It is not that of course; if National Review is superfluous, it is so for very different reasons: It stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no other is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those <b>who</b> <b>so</b> urge it.|$|E
25|$|A file {{was then}} {{made for the}} polling place. The file {{contained}} {{a copy of the}} log (Acta de la jornada electoral), a copy of the signed tally sheet, and a copy of any protests filed. Separate packets contained the unused ballots, the annulled ballots, and the valid votes. A separate envelope contained the list of voters. Finally, all files were placed together in a sealed packet; the sealed packet was then signed by every member of the Directing Committee, and any party representative <b>who</b> <b>so</b> desired (article 234).|$|E
25|$|Francis Petre's work {{cannot be}} judged against {{that of the}} great {{classical}} architects of the northern hemisphere, <b>who</b> <b>so</b> clearly influenced him. He did not create a style or have a revival period named after him. His achievement was adapting and developing so many established styles well; whether through the new techniques of steel or concrete, or through more traditional building methods. He was given amazing opportunities to prove himself worthy as an accomplished and inspired architect; the many monumental buildings with which he provided New Zealand are testimony to his talent.|$|E
60|$|Finally, {{a verdict}} of felo de se was returned, {{with a strong}} {{expression}} of the jury's admiration of the conduct of constables Malcolm, Chester, and Roberts, <b>who</b> had <b>so</b> cleverly effected the capture of the man <b>who</b> had <b>so</b> long set the law at defiance.|$|R

25|$|Don Luis de Noroña (or Noronha), captain {{general of}} Ceuta, witness the {{incredible}} battle {{and that he}} had given the squad a signal service and to warn of the approximation of their enemies, reacted immediately, sending a brig with gunpowder and bullets tow, bandages for the wounded, a surgeon and some food. In the attached message cavalierly congratulated the squad leader saying he did not know that Don Fadrique was at this place (but) it did not think could be another <b>who</b> <b>so</b> bravely and with so few ships had disrupted so many. The Dutch fleet was no longer a danger to anyone.|$|E
25|$|The main {{trouble with}} Kurzman's {{interesting}} {{book is the}} author's credulity; he uncritically accepts the validity of controversial documents and unquestioningly believes in the statements made {{to him by his}} principal German interlocutor, the former SS General Karl Wolff, who died in 1984. The book's documentation is modest; the short notes and index contain a great number of vague or inaccurate references. Moreover, it is difficult to believe the arguments of an author <b>who</b> <b>so</b> manifestly lacks the language abilities needed for his work. Kurzman seems to know Italian but no German; he misspells German names and uses almost no German-language sources.|$|E
25|$|All {{incumbent}} {{town and}} village police officers serving {{in those areas}} that voted to join the police district became {{members of the new}} department without further examination or qualification. In addition, state troopers serving on Long Island <b>who</b> <b>so</b> desired could request appointment to the new force. Criminal investigators in the district attorney's office were appointed the new detectives. The serving town and village police chiefs were typically appointed inspectors, deputy chiefs or assistant chiefs in the new department. The remaining positions were filled by competitive civil service examinations. The Suffolk County Police Department officially came into being on January 1, 1960 with 619 sworn members.|$|E

25|$|At Camp David, the Palestinians {{maintained}} their traditional {{demand that the}} right of return be implemented. They demanded that Israel recognize the right of all refugees <b>who</b> <b>so</b> wished to settle in Israel, but to address Israel's demographic concerns, they promised that the right of return would be implemented via a mechanism agreed upon by both sides, which would try to channel a majority of refugees away from the option of returning to Israel. According to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, some of the Palestinian negotiators were willing to privately discuss a limit {{on the number of}} refugees who would be allowed to return to Israel. Palestinians who chose to return to Israel would do so gradually, with Israel absorbing 150,000 refugees every year.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{set about}} his innings in a workman-like fashion {{and kept the}} {{scoreboard}} ticking over. He and Boon put on 96 for the fourth wicket, before the different pace at running between the wickets of the burly Tasmanian and greyhound-like Jones led to Boon's run out for 38. This brought Steve Waugh to the wicket for the Australians, <b>who</b> <b>so</b> far had not been dismissed all series. Jones had edged past fifty and was looking very confident as the day wore on. The pair added a further 31, and despite day one ending with an almost biblical-scale lightning storm and flash flood, Australia ended day one on 234 for 4, with Dean Jones 71 not out, and Steve Waugh 17 not out.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasons for}} the revolt {{are thought to have}} been religious. After al-Hawari's death, the Roman emperor Valens, an Arian heterodox, decided to {{disregard}} the requests of the Arabs for an orthodox bishop, insisting on the appointment of an Arian bishop instead. Mavia withdrew from Aleppo into the desert with her people, forming alliances with desert Arabs and gaining support throughout much of Arabia and Syria, in preparation for the fight against Roman rule. It is unclear as to whether Mavia herself was Christian at this time or not. Some historians report that it was during her military exploits that she met an ascetic monk <b>who</b> <b>so</b> impressed her that she converted to orthodox Christianity. All agree, however, that the conditions she set for any truce with Rome, was this monk's appointment as bishop over her people.|$|E

5000|$|Principles of self-injury {{are applied}} to more than just one's self. It is {{noteworthy}} that a person may not request or hire an agent to injure themselves: it is forbidden to waive the rule against self-injury or to abet self-injury to one's own body. The Mishnah states: [...] "If a person asks, 'Blind my eye', or 'cut off my hand' or 'break my leg,' anyone <b>who</b> does <b>so</b> is liable (for violating injury law) -- even if a person asking to be injured stipulates that anyone <b>who</b> does <b>so</b> would be exempt, the one who causes injury would still be liable. Likewise, if a person asks, 'Tear my clothes' or break my pitcher' then anyone <b>who</b> does <b>so</b> is liable; however, if a person asking for their property to be damages stipulates that anyone <b>who</b> does <b>so</b> would be exempt, then the exemption is valid." [...] (Bava Kamma 8:7) ...|$|R
