5|$|Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother! (often {{referred}} to simply as Happy Brothers) is an 1887 oil painting by the Serbian artist Uroš Predić.

5|$|Kent Hughes broke Olympic {{tradition}} in two significant <b>ways.</b> <b>He</b> decided to charge for television and newsreel {{footage of the}} Games where previously footage was provided free of charge. Secondly, following a suggestion from John Ian Wing, a 17-year-old apprentice carpenter from Melbourne, Kent Hughes instigated the now familiar closing ceremony tradition of the athletes of different nations parading together, instead of with their national teams, {{as a symbol of}} world unity. Kent Hughes's plan to charge for television and newsreel footage of the Games was strongly opposed in many circles, including the media, who believed that the Games were news and as such should be free, while Australian government authorities thought that providing free television coverage of the Games would lead to greater tourism opportunities. Brundage made no public comment on television rights for the Games but grasped the financial possibilities of charging for rights, devising a television rights fees policy following the Games, whereby television stations were forced to negotiate for televised rights for all future Games. This policy is believed to have netted the IOC over $12 billion since its inception at the 1960 Summer Olympics.|$|E
