6000|$|It must be {{confessed that}} the controversialists {{of the present}} day have an eminent {{advantage}} over their predecessors {{in the days of}} folios; it required some learning then to write a book, and some time, at least--for the very labor of writing out a thousand such vast pages would demand a considerable period. But now, in the age of duodecimos, the system is reformed altogether: a male or female controversialist draws upon his imagination, and not his learning; makes a story instead of an argument, and, in the course of 150 pages (where the preacher has it all his own way) will prove or disprove you anything. And, to our shame be it said, we Protestants have set the example of this kind of proselytism--those detestable mixtures of truth, lies, false sentiment, false reasoning, bad grammar, correct and genuine philanthropy and piety--I mean our religious tracts, which any woman or man, be he ever so silly, can take upon himself to write, and sell for a penny, as if religious instruction were the easiest thing in the world. We, I say, have set the example in this kind of composition, and all the sects of the earth will, doubtless, speedily follow it. I can point you out blasphemies in famous pious tracts that are as dreadful as those above mentioned; but this is no place for such discussions, and we had better return to Madame Sand. As Mrs. Sherwood expounds, by means of many touching histories and anecdotes of little boys and girls, her notions of church history, church catechism, church doctrine;--as the author of [...] "Father Clement, a Roman Catholic Story," [...] demolishes the stately structure of eighteen centuries, the mighty and beautiful Roman Catholic faith, in whose bosom repose so many saints and sages,--by the means of a three-and-sixpenny duodecimo volume, which tumbles over the vast fabric, as David's pebble-stone did Goliath;--as, again, the Roman Catholic author of [...] "Geraldine" [...] falls foul of Luther and Calvin, and drowns the awful echoes of their tremendous protest by the sounds of her little half-crown trumpet: in like manner, by means of pretty sentimental tales, and cheap apologues, Mrs. Sand proclaims HER truth--that <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Messiah, and that the Christian religion is no more! O awful, awful name of God! Light unbearable! Mystery unfathomable! Vastness immeasurable!--Who are these who come forward to explain the mystery, and gaze unblinking into the depths of the light, and measure the immeasurable vastness to a hair? O name, that God's people of old did fear to utter! O light, that God's prophet would have perished had he seen! Who are these that are now so familiar with it?--Women, truly; for the most part weak women--weak in intellect, weak mayhap in spelling and grammar, but marvellously strong in faith:--women, who step down to the people with stately step and voice of authority, and deliver their twopenny tablets, as if there were some Divine authority for the wretched nonsense recorded there! ...|$|E

40|$|Several years ago, I had the {{opportunity}} to accompany a team from an eye hospital as they went to several locations on what they called ‘outreach’. The primary purpose of these trips was to identify operable cataract patients. Many people attended these outreach clinics, but they identified very few cataracts. The second day, I made friends with a couple of primary school children and explained to them that I wanted to find some people who were blind. I asked them to take me through the village to find these people. With the help of these children, I found five blind people, three with operable cataracts. None of these ever came to the ‘outreach clinic’.
