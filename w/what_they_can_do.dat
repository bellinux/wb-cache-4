25|$|Most of the area's native mammal {{species are}} present in the wilderness, with the {{exception}} of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct. Gray wolves were reintroduced to the SNRA amidst controversy in the mid-1990s and now occupy most of the forest except for the Minidoka District. They were reintroduced to restore the ecosystem stability that they provide as top predators, including managing high elk populations, which had inhibited new vegetation growth. Opponents to the reintroduction included hunters concerned that wolves would inhibit their ability to hunt the highest number of game species possible, ranchers concerned for the welfare of their animals, and land developers concerned that a species listed under the Endangered Species Act may restrict <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to their land. Plans for the reintroduction of grizzly bears to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed because of concerns similar to those with the wolf reintroduction but also concerns for personal safety. The wilderness contains habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canada lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.|$|E

500|$|The most {{commonly}} given {{answer is that}} we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences {{of the sort that}} we do. [...] There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation. [...] For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe. [...] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in an essay titled The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies, argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying. [...] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. [...] A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.|$|E
500|$|Locking looks {{similar to}} popping, {{and the two}} are {{frequently}} confused by the casual observer. In locking, dancers hold their positions longer. The lock is the primary move used in locking. It is [...] "similar to a freeze or a sudden pause." [...] A locker's dancing is characterized by frequently locking in place and after a brief freeze moving again. According to Dance Spirit magazine, a dancer cannot perform both locking and popping simultaneously; thus, it is incorrect to call locking [...] "pop-locking". While both styles originate in Los Angeles, locking and popping are two distinct funk styles with their own histories, their own set of dance moves, their own pioneers, and their own competition categories. Locking is more playful and character-driven, whereas popping is more illusory. In popping, dancers push the boundaries of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with their bodies. Locking has specific dance moves that distinguish it from popping and other funk styles. In the 2006 book Total Chaos, hip-hop historian Jorge [...] "Popmaster Fabel" [...] Pabon lists some of these moves which include [...] "the lock, points, skeeter , scooby doos, stop 'n go, which-away, and the fancies." [...] In addition, Lockers commonly use a distinctive dress style, such as colorful clothing with stripes and suspenders.|$|E

500|$|Madonna's first {{performance}} of [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] was on The MDNA Tour (2012) as the concert's opening track. The performance was choreographed by Jason Young and Alison Faulk, along with dancer Derrell Bullock, who assisted as supervisor. According to Faulk, Madonna asked Bullock {{to experiment with}} the concept of [...] "girl gone wild", {{and come up with a}} routine and style of his own. He wanted to find a story with the dancing and presented his moves to Madonna the next day. The singer also wanted to experiment {{with the concept of}} Catholic church, along with monks and gargoyles. Her message behind it was that of freedom, [...] "people getting to do whatever they wanted to". Four dancers from Brooklyn, adept at bone breaking dance, were enlisted as backup crew for the performance. Young recalled that they could [...] "create these abstract, very animalistic shapes. <b>What</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with their arms is unbelievable. Anything that most people can do in front of their bodies, they do it behind their bodies." [...] The dancing required the boys to put on heels like Kazaky in the music video. Most of them refused to abide by it, resulting in Madonna giving them a choice to put the heels and dance or leave the show. The dancers complied and learned the choreography.|$|E

Rich Goldstein of The Daily Beast argued that the emotional depth of the series increased during this season, highlighting [...] "Simon & Marcy" [...] as an example. Emily Guendelsberger of The A.V. Club later awarded the entire season an [...] "A", noting that [...] "Adventure Time has somehow managed to stay on fire for its fifth season's double-wide 52-episode run." [...] Guendelsberger praised the show's aforementioned creativity and experimentation, and also wrote that [...] "the writing staff has also taken the less-obvious X-Files approach: expanding the length of the stories they're able to tell by linking monster-of-the-week episodes into longer arcs." [...] The A.V. Club later named the series the 27th best television series of 2014, noting that, [...] "The end of the super-sized season five saw a string of conceptually ambitious episodes that blew the world of Ooo wide open, deepening the stories of Lemongrab, Lumpy Space Princess' doomed romance, and Ice King's past as Simon Petrikov." [...] The site selected [...] "Lemonhope" [...] as the stand-out from the season's end. Each episode was also graded by The A.V.

2500|$|But {{how does}} Deleuze square his pessimistic diagnoses with his ethical naturalism? Deleuze claims that {{standards}} of value are internal or immanent: to live well is to fully express one's power, {{to go to}} the limits of one's potential, rather than to judge what exists by non-empirical, transcendent standards. Modern society still suppresses difference and alienates persons from <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> To affirm reality, which is a flux of change and difference, we must overturn established identities and so become all that we can become—though we cannot know what that is in advance. The pinnacle of Deleuzean practice, then, is creativity. [...] "Herein, perhaps, lies the secret: to bring into existence and not to judge. If it is so disgusting to judge, it is not because everything is of equal value, but on the contrary because what has value can be made or distinguished only by defying judgment. What expert judgment, in art, could ever bear on the work to come?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Stories {{are based}} on values passed down by older generations to shape the {{foundation}} of the community. Storytelling is used as a bridge for knowledge and understanding allowing the values of [...] "self" [...] and [...] "community" [...] to connect and be learned as a whole. Storytelling in the Navajo community for example allows for community values to be learned at different times and places for different learners. Stories are told from the perspective of other people, animals, or the natural elements of the earth. In this way, children learn to value their place in the world as a person in relation to others. Typically, stories are used as an informal learning tool in Indigenous American communities, and can act as an alternative method for reprimanding children's bad behavior. In this way, stories are non-confrontational, which allows the child to discover for themselves what they did wrong and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to adjust the behavior.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> really <b>do.</b> <b>They</b> are athletes {{who want to be}} in a class that is more advantageous to for them. In testing and classification <b>they</b> don't show <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> really <b>do.</b> <b>They</b> try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult. In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: that is certainly the future that we are all looking to." ...|$|R
