25|$|To {{those who}} believe that {{consciousness}} entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate, whether what we think of when <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.|$|E
25|$|In many categories, e.g. Ab or VectK, the hom-sets hom(a, b) are {{not just}} sets but {{actually}} abelian groups, and the composition of morphisms is compatible with these group structures; i.e. is bilinear. Such a category is called preadditive. If, furthermore, the category has all finite products and coproducts, it is called an additive category. If all morphisms have a kernel and a cokernel, and all epimorphisms are cokernels and all monomorphisms are kernels, then <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> of an abelian category. A typical example of an abelian category is the category of abelian groups.|$|E

25|$|Color: In the {{evaluation}} of colored gemstones, color {{is the most important}} factor. Color divides into three components: hue, saturation and tone. Hue refers to color as we normally use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the pure spectral hues of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet. In nature, there are rarely pure hues, so when speaking of the hue of a gemstone, <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues. Ruby is defined to be red. All other hues of the gem species corundum are called sapphire. Ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues, including orange, purple, violet, and pink.|$|E

If Government is of people and democratic, people can be consulted, as we are doing here. What is more an example of pure democracy than meetings such as this one. If they cannot call such meetings they are not democracies.” Castro continued “Those who want to see people’s democracy let them come here and see this. We can speak to America and the world because <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> in names of a whole nation.” In this 1960 speech, Castro also criticized many Latin American liberal democracies, describing them as a “Pretense of democracy”, as, he claimed, they did not allow such gatherings.|$|E
25|$|In every discourse, {{whether of}} the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the {{individual}} in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive {{with those of the}} universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that <b>we</b> <b>speak,</b> as of civilised men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.|$|E

500|$|Johnson did {{not attempt}} to create schools of {{theories}} to analyse the aesthetics of literature. Instead, he used his criticism for the practical purpose of helping others to better read and understand literature. When it came to Shakespeare's plays, Johnson emphasised the role of the reader in understanding language: [...] "If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers, it is to be imputed to the nature of his work, which required the use of common colloquial language, and consequently admitted many phrases allusive, elliptical, and proverbial, such as <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> and hear every hour without observing them".|$|E

[...] Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic [...] wrote about the song's composition and musical influences, [...] " [...] is driven by booming dancehall-lite beats and a reggae vocal cadence (and title spelling), it's a simple dance-pop song at its core, with standard English-language singing {{as well as a}} can't-miss singalong hook." [...] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone also commented on the song's composition and concurred with Birchmeier's opinions of the song, writing that the song is [...] "a poppy piece of dancehall reggae with slapping, syncopated beats recalling big-band jazz".|$|E

500|$|A {{few other}} historians argue {{there was an}} actual {{alliance}}, but do not agree on the details: Jean Richard wrote that an alliance began around 1263. Reuven Amitai stated that {{the closest thing to}} actual Mongol-Frankish military coordination was when Prince Edward of England attempted to coordinate activities with Abaga in 1271. Amitai also mentioned the other attempts towards cooperation, but said, [...] "In none of these episodes, however, can <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> of Mongols and troops from the Frankish West being on the Syrian mainland at the same time." [...] Timothy May described the alliance as having its peak at the Council of Lyon in 1274, but that it began to unravel in 1275 with the death of Bohemond, and May too admitted that the forces never engaged in joint operations. Alain Demurger, in his own book The Last Templar, said that an alliance was not sealed until 1300.|$|E
500|$|Philosophers and non-philosophers {{differ in}} their intuitions about what {{consciousness}} is. While most people have a strong intuition {{for the existence of}} what they refer to as consciousness, skeptics argue that this intuition is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions. [...] Gilbert Ryle, for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of [...] "consciousness" [...] we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings. [...] More generally, many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness.|$|E
500|$|The {{statements}} about the obligatory nature {{of the terms of}} language have been taken to suggest that Whorf meant that language completely determined the scope of possible conceptualizations. However neo-Whorfians argue that here Whorf is writing about the terms in which <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> of the world, not the terms in which we think of it. Whorf noted that to communicate thoughts and experiences with members of a speech community speakers must use the linguistic categories of their shared language, which requires moulding experiences into the shape of language to speak them—a process called [...] "thinking for speaking". This interpretation is supported by Whorf's subsequent statement that [...] "No individual is free to describe nature with absolute impartiality, but is constrained by certain modes of interpretation even when he thinks himself most free". Similarly the statement that observers are led to different pictures of the universe has been understood as an argument that different conceptualizations are incommensurable making translation between different conceptual and linguistic systems impossible. Neo-Whorfians argue this to be is a misreading since throughout his work one of his main points was that such systems could be [...] "calibrated" [...] and thereby be made commensurable, but only when we become aware of the differences in conceptual schemes through linguistic analysis.|$|E

[...] "Whenever <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> {{in terms of}} 'air force' we are thinking of bombardment aviation," [...] he wrote, dismissing other forms of aviation. This was orthodox at the Air Corps Tactical School, which taught that [...] "every dollar which goes into the building of auxiliary aviation and special types, which types are not essential for the efficient functioning of the striking force can only occur {{at the expense of}} that air force's offensive power." [...] Walker's major thesis was that [...] "a determined air attack, once launched, is most difficult, if not impossible to stop when directed against land objectives." [...] At the conclusion of his article, he renewed his call for the creation of an independent air force [...] "as a force with a distinct mission, of importance co-equal to that of the Army and the Navy." [...] Walker's persistent advocacy of strategic bombing led to frequent clashes with Captain Claire Chennault, who led instruction in pursuit aviation at the Air Corps Tactical School from 1931 to 1936. [...] Chennault believed that the right mix of fighters and ground defenses could successfully defeat a bomber assault and ridiculed Walker for suggesting that bombers could not be stopped, leading to [...] "legendary" [...] debates between the two.|$|E
