5|$|Izdeliye 154 - A second 152 {{airframe}} with a Lyulka TR-1 turbojet. Canceled due to delays <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{attempts}} to re-engine the aircraft <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{it was originally}} designed for, the Mikulin AM-37. This was designated the MiG-7, and one MiG-3 was converted to evaluate the engine in May 1941. It proved to have poor longitudinal stability and the powerplant itself still {{had a number of}} problems. The German invasion the following month caused the cancellation of the development of the AM-37 as Mikulin's resources were required for the AM-35 and AM-38 engines already in production.|$|E
5|$|To {{provide the}} desired performance, several {{features}} {{were used in}} the RB.199. To operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions and speeds up to Mach 2, the RB.199 and several other engines make use of variable intake ramps to control the air flow. The hydraulic system is pressurised by syphoning power from both or either operational engine; the hydraulics are completely contained within the airframe rather than integrating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to improve safety and maintainability. In case of double-engine, or double-generator, failure, the Tornado has a single-use battery capable of operating the fuel pump and hydraulics for up to 13 minutes.|$|E

50|$|In Russian service, many BTR-60 {{variants}} {{have been}} replaced by variants of the BTR-80/K1Sh1 or have been upgraded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> from <b>the</b> BTR-80.|$|R
5|$|Forest Hill {{was a new}} air base, {{and roads}} and {{buildings}} were still under construction when its first course of flying training commenced with Avro Ansons on 29July 1940. One of the Ansons crashed in August, killing its instructor and a student. Later that month the second flying course began, on CAC Wirraways. The school was then reorganised into Initial and Advanced Squadrons. On 29September, two Ansons collided in mid-air and became locked together. Both navigators bailed out, to be followed shortly afterwards by the injured pilot of the lower aircraft. The pilot of the upper Anson, however, {{found that he was}} able to control the interlocked aircraft using his ailerons and flaps, coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> power of the Anson underneath. He then managed to make a successful emergency landing in a paddock near the town of Brocklesby.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was once}} again fastest during third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, even while suffering from overheating under his seat. The two Mercedes cars were separated by two-tenths of a second with the two Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen behind, another half a second down. Red Bull had a slight upturn in fortune, with Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat finishing fifth and sixth respectively. McLaren-Honda had another problematic session as Fernando Alonso stopped the car just after starting his installation lap. Teammate Jenson Button was called into the pit lane as well, citing a similar problem <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> but was able to continue later in the session. Felipe Massa experienced smoke in his cockpit both on Friday and Saturday, apparently caused by the new titanium plates underneath the cars which also create sparks when driving over bumps on the track.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's {{original}} {{intention was}} to sail down to Cape Town, visiting the main South Atlantic islands on the way. From Cape Town, Quest would head for the Enderby Land coast of Antarctica where, once in the ice, it would explore the coastline towards Coats Land in the Weddell Sea. At {{the end of the}} summer season the ship would visit South Georgia before returning to Cape Town for refitting and preparation for the second year's work. The ship's performance in the early stages of the voyage disrupted this schedule. Serious problems <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> necessitated a week's stay in Lisbon, and further stops in Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands. These delays and the slow speed of the ship led Shackleton to decide that it would be necessary to sacrifice entirely the visits to the South Atlantic islands, and instead he turned the ship towards Rio de Janeiro, where the engine could receive a thorough overhaul. Quest reached Rio on 22 November 1921.|$|E
50|$|A 5-speed manual {{transmission}} (NV-T350) was available <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 2.0 L <b>engine,</b> and a 4-speed automatic (A604) came <b>with</b> <b>the</b> larger <b>engines.</b> AutoStick was {{an option for}} some trim levels <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 2.5 L <b>engine.</b> <b>The</b> wheelbase was a long 108 inches.|$|R
5000|$|While two of <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> had {{problems}} {{and one of}} them was shut down, the damage to the plane's structure was so severe that the crash would have been inevitable, even <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> operating normally.|$|R
25|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> off, Sewol became {{unable to}} change {{directions}} and began drifting sideways. A passenger later testified that {{lights went out}} after the ferry started listing.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{awarding}} of the contract, a preliminary design review {{was carried out in}} September 1972, followed by a critical design review in September 1976 after which the engine's design was set and construction of the first set of flight-capable engines began. Final review of all the Space Shuttle's components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle and fuel preburners. The individual engine component tests were followed by the first test of a complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle's first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds of testing, a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> having undergone 110,253 seconds of testing by the time of STS-1 both on test stands at Stennis Space Center and installed on the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA). The first set of engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) were delivered to Kennedy Space Center in 1979 and installed on , before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% rated power level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight readiness firing on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.|$|E
5|$|On 4 November 2010, Qantas Flight 32, {{en route}} from Singapore Changi Airport to Sydney Airport, {{suffered}} an uncontained engine failure, resulting {{in a series of}} related problems, and forcing the flight to make an emergency landing. The plane safely returned to Singapore. There were no injuries to the passengers, crew or people on the ground despite debris falling onto the Indonesian island of Batam. The A380 was damaged sufficiently for the event to be classified as an accident. Qantas subsequently grounded all of its A380s that day subject to an internal investigation taken in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> manufacturer Rolls-Royce plc. A380s powered by Engine Alliance GP7000 were unaffected but operators of Rolls-Royce Trent 900-powered A380s were affected. Investigators determined that an oil leak, caused by a defective oil supply pipe, led to an engine fire and subsequent uncontained engine failure. Repairs cost an estimated 139 million (~US$145M). As other Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines also showed problems with the same oil leak, Rolls-Royce ordered many engines to be changed, including about half of the engines in the Qantas A380 fleet. During the airplane's repair, cracks were discovered in wing structural fittings which also resulted in mandatory inspections of all A380s and subsequent design changes.|$|E
5|$|While Final Fantasy XIII was in production, the {{development}} of Crystal Tools caused significant problems and delays. The programmers spent much time on taking all demands from staff into account. Based on this feedback, Murata's team tried to adapt the engine {{to the needs of}} several game projects, which proved to be virtually impossible and prevented the engine's specifications from being finalized. Furthermore, as separate groups were working on the individual tools of the engine, there was no comprehensive software documentation to ensure usability and compliance. Unable to wait any longer, the Final Fantasy XIII team {{had no choice but to}} begin creating assets to keep to the game's production schedule. However, the lack of specifications resulted in these assets being incompatible <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> In the end, it was decided that Final Fantasy XIII was to be the principal focus of Crystal Tools and the game's team began cooperating with the Research and Development Division more closely to receive the required tools and specifications. While preliminary support of Crystal Tools was developed for the Wii, the console did not fully support all components. In 2008, Murata said that Square Enix might license the engine out to other companies at some point in the future, although the limited documentation and the impracticality of supporting licensees posed great problems in doing so. Two years later, Final Fantasy XIII producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that developing an engine from scratch to go with a new game may have been a mistake and a likely cause for the long period between the title's announcement and release.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine upgrades Honda introduced for the , McLaren brought a new aerodynamic package for the MP4-30 which revised the front wing to increase downforce, altered the turning vanes to improve air flow over the front splitter, and adopted a concept pioneered by Ferrari to the rear floor designed to reduce the impact of airflow washing over the rear wheels and disrupting the rear diffuser, which in turn opened up {{a wider range of}} set-up options for the ride height and rake, or the angle between the front and rear ride height. These updates were designed to bring the MP4-30 in line with the designs developed by other teams. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and aerodynamic updates, the team had hoped to compete for points on merit, and while Alonso clashed with Felipe Massa on the opening lap, he was running as high as fifth on the closing stages—and was on course to replicate the team's best result of the season—before suffering a loss of power and slipping back down the order to finish eleventh. With Alonso out of the points, Button was promoted to sixth. The race also saw what would be the car's best qualifying performance as Alonso started eleventh, while the six points Button scored saw the team close to within ten points of Sauber in the World Constructors' Championship. However, the result also meant that McLaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty-three races, previously set between the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix and the 1981 British Grand Prix. Despite the progress that the team made over the previous rounds, the MP4-30's struggles continued in Mexico, with both drivers eliminated early in qualifying, and Jenson Button setting a new record for grid penalties, changing enough parts to warrant a seventy-place penalty. Alonso retired from the race with an incurable ERS problem that the team had identified the night before and Button finished fourteenth overall.|$|E

50|$|Not {{unusual for}} the era, the design was a biplane, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> mounted as two {{push-pull}} pairs between {{the upper and lower}} wing, each driving a four-bladed propeller.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} {{decommissioned}} in 1892, {{sold to a}} private firm (Peter Ellison, Sydney) for £2,200 in August 1893 and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> removed {{was used as a}} hulk.|$|R
25|$|An {{autogyro}} {{is characterized}} by a free-spinning rotor that turns because of the passage of air through the rotor from below. The vertical (downward) component of the total aerodynamic reaction of the rotor gives lift for the vehicle, and sustains the autogyro in the air. A separate propeller provides forward thrust, and can be placed in a tractor configuration <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and propeller {{at the front of the}} fuselage (e.g., Cierva), or pusher configuration <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and propeller at the rear of the fuselage (e.g., Bensen).|$|E
25|$|Charles Vignoles {{has also}} been {{associated}} with Novelty, but his practical involvement is not known. He may have aligned himself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> because of a continuing feud with George Stephenson.|$|E
25|$|The Tonti {{frame was}} {{engineered}} for stiffness using short, straight tubes working well <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> design {{and allowing the}} main backbone {{to pass through the}} cylinder splay and connect the steering head to the swingarm in the shortest possible distance.|$|E
5000|$|The vehicle's {{construction}} {{differs from}} the traditional GEA's scheme which uses under-wing airflow from <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> located in front. Designers of [...] "Burevestnik-24" [...] used a bi-plane scheme <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> which are located on the top wing, facing rearwards with pushing propellers.|$|R
