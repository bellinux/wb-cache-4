500|$|For his part, Rodgers {{recalled}} {{that he had}} first seen Madonna perform at a small club in New York in 1983. In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: [...] "I went to the club to see another woman sing, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence and then we met right after that. I kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't at that time. I always {{wanted to work with}} her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|She [...] {{gave me a}} call, and she was like, [...] "I {{would love}} to do a duet with you. Come by the studio." [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> she played the song for me. I didn't expect to record the song, but when I heard it, I said, [...] "Man, there's no way I'm going to leave this studio without my voice being on that record." [...] Everything just {{happened}} so fast. I didn't expect for it to be a single or a video. Everything was just great.|$|E

60|$|Breakfast {{was ready}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> in. <b>There</b> {{was a cold}} chicken on the sideboard, devilled chicken on the table, a trio of boiled eggs, and a dish of {{scrambled}} eggs. As regarded quantity Mrs. Beale never failed us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I'm {{nothing so}} interesting," [...] he said; [...] "but I {{have wanted to}} see new places and new things--and I've more or less seen 'em. When I've got tired of one town, I've simply up and beat it, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> there--wherever <b>there</b> was--I've looked for a job. And----Well, I haven't lost {{anything}} by it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> over <b>there</b> <b>I</b> found young Conley's sorrel hitched to one {{post and}} Walt Brown's gray hitched to the other. I went in, but I didn't stay long; in fact, I didn't sit down. I was afraid those infernal apples would roll out o' my pockets. I was afraid they'd find out I brought 'em over there for Miss Cole, like the darn fool I was." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, no, {{the minute}} he noticed that I saw him he hurried out of sight around the corner. I {{followed}} to the corner, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> he had gone." ...|$|E
5000|$|An {{hour and}} a half after {{reaching}} the base of the tree, we got the last of the provisions up. By then it was midnight. Finally, I was able to put on the harness and ascend Luna. It seemed an exhausting eternity before I reached the top. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> finally <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> <b>I</b> untangled myself from the harness and looked around for a place to collapse.|$|R
5000|$|While {{attending}} a Muscular Dystrophy Association banquet at age nine, Foster {{asked if he}} could address the audience. [...] "I was anxious because I had never done it before, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up <b>there</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to stop," [...] he recalled. To the surprise of his parents, Foster demonstrated a flair for communication; this in turn led to his choice as a national MDA Goodwill Ambassador (formerly known as an MDA Poster Child) for two consecutive years (2012 and 2013).|$|R
60|$|When the nicht cam roond I tauld the women-folk that I was bad wi' the jawache, {{and would}} gang airly tae my room. <b>I</b> kenned fine <b>when</b> ance <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> {{that there was}} na chance o' ony ane disturbin' me, so I waited a wee while, and then when a' was quiet, I slippit aff my boots and ran doon the ither stair until I cam tae the heap o' auld clothes, and there I lay doon wi' ane e'e peepin' through a kink and a' the rest covered up wi' a great, ragged cairpet.|$|R

60|$|I {{walked through}} the crowds of purchasers and salespeople, around the {{counters}} and tables filled with goods, to the far room to the left. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> I asked for red calico.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> {{the last}} offices were over, and I was shown my old mother's {{peaceful}} white face, very still, {{but a little}} cold and stern to me, a little unfamiliar, lying among white flowers.|$|E
60|$|On Wednesday {{the club}} {{could not be}} held, and I must ride down town and to and fro all {{afternoon}} delivering messages, then dined and rode up by the young moon. I had plenty news <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back; <b>there</b> is great talk in town of my deportation: it is thought they have written home to Downing Street requesting my removal, which leaves me not much alarmed; what I do rather expect is that H. J. Moors and I may be haled up before the C. J. to stand a trial for LESE-Majesty. Well, we'll try and live it through.|$|R

500|$|Lead singer Chester Bennington {{arrived late}} in the {{recording}} process of the album, having been chosen to replace Scott Weiland in the band Stone Temple Pilots, and then proceeded to record High Rise and tour with the band for most of 2013. When he eventually joined the band in the studio, {{he was surprised to}} find the band had reverted to their heavier rock-centric sound. Bennington stated in an interview with Kerrang!: [...] "Mike wrote tons while I was touring with Stone Temple Pilots last year. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> home, <b>there</b> was a lot for me to catch up with, and he was playing me things and I was like, 'Dude, this is fucking awesome!' I was really surprised how heavy it was".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, Sir, that's wagging, Sir,' {{returned}} the quondam Grinder, much affected. 'I was chivied through the streets, Sir, when I went there, and pounded <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there.</b> So I wagged, and hid myself, and that began it.' ...|$|E
60|$|I set {{myself to}} decide just {{exactly how the}} return to earth could be contrived. As I {{struggled}} with that problem I ceased {{to worry about what}} I should do <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there.</b> At last my only care was to get back.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't an {{accusation}} at all--it's a fact," [...] Crawshay replied. [...] "Luckily, he hadn't {{picked her up}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there.</b> He signalled our exact location and our course a dozen times or more, without response. Then I took {{a hand in the}} game." ...|$|E
5000|$|Henson {{refereed}} {{his first}} match in 1987. He {{broke into the}} business {{with the help of}} Steve Keirn, Mike Graham, and Gordon Solie in Championship Wrestling from Florida. According to Henson, “My first match was in Orlando, Fla., at the Eddie Graham Sports Complex. I think it’s been turned into apartment buildings now. The match was between Bob Cook and a young Mike Awesome. I wasn’t really all that nervous. I had watched it on television forever. I paid attention to the referees, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out <b>there</b> <b>I</b> kind of just fell into it. I was lucky enough to learn from some of the best workers of the time like Dick Slater and Mike Graham so it was pretty easy to catch on.” ...|$|R

500|$|Martin, who {{finished}} second, was candid about the result, [...] "We did really well to finish second. I just don't {{think we were}} in [...] league today." [...] In the post-race press conference, Kenseth said of his result, [...] "We didn't qualify very good, but we were really happy with our car. When the race started, I didn't think we were quite {{as good as we}} were yesterday (in practice), but we were able to have really good pit stops." [...] Logano, who was involved in the biggest accident of the race, [...] "The biggest thing was, I was fine the whole time, [...] I'm not really sure what happened. The spotter was clearing me low. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> down <b>there,</b> they checked up going into the corner and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> tagged from behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it is a {{very good}} idea, Jerry; I could not think what was up <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> and did not see anybody. I see you have another fire over the other side. I could make it out clear enough as we came on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure thing!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> {{what do you}} think? {{there was}} hardly enough of the old stone left to stand on, and that had a fence around it like an exhibit in an exposition. It had all been chipped away by {{souvenir}} hunters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I can't speak {{a word of}} French." [...] And then {{it ended}} in my {{undertaking}} to go to Como.

5000|$|Cirillo {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with the Minnesota Twins in December [...] He did not finish the season with the Twins and was claimed off waivers by the Diamondbacks on August 3, [...] Cirillo stated that he would most certainly retire {{at the end of}} the 2007 season. He made the first pitching appearance of his career on August 20, 2007, against Milwaukee. He pitched one inning and gave up two walks and no runs while striking out one player, former Diamondback Craig Counsell. [...] "He's way nastier than I thought he would be," [...] said Bill Hall, who worked one of the walks. [...] "I was shocked <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up <b>there.</b> He's <b>got</b> a knuckleball, a slider, he was throwing some changeups. Those pitches make 84, 83 fastballs look pretty hard. I heard he was a better pitcher in college than he was a hitter." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to Salem, <b>there</b> {{was great}} joy, {{as you may}} suppose. [...] . Mother hinted an {{apprehension}} that poor baby would be spoilt, whereupon I irreverently observed that, having spoiled her own three children, it was natural for her to suppose that all other parents would do the same; when she averred {{that it was impossible}} to spoil such children as E---- and I, because she had never been able to do anything with us. [...] . I could hardly convince them that Una had begun to smile so soon. It surprised my mother, though her own children appear to have been bright specimens of babyhood.|$|R
5000|$|All Music Guide said in its review: “American Jerusalem and {{the title}} tune are thoughtful, pointed commentaries {{on the state of}} the union in 2012”. Performing Songwriter magazine, called Colvin's version of the song [...] "stunning", asked her [...] "Your cover choices, as always, are terrific. Was Rod MacDonald’s 'American Jerusalem' one you used to perform in the early days of your career?" [...] Colvin replied [...] "Yeah … forever ago. In the early 80s before I started writing I’d perform it in Greenwich Village at the Cottonwood Café. I think that song’s more {{reminiscent}} of the New York that I—for want of a better phrase—grew up in, in my 20s. It was a little bleaker. So that’s kind of a little snapshot of New York <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>got</b> <b>there</b> and didn’t know anybody and I was getting used to living in this … jungle. I’m so glad I finally recorded it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> old man Sterling and his outfit {{certainly}} laid {{themselves out}} to be agreeable.

6000|$|... "I should {{love to go}} to London, {{and have}} a good time, but I don't think I should care about {{spending}} ever so much money, or going to Court. Maybe I might <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> for I do like fun and splendor," [...] added honest Polly, feeling that pleasure was a very tempting thing.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{his career}} it was {{discovered}} that Roberts had seriously bad eyesight due to an accident when he was a child. [...] "I have real bad eyes," [...] Roberts said, [...] "I stabbed my eye with a knife <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a kid. I was goofing around with my jackknife. I kept it hidden because I wanted to be a ballplayer. I had bad focusing point in my right eye and bad depth perception in my left eye, but I kept it secret so I wouldn’t be released. I never told anyone that I had such bad vision in my right eye, not a manager, not a teammate, not anyone. When we had our physicals in spring training there would be a long line, just like a cattle call. I would sneak up and read the line they wanted us to read and memorize it. Then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up <b>there</b> I’d just recite what I’d memorized. No one ever figured it out. I would always force myself to really concentrate on reading the ball and tracking the ball." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just how}} I should feel," [...] Hiram Powlett said. [...] "Now a {{stranger}} {{who looked at}} The Hold would say what a pleasant, open-looking house it was; but when you took him inside, and told him what had happened there, it {{would be enough to}} give him the creeps. I believe it was being up there {{that was the beginning of}} my daughter's changing so. I never made a worse job of a thing than <b>I</b> did <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> her up <b>there</b> as Miss Carne's maid, and yet it was all for her good. And now, neighbours, it's my time to be off. It's a quarter to nine and that is five minutes later than usual." ...|$|R
5000|$|These {{amplifiers}} (collectively the 5150 series) {{and speaker}} cabinets {{were the result}} of a collaboration with Eddie Van Halen. The 5150 series was preceded by the VTM-60/VTM-120 amps, among the first [...] "non-hotrodded" [...] amps. The 5150 has gained popularity with modern hard rock, hardcore punk and metal bands and guitarists due to its large amount of distortion. Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains uses this amplifier. While touring with Van Halen, Cantrell asked Eddie Van Halen, [...] "if I could buy one off him {{at the end of the}} tour with them, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> home <b>there</b> were three full stacks and two guitars waiting for me." [...] In 2004, Peavey and Eddie Van Halen parted ways, with Eddie taking the 5150 brand name with him. This resulted in the renaming of the amplifier as the 'Peavey 6505', with slightly updated styling but original circuitry. The 5150 II, which contains an extra preamp tube for more headroom and gain on the Rhythm channel, is the old equivalent to the new 6505+. In 2010, Peavey released a new amplifier for the 6505 line, the 6534+. It is much like the 6505+, but the 6534 has EL34 power tubes instead of the 6L6 power tubes on the standard 6505 amplifiers.|$|R
