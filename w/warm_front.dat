5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a <b>warm</b> <b>front.</b> The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> is cooler than the cool air ahead of the <b>warm</b> <b>front,</b> and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the <b>warm</b> <b>front,</b> and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|A <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> {{can produce}} snow for a period, as warm, moist air {{overrides}} below-freezing air and creates precipitation at the boundary. Often, snow transitions to {{rain in the}} warm sector behind the front.|$|E
5|$|By early afternoon, the {{low-pressure}} {{area had}} moved east into Nebraska, while the <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> had moved northward into southern Minnesota. The atmosphere {{to the south}} of the <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> was strongly capped, meaning that the best chance of thunderstorm development was in areas along and slightly north of the front. By the time the thunderstorms started developing, CAPE values were 2000J/kg, indicating moderate atmospheric instability. Also present were low-level and deep-layer wind shear values of , respectively. All of these factors combined to create very favorable conditions for the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|The windfield of an extratropical cyclone constricts with {{distance}} {{in relation to}} surface level pressure, with the lowest pressure being found near the center, and the highest winds typically just on the cold/poleward side of <b>warm</b> <b>fronts,</b> occlusions, and cold fronts, where the pressure gradient force is highest. The area poleward and west of the cold and <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> connected to extratropical cyclones {{is known as the}} cold sector, while the area equatorward and east of its associated cold and <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> is known as the warm sector.|$|R
50|$|Ali {{started her}} career in 2005, when she {{released}} her first record <b>Warm</b> <b>Fronts</b> EP.|$|R
50|$|<b>Warm</b> <b>fronts</b> occur {{where the}} warm air pushes out a {{previously}} lodged cold air mass. The warm air overrides the cooler air and moves upward. <b>Warm</b> <b>fronts</b> are followed by extended periods of light rain and drizzle, because, after {{the warm air}} rises above the cooler air (which remains on the ground), it gradually cools due to the air's expansion while being lifted, which forms clouds and leads to precipitation.|$|R
5|$|The left {{edge of the}} {{conveyor}} belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of stratiform precipitation develops poleward of the <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> along {{the conveyor}} belt. Active precipitation poleward of the <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of the <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence {{as to whether or not}} this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E
5|$|Polar front {{theory is}} {{attributed}} to Jacob Bjerknes, and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the <b>warm</b> <b>front.</b> The trailing convergence zone {{was referred to as}} the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones. A conveyor belt, also referred to as the warm conveyor belt, is a term describing the flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within the warm sector (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface <b>warm</b> <b>front.</b> The concept of the conveyor belt originated in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Several {{clusters}} of thunderstorms {{developed during the}} morning from eastern Nebraska across Iowa into Illinois, taking place along a <b>warm</b> <b>front.</b> The front remained over the same areas during the day, as daytime heating and southwesterly surface winds brought warm and unstable air northward, resulting in severe weather development. The presence of strong winds aloft aided in development of multiple clusters and lines of thunderstorms that produced damaging wind, hail and tornadoes across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.|$|E
50|$|Graupel and hail {{indicate}} convection. In mid-latitudes, {{convective precipitation}} {{is associated with}} cold fronts (often behind the front), squall lines, and <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> in very moist air.|$|R
500|$|Cold fronts and {{occluded}} fronts generally {{move from}} west to east, while <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> move poleward. Because {{of the greater}} density of air in their wake, cold fronts and cold occlusions move faster than <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> and <b>warm</b> occlusions. Mountains and warm bodies of water can slow the movement of fronts. [...] When a front becomes [...] stationary, and the density contrast across the frontal boundary vanishes, the front can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind velocity, known as a shearline. [...] This is most common over the open ocean.|$|R
5|$|Rainbands are {{cloud and}} {{precipitation}} areas which are significantly elongated. Rainbands can be stratiform or convective, and are generated by differences in temperature. When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation {{is referred to}} as banded structure. Rainbands in advance of <b>warm</b> occluded <b>fronts</b> and <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> are associated with weak upward motion, and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature.|$|R
5|$|Warm fronts are at {{the leading}} edge of a {{homogeneous}} warm air mass, which is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface.|$|E
5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing the cold front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the <b>warm</b> <b>front.</b> This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|A warm {{seclusion}} is {{the mature}} {{phase of the}} extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was conceptualized after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model, as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones {{at the tail end}} of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E
5|$|Weather fronts {{mark the}} {{boundary}} between two masses of air of different temperature, humidity, and densities, and {{are associated with the}} most prominent meteorological phenomena. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Such fronts form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east; <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. <b>Warm</b> <b>fronts</b> move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle {{near the center of the}} cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.|$|R
500|$|In {{the warm}} season, lee troughs, breezes, outflow {{boundaries}} and occlusions {{can lead to}} convection if enough moisture is available. Orographic precipitation is precipitation created through the lifting action of air moving over terrain such as mountains and hills, which is most common behind cold fronts that move into mountainous areas. It may sometimes occur in advance of <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> moving northward {{to the east of}} mountainous terrain. However, precipitation along <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> is relatively steady, as in rain or drizzle. [...] Fog, sometimes extensive and dense, often occurs in pre-warm-frontal areas. [...] Although, not all fronts produce precipitation or even clouds because moisture must be present in the air mass which is being lifted.|$|R

5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} moved generally eastward from Oklahoma and produced heavy rains from Missouri to Ohio on February 8. By February 9, it had reached Kentucky. A new, secondary {{low pressure}} system formed over Georgia along the <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> {{associated with the}} primary low. As the secondary low matured along the U.S. East Coast, the initial center weakened rapidly, and heavy rainfall developed over the Carolinas in association with the new low. Mixed precipitation soon spread across the Mid-Atlantic States, and heavy snow began to fall from New Jersey northward by 1200 UTC on February 9.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where divergence ensues. The divergence causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the air column. As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at surface level (the weight of the air column) is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts to draw in air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, and therefore more difficult to dislodge. Later, the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the <b>warm</b> <b>front,</b> forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|E
5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the warm}} season, lee troughs, breezes, outflow {{boundaries}} and occlusions {{can lead to}} convection if enough moisture is available.

50|$|Cold fronts {{occur when}} {{a mass of}} cooler air dislodges a mass of warm air. This type of {{transition}} is sharper, since cold air is more dense than warm air. The rain duration is shorter, and generally more intense, than that which occurs ahead of <b>warm</b> <b>fronts.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the odd {{case when}} Breitenthal finds {{itself on the}} {{windward}} side of the Idar Forest, there can be prolonged rainfall and low cloud ceilings ahead of <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> {{as long as the}} wind is out of the south (between 150° and 210°) and the dew point spread is only slight.|$|R
5|$|After {{making its}} final Florida landfall, Allison rapidly weakened. Tropical storm force winds {{continued}} over the eastern Florida Panhandle until late that afternoon, {{as the storm}} moved northward into Georgia. It weakened to a tropical depression {{on the evening of}} June 5 over southern Georgia. Early on June 6, Allison began to transition into an extratropical storm as it interacted with a <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> to the northeast while tracking across the Carolinas. The remnant low emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Cape Hatteras that evening. It then raced across the western Atlantic, crossing the easternmost part of Nova Scotia on June 8 and Newfoundland on June 9. It continued northward across the Labrador Sea, dissipating on June 11.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} {{can bring}} mild weather {{with a little}} rain and surface winds of , or they can be cold and dangerous with torrential rain and winds exceeding , (sometimes referred to as windstorms in Europe). The band of precipitation {{that is associated with}} the <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> is often extensive. In mature extratropical cyclones, an area known as the comma head on the northwest periphery of the surface low can be a region of heavy precipitation, frequent thunderstorms, and thundersnows. Cyclones tend to move along a predictable path at a moderate rate of progress. During fall, winter, and spring, the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the troposphere to cause snowfall.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts may feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. <b>Warm</b> <b>fronts</b> are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, {{although there is}} invariably a wind shift.|$|R
2500|$|Altostratus is a mid-level opaque or {{translucent}} non-convective veil of grey/blue-grey {{cloud that}} often forms along <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> and around low-pressure areas. [...] Altostratus is usually composed of water droplets {{but may be}} mixed with ice crystals at higher altitudes. Widespread opaque altostratus can produce light continuous or intermittent precipitation. Precipitation commonly becomes heavier and more widespread if it thickens into nimbostratus.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of false}} return is {{relatively}} easy to spot on a time loop if it is due to night cooling or marine inversion as one sees very strong echoes developing over an area, spreading in size laterally but not moving and varying greatly in intensity. However, inversion of temperature exists ahead of <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> and the abnormal propagation echoes are then mixed with real rain.|$|R
5|$|In {{east central}} Florida, a warm sector, {{a region of}} warm surface air between a cold front and a <b>warm</b> <b>front,</b> was {{positioned}} ahead of a progressing cold front. Large scale lift {{was supported by a}} very strong jet stream aloft, with strong vertical shear evident, conducive for rotating thunderstorms and tornadoes. Instability increased overnight with temperatures and dew points increasing through the pre-dawn hours. For example, northwest of Orlando, temperatures were still at , which was about 3 degrees warmer than the average high for the day and 14 degrees warmer than the average low. The conditions helped to form a long-tracked supercell thunderstorm that traveled from Sumter County to the coastal waters of Volusia County during {{the early morning hours of}} February 2, 2007, producing three tornadoes along its track.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{system that}} caused the tornado had {{produced}} severe weather, including two weak tornadoes, in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey that morning. This was an unusual setup for a significant tornado, associated with a <b>warm</b> <b>front</b> near a low-pressure center. A thunderstorm cell formed south of Long Island around 10:20 am, and became a supercell sometime later after interacting with a surface low-pressure center. It turned north as a left-moving supercell, meaning it moved left {{with respect to the}} mean atmospheric flow. Left-moving supercells are very rare, as cyclonic storms usually turn {{to the right of the}} mean flow. It is unknown whether this leftward movement was due to an atmospheric interaction or terrain-induced movement, as the storm moved straight up the Connecticut River valley.|$|E
5|$|The symbols {{used for}} clouds emulate the cloud shape. Cirrus is {{indicated}} by a couple hooks, cumulus are indicated by a mound shape, with cumulonimbus indicated with an upside down trapezoid {{on top of the}} cumulus symbol to indicate its anvil. When {{there is more than one}} cloud type present per level, the cloud type with the highest priority is included. Knowing the cloud type at various locations can help determine whether or not a weather front has passed by a particular location. A low deck of stratus could indicate a station is still north of a <b>warm</b> <b>front,</b> while thunderstorms can indicate the approach of a squall line or cold front.|$|E

40|$|Many fronts {{over the}} UK {{do not fit}} the {{traditional}} conceptual model of a single maximum of vertical shear of the horizontal wind sloped over the cold air. A 2 -year climatology of 296 cold, <b>warm,</b> and occluded <b>fronts</b> from a mesosphere–stratosphere–troposphere radar near Aberystwyth, Wales, reveals that 74 % of <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> were associated with multiple linear bands representing maxima of vertical wind shear, radar return signal power, or both. In contrast, 51 % of cold fronts lacked any such maxima. Similarly, the warm frontal segments of occluded fronts exhibited more banding than the cold frontal segments.

5|$|Weather fronts. Significant shear is {{observed}} {{when the temperature}} difference across the front is 5°C (9°F) or more, and the front moves at 30 knots or faster. Because fronts are three-dimensional phenomena, frontal shear can be observed at any altitude between surface and tropopause, and therefore be seen both horizontally and vertically. Vertical wind shear above <b>warm</b> <b>fronts</b> {{is more of an}} aviation concern than near and behind cold fronts due to their greater duration.|$|R
