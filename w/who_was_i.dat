Kennan found his ambassadorship in Belgrade to be much improved from his experiences in Moscow a decade earlier. He commented, [...] "I was favored in being surrounded {{with a group of}} exceptionally able and loyal assistants, whose abilities I myself admired, whose judgment I valued, and whose attitude toward myself was at all times... enthusiastically cooperative... <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> to complain?" [...] Kennan found the Yugoslav government treated the American diplomats politely, in contrast from {{the way in which the}} Russians treated him in Moscow. He wrote that the Yugoslavs [...] "considered me, rightly or wrongly, a distinguished person in the U.S., and they were pleased that someone whose name they had heard before was being sent to Belgrade".|$|E
500|$|Erlewine {{commented that}} the [...] "Steven Meisel-shot cover... was as key to her reinvention as {{the music of the}} album itself." [...] William McKeen, author of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology, felt that the image was another trigger and {{testament}} to the fact that Madonna was the last word on fashion for women and young girls of that era, the epitome of cool. Costume designer Arianne Phillips commented of the Like a Virgin look: [...] "This {{was one of the most}} shocking, liberating and influential moments in pop culture/fashion history... Fashion has never been the same." [...] Madonna herself declared: [...] "I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> pretending to be—the Virgin Mary or the whore? These were the two extreme images of women I had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and I wanted to play with them. I wanted to see if I can merge them together, Virgin Mary and the whore as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome. But if you wanna be a whore, it's your fucking right to be so." ...|$|E

He appeared on the BBC's Wogan show, hosted by Terry Wogan, an event which McAvennie claims changed his life and introduced him to a celebrity lifestyle. He is quoted as saying [...] "Then I signed for West Ham and money and girls were thrown at me and, hey, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> to say no? Then I went on Wogan and it really took off. I was never under any illusions why it was happening. It wisnae because of my looks, it was because I was a footballer." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 1978 Forster's first {{recorded}} work was the group's debut single, [...] "Lee Remick", {{which appeared in}} September. It was a paean to the Hollywood actress of the same name. Forster later recalled [...] "I didn't have a girlfriend or any sort of romantic side to my life ... I {{wanted to write a}} love song. But <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> in love with? No-one. I had to find someone and I found Lee Remick". He also wrote the B-side, [...] "Karen", as an ode to the university's library staff, [...] "here was kindness in the library, then you walk out of the library into the harsh real world". Forster then wrote their second single, [...] "People Say". According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, both singles were [...] "sparsely produced, poorly played yet passionately performed folksy, post-punk pop songs. They were sunny, catchy and hopelessly romantic, earning the band immediate local and international acclaim".|$|E
