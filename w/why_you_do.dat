500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV in 2006, vocalist Taylor said that Come What(ever) May was {{a return to the}} roots of the band, stating it is [...] "a lot more from the spirit of what the band started with in 1992". He noted that some songs were [...] "very atmospheric" [...] while others maintained [...] "the hard rock and the heavy stuff". Jon Wiederhorn of MTV said that [...] "for every thrash riff there's a tunefully grungy passage, for every flailing guitar line there's a rock-radio hook." [...] When talking about the track [...] "30/30-150", he said parts are [...] "bludgeoning, barbed and heavy" [...] while others are [...] "soaring and triumphant" [...] with the production of Raskulinecz helping to balance the album's heaviness with its radio-accessibility. Come What(ever) Mays lyrics include themes of [...] "pain, pleasure, happiness, and grief". The diversity in subjects is evident throughout the album; songs including [...] "Come What(ever) May" [...] were politically influenced while the track [...] "Socio" [...] is about [...] "social anxiety attacks" [...] that Taylor suffered. [...] "Zzyzx Rd" [...] is a love song written to Taylor's wife for helping him in his struggles against alcoholism and contemplation of suicide. [...] "I've never written anything like that before, but it was very important for me to tell the world not only how much she saved me, but how much she means to me," [...] said Taylor. Taylor said there is a common thread with the lyrics throughout the album, saying that they are [...] "about never forgetting where you came from, who you are and <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> this." ...|$|E
