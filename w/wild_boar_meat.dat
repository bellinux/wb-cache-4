There is considerable {{evidence that the}} infection is also present in <b>wild</b> <b>boars.</b> <b>Meat</b> juice provides an alternative to serum for antibody testing, {{and it has been}} used in testing for many important porcine infectious diseases. Samples of brachial muscle were collected from 142 <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> shot in different regions of Poland during the 2006 / 2007 and 2007 / 2008 hunting seasons. Meat juice harvested from muscle samples was tested using an ELISA test specific for PCV 2 and PRRSV antibodies. Additionally, IgG and IgM antibodies specific for PCV 2 were detected in order to estimate the status of the PCV 2 infection. Only one of the tested meat juice samples was positive for PRRSV (0. 7 %), and 68 out of 142 (47. 9 %) samples were positive for PCV 2. Of the positive animals, 4 (2. 8 %) had an antibody profile suggesting active infection, 2 (1. 4 %) early active infection, and 62 (43. 7 %) late infection.

40|$|A {{reflection}} of highly prevalent endemic wildlife trichinellosis {{is seen in}} <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> farming in Finland. During the last five years, 0. 7 % (15 / 2265) of <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> undergoing official <b>meat</b> inspection have been determined to be Trichinella-positive. These findings originate from six different farms. In Finland, T. spiralis and T. pseudospiralis have been discovered in <b>meat</b> inspection of <b>wild</b> <b>boars.</b> ELISA showed 11 out of 9 9 serum samples (11 %) as having specific antibodies for T. spiralis crude antigen. Positive samples were from three out of the thirteen farms from which the sera were available. Most of the positive serum samples (8 / 11) originated from a farm where trichinellosis was also revealed in meat inspection, the other two seropositive farms were without previous Trichinella records. Over the last few decades, no reports have been made of human trichinellosis acquired in Finland. This indicates both efficient meat inspection as well as public awareness of high-risk foodstuff...|$|R

Sera from 656 hunter harvested <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> from 45 different geographical sites and 22  additional imported animals were analysed by means of an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). We also examined the tissues from 55 healthy and one diseased <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> for the presence of PCV 2 nucleic acid and PMWS lesions by in situ hybridisation and histopathology, respectively. Additionally, abundance estimates of <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> and field interviews were carried out on 30 sampling sites. The prevalence of medium to high PCV 2 serological titres among the examined <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> was 47. 89 ± 1. 9 %.
