5|$|The element, {{like other}} lanthanides, has no {{biological}} role. Promethium-147 can emit X-rays during its beta decay, which are dangerous for all lifeforms. Interactions <b>with</b> <b>tiny</b> quantities of promethium-147 are not hazardous if certain precautions are observed. In general, gloves, footwear covers, safety glasses, and an outer layer of easily removed protective clothing should be used.|$|E
5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} <b>with</b> <b>tiny,</b> two-fingered {{hands and}} a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may {{have been at the}} top of the food chain in its local ecosystem. While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E
5|$|In most amphibians, {{there are}} four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some {{salamanders}} have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in appearance <b>with</b> <b>tiny,</b> stubby legs. The sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow {{in the manner of}} earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.|$|E

5|$|Somewhere between 100 and 200 {{million years}} after the Serenitatis basin and Taurus–Littrow formed, the lavas that began to seep through the lunar crust began to flood the low-lying areas. These lava flows were often {{accompanied}} by fire fountains that blanketed the surrounding area <b>with</b> <b>tiny</b> glass beads. These beads were sometimes colored orange, explaining the orange soil discovered by the Apollo 17 astronauts at Shorty crater. Most of these beads, however, were darkly colored, resulting in the dark appearance of the Serenitatis basin from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Spores are spherical, hyaline (translucent), {{and measure}} 2.5–3.4μm in diameter. They are {{thick-walled}} {{with a short}} pedicel (a tubelike extension), and are ornamented <b>with</b> <b>tiny</b> spines (verrucae) that are roughly equidistant from each other. Capillitial threads are long, hyaline, and branched, measuring 2.4–4μm thick. They are septate and occasionally have pits on their walls. The exoperidium comprises thick-walled, inflated hyphae mixed with sphaerocysts (spherical cells), while the endoperidium is made of tightly interwoven, thick-walled hyphae. In the rhizomorphs, the hyphae in the central core are several times as thick {{as those in the}} surrounding subcortex.|$|E

5|$|Animaniacs, along <b>with</b> <b>Tiny</b> Toon Adventures, {{continued}} to rerun in syndication through the 1990s {{into the early}} 2000s after production of new episodes ceased. In the US, Animaniacs aired on Cartoon Network, originally as a one-off airing on January 31, 1997, {{and then on the}} regular schedule from August 31, 1998 until the spring of 2001, when Nickelodeon bought the rights to air the series beginning on September 1, 2001. Nickelodeon transferred the series to its newly launched sister channel Nicktoons on May 1, 2002, and aired there until July 7, 2005. Animaniacs started airing on Hub Network with a 4-hour marathon on December 24, 2012 and aired regularly from January 7, 2013 until October 10, 2014 before it was rebranded Discovery Family.|$|E
5|$|Hapalopilus nidulans (also {{known as}} Hapalopilus rutilans) is {{a species of}} polypore fungus in the family Polyporaceae. Officially {{described}} in 1821, it was transferred to its current genus Hapalopilus six decades later. It {{is commonly known as}} the tender nesting polypore, purple dye polypore, or the cinnamon bracket. This widely distributed species is found on five continents. It grows on the fallen or standing dead wood of deciduous trees, in which it fruits singly, in groups, fused, or in overlapping clusters. Fruit bodies are in the form of kidney-shaped to semicircular, cinnamon-orange-brown brackets. The underside of the fruit body features a yellowish to brownish pore surface <b>with</b> <b>tiny</b> angular pores, from which spores are released.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of the wings <b>with</b> <b>tiny</b> muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E

5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed <b>with</b> <b>tiny</b> figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E
5|$|Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. {{was born}} in Quincy, Illinois, on 23 February 1915, the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets Sr. and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he {{was five years old}} the family moved to Davenport, Iowa, and then to Iowa's capital, Des Moines, where he was raised, and where his father became a {{confections}} wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to Hialeah, Florida, to escape from harsh midwestern winters. As a boy he was very interested in flying. One day his mother agreed to pay one dollar to get him into an airplane at the local carnival. In 1927, when he was 12 years old, he flew in a plane piloted by barnstormer Doug Davis, dropping candy bars <b>with</b> <b>tiny</b> parachutes to the crowd of people attending the races at the Hialeah Park Race Track.|$|E

5|$|The mature {{mycelium}} {{consists of}} thin-walled, densely packed hyphae that are 1.5–3.2µm in diameter. They are often gnarled or somewhat spiral (subhelicoid), and frequently branched {{at an angle}} of about 45°, with a clamp {{at the base of}} the branch. They contain amorphous granules that appear refractive when viewed under phase contrast microscopy, and their walls are often encrusted <b>with</b> <b>tiny</b> granules. Gloeocystidia (thin-walled cystidia with refractive, frequently granular contents) are common; they measure 50–85 by 6.5–8.5µm, and are club-shaped (sometimes elongated), thin-walled, and often have one or two lobes with rounded tips. Containing foamy and pale yellow contents, they are a refractive yellow color under phase contrast. Initially they are erect but they soon fall under their own weight to lie on the agar surface. Crystalline deposits are abundant as small, randomly scattered plate-like or star-like crystals.|$|E
5|$|Throughout their travels {{they studied}} art and visited churches and museums, which appealed to Bauer's eclectic mind. In the evenings {{they went to}} small tavernas to enjoy the ambiance; {{all of which is}} {{recorded}} in the letters they sent home to Bauer's family. Bauer's sketchbooks are full of studies of antique objects and Renaissance art, some of which he used for his illustrations. A portrait of Ghirlandaio by Sandro Botticelli {{is said to be the}} basis for Svanhamnen (The Swan maiden), and Piero della Francesca's work was the inspiration for Den helige Martin (Saint Martin, the Holy). He also became intrigued by frescoes. He was exuberant in the study of art, but he also became homesick for the quiet serenity of the Swedish forest which resulted in some of his best winter pictures with white snow, dark woods and the sky glittering <b>with</b> <b>tiny</b> stars.|$|E
5|$|Female banded sugar ants {{are easily}} {{recognised}} by their black head, orange thorax and the orange-brown band that wraps around their gaster. Males {{of the species}} are completely black. The dark sides of the thorax and legs are ferruginous (rusty in colour). The scape (the base of the antenna) and mandibles are black, and the head is wider than the thorax. The thorax is longer than its total width and slightly compressed, and the gaster is covered <b>with</b> <b>tiny</b> black dots. Erect setae are golden in colour and absent under the head but present on the mesosoma. The setae on the tibia and scape are shorter than those on the mesosoma. The anterior of the gaster is lighter in colour compared to the posterior, and the dorsum of the mesosoma is outlined and curved. A worker's metanotum is absent and the eyes are bulging, while a soldier's metanotum is noticeable and the eyes are flat. The wings on the queen are dark, and the stigmata and nerves are yellow. While many ant species have a metapleural gland, the gland is not present in the banded sugar ant; the number of malpighian tubules in workers is 21.|$|E
