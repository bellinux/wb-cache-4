5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of humans, an {{estimated}} 80% of the land <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> forest, with only high alpine, wet, infertile and volcanic areas without trees. Massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived, with around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian settlement. Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement, being logged or cleared {{to make room for}} pastoral farming, leaving forest occupying only 23% of the land.|$|E
5|$|Both events, not {{connected}} publicly for several weeks, caused the curious {{to visit the}} website ilovebees.com. The site, which appeared to be dedicated to honey sales and beekeeping, <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> confusing random characters and sentence fragments. Dana, the ostensible webmaster of the ilovebees site, created a weblog stating that something had gone wrong with her website, and the site itself had been hacked. Suspecting {{that this was a}} mystery that could be unraveled, Halo and ARG fans spread the link and began to work on figuring out what was going on.|$|E

5|$|Everybody {{had thought}} St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, with its thick stone walls and natural {{firebreak}} {{in the form}} of a wide, empty surrounding plaza. It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row. However, an enormous stroke of bad luck meant that the building <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> wooden scaffolding, undergoing piecemeal restoration by a relatively unknown Christopher Wren. The scaffolding caught fire on Tuesday night.|$|E

5|$|In December 1989, Lexus {{initiated}} a voluntary recall of all 8,000 LS 400s based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated brake light. A 20-day operation {{to replace the}} parts on affected vehicles included technicians to pick up, repair and return cars to customers free of charge, and also flying personnel and renting garage space for owners in remote locations. This response <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> media publications and helped establish the marque's early reputation for customer service.|$|E
5|$|In the Carnian {{stage of}} the Late Triassic (228.0 - 216.5 Mya), capitosauroids were joined by the superficially very similar Metoposauridae. Metoposaurids are {{distinguished}} from capitosauroids by the positioning of their eye sockets {{near the front of}} their skulls. Another group of stereospondyls, the plagiosaurs, had wide heads with external gills, and adapted to life at the bottom of lakes and rivers. By this time, temnospondyls had become a common and widespread component of semiaquatic ecosystems. Some temnospondyls, such as Cryobatrachus and Kryostega, even inhabited Antarctica, which <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> temperate forests at the time.|$|E
5|$|More than 170million years ago, Antarctica {{was part}} of the supercontinent Gondwana. Over time, Gondwana {{gradually}} broke apart and Antarctica {{as we know it today}} was formed around 25million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.|$|E

5|$|Several game {{websites}} {{were outraged}} at Nintendo's decision. Though disappointed with Nintendo's decision, McMillen {{did not think}} {{the loss of the}} 3DS port was a major issue, and saw a brief sales burst on Steam as the news <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> gaming website. McMillen further praised the flexibility of the Steam platform, which does not require games to obtain ESRB ratings to be published on the service, and the freedom it gave to the publishers regardless of the game content.|$|E
5|$|The Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone, {{from where}} Euchambersia is known, {{represents}} a floodplain that <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> many small, relatively straight streams. The water level in these streams was probably seasonally dependent. Judging from pollen {{preserved in the}} Cistecephalus AZ, the pollen taxon Pityosporites (which probably originated from a plant similar to Glossopteris) was very common, forming some 80% to 90% of the pollen discovered (although the prevalent sediments {{would not have been}} ideal for pollen preservation).|$|E
5|$|The battle <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> detail by Time, and Arafat's face {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} the 13 December 1968 issue, bringing his image to the world for the first time. Amid the post-war environment, the profiles of Arafat and Fatah were raised by this important turning point, and he came to be regarded as a national hero who dared to confront Israel. With mass applause from the Arab world, financial donations increased significantly, and Fatah's weaponry and equipment improved. The group's numbers swelled as many young Arabs, including thousands of non-Palestinians, joined the ranks of Fatah.|$|E
