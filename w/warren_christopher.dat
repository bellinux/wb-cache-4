Under pressure from the United States, the belligerents agreed on a truce in late February, followed by a meeting of Croatian, Bosnian, and Bosnian Croat representatives with US Secretary of State <b>Warren</b> <b>Christopher</b> in Washington, D.C. on February 26, 1994. On March 4, Franjo Tuđman endorsed the agreement providing for the creation of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and an alliance between Bosnian and Croatian armies against the Serb forces.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{official}} police and security sector discussions, the U.S. was undertaking some independent training and equipment donations, though the programs—mainly organized by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)—were not explicitly detailed to the international community. Lia writes that covert contacts and counter-terrorism collaboration between the PLO and the CIA had been ongoing in the 1970s and throughout the Lebanese Civil War in the 1980s but were not favored in the Reagan and Bush administrations. After the Oslo accords, the Clinton Administration revived covert ties and intelligence training. In January 1994 media sources reported that PLO officials and bodyguards were traveling to the U.S. to receive training {{as a result of}} an agreement between Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State <b>Warren</b> <b>Christopher.</b> Publicly, the U.S. was ambivalent regarding support for police and security sector activities. The Gaza–Jericho Agreement between the PLO and Israel signed on May 4, 1994 increased U.S. interest in coordinating public international efforts to fund the PLO police who were to deploy into Gaza and Jericho. The day after the treaty was signed, the U.S. announced a $5 million grant for the PLO police and they worked to encourage other nations to donate flexible funds for the same purpose.|$|E

500|$|Little {{known before}} the {{nomination}} (Clinton had not met her until their interview), Baird was a skilled networker {{who had been}} the protégé of several powerful Washington insiders, including Clinton transition team leader <b>Warren</b> <b>Christopher</b> and once-and-future White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler. [...] Picking Baird gave Clinton the ability to satisfy the women's groups' desires while still showing independence by not choosing one of their preferred selections. [...] Despite the lack of familiarity and getting a lukewarm response from some Clinton backers – those in the legal public interest community said [...] "Zoë who?" [...] and her corporate sympathies discouraged liberals – Baird was expected to gain confirmation in the U.S. Senate.

500|$|There {{was also}} a real Dayton out there, a charming Ohio city, famous as {{the birthplace of the}} Wright brothers. Its {{citizens}} energized us from the outset. Unlike the population of, say, New York City, Geneva or Washington, which would scarcely notice another conference, Daytonians were proud to be part of history. Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the [...] "temporary center of international peace". The local newspapers and television stations covered the story from every angle, drawing the people deeper into the proceedings. When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown, people crowded around, saying that they were praying for us. <b>Warren</b> <b>Christopher</b> was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant. Families on the air base placed [...] "candles of peace" [...] in their front windows, and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base. One day they formed a [...] "peace chain", although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight-thousand-acre base. Ohio's famous ethnic diversity was on display.|$|E
50|$|A genuine {{crisis in}} transatlantic {{relations}} blew up over Bosnia.

US Secretary of State <b>Warren</b> <b>Christopher's</b> campaign {{to lift the}} embargo was rebuffed by Major and President Mitterrand in May 1993. After the so-called 'Copenhagen ambush' in June 1993, where Clinton 'ganged up' with Chancellor Kohl to rally the European Community against the peacekeeping states, Major {{was said to be}} contemplating the death of the special relationship.
