5|$|Investigators {{immediately}} began to question Sharon Kinne, James Boldizs, and Walter Jones. All three were questioned on May 28. Jones and Boldizs both gave <b>written</b> <b>statements</b> admitting to have been dating Sharon Kinne and both agreed to lie detector tests; Kinne gave an oral statement to police but declined to sign a written one or take a lie detector test.

Kinne's brother Eugene was also questioned on May 31, but declined to answer questions.|$|E
5|$|The McMahon Act that {{established}} the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) required all employees holding wartime security clearances {{issued by the}} Manhattan Project to be investigated by the FBI and re-certified. This provision had come {{in the wake of}} the February 16, 1946, defection of Igor Gouzenko in Canada, and the subsequent arrest of 22 people. President Harry S. Truman appointed Oppenheimer to the AEC General Advisory Committee (GAC) on December 10, 1946, so the FBI interviewed two dozen of Oppenheimer's associates, including Robert Bacher, Ernest Lawrence, Enrico Fermi and Robert Gordon Sproul. Groves and the Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson supplied <b>written</b> <b>statements</b> supporting Oppenheimer. AEC chairman David Lilienthal and Vannevar Bush discussed the matter with Truman's sympathetic aide Clark Clifford at the White House. They found John Lansdale, Jr. particularly persuasive; he had interrogated Oppenheimer over the Chevalier incident in 1943, and strongly supported him. On August 11, 1947, they unanimously voted to grant Oppenheimer a Q clearance. At the first meeting of the GAC on January 3, 1947, Oppenheimer was unanimously elected its chairman.|$|E

25|$|While in Securitate custody, {{the former}} Jewish Commissioner was {{subjected}} to several inquiries. His <b>written</b> <b>statements</b> were kept under key, in special files. Romanian-born Israeli historian Jean Ancel presumes that the Securitate had vested interest in allowing Lecca to produce a personal version of Romania's World War II history. The Securitate, Ancel notes, shared Lecca's goal of shifting focus from Romania's Holocaust complicity.|$|E

25|$|The nocturne {{series was}} {{limited by the}} {{difficulties}} posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.e., at night. The first painting in the series was Café Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night Over the Rhone later that same month. Van Gogh's <b>written</b> <b>statements</b> concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.|$|E

25|$|Waldheim was {{appointed}} again in 1976 despite some opposition. Waldheim and then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter both prepared <b>written</b> <b>statements</b> for inclusion on the Voyager Golden Records, now in deep space. He {{was the first}} Secretary-General to visit North Korea, in 1979. In 1980, Waldheim flew to Iran {{in an attempt to}} negotiate the release of the American hostages held in Tehran, but Ayatollah Khomeini refused to see him. While in Tehran, it was announced that an attempt on Waldheim's life had been foiled. Near the end of his tenure as Secretary-General, Waldheim and Paul McCartney organized a series of concerts for the People of Kampuchea to help Cambodia recover from the damage done by Pol Pot.|$|E
25|$|Croydon is {{also home}} to three single-sex Catholic state schools. The {{formerly}} independent John Fisher School in Purley has not charged fees since the late 1970s, but during the 1990s was selective, choosing boys via exams, interviews, tests, previous school reports and <b>written</b> <b>statements.</b> The school ended its selection policy in 1999, and now accepts pupils under a points system, which discriminates in favour of those who have high mass attendance and whose families are most involved in the Catholic Church. Coloma Convent Girls' School is one of England's Catholic girls' schools: formerly a grammar school, it has now, like John Fisher, adopted points-based admission criteria. St. Joseph's College, located on Beulah Hill in Upper Norwood, is a boys' school with a mixed sixth form.|$|E
25|$|In the 1957 case Jencks v. United States the United States Supreme Court {{ruled that}} a {{defendant}} must have access to government witnesses who will testify against him in a criminal trial, and must also have access to any documents pertaining to that testimony. This includes papers, documents, <b>written</b> <b>statements</b> and the like. This led to passage of the Jencks Act, 18 USC, Part II, Chapter 223, § 3500, which allows for subpoena duces tecum of relevant government documents, but only after a government agent or employee has testified at trial. There can be no pre-trial discovery. The subpoena is allowed by the trial judge. The government {{has the right to}} deny access to the documents. This {{may be due to the}} sensitive nature of the documents, or because they are classified.|$|E

25|$|Qutb was let out {{of prison}} {{at the end of}} 1964 {{at the behest of the}} Prime Minister of Iraq, Abdul Salam Arif, for only 8 months before being rearrested in August 1965. He was accused of {{plotting}} to overthrow the state and subjected to what some consider a show trial. Many of the charges placed against Qutb in court were taken directly from Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq and he adamantly supported his <b>written</b> <b>statements.</b> The trial culminated in a death sentence for Qutb and six other members of the Muslim Brotherhood. He was sentenced to death for his part in the conspiracy to assassinate the President and other Egyptian officials and personalities, though he was not the instigator or leader of the actual plot. On 29 August 1966, he was executed by hanging.|$|E
25|$|Such was the Duke's unpopularity by {{this time}} that Felton was widely {{acclaimed}} as a hero by the public. A large number of poems celebrating Felton and justifying his action were published. Copies of <b>written</b> <b>statements</b> Felton carried in his hat during the assassination were also widely circulated. Many of these described Buckingham as effeminate, cowardly and corrupt, and contrasted him with Felton, who was held up {{as an example of}} manliness, courage and virtue. The son of Alexander Gill the Elder was sentenced to a fine of £2000 and the removal of his ears, after being overheard drinking to the health of Felton, and stating that Buckingham had joined King James I in hell. However, these punishments were remitted after his father and Archbishop Laud appealed to King Charles I. Felton was hanged on 29 November and his body was taken to Portsmouth for public display. However, this proved to be a miscalculation by the authorities as it became an object of veneration by the public.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{also changed}} the court rules on the {{submission}} of evidence. The Civil Justice Review {{found that many}} cases which {{could easily have been}} settled before the hearings in court were not, primarily because there was no way of assessing the strength of the other side's arguments and their evidence. The Civil Justice Review suggested that forcing parties to provide evidence and witness statements to the other side before the case came to court would make this assessment easier, and would lead to the parties settling their case before it came to court if one side was at an obvious disadvantage. This suggestion was accepted, and included in the Act, which says that each party must produce <b>written</b> <b>statements</b> of any oral evidence they intend to present in court, and that these statements should be given to the other party before the case comes to court. Any party who fails to comply with this may be refused leave to present this oral evidence in court. A similar system had been used in the Chancery Division, Admiralty Court and Commercial Court since 1986.|$|E
