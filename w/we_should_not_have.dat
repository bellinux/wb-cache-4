Wenger commented afterwards: [...] "People say <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> come into this competition, but we have not got the final the easy way – we have played 14 games to get this far." ...|$|E
500|$|Emily Eavis, the {{organiser}} of the festival, {{said she}} was honoured Jay-Z was headlining the event saying: [...] "He is absolutely the right act for our festival," [...] she said. [...] "There {{is no reason why}} <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the greatest living hip-hop artist on at Glastonbury." [...] Eavis also cited that Jay-Z was far from the first hip-hop artist to appear at Glastonbury. the Roots, Cypress Hill, and De La Soul had all previously performed at the Glastonbury Festival.|$|E
500|$|Wenger apologised for his team’s behaviour: [...] "I feel <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> reacted at all. Overall we are {{sorry for}} what happened. When you do not behave like you want to, {{then you have to}} apologise." [...] He had no regrets over his team {{selection}} and suggested {{it was part of the}} player's learning process. Wenger said of Walcott: [...] "…he had a very good performance and scored a great goal. That is good for us and good news for England." [...] Gilberto Silva described Arsenal’s defeat as a “sad memory” and wanted to use the loss to motivate the team for their coming matches.|$|E

[...] The few specimens which we have selected of his ethics and his criticism are more than sufficient to prove that Mr. Hazlitt's knowledge of Shakespeare and the English language is exactly {{on a par with the}} purity of his morals and the depth of his understanding.|$|E
500|$|Saint-Gaudens {{originally}} conceived {{a flying}} eagle {{design for the}} cent, but at Roosevelt's request, developed it for the double eagle after learning that by law, an eagle could not appear on the cent. [...] Writer and friend Witter Bynner recalled that in , Saint-Gaudens was seriously ill with cancer, and was carried to his studio for ten minutes a day to critique {{the work of his}} assistants on current projects, including the cent. Saint-Gaudens sent Roosevelt a design in February for the obverse of the cent showing a figure of Liberty. [...] Roosevelt suggested the addition of a Native American war bonnet, stating, [...] "I don't see why <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a conventional head-dress of purely American type for the Liberty figure." [...] In , Roosevelt instructed that the Indian design be developed for the eagle instead. [...] Saint-Gaudens was by then in declining health; he died on , 1907, without having submitted another design for the cent.|$|E

He said after the release that [...] "I deeply regret the blasts.

Then, {{an end to the}} war in favour of our allies, civilized countries with democratic traditions, would have meant a hundred times less suffering for our people than that which Stalin again inflicted on it after his victory." ...|$|E
2500|$|Senator Dorgan {{was one of}} {{only eight}} members of the Senate to vote against the repeal of key {{provisions}} of the Glass-Steagall Act (contained in the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act) in 1999. During debate on that 1999 legislation, in a speech on the Senate floor, he said that, [...] "it will in my judgement raise the likelihood of future massive taxpayer bailouts" [...] (cited in John Lanacaster, Whoops, London, 2010, p.161). On September 26, 2008, against a backdrop of growing economic turmoil caused by the Credit Crunch, David Leonhardt of The New York Times singled out a quotation made by Dorgan in 1999 during the US Senate's repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act. [...] "I think we will look back in 10 years’ time and say <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done this, but we did because we forgot the lessons of the past, and that that which is true in the 1930s is true in 2010." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{authenticity}} of the documents was challenged within hours on Internet forums and blogs, with questions initially focused on alleged anachronisms in the documents' typography. [...] Content soon spread to the mass media. Although CBS and Rather defended the authenticity and usage of the documents for a two-week period, continued scrutiny from other news organizations and independent analysis of the documents obtained by USA Today and CBS raised questions about their validity {{and led to a}} public repudiation on September 20, 2004. Rather stated, [...] "if I knew then what I know now – I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question," [...] and CBS News President Andrew Heyward said, [...] "Based on what we now know, CBS News cannot prove that the documents are authentic, which is the only acceptable journalistic standard to justify using them in the report. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> used them.

2500|$|On August 15, 2011, Schultz used an edited {{video clip}} of Texas Governor Rick Perry {{at a rally}} talking about the {{national}} debt crisis. Governor Perry said [...] "getting America back to work {{is the most important}} issue that faces this country, being able to pay off $14.5 trillion or $16 trillion worth of debt. That big black cloud that hangs over America, that debt that is so monstrous." [...] The audio of the clip was cut off after [...] "America", so Schultz's audience did not hear [...] "that debt that is so monstrous". Governor Perry refers to the debt before and after the [...] "big black cloud" [...] statement. Schultz said, [...] "That black cloud Perry is talking about is President Barack Obama." [...] The following day on his TV show Schultz apologized for taking Governor Perry out of context. [...] "We did not present the full context of those statements and we should have ...

[...] Mr. Striker bore his recalcitrant pupil a grudge, but he was evidently trying both to be fair and to respect the susceptibilities of his companions. But he was unversed in the mysterious processes of feminine emotion. Ten minutes before, there had been a general harmony of sombre views; but on hearing Roderick's limitations thus distinctly formulated to a stranger, the two ladies mutely protested. Mrs. Hudson uttered a short, faint sigh, and Miss Garland raised her eyes toward their advocate and visited him with a short, cold glance.|$|R
