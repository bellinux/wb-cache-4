It began by managing South-east Australian plantations of Pinus radiata, but in 1992 shifted to Eucalytus plantations for woodchip production, dealing in blue gum <b>woodlot</b> investments. Through the 1990s it developed its plantation business in south western Western Australia including the Great Southern region (after which the company is named), leasing woodlots to investors on land owned by Great Southern.

Over {{the period from}} 2005 through to 2012, 253 <b>woodlots</b> at 170 sites were sampled {{as part of a}} large multidisciplinary project, resulting in a substantial timber inventory database. The inventory was undertaken to provide information for three separate but interrelated studies, namely (1) tree growth, performance and timber availability from private smallholder <b>woodlots</b> on Leyte Island; (2) tree growth and performance of mixed-species plantings of native species; and (3) the assessment of reforestation outcomes from various forms of reforestation. A common procedure for establishing plots within each site was developed and applied in each study, although the basis of site selection varied. A two-stage probability proportion to size sampling framework was developed to select smallholder <b>woodlots</b> for inclusion in the inventory. In contrast, community-based forestry <b>woodlots</b> were selected using stratified random sampling. Challenges encountered in undertaking the inventory were mostly associated with the need to consult widely before the commencement of the inventory and problems in identifying <b>woodlots</b> for inclusion. Most smallholder <b>woodlots</b> were only capable of producing merchantable volumes of less than 44 % of the site potential {{due to a lack of}} appropriate silviculture. There was a clear bimodal distribution of proportion that the <b>woodlots</b> comprised of the total smallholding area.

We surveyed 35 transects located along secondary roads. Bird pest abundance was significantly higher at those sites with presence of <b>woodlots</b> (p< 0. 0001).

Most bird pest species in the study area are more sensitive to the presence of <b>woodlots</b> rather than to the presence of croplands in the rural landscape.

40|$|Growing {{of trees}} as <b>woodlots</b> on farms {{for five to}} seven years in {{rotation}} with crops was considered as a potential technology to overcome the shortage of wood, which is a common problem to many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The paper summarizes the results of trials conducted at Tabora and Shinyanga in northwestern Tanzania on rotational <b>woodlots,</b> to evaluate tree species for wood production and yields of maize grown in association with and after harvest of trees. On acid sandy soils at Tabora, Acacia crassicarpa A. Cunn. ex Benth. grew fast and produced 24 to 77 Mg ha(- 1) of wood in four to five years. On alkaline Vertisols at Shinyanga, seven years old <b>woodlots</b> of Acacia polyacantha Willd. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit. produced 71 and 89 Mg ha(- 1) of wood, respectively. Intercropping of maize between trees was possible for two years without sacrificing its yield. The first maize crop following A. crassicarpa <b>woodlots</b> gave 29 to 113 % greater yield than the crop after natural fallow. Acacia polyacantha and L. leucocephala <b>woodlots</b> also increased the subsequent maize yields over a three-year period. The increase in crop yields after <b>woodlots</b> was attributed partly to accumulation of greater amounts of inorganic N in the topsoil compared to the traditional fallow, and partly to other effects. Thus medium-term rotational <b>woodlots</b> are likely to contribute to meet the wood requirements of rural people and thereby help protect the natural woodlands in sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R

Great Southern would deduct management fees from the final sale value. A typical forestry investment in the early 2000s involved an initial payment of $3000 for one-third of a hectare <b>woodlot,</b> yielding a $2900 tax deduction at that time. Returns on harvesting depended on many variables; Great Southern forecast that investors would recoup their original investment and a further return of between $1923 and $4569 per <b>woodlot,</b> however early schemes did not achieve these figures on the basis of the timber sales, with some resulting in woodchip sales of only around A$1500, half the value of what was originally invested.

40|$|Forest {{fragmentation}} {{is thought}} to be partially responsible for declines in many Neotropical migrant birds due to the combined effects of higher rates of brood parasitism and increased predation near forest edges. A majority of the forested habitat in the northern prairie region is found in riparian corridors, but this native habitat has been much reduced from its historical extent. However, additional woodland nesting habitat has been established within the last century in the form of isolated <b>woodlots</b> on farms. We compared abundance, species richness, and nesting success of migrant forest birds breeding in native riparian corridors and anthropogenic <b>woodlots.</b> The two habitats had similar bird abundances but native riparian woodlands were more species-rich than <b>woodlots.</b> We located a total of 650 nests, with 320 nests of 15 species in <b>woodlots</b> and 331 nests of 25 species in riparian corridors. Nesting success was not significantly different between the two habitats for all species combined or for individual species with ≥ 15 nests in each habitat. Nests above 5 m were more successful than lower nests, but distance to woodland edge did not influence nesting success. Nests initiated in the middle and late portions of the nesting season were more successful than early season nests, significantly so in <b>woodlots.</b> Thus, anthropogenic <b>woodlots</b> were as suitable as natural habitats for successful nesting. However, many of the Neotropical migrants occurring in riparian habitats were absent from <b>woodlots,</b> which suggests that riparian corridors are especially important habitats for breeding birds in the northern prairie region...|$|R

Gambier has a small resident population, plus hundreds more who enjoy the SW peninsula community in the summer months. This area has a year-round foot ferry, the Stormaway IV, run by BC Ferries, and a community centre. Until recently, the only commercial location on the island, the General Store, was located here, near New Brighton, where the ferry lands. The store is now closed. This area of Gambier has landline power and telephone. There also are numerous seasonal homes line the shores of the southern bays (West Bay, Centre Bay, Port Graves, and Halkett Bay) along with several local yacht club outstations in both the southern and northern parts of the island.

40|$|Despite a trend {{during the}} last century towards a {{disconnection}} between agriculture and forestry, small <b>woodlots</b> strongly associated to farming activities are still very common in south western France. To explain {{the origin of this}} particularity and its consequences, we engaged ethnological, biotechnical and ecological studies. The ethnological study showed that the ‘house-centred’ social system - which is characteristic in this region - has shaped landscapes and reinforced the need for scattered small <b>woodlots.</b> Due to a principle of self-sufficiency, each farm had to have a direct access on its property or in its vicinity to all the resources needed. <b>Woodlots</b> had been maintained on lands that might have been cultivated and they contain a large diversity of woody species - even in the dominant tree layer - corresponding to the species needed for the family uses. Even if they are less able to apply all the usual practices, small <b>woodlots</b> are still seen by farmers as important components of their resources and landscapes. Their management lead to a particularly fine-grained mosaic of stands with different historical trajectories. Ecological studies revealed that these <b>woodlots,</b> and especially their edges, are key components of processes impacting agricultural activities, such as pest regulation. We argue that the small <b>woodlots</b> maintained in rural landscapes in south western France are beneficial for agriculture, forestry and rural activities, especially in a global change perspective.

40|$|AbstractPerennial plant {{communities}} in the proximity of metal smelters and refineries may receive substantial inputs of base metal particulate as well as sulphate from the co-emission of sulphur dioxide. The Ni refinery at Port Colborne (Canada) operated by Inco (now Vale Canada Ltd.) emitted Ni, Co and Cu, along with sulphur dioxide, between 1918 and 1984. The objectives were to determine if vascular plant community composition, including standing litter, in twenty-one <b>woodlots</b> on clay or organic soil, were related to soil Ni concentration which decreased in concentration with distance from the Ni refinery. The soil Ni concentration in the clay <b>woodlots</b> ranged from 16 to 4130  mg Ni/kg, and in the organic <b>woodlots,</b> ranged from 98 to 22, 700  mg Ni/kg. The concentrations of Co and Cu in the soils were also elevated, and highly correlated with soil Ni concentration. In consequence, each series of <b>woodlots</b> constituted a ‘fixed ratio ray’ of metal mixture exposure. For each of the <b>woodlots,</b> there were 16 independent measurements of ‘woodlot status’ which were correlated with elevated soil Ni concentration. Of the 32 combinations, there were eight linear correlations with soil Ni concentration, considerably more than would be expected by chance alone at a p-value of 0. 05. With the exception of mean crown rating for shrubs at the clay sites, the correlations {{were consistent with the}} hypothesis that increased soil metal concentrations would be correlated with decreased diversity, plant community health or fitness, and increased accumulation of litter. Only five of the eight linear correlations were from the organic <b>woodlots,</b> suggesting that the observations were not confounded with soil type nor range in soil metal concentrations...|$|R
