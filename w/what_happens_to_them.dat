500|$|StarClan is a {{group of}} the Clans' {{deceased}} ancestors who give guidance to the Clans. After death, most Clan cats join StarClan. StarClan is said to be represented by Silverpelt, and each individual star represents the spirit of a single dead warrior. Upon joining StarClan, the cats' spirits take the form in which they were most happy while living (i.e. blindness and deafness can be cured).StarClan Warriors, elders, deputies, queens, and kits keep watch over the Clans, usually watching the Clan they lived in while alive. They provide guidance to the Clans, often through dreams and other signs like omens. Often, this occurs when medicine cats go to the Moonstone, a large piece of quartz in an abandoned mine, which is used in the forest territory to communicate with the medicine and leader cats' ancestors every half-moon. This is later replaced by the Moonpool, a small body of water from which cats can drink from in order to communicate with StarClan. In an author chat, Hunter said that StarClan can [...] "just get glimpses of" [...] the future, which they occasionally pass on, although these visions tend to be convoluted and difficult to understand. StarClan cats are often described as being transparent and silver in color, with stars sparkling around their paws. In the manga, their eyes are portrayed as blank and empty. On very rare occasions, a StarClan cat will interact with the world of the living, mainly to take a recently deceased cat to their place of resting. When a StarClan cat is forgotten by all living memory, or is killed in battle, they will fade away-it is unknown <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> after this.|$|E
2500|$|Outside of the {{transsexual}} {{community and}} sexology researchers, this controversy is largely notable {{because of its}} implications for academic freedom and freedom of speech. [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Dreger said, [...] "If we're going to have research at all, then we're going to have people saying unpopular things, {{and if this is}} <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> then we've got problems not only for science but free expression itself." [...] While Conway compared his work to Nazi propaganda, and Andrea James posted pictures of his children on her website with sexually explicit captions, other critics believe that their actions against Bailey and his book represent legitimate comment on a topic of public interest.|$|E
2500|$|The book {{elicited}} both strongly {{supportive and}} strongly negative reactions. The controversial aspects included {{the contents of}} the book, whether the research was conducted ethically, whether it should have been published by the National Academies Press, and whether it should have been promoted as a scientific work. According to Benedict Carey's story in The New York Times, [...] "To many of Dr. Bailey’s peers, his story is a morality play about the corrosive effects of political correctness on academic freedom." [...] Interviewed by Carey, bioethicist Alice Dreger argues that [...] "what happened to Bailey is important, because the harassment was so extraordinarily bad and because it could happen to any researcher in the field. If we’re going to have research at all, then we’re going to have people saying unpopular things, and if this is <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> then we’ve got problems not only for science but free expression itself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dewey's biographer Richard Norton Smith wrote, [...] "For fifteen years... {{these two}} combatants waged {{political}} warfare. Their dispute pitted East against Midwest, city against countryside, internationalist against isolationist, pragmatic liberals against principled conservatives. Each man thought himself the genuine spokesman of the future; each denounced {{the other as}} a political heretic." [...] In a 1949 speech, Dewey criticized Taft and his followers by saying that [...] "we have in our party some fine, high-minded patriotic people who honestly oppose farm price supports, unemployment insurance, old age benefits, slum clearance, and other social programs... these people believe in a laissez-faire society and look back wistfully to the miscalled 'good old days' of the nineteenth century... if such efforts {{to turn back the}} clock are actually pursued, you can bury the Republican Party as the deadest pigeon in the country." [...] He added that people who opposed such social programs should [...] "go out and try to get elected in a typical American community and see <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> But they ought not to do it as Republicans." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then {{so far as}} {{he could}} {{subsequently}} remember, Kipps had [...] "another," [...] and then it would seem that suddenly, regardless of the tragedy, he insisted that he [...] "reelly must be getting on," [...] and from that point his memory became irregular. Certain things have remained quite clearly, and as {{it is a matter of}} common knowledge that intoxicated people forget <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> it follows that he was not intoxicated. Chitterlow came with him partly to see him home and partly for a freshener before turning in. Kipps recalled afterwards very distinctly how in Little Fenchurch Street he discovered that he could not walk straight and also that Chitterlow's needle and thread in his still unmended trouser leg was making an annoying little noise on the pavement behind him. He tried to pick up the needle suddenly by surprise and somehow tripped and fell and then Chitterlow, laughing uproariously, helped him up. [...] "It wasn't a bicycle this time, old boy," [...] said Chitterlow, and that appeared to them both at the time as being a quite extraordinarily good joke indeed. They punched each other about on the strength of it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In France, {{though nothing}} so {{deliberately}} tedious as Robert Elsmere has been produced, {{things are not}} much better. M. Guy de Maupassant, with his keen mordant irony and his hard vivid style, strips life of the few poor rags that still cover her, and shows us foul sore and festering wound. He writes lurid little tragedies in which everybody is ridiculous; bitter comedies at which one cannot laugh for very tears. M. Zola, true to the lofty principle that he lays {{down in one of}} his pronunciamientos on literature, [...] "L'homme de genie n'a jamais d'esprit," [...] is determined to show that, if he has not got genius, he can at least be dull. And how well he succeeds! He is not without power. Indeed at times, as in Germinal, there is something almost epic in his work. But his work is entirely wrong from beginning to end, and wrong not on the ground of morals, but on the ground of art. From any ethical standpoint it is just what it should be. The author is perfectly truthful, and describes things exactly as they happen. What more can any moralist desire? We have no sympathy at all with the moral indignation of our time against M. Zola. It is simply the indignation of Tartuffe on being exposed. But from the standpoint of art, what can be said in favour of the author of L'Assommoir, Nana and Pot-Bouille? Nothing. Mr. Ruskin once described the characters in George Eliot's novels as being like the sweepings of a Pentonville omnibus, but M. Zola's characters are much worse. They have their dreary vices, and their drearier virtues. The record of their lives is absolutely without interest. Who cares <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>them?</b> In literature we require distinction, charm, beauty and imaginative power. We don't want to be harrowed and disgusted with an account of the doings of the lower orders. M. Daudet is better. He has wit, a light touch and an amusing style. But he has lately committed literary suicide. Nobody can possibly care for Delobelle with his [...] "Il faut lutter pour l'art," [...] or for Valmajour with his eternal refrain about the nightingale, or for the poet in Jack with his [...] "mots cruels," [...] now that we have learned from Vingt Ans de ma Vie litteraire that these characters were taken directly from life. To us they seem to have suddenly lost all their vitality, all the few qualities they ever possessed. The only real people are the people who never existed, and if a novelist is base enough to go to life for his personages he should at least pretend that they are creations, and not boast of them as copies. The justification of a character in a novel is not that other persons are what they are, but that the author is what he is. Otherwise the novel is not a work of art. As for M. Paul Bourget, the master of the roman psychologique, he commits the error of imagining that {{the men and women of}} modern life are capable of being infinitely analysed for an innumerable series of chapters. In point of fact what is interesting about people in good society--and M. Bourget rarely moves out of the Faubourg St. Germain, except to come to London,-- is the mask that each one of them wears, not the reality that lies behind the mask. It is a humiliating confession, but we are all of us made out of the same stuff. In Falstaff there is something of Hamlet, in Hamlet there is not a little of Falstaff. The fat knight has his moods of melancholy, and the young prince his moments of coarse humour. Where we differ from each other is purely in accidentals: in dress, manner, tone of voice, religious opinions, personal appearance, tricks of habit and the like. The more one analyses people, the more all reasons for analysis disappear. Sooner or later one comes to that dreadful universal thing called human nature. Indeed, as any one who has ever worked among the poor knows only too well, the brotherhood of man is no mere poet's dream, it is a most depressing and humiliating reality; and if a writer insists upon analysing the upper classes, he might just as well write of match-girls and costermongers at once.' However, my dear Cyril, I will not detain you any further just here. I quite admit that modern novels have many good points. All I insist on is that, as a class, they are quite unreadable.|$|E
