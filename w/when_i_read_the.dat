500|$|On {{taking the}} role of Jigsaw, Bell said - [...] "I did Saw because I {{thought it was a}} {{fascinating}} location for a film to be made. These guys locked in a room, to me, was fresh. I did not anticipate the ending <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> script, so I was quite caught by surprise and {{it was clear to me}} that if the filmmakers shot the scene well, the audience would be caught by surprise as well. The film was worth doing for that moment alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing his onscreen {{relationship}} with Yang, McKidd said: [...] "It's {{not going to}} be easy for them. What I read <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet." [...] On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: [...] "It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|Nichols {{was cast}} as Shana [...] "Scarlett" [...] O'Hara in the live-action film {{adaptation}} of the G.I. Joe franchise [...] (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. [...] "I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then when I finally got to read it myself... I really, really liked it... I liked {{that there were two}} kick-ass female roles. And I liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> script." [...] She put on approximately [...] of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had [...] "an appealing manner and comely biceps" [...] as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her [...] "savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness." [...] After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played Anna Farrier. Going straight-to-video on October 27, 2009, the movie went largely unnoticed by critics and audiences alike.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{years later}} she reprised her role as Kay Adams in The Godfather Part II. She was {{initially}} reluctant, stating that, [...] "At first, I was skeptical about playing Kay again in the Godfather sequel. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> script, the character seemed much more substantial than in the first movie." [...] In Part II, her character changed dramatically, becoming more embittered about her husband's activities. Even though Keaton received widespread exposure from the films, her character's importance was minimal. Time wrote that she was [...] "invisible in The Godfather and pallid in The Godfather, Part II." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aaron Tveit as Enjolras, {{the leader}} of Les Amis de l'ABC. Hoping to play Marius, Tveit {{submitted}} an audition tape in which he sang [...] "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables" [...] and [...] "In My Life". He had never performed any role in the musical. He also said of Enjolras that [...] "once I {{got more and more}} familiar with the material and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> novel, I was like, 'Wow this is a really, really great role,' and I felt very much better suited for it." [...] Tveit said the shooting of the film was [...] "almost as grueling as a marathon".|$|E
5000|$|When {{he started}} working at UTV, Simmons' job {{involved}} reading news and sports bulletins {{as well as}} introducing the channel's programmes, but he felt uneasy with newsreading. [...] "I didn't know what I was talking about... My main worry <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> news was...you are worried about making a mistake, but I was also worried I was going to laugh. I have this thing if I'm hearing bad news, or someone goes {{to tell me something}} grave... it must be a nervous thing, I feel myself starting to smirk. So I was always terrifed that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> news that <b>I</b> was going to laugh." ...|$|R

2500|$|Shyamalan's {{name was}} {{linked with the}} 2001 film Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, but it {{conflicted}} with the production of Unbreakable. In July 2006, while doing press tours for Lady in the Water, Shyamalan had said he was still interested in directing {{one of the last}} two Harry Potter films: [...] "The themes that run through it...the empowering of children, a positive outlook...you name it, it falls in line with my beliefs", Shyamalan said. [...] "I enjoy the humor in it. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> first Harry Potter and was thinking about making it, I had a whole different vibe in my head of it".|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Lopez, journalist Diane Sawyer of ABC News noted that people [...] "in the abuse counseling industry, have said you can't tell women that, they can't do that. That something that's dangerous, even {{to see it in}} their minds." [...] Lopez responded by stating: [...] "Well, you know, this is a movie that has the touches upon those themes, but really, it's a thriller [...] it's about empowering yourself in any situation, you know, that you have. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> script, I saw it as, you have the power within yourself, no matter how severe the situation can be, to change whatever that is, to find that power within yourself to change any negative situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|His biographer Silvanus P. Thompson {{writes that}} [...] "When Röntgen's {{discovery}} of the X-rays was announced {{at the end of}} 1895, Lord Kelvin was entirely skeptical, and regarded the announcement as a hoax. The papers had been full of the wonders of Röntgen's rays, about which Lord Kelvin was intensely skeptical until Röntgen himself sent him a copy of his Memoir"; on 17 January 1896, having read the paper & seen the photographs, he wrote Röntgen a letter saying that [...] "I need not tell you that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> paper I was very much astonished and delighted. I can say no more now than to congratulate you warmly on the great discovery you have made" [...] He would have his own hand X-rayed in May 1896. (See also N rays.) ...|$|E

5000|$|The film is the English-language {{debut of}} German {{director}} Roland Suso Richter, whose previous credits include The Tunnel, After the Truth, and 14 Days to Life.

50|$|In the 1960s, Glover aroused {{the ire of}} Lacan by way of {{his attack}} on Franz Alexanders concept of the {{corrective}} emotional experience: <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> in <b>the</b> Psychoanalytic Quarterly an article like the one by Mr Edward Glover, entitled Freudian or Neo-Freudian, directed entirely against the constructions of Mr Alexander, I sense a sordid smell of stuffiness,...Alexander being counter-attacked {{in the name of}} obsolete criteria.|$|R
