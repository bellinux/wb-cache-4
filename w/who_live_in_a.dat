25|$|Marine {{life can}} be {{susceptible}} to noise or the sound pollution from sources such as passing ships, oil exploration seismic surveys, and naval low-frequency active sonar. Sound travels more rapidly and over larger distances in the sea than in the atmosphere. Marine animals, such as cetaceans, often have weak eyesight, and {{live in a world}} largely defined by acoustic information. This applies also to many deeper sea fish, <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> world of darkness. Between 1950 and 1975, ambient noise at one location in the Pacific Ocean increased by about ten decibels (that is a tenfold increase in intensity).|$|E
25|$|In abusive relationships, {{there may}} be a cycle of abuse during which {{tensions}} rise and an act of violence is committed, followed by a period of reconciliation and calm. Victims of domestic violence may be trapped in domestic violent situations through isolation, power and control, cultural acceptance, lack of financial resources, fear, shame, or to protect children. As a result of abuse, victims may experience physical disabilities, chronic health problems, mental illness, limited finances, and poor ability to create healthy relationships. Victims may experience psychological problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Children <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> household with violence often show psychological problems from an early age, such as dysregulated aggression which may later contribute to continuing the legacy of abuse when they reach adulthood.|$|E

500|$|Louise Watson, {{writing for}} Screenonline, felt the film's costume and make-up help [...] "convey the full Cinderella {{transformation}} of Austen's heroine. At first the undervalued family martyr, Anne is the wallflower {{who has lost}} her 'bloom'. Her loose-fitting costumes hint at how she has pined away since refusing Wentworth... As she regains her confidence, she blossoms; she dresses becomingly, her eyes sparkle and her features become animated". Paulette Richards argues that the film's [...] "unreliable" [...] male characters, such as Sir Walter, are identified as such by the flamboyant nature of their clothing. This flamboyance is especially clear to modern viewers, <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> culture where [...] "real men" [...] are expected to care little for their clothing. Conversely, the film's Wentworth is typically depicted in naval uniforms, which is a contrast to Bryan Marshall's version of the character in the 1971 adaptation. This uniform helps set Wentworth apart {{from many of the}} other male characters, allowing him to appear romantic but isolated. Gina and Andrew MacDonald had a similar view of the film, writing that it accurately captures Austen's satire by juxtaposing the upper classes' extravagance in fashion with the virtuous qualities of the Royal Navy. The naval men's profession is emphasised by the frequency of wearing their uniforms, in contrast to other adaptations of the novel.|$|E
