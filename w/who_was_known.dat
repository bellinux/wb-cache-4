5|$|Alexander {{was also}} noted for his {{nepotism}} that was partially {{due to his}} advanced age and belief that his family would have little time to profit from his reign. This was in contrast to his predecessor Innocent XI, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> for being austere and had not caused any scandals through nepotism.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009, {{the local}} police arrested Anthony Sowell, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> in press reports as the Cleveland Strangler. He was convicted of eleven murders {{as well as other}} crimes and sentenced to death.|$|E

George, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> educated at Oxford and {{is old enough}} to be considered an adult, is sent away to town. The rest of the family move to a new and more humble parish on the land of Squire Thornhill, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> to <b>be</b> a womanizer. On the way, they hear about the dubious reputation of their new landlord. Also, references are made to the squire's uncle Sir William Thornhill, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> throughout the country for his worthiness and generosity.|$|R
25|$|In Enclosure 3 {{there are}} cenotaphs to 15 men <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> or {{believed}} to be buried on the site, plus other memorials recording 5 men <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>known</b> to <b>be</b> buried in another cemetery but <b>who</b> could not <b>be</b> found when that cemetery was concentrated to the Voormezeele Enclosures after the Armistice.|$|R
5|$|A stone coffin {{found during}} the 2012 {{excavation}} was opened {{for the first}} time, revealing a lead coffin inside. An investigation with an endoscope revealed {{the presence of a}} skeleton along with some head hair and fragments of a shroud and cord. The skeleton was at first assumed to be male, perhaps that of a knight called Sir William de Moton <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> to have been buried there, but later examination showed it to be of a woman—perhaps a high-ranking benefactress. She may not necessarily have been local, as lead coffins were used to transport corpses over long distances.|$|E
5|$|After Hinde's death, Constable quickly {{gathered}} {{all of his}} writings, diaries, business documents, and miscellaneous {{other items}} and donated them to Lyman Draper in 1864, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> for collecting the papers of figures of the Trans-Allegheny frontier. Because of this donation, many scholars and historians {{have been able to}} study these papers. The Thomas S. Hinde documents are owned and kept at the Wisconsin Historical Society.|$|E
5|$|After signing to Mercury Records, the New York Dolls {{recorded}} the album at The Record Plant in New York with producer Todd Rundgren, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> for his sophisticated pop tastes {{and held a}} lukewarm opinion of the band. Despite stories of conflicts during the recording sessions, lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain later said Rundgren successfully captured how the band sounded live. Their music on the album incorporates carefree rock and roll, Brill Building pop influences, and campy sensibilities, while Johansen's colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explore themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and authenticity.|$|E

5|$|C. V. Sridhar and Sadagopan, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> by {{his screen}} name Chitralaya Gopu, {{had been friends}} since their tenure at St. Joseph's High School, Chengalpattu. At school both were playwrights; Sridhar wrote stage plays and portrayed the lead roles. Gopu wrote the humour-oriented plays and portrayed comic roles. Later, when Sridhar had the {{opportunity}} to direct a film, he asked Gopu to join him and handle the humour content. The success of Kalyana Parisu (1959) led to Sridhar establishing his own production house, Chitralaya Pictures.|$|E
5|$|Friendly {{generally}} {{approved of}} the first version but {{believed that it was}} necessary to include information on same-sex sexual practices. When those practices were explained to him, however, he changed his mind. While the documentary was still in production, Friendly was promoted to the presidency of CBS News but left soon after over a disagreement over the network's coverage of the Vietnam War. He was replaced by Richard S. Salant, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> for his cost-consciousness, which put the future of the documentary and the CBS Reports series in question.|$|E
5|$|In this game, the Crimson Tide wore Nike Pro Combat uniforms for {{the first}} time. These uniforms {{featured}} crimson jerseys with grey and white houndstooth numbers, a houndstooth stripe on the helmet, houndstooth gloves and an American flag sewn {{into one of the}} sleeves in honor of Veterans Day. The houndstooth design was chosen as a tribute to former Alabama coach Bear Bryant <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> for wearing a houndstooth fedora during games. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Bulldogs to 73–18–3 (75–17–3 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E

5|$|Lasker made {{contributions}} {{to the development of}} other games. He was a first-class contract bridge player and wrote about bridge and other games, including Go and his own invention, Lasca. His books about games presented a problem that is still considered notable in the mathematical analysis of card games. Lasker was also a research mathematician <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> for his {{contributions to}} commutative algebra, which included proving the primary decomposition of the ideals of polynomial rings. On the other hand, his philosophical works and a drama that he co-wrote received little attention.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) {{opened a}} file on Burhop in 1948, believing {{him to be}} a secret member of the Communist Party of Australia, and an {{associate}} of Ian Milner, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> through Venona intercepts to have passed secret documents to the Soviet Union. In July 1951, the British government cancelled his passport when he accepted an offer to travel to the Soviet Union. A new passport was issued after he gave the Foreign Secretary a written assurance that he would not seek to travel to the Soviet Union or other Iron Curtain countries.|$|E

5|$|Another theory {{presented}} by an expert {{shortly after the}} crash theorized that an engine fire {{could have been the}} catalyst of the accident. Under this theory, one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel from the engine may have punctured the fuselage, causing explosive decompression. Alternatively, Julian Frank, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> to be desperately afraid of flying, may have panicked and hit the window, weakening it such that it subsequently blew out. Under this theory, the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing, as well as {{the fact that some of}} the passengers were found wearing life jackets.|$|E
5|$|At one time, {{there were}} {{detailed}} contemporaneous histories on Caligula, {{but they are}} now lost. Additionally, the historians who wrote them are described as biased, either overly critical or praising of Caligula. Nonetheless, these lost primary sources, along with the works of Seneca and Philo, were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Caligula written by the next generations of historians. A few of the contemporaneous historians are known by name. Fabius Rusticus and Cluvius Rufus both wrote condemning histories on Caligula that are now lost. Fabius Rusticus {{was a friend of}} Seneca <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> for historical embellishment and misrepresentation. Cluvius Rufus was a senator involved in the assassination of Caligula.|$|E
5|$|Browne was {{regarded}} as an intelligent and meticulous athlete, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> for a logical and somewhat introspective style in his approach to the sport. He felt {{that he did not}} have the raw speed to match the likes of Lionel Cox and Dick Ploog in vying for selection in Australia's sprint team, and that he was not suited to long road races, instead focusing on medium length track racing. Browne typically was the front rider in tandem races, liking to be in control. He {{was regarded}} to be a cyclist who behaved in a careful and scholarly manner, and was known for coaxing higher levels of performance out of his younger partners. Browne was respected for his technical knowledge of the tandem and his success was often attributed to his vast experience.|$|E

5|$|Casting for {{the episode}} was difficult, as the {{production}} team wanted real Africans. They auditioned every one they could find, including an African theater troupe that was passing by. The role of Marcus Duff eventually went to Carl Lumbly, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> {{for his role}} on CBS's Cagney & Lacey. The role of Aboah went to Willie Amakye, a Ghanaian Olympic runner who had just returned {{to his home in}} Southern California from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. To appear albino, Amakye's skin underwent several layers of cover-up cream, layers of white powder, and a little pink powder for color. He also wore contacts for the transparent pink eyes. Amakye's hair was dyed orange for post-production special effects to change it back and forth from black and white. As revealed on his resident alien card, Aboah's birthday is September 25, a reference to the birthday of Gillian Anderson's daughter.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{created a}} merit system for state {{government}} workers, ensuring that officials {{could not be}} hired or fired for political reasons. This provision attracted more well-qualified people to public service careers. Such careers were made even more attractive when, in 1962, the state courts declared that the salaries of state employees, the amounts of which were specified in the state constitution, could be adjusted for inflation. Combs demanded that state employees stick strictly to the rules governing their offices. In one instance, Combs ordered a state audit of Carter County superintendent Heman McGuire, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> to use his office for political gain. While Combs {{did not have the}} authority to remove McGuire directly, the audit showed McGuire's misappropriation of funds and abuse of power. The state school board investigated these findings and removed the county school board members from office; the replacement board members then ousted McGuire.|$|E
5|$|Conn Smythe {{was born}} on February 1, 1895, in Toronto to Albert Smythe, an Irish Protestant from County Antrim who immigrated to Canada in 1889, and Mary Adelaide Constantine, an English woman. Mary and Albert were married in the 1880s while immigrating to Canada. Albert and Mary had a rocky {{marriage}} and did not live together {{for more than a}} few months at a time. Mary, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>known</b> as Polly, was remembered by Conn as pretty, a drinker and troublemaker, while Albert was quiet, a vegetarian and a devoted member of Madame Blavatsky's Theosophical movement. Albert Smythe was a charter member of the Theosophical Society of Canada in 1891, and edited its newsletter until the final years of his life.|$|E
