5000|$|In the evening, Creel runs {{to inform}} Craven {{that his wife}} is ready to give birth. The doctor asks, [...] "can't {{some of the women}} handle this?", but Allaryce tells him, [...] "I've {{examined}} the woman. A caesarian section is indicated". Craven refuses to operate, even when Allaryce threatens to leave him if he does not help. As Major Adams tries to reason with him, Craven recounts that he could never perform proper surgery and that he paid for medical school with a job at a slaughterhouse. He tells the Major, [...] "I graduated {{just in time for the}} war… Shiloh… eighteen thousand casualties… in that one campaign, seventy-two percent of my patients died…" [...] The Major tells him, [...] "…shock and gangrene… that wasn't your fault…" [...] and continues, [...] "…who do you think you are to sit in judgment of yourself?… <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you ought to be infallible?… what right have you got to make yourself personally responsible for the war?… I was at Shiloh… I had two hundred and twenty-three men… every one of them friends and neighbors… I came out with seventeen…" ...|$|E

In the 1970 ’s, messages to aliens were included on the Pioneer 10 and 11, and Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft. There is an account of these efforts in the book [19]; see especially the chapter by F. D. Drake. The Voyager messages include some mathematics, e. g., a translation table between binary and decimal representation systems. (Recent updates on the search for extra-terrestial intelligence may be found at www. seti-inst. edu and www. setileague. org.) At a NATO Workshop at the University of Hawaii in October 2002, Jack Cohen raised the question: <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the aliens will recognize your mathematics? Might they not have an entirely different mode of thought? At the time, the feeling of the mathematicians present was that the fundamentals of discrete math, and in particular the integers, would be the same in any mathematical system. While aliens might have a different perception that changes the more complex structures that they would use to describe the universe, their natural numbers would be the same as ours. Furthermore, if they are very intelligent, then {{they should be able to}} add and multiply integers, so for example aliens would recognize a sequence of prime numbers. Now in fact, such questions about the fundamentals of mathematics have a long history, without the alien factor. My own interest was spurred years ago by a rather long but otherwise forgettable lecture on “The nature of duality ” by a visitor to the Philosophy Department. But Jack’s question has encouraged me to put down some of the thoughts that have been fomenting beneath the surface, in need for further development. Besides raising a number of topics for discussion, we will propose some problems that might be appropriate for student projects...|$|E

He and his former wife Elvera Sanchez were both dancers in a {{vaudeville}} troupe. The couple split up when their son Sammy Jr. was three. Davis took custody of his son, who then went into show business with his father. He and Will Mastin, {{the leader of the}} dance troupe, taught Sammy, Jr. how to dance and they performed together as the Will Mastin Trio. Sammy, Jr. once stated, [...] "When I was nine I told my father, 'I can outdance you'. 'Oh yeah? <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that?' he asked.

40|$|The {{vision of}} having a {{computer}} communicate with humans in natural language was entertained shortly after the computer was invented. Weizenbaum’s (1966) ELIZA program was the first conversation system that was rea-sonably successful, popular, and widely used.

Patient: You are very aggressive but I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> don’t want me to notice that. ELIZA: <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I am aggressive? Patient: You always argue with me. ELIZA: Why do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I argue with you? Like a typical Rogerian therapist, ELIZA {{tried to get the}} patient to do the talking by asking the patient questions about the patient’s verbal contributions to the exchange.

Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia {{escaping}} and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used. In retaliation, Libra kidnaps Josh and tries to get Mardon to join the Society, threatening to kill the boy if he does not.

5000|$|The {{emergence}} of a class of meta-jokes about blondes ("meta-blonde jokes", i.e., jokes about blonde jokes) is noted. In a typical plot of this type a blonde complains about the unfairness of the stereotype propagated by blonde jokes, with a punch line actually reinforcing the stereotype. An example is about a blonde objecting to a ventriloquist act packed with sexist jokes about blondes: Blonde: [...] "I’ve heard enough of your stupid blonde jokes. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can stereotype women that way? What does {{the color of a}} person’s hair have to do with her worth as a human being?

Because you and men like you continue to perpetuate discrimination against not only blondes, but women in general, and {{all in the name of}} humor!"Ventriloquist: [...] "I'm sorry ma'am but..."Blonde: [...] "You stay out of this, mister!

5000|$|In 1970, Pat Summerall {{and then}} Boston Bruins' {{television}} announcer Don Earle did a short post-game segment {{from inside the}} team's dressing room {{at the end of}} CBS' coverage of the fourth (and {{what turned out to be}} the final game) of the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals. WSBK-TV, which was the Bruins' television flagship at the time, simulcast the CBS coverage and did a longer post-game locker-room segment after CBS' coverage ended. After Bobby Orr scored the championship-winning goal after just 40 seconds, so the story went, Summerall turned to Bobby's father, Doug Orr (who was reportedly, too nervous to go back to his seat from the Bruins' dressing room for the start of overtime) and yelled over the crowd in the stands above [...] "Mr. Orr, your son has scored and Boston has won the Stanley Cup!" [...] Doug Orr is said to have told Summerall, [...] "I know Boston scored, but we didn't see it! <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> my son scored?"
