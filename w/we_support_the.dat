We thought Britain was safe in the European exchange-rate mechanism just weeks before it crashed out; we opined, in 1997, that Indonesia was well placed to avoid financial crisis; we noted in 1999 that oil, at $10 per barrel, might well reach $5, almost perfectly timing {{the bottom of the}} market; and in 2003 <b>we</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> {{invasion of}} Iraq." ...|$|R
2500|$|On April 23, Gideon Saar, {{the cabinet}} secretary, {{threatened}} {{to ban the}} team from entering Jenin.

Sharon accepted Eiland and Mofaz's position, and announced Israel's decision that the UN team was no longer acceptable on April 24, citing the lack of military experts. The US rebuked Sharon's decision, and a White House official said, [...] "We were the sponsors of that and we want it implemented as written. <b>We</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> initiative of the secretary general." ...|$|E

But they must guard the holiness of Israel, teachers and students alike, and not follow foreign ideas nor turn aside from the Torah and the mitzvos. And even then, it is not from secular subjects that Torah will come forth, but rather when <b>we</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> holy yeshivas, which are dedicated solely to the holiness of the Torah.|$|E

[...] Blair also underscored the tragedy that the crisis has brought to the region. [...] "What is happening is absolutely tragic for all the people involved, but the only solution is that the international community empowers the moderates on both sides to come to a solution."

2500|$|Union {{leaders say}} that unions and OWS can offer mutual support, with OWS gaining from the union's money, stature, and large membership, and the {{weakened}} labor movement absorbing the protesters vitality. The Industrial Workers of the World announced on September 28, 2011, that its General Executive Board (GEB), and the General Defense Committee (GDC) had issued statements {{of support for}} Occupy Wall Street. After numerous arrests of protesters on the Brooklyn Bridge, police commandeered city buses to pick up detained protesters and union drivers later sued the New York Police Department. Union President John Samuelsen said, [...] "We're down with these protesters. <b>We</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> notion that rich folk are not paying their fair share.

On October 4, representatives from more than 14 of the country's largest labor unions joined the protesters for a mass rally and march. In early November, National Nurses United (NNU), the largest union of registered nurses in the nation, expressed support for OWS and rallied in front of the White House and Department of Treasury. Karen Higgins, co-president of NNU, said, [...] "A real finance tax would generate $350 billion a year in the U.S. alone and bring relief to families out of homes, friends out of work, patients out of care, communities running out of time. The tax starts a revenue flow back to the 99 percent." ...|$|E
