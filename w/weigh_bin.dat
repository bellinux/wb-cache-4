40|$|Within the Australian Sugar {{industry}} {{a number}} of {{attempts have been made}} to monitor yield variation across a block. These have ranged from the early yield monitoring systems based on discrete mass measurement, to the current focus of predicting yield via surrogate measurements based on chopper pressure, feed train roller displacement and elevator power. This paper describes an independent evaluation of commercially available mass flow sensors that was conducted to assess current performance of yield monitoring options while identifying opportunities for developing improved cane yield monitoring systems. Three yield monitoring systems which were commercially available in 2008 (AgGuide, TechAgro and MTData) were fitted to a BSES-owned CH 2500 Cameco harvester. Trials were conducted during the 2008 and 2009 seasons in the Ingham district of North Queensland. Each yield monitoring system was assessed simultaneously to eliminate the influence of machine setup and site characteristics that would be encountered through independently assessing each unit. During the trial, the harvester was operated according to Harvesting Best Practice (HBP). In addition to yield monitoring, sugarcane yield was also measured using a <b>weigh</b> <b>bin</b> in order to determine the absolute accuracy and resolution of the respective yield monitoring systems. <b>Weigh</b> <b>bin</b> and mill weight data were used to assess the yield monitors at a range of scales including; 50 m of row, full rows, multiple rows (i. e. plot of 9 rows) and the entire field. These assessments were made with the harvester operating at both high and low pour rates. Only the TechAgro unit was found to provide results that were sufficiently accurate to be considered as a potentially viable sugarcane yield monitor. Performance of this unit was, however substantially reduced at high pour rates and this sensor was unable to account for changing pour rates. Recommendations for further refining the devices and for additional work are included...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. There {{are many}} sources of {{disturbances}} for on-the-go weighing. This {{study was conducted}} to develop a new method to remove those disturbances and to estimate more accurate dynamic masses in silage harvesting. A mathematically simple procedure was developed using vertical movement information from a low-cost accelerometer, in addition to conventional instrumentation using load cells for mass data, and was tested using a small scale model <b>weighing</b> <b>bin</b> and a commercial silage wagon. Clear similarities were found between the patterns of low-pass filtered mass and acceleration data when both were obtained simultaneously from the same harvesting system. Multiplication factors for acceleration data were calculated so that the differences between the mass data and the multiplied acceleration data could be minimized. Thus, subtracting the multiplied acceleration from the mass data corresponded to deleting load cell disturbances due to vertical movements. A small-scale model weighing system was used to apply the developed approach to known dynamic masses. Mass estimation showed less than 20 g measurement errors for experimental loads. The same method was applied to a commercial silage wagon with harvested silage mass data in the 0 to 7, 000 kg range. The proposed method showed that remaining error magnitude...|$|R

50|$|Hand-counting is a {{cheap and}} easy to conduct method to {{estimate}} the liberation characteristics of a bulk sample wither originating from run-of-mine material, a waste dump or for example exploration trenching. Analysis of particles in the size range 10-100mm has been conducted on a total sample mass of 10 tonnes. By visual inspection of trained personnel, a classification of each particle into different bins (e.g. lithology, grade) is possible and the distribution is determined by <b>weighing</b> each <b>bin.</b> A trained professional can quickly estimate the efficiency of a specific detection and process efficiency of sensor-based ore sorting knowing the sensor response of the mineralogy of ore in question and other process efficiency parameters.|$|R
40|$|Accurate massing {{of mixed}} juice is {{critical}} to the South African industry for cane payment purposes, as well as for controlling performance in a factory. The batch weighing system usually employed in the South African sugar industry consists of load cells, holding tanks, <b>weighing</b> <b>bins,</b> processors, valves and actuators. Due {{to the nature of the}} mechanism used, the system can be subject to frequent downtime because of mechanical and electronic malfunctions. Any errors or interruptions within the weighing system could result in mixed juice weighing being suspended or the mill stopping until the problem is rectified. During these periods, the unweighed mixed juice has to be estimated as accurately as possible. The Cane Testing Service (CTS) has developed a number of methods for estimating the mass of mixed juice in such an event (Brokensha, 1997). These methods usually involve the use of an assumed pol factor, the value of which may differ according to the amount of cane already crushed in the week. Due to the indirect nature of such a correction, and the need for decision making at laboratory manager level, the correction of the mixed juice mass can be lengthy and disputes as to its validity can arise. With a view to the eventual standardising on a direct method that could be applied automatically in all situations, the determination of mixed juice tonnage by flow meter was investigated at the Umzimkulu mill. The daily tonnages of mixed juice derived via the use of a flow meter already existing at the mill were compared against the routine massing of mixed juice and were recorded over the 2003 crushing season. After correcting the volumetric flow meter values for temperature, brix and specific gravity, the data showed a very good correlation to the tonnage obtained by the conventional massing of mixed juice. This paper describes the two measuring systems and discusses the preliminary results...|$|R
