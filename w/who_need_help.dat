25|$|Grinnell College expects all {{students}} to possess significant academic achievements. For example, the math department does not offer any basic-level classes such as college algebra, trigonometry, or pre-calculus, and remedial classes are not offered in any subject. However, several independent, non-credit programs assist students <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>help</b> in a specific subject. Among these programs are the Library Lab, Math Lab, Reading Lab, Science Learning Center, and the Writing Lab. While private tutors can be hired, participation in these programs is free for any enrolled student.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{advanced}} triage may become necessary when medical professionals {{decide that the}} medical resources available are not sufficient to treat all the people <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>help.</b> The treatment being prioritized can include the time spent on medical care, or drugs or other limited resources. This has happened in disasters such as terrorist attacks, mass shootings, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, and rail accidents. In these cases some percentage of patients will die regardless of medical care because {{of the severity of}} their injuries. Others would live if given immediate medical care, but would die without it.|$|E

500|$|On 30 March 2010, Alan Johnson, {{the then}} Home Secretary, {{announced}} mephedrone {{would be made}} illegal [...] "within weeks" [...] after the ACMD sent him {{a report on the}} use of cathinones. The legislation would make all cathinones illegal, which Johnson said would [...] "stop unscrupulous manufacturers and others peddling different but similarly harmful drugs". The ACMD had run into problems with the UK Government in 2009 regarding drugs policy, after the government did not follow the advice of the ACMD to reclassify ecstasy and cannabis, culminating in the dismissal of the ACMD chairman, David Nutt, after he reiterated the ACMD's findings in an academic lecture. Several members resigned after he was sacked, and prior to the announcement that mephedrone was to be banned, the trend continued when Dr Polly Taylor resigned, saying she [...] "did not have trust" [...] in the way the government would use the advice given by the ACMD. Eric Carlin, a member of the ACMD and former chairman of the English Drug Education Forum, also resigned after the announcement. He said the decision by the Home Secretary was [...] "unduly based on media and political pressure" [...] and there was [...] "little or no discussion about how our recommendation to classify this drug would be likely to impact on young people's behaviour." [...] Some former members of the ACMD and various charity groups expressed concern over the banning of the drug, arguing it would inevitably criminalise users, particularly young people. Others expressed concern that the drug would be left in the hands of black market dealers, who will only compound the problem. Carlin's resignation was specifically linked to the criminalisation of mephedrone, he stated: [...] "We need to review our entire approach to drugs, dumping the idea that legally-sanctioned punishments for drug users should constitute a main part of the armoury in helping to solve our country’s drug problems. We need to stop harming people <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>help</b> and support".|$|E

2500|$|Pius XII asked Archbishop Montini to Rome October 1957, {{where he}} gave the main {{presentation}} to the Second World Congress of Lay Apostolate. Previously as Pro-Secretary of State, he had worked hard to form a unified worldwide organization of lay people of 58 nations, representing 42 national organizations. He presented them to Pius XII in Rome in 1951. The second meeting in 1957 gave Montini an opportunity to express the lay apostolate in modern terms: [...] "Apostolate means love. We will love all, but especially those, <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>help...</b> We will love our time, our technology, our art, our sports, our world." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{translation of}} the name into Chinese by authors such as Xuanzang was [...] Guānzìzài (...) , not the form used in East Asian Buddhism today, Guanyin (...)

The original form Avalokitasvara appears in Sanskrit fragments of the fifth century.|$|E

2500|$|Mara {{founded the}} charity Faces of Kibera, which aimed to provide housing, food, {{and medical care}} for orphans in Kibera, a Nairobi, Kenya slum. The charity's goal was to build an orphanage in the region, for which 6 acres of land have been purchased. The charity {{auctioned}} memorabilia from the Steelers and Giants, as well as training camp events on eBay to raise money. She visited the area as a volunteer in 2006 and was moved to help the orphans, many whose parents have died from AIDS and HIV-related illnesses. She began the charity due to her frustration with {{the growing number of}} nonprofits that are just business opportunities. [...] "The people <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>help</b> aren’t really getting it. So I started my own", she told Interview magazine in 2009. Mara later found it challenging to balance her charity work and acting career. [...] "I need to do both; I can't just do acting," [...] she stated to The Journal News. In January 2011, Faces of Kibera merged with Uweza Foundation which runs community-based empowerment programs in Kibera, including soccer leagues and after-school tutoring. Uweza is a Swahili word meaning opportunity, ability, and power. Mara serves {{as the president of the}} board of directors for the foundation.|$|E

We are here to help {{to the best of}} our ability all <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>help,</b> {{whatsoever}} their characters. They are equally welcome to what we have to offer, whether they be thieves, or prostitutes, or drunkards, or respectable men and women. But if I were asked what really brought me here, for what class of people in the world my sympathy and the sympathies of my friends have been most warmly kindled, I should say, for such as that young woman who has just presented herself here. If she asks for them, she will have from us food and clothes and the use of our baths and reading-rooms whenever she chooses, and I will guarantee that not one of my women friends here who come in contact with her will ask a single question as to her mode of life, until she invites their confidence. If you think that she is responsible for her present state, you and I differ--if you think that one shadow of blame rests upon her, we differ again. And if there are any more like her in the room, let them come out, and they shall have all that they ask for, that it is within our power to give." ...|$|E
