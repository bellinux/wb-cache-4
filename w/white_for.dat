5|$|After the 1973 {{season the}} team fired Webster, who later {{admitted}} {{his heart was}} never in head coaching, and said he more enjoyed life as an assistant. They hired retired star defensive end Andy Robustelli to run their football operations, and he picked Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger as the team's head coach. Arnsparger had built an enviable reputation as {{the architect of the}} Dolphins defense which helped the team to two Super Bowl championships. Robustelli traded their 1975 first round draft choice to the Cowboys (who used it to select Hall of Fame defensive lineman Randy <b>White)</b> <b>for</b> quarterback Craig Morton {{in the middle of the}} 1974 season.|$|E

5|$|After Bernard Blake intercepted an AJ McCarron pass on Alabama's first {{possession}} of the second half, Jared Roberts kicked a 45-yard field goal on the drive that ensured that made the score 17–3. Roberts then scored the Rams' only other points on their next possession with his 31-yard field goal. Early in the fourth quarter, Trey DePriest both forced and recovered a Garrett Grayson fumble. On the next play, Alabama scored on a 30-yard McCarron touchdown pass to DeAndrew <b>White</b> <b>for</b> a 24–6 lead. The Crimson Tide then made the final score 31–6 with a 15-yard Blake Sims touchdown pass to Chris Black. In the game, the Rams were led by former Crimson Tide offensive coordinator Jim McElwain and received $1.5 million {{to play the game}} at Bryant–Denny Stadium.|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} Star Trek films, existing props and footage were reused where possible to save money, though The Voyage Home required less of this than previous films. The Earth Spacedock interiors and control booth sets were reused from The Search for Spock, although the computer monitors in these scenes featured new graphics—the old reels had deteriorated in storage. Stock {{footage of the}} destruction of the Enterprise and the Bird-of-Prey's movement through space were reused. While the Bird-of-Prey bridge was a completely new design, other parts of the craft's interior were also redresses; the computer room was a modification of the reactor room where Spock died in The Wrath of Khan. After all other Bird-of-Prey bridge scenes were completed, the entire set was painted <b>white</b> <b>for</b> one shot that transitioned into a dream sequence during the time travel.|$|E
5|$|At the 1965 Academy Awards, Norman Wanstall won the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing for his work, making Goldfinger {{the first}} Bond film {{to receive an}} Academy Award. John Barry was {{nominated}} for the Grammy Award for Best Score for a Motion Picture, and Ken Adam was nominated for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) for Best British Art Direction (Colour), where he also won the award for Best British Art Direction (Black and <b>White)</b> <b>for</b> Dr. Strangelove. The American Film Institute has honoured the film four times: ranking it No.90 for best movie quote ("A martini. Shaken, not stirred"), No.53 for best song ("Goldfinger"), No. 49 for best villain (Auric Goldfinger), and No.71 for most thrilling film. In 2006, Entertainment Weekly and IGN both named Goldfinger as the best Bond film, while MSN named it as the second best, behind its predecessor. IGN and EW also named Pussy Galore as the second best Bond girl. In 2008, Total Film named Goldfinger as the best film in the series. The Times placed Goldfinger and Oddjob second and third on their list of the best Bond villains in 2008. They also named the Aston Martin DB5 as the best car in the films.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, McCarron threw a 67-yard {{touchdown}} pass to DeAndrew <b>White</b> <b>for</b> a 17–14 lead. However, {{this would be the}} last time the Crimson Tide led in the game as a pair of turnovers by the Crimson Tide later in the quarter directly resulted in a pair of Oklahoma touchdowns. After the Sooners tied the game with a 47-yard Michael Hunnicutt field goal, Geneo Grissom recovered a Yeldon fumble at their eight-yard line and returned it to the 34. Seven plays later Knight threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Saunders for a 24–17 Oklahoma lead. On the next offensive series, McCarron threw his second interception of the game to Zack Sanchez who returned it to the Alabama 13-yard line. On the next play, Sterling Shepard extended the Sooners' lead to 31–17 with his 13-yard touchdown run. The Crimson Tide was able to get into field goal range late, but Foster missed an attempt from 32-yards as time expired for the first half.|$|E
5|$|Following the Nebraska kickoff, Tech {{tried to}} answer the Cornhusker score with one of its own. The Hokies started at their 20-yard line after a touchback. Parker caught an eight-yard pass from Druckenmiller, then ran for three yards and a first down. With a first down at the Tech 31-yard line, Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} pass. This {{was followed by a}} four-yard run by Oxendine and a ten-yard completion by Druckenmiller for another first down, this time to the Tech 45-yard line. Oxendine picked up three yards on two short runs, then Druckenmiller advanced the Hokies into the Nebraska side of the field with a 19-yard pass to Jennings. Oxendine was stopped for no gain and Druckenmiller threw an incompletion, but on third down, Druckenmiller connected with <b>White</b> <b>for</b> a 33-yard gain and Tech's first touchdown of the second half. The extra point was good, and the Hokies again trimmed Nebraska's lead to three points: 2421. Tech's drive covered 80 yards in 12 plays and 4:56 of game time.|$|E
5|$|Former Seattle SuperSonics {{announcer}} Kevin Calabro {{and former}} U.S. soccer star Greg Vanney called the play-by-play {{for the local}} broadcasts during the Sounders' inaugural season in 2009.

In 2012, White was hired by NBC Sports Network to be the voice of their soccer coverage. That led to BBC commentator Ross Fletcher becoming the club's television and radio play-by-play commentator beginning with the 2012 season, working alongside Kasey Keller as the color commentator. Fletcher left the club {{at the end of}} the 2015 season and was controversially replaced by Keith Costigan.|$|E

5|$|Freeway {{construction}} {{continued through}} the 1970s. On April 6, 1972, the New Buffalo Welcome Center was relocated from its previous location next to US12 to one adjacent to I-94. Later that year, the state switched paint colors for its centerlines; yellow {{was used for the}} lines separating directions of travel and <b>white</b> <b>for</b> lines separating lanes traveling in the same direction. Also in 1972, a gas tax increase was passed to facilitate US and state highway improvement projects. The final section of I-75 between Alger and Roscommon was opened on November 1, 1973, in a dedication by Governor William G. Milliken, completing the longest highway in the state. In 1974, the state implemented mileage-based exit numbers along the remaining Interstates in Michigan. By late 1977, the state highway department shifted its focus from construction of new highways to improvements of the existing system.|$|E
5|$|In April 1921, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi {{wrote in}} his journal Young India {{about the need for}} an Indian flag, proposing a flag with the charkha or {{spinning}} wheel at the centre. The idea of the spinning wheel was put forth by Lala Hansraj, and Gandhi commissioned Pingali Venkayya to design a flag with the spinning wheel on a red and green banner, the red colour signifying Hindus and the green standing for Muslims. Gandhi wanted the flag to be presented at the Congress session of 1921, but it was not delivered on time, and another flag was proposed at the session. Gandhi later wrote that the delay was fortuitous since it allowed him to realise that other religions were not represented; he then added white to the banner colours, to represent all the other religions. Finally, owing to the religious-political sensibilities, in 1929, Gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of the flag colours, stating that red stood for the sacrifices of the people, <b>white</b> <b>for</b> purity, and green for hope.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1825, White was en route {{to serve on the}} court of Loudoun County and stayed the night at a tavern along the Shenandoah River. He was {{discovered}} by the proprietor the following morning suffering with paralysis. White remained stricken with paralysis for several weeks and returned to his home in Winchester on a litter. His position as judge of the tenth judicial district was assumed by two judges: William Brockinbough and John Scott. White remained paralyzed for the remainder of his life. On July 1, 1825, White gave power of attorney to his son, John Baker <b>White,</b> <b>for</b> the management of his affairs. White later died at his residence in Winchester on March 9, 1831.|$|E

5|$|Michigan won {{the coin}} toss and elected {{to defer to}} the second half, and Alabama opened play with a three-and-out. Michigan was then held to only one first down before they punted on their first possession. On the drive that ensued, Alabama's mix of play-action passes and rushes ended with a two-yard {{touchdown}} reception by Michael Williams from AJ McCarron for a 7–0 lead. After the Crimson Tide defense again forced a Wolverine punt, on Alabama's next drive, McCarron connected with DeAndrew <b>White</b> <b>for</b> a 51-yard touchdown reception and a 14–0 lead. Michigan stalled on their next drive after Denard Robinson threw an interception to Dee Milliner who returned it to Michigan's 17-yard line. On third down, Eddie Lacy rushed nine yards {{into the end zone}} for a touchdown and a 21–0 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Military {{ambulances}} {{have historically}} included vehicles based on civilian designs {{and at times}} also included armored, but unarmed, vehicles ambulances based upon armoured personnel carriers (APCs). In the Second World War vehicles such as the Hanomag Sd Kfz 251 halftrack were pressed into service as ad hoc ambulances, and in more recent times purpose built AFVs such as the U.S. M1133 Medical Evacuation Vehicle serve the exclusive purpose of armored medical vehicles. Civilian based designs may be painted in appropriate colours, depending on the operational requirements (i.e. camouflage for field use, <b>white</b> <b>for</b> United Nations peacekeeping, etc.). For example, the British Royal Army Medical Corps has a fleet of white ambulances, based on production trucks. Military helicopters have also served both as ad hoc and purpose-built air ambulances, since they are extremely useful for MEDEVAC.|$|E
5|$|Production of For Your Eyes Only {{began on}} 2 September 1980 in the North Sea, with three days {{shooting}} exterior scenes with the St Georges. The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios, {{as well as}} the ship's explosion, which was done with a miniature in Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage. On 15 September principal photography started on Corfu at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni, above Corfu Town, which acted as the location of the Spanish villa. Many of the local houses were painted <b>white</b> <b>for</b> scenographic reasons. Glen opted to use the local slopes and olive trees for the chase scene between Melina's Citroën 2CV and Gonzales' men driving Peugeot 504s. The scene was shot across twelve days, with stunt driver Rémy Julienne – who would remain in the series up until GoldenEye – driving the Citroën. Four 2CVs were used, with modifications for the stunts – all had more powerful flat-four engines, and one received a special revolving plate on its roof so it could get turned upside down.|$|E
