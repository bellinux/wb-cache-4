This Multiverse allows for bidirectional visits of inhabitants from different parallel Universes through portals which {{have nothing to do}} with the so-called ‘wormholes’. However, since portal borders are invisible and portals themselves may appear and disappear sporadically, travelling into other parallel Universes without the yet non-existent special navigation devices is dangerous, and even more so, since these journeys may involve travelling not only in space, but in time, as well. Investigation of natural portal formation mechanisms <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>creating</b> artificial portals.

Saving formats during post processing are improved by setting fixed landmarks integrated in the 3 D model in a multitask file. The D. I. C. O.

40|$|Because of {{physical}} constraints, performance gains of single-core processors {{has come to}} a halt. Computer architects have responded by adding multiple processor cores to their designs. However, for continued performance gains, multi-core designs require multithreaded applications. Manually managing individual threads becomes burdensome for large applications, and programmers therefore opt to use interfaces that abstract some of this complexity. OpenMP is one such interface. It is an industry-standard for parallel shared-memory programming. There is currently an ongoing effort to add a profiling interface called the OpenMP Tools (OMPT) API to the upcoming OpenMP 5. 0 specification. OMPT <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>creating</b> portable, high-quality performance analysis tools for OpenMP programs. Grain graphs is a recent visualization that simplifies OpenMP performance analysis. It has previously been found that the instrumentation callbacks of OMPT are almost sufficient to generate the data needed by grain graphs. However, OMPT does not describe events to measure the duration spent creating tasks, or tracing the execution of parallel for-loop chunks. In this thesis, I propose extensions that provide the necessary descriptions, and evaluate the performance impact of these extensions in the LLVM/Clang toolchain. My evaluation shows that the overheads are low. Benchmarks from the EPCC OpenMP micro-benchmark suite provoke up to 3 % increased overhead in the most important scenarios. Most HPC workloads from the BOTS and SPEC OMP 2012 application suites don't see any change in execution time. While the proposed extensions are motivated by grain graphs, they can be used by other profiling methods as well...|$|E
40|$|The high-luminosity large hadron {{collider}} (LHC) {{project at}} CERN entered into the production phase in October 2015 {{after the completion of}} the design study phase. In the meantime, the development of the 11 T dipole needed for the upgrade of the collimation system of the machine made significant progress with very good performance of the first two-in-one magnet model of 2 -m length made at CERN. The 11 T dipole, which is more powerful than the current main dipoles of LHC, can be made shorter with an equivalent integrated field. This <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>creating</b> space for the installation of additional collimators in specific locations of the dispersion suppressor regions. Following tests carried out during heavy ions runs of LHC in the end of 2015, and a more recent review of the project budget, the installation plan for the 11 T dipole was revised. Consequently, one 11 T dipole full assembly containing two 11 T dipoles of 5. 5 -m length will be installed on either side of interaction point 7.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{proposal}} is to join together {{the owners of the}} most advanced CPV technology, with respect to the state of the art, in order to research from its leading position new applications for CPV systems. In addition to opening up new markets, it will unveil possible sources of failure in new environments outside Europe, in order to assure component reliability. The proposed project will also try to improve the current technology of the industrial partners (ISOFOTON and CONCENTRIX) by accelerating the learning curve that CPV must follow in order to reach the competitive market, and lowering the cost under the current flat panel PV significantly within 3 - 4 years. The use of CPV systems in remote areas, together with harsher radiation, ambient and infrastructure conditions will help to increase the rate of progress of this technology. In addition, the ISFOC s contribution, which brings together seven power plants from seven CPV technologies up to 3 MWpeak, <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>creating</b> the most complete database of components and systems performance to be generated as well as the effects of radiation and meteorology on systems operations.

In a similar way ISOFOTON will connect up to 25 kWp CPV to the Moroccan ONE utility grid. From the research content point of view of this project, which is directly addressed by the scope of the call, the cooperative research between UPM, FhG-ISE and the two companies will be favoured by the fact that all are progressing in similar directions: developing two-stage optics CPV systems.

40|$|Purpose. The {{determination}} of a maximum annual amount of fish reared in cagesm {{which does not}} result in {{the deterioration of the}} ecological state of water cooling ponds of the Zmiev Thermal Power Plant and Kursk Nuclear Power Plant series Ι and ΙΙ. Methodology. The specific (per 1 ton of farmed fish) nutrient intake necessary for calculations was determined according to the data of own studies. For this purpose, we perfrormed the {{determination of}} the input of suspended solids into cooling ponds from cage lines. The calculation of mean fish weight increase during the period of trap exposition bsed on fish farm data allowed calculating the specific input of suspended solids from cages. The effect of artificial feeds and a mixture of feed resideus and fish of fishes collected under cages on water quality were evaluated in the condoitins of laboratory experiments. The effect of fish metabolites on water quality was taken into account according to literature data. Findings. In the specific conditions of the investigated cooling ponds, the environmentally allowable concentrations of biogenic elements are established based on the mineral nitrogen content. With the mean volume of the Zmiev Thermal Power Plant of 40. 5 million m 3, the total amount of mineral nitrogen, which can be introduced with cage aquaculture residues, is 21. 87 tons. When rearing one ton of fish in cages, 91. 3 kg of mineral nitrogen get into the cooling pond. Thus, the environmental capacity of the Zmiev Thermal Power Plant cooling pond for cage fish farming is 281. 7 tons. Accordingly, the allowable amounts of the production of cage fish farming for the Kursk NPP taking into account N content of 0. 406 mgN/dm 3 and volume of the cooling pond is 625. 5 tons.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} article. The aim of this {{research}} is to form an order of enterprise distribution system development in bases of previous investigations of regional logistics potential. The results of the analysis. Nowadays {{there are a lot of}} methods for territories’ logistics potential measuring. Previously this term was given in consideration with amount of cargo transported and implemented through the territory, but now it is supplemented by quantitative and qualitative aspects of logistics processes in the region. Authors claims that logistics potential of the region is a sum of existing and potential elements and factors of logistics infrastructure, which help to form and distribute material and accompanying flows. Forming and using of the logistics potential is aimed to ensure timely and effective movement of logistics resources with a minimum cost. The structure of logistics potential, which influences on validity of decisions connected with the distribution channels formation in specific region, was improved. It was proposed to identify such elements of the regional logistics potential as: transport potential; storage potential; transit potential; human resources potential; customers and sales potential; marketing and services potential; advantages of the economical and geographical position, or dimensional potential. Thereby, use of the system of regional logistics potential monitoring <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>creating</b> conditions for logistics service improvement and rational distribution system choice. Logistics potential of the region is a key factor that influences positively or negatively on the process of distribution. Generalized scheme of distribution system development in terms of certain region and its logistics potential was formed by the authors. Consequently, taking into account regional logistics potential will help enterprise to consider all advantages and peculiarities of the region and decries potential risks. That, in turn, will stimulate development of distribution system that will absolutely meet needs and peculiarities of the region. Conclusions and directions of further researches. As a result, investigation on regional logistics potential, on base of proposed structure, allows identifying logistics status of the territory more efficiently on any level (city level, regional or country level) and facilitating well-organized distribution system in specific region. Future investigations will be targeted to identification of the logistics potential of Ukraine’s regions, and recommendations making...|$|E
