5|$|In 2006, Airbus tested three {{styles of}} <b>winglet</b> {{intended}} {{to counteract the}} wing's induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design type to be tested was developed by Airbus and was based on work done by the AWIATOR programme. The second type of <b>winglet</b> incorporated a more blended design and was designed by <b>Winglet</b> Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas. Two aircraft {{were used in the}} flight test evaluation campaign– the prototype A320, which had been retained by Airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of winglets before it was delivered to JetBlue.|$|E
5|$|The Embraer jet, despite {{serious damage}} to the left {{horizontal}} stabilizer and left <b>winglet,</b> was able to continue flying, though its autopilot disengaged and it required an unusual amount of force on the yoke to keep the wings level.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{anticipated}} efficiency gains and development work, Airbus {{announced that the}} new winglets will not be offered to customers, claiming that {{the weight of the}} modifications required would negate any aerodynamic benefits. Instead, on 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended <b>winglet</b> design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.|$|E

25|$|In December 2011, Airbus {{filed suit}} in the western {{district}} of Texas over Aviation Partners' claims of infringement of its patents on <b>winglet</b> design and construction which were granted in 1993. Airbus' lawsuit seeks to reject responsibility to pay royalties to Aviation Partners for using its designs, despite work performed together with both parties to develop advanced winglets for the A320neo.|$|E
25|$|Kalas awakens in Mintaka, the Imperial capital, and {{receives}} both his <b>Winglet</b> and his guardian spirit back from Xelha. He also {{takes on the}} role of world-saving hero with greater enthusiasm than before, feeling he must make amends for deceiving his friends. After this, Mizuti directs the group to the lands below the Taintclouds, a poisonous layer of gas {{at the bottom of the}} sky. The atmosphere down there has become breathable over a thousand years, but this was not always the case. Due to this, the people who lived down there wore masks which could filter the air and make it possible to breathe. They also do not know when the air became safe to breathe. It is down here that the gang learn about the Sword of the Heavens, and that this area is Mizuti's homeland. Sadly, the Sword of the Heavens had been stolen by Krumly, who resented the role of guardians that the children of the Earth have inherited for generations. He therefore attempted a ritual to a pierce a hole in the Taintcoluds and beg Malpercio to release the children of the Earth from their duty. This turns out to be a mistake as Melodia and Malpercio rampage through Krumly's village. The village is saved by a last minute intervention from Kalas and the gang, but the Sword of the Heavens is broken.|$|E
500|$|At 16:56:54 BRT, the 737 and the Legacy {{collided}} almost head-on at , approximately {{midway between}} Brasília and Manaus, {{near the town}} of Matupá, [...] southeast of Manaus. The left <b>winglet</b> of the Embraer cut off about half of the Gol plane's left wing. This caused the Boeing to nosedive and enter an uncontrollable spin, which quickly led to an in-flight breakup and crash into an area of dense rainforest, [...] east of the municipality of Peixoto de Azevedo. [...] All 154 passengers and crew on board died and the aircraft was destroyed, with the wreckage scattered in pieces around the crash site.|$|E
50|$|<b>Winglets</b> {{have the}} {{opposite}} effect to washout. <b>Winglets</b> allow {{a greater proportion of}} lift to be generated near the wing tips. (This can be described as aerodynamic wash-in.) <b>Winglets</b> also promote a greater bending moment at the wing root, possibly necessitating a heavier wing structure. Installation of <b>winglets</b> may necessitate greater aerodynamic washout in order to provide the required resistance to spinning, or to optimise the spanwise lift distribution.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{covers the}} {{experimental}} examinations {{of the influence}} of attaching <b>winglets</b> to the blade tips of vortex pump impellers. The head, efficiency and power consumption as well as cavitation behavior are analyzed. At first, a series of tests compared an impeller with <b>winglets</b> with a semi-open impeller without <b>winglets</b> and to an impeller with a front shroud. The results suggest that an impeller with <b>winglets</b> leads to the highest head and the greatest efficiency. The impeller with front shroud generates higher head and efficiency than the semi-open impeller, which is frequently used for vortex pumps. A second test series investigates the cavitation performance when blade depth and diameter of impeller are varied compared to the first test series. It could be demonstrated that an impeller with <b>winglets</b> has a similar NPSH characteristic as an impeller without <b>winglets.</b> Thus <b>winglets</b> clearly improve the performance of vortex pumps...|$|R
50|$|The <b>winglets</b> were {{originally}} retrofit to production sailplanes, but now most high-performance gliders are equipped {{from the factory}} with <b>winglets,</b> or some other wingtip device. Dr. Maughmer has consulted with German sailplane designers on <b>winglets,</b> non-planar wing tips, and other aerodynamic improvements incorporated in several production sailplanes.|$|R
500|$|The upgrade will be {{available}} from 2020. [...] <b>Winglet</b> mockups, 4.7m (15½ft) high, were displayed on the MSN04 test aircraft at Le Bourget. [...] Wing twist will be modified and camber changed by increasing its height by 33 mm (1.3 in) between Rib 10 and Rib 30, along with upper-belly fairing improvements. [...] The in-flight entertainment, the flight management system and the fuel pumps {{will come from the}} A350 to reduce weight and improve reliability and fuel economy. Light checks will be required after 1,000 hr instead of 750 hr and heavy check downtime will be reduced to keep the aircraft flying for six days more per year.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, the 767 {{received}} a production boost when UPS and DHL Aviation placed a combined 33 {{orders for the}} 767-300F. Renewed freighter interest led Boeing to consider enhanced versions of the 767-200 and 767-300F with increased gross weights, 767-400ER wing extensions, and 777 avionics. Net orders for the 767 declined from 24 in 2008 to just three in 2010. During the same period, operators upgraded aircraft already in service; in 2008, the first 767-300ER retrofitted with blended winglets from Aviation Partners Incorporated debuted with American Airlines. The manufacturer-sanctioned winglets, at [...] in height, improved fuel efficiency by an estimated 6.5percent. Other carriers including All Nippon Airways and Delta Air Lines also ordered <b>winglet</b> kits.|$|E
500|$|The {{airframe}} of the A330 {{features a}} low-wing cantilever monoplane with a wing virtually {{identical to that}} of the A340. On the A330-300 one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used, while for the A340-300 both engine pylons are used, which allows the A340-300 wing to able to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW. This is as the A340's two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing, while also the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300. The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency. The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86. The wing has a very high thickness-to-chord ratio of 12.8 per cent, which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty. For comparison, the rival MD-11 has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 8–9 per cent. Each wing also has a [...] tall <b>winglet</b> instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft.|$|E
50|$|On April 2014, {{the carrier}} {{received}} its first Boeing 737-800 (registration HP-1836CMP) with Split Scimitar <b>winglets</b> {{and expects to}} retrofit all the Boeing 737s with the new <b>winglets.</b>|$|R
25|$|Wingtip devices or <b>winglets</b> {{are usually}} {{intended}} {{to improve the}} efficiency of fixed-wing aircraft. The concept of <b>winglets</b> originated in the late 19th century, but the idea remained on the drawing board. Throughout the 1970s {{when the price of}} aviation fuel started spiraling upward, NASA aeronautical engineer Richard Whitcomb began investigating and studying the feasibility of <b>winglets</b> in order to improve overall aerodynamics and reduce drag on aircraft. Whitcomb's tests finally culminated with the first successful test flight of his attached <b>winglets</b> on a KC-135 Stratotanker on July 24, 1979.|$|R
50|$|Blended <b>winglets</b> {{have been}} offered as an {{aftermarket}} retrofit for the Gulfstream II, Hawker 800, and the Falcon 2000 with <b>winglets</b> designed by Aviation Partners Inc., a Seattle, Washington-based firm that develops and markets blended <b>winglets.</b> A joint partnership of Aviation Partners, Inc. and Boeing, Aviation Partners Boeing offers blended <b>winglets</b> for the Boeing 737 Classic and Next Generation models, 757 and 767. The 737 version is now standard on the Boeing Business Jet derivative. Many operators have retrofitted their fleets with these for the fuel cost savings.|$|R
2500|$|The 737 {{has four}} {{different}} <b>winglet</b> types: 737-200 Mini-winglet, 737 Classic/NG Blended <b>Winglet,</b> 737 Split Scimitar <b>Winglet,</b> and 737 MAX Advanced Technology <b>Winglet.</b> [...] The 737-200 Mini-winglets {{are part of}} the Quiet Wing Corp modification kit that received certification in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Split Scimitar {{winglets}} {{became available}} in 2014 for the 737-800, 737-900ER, BBJ2 and BBJ3, and in 2015 for the 737-700, 737-900 and BBJ1. Split Scimitar winglets {{were developed by}} Aviation Partners Inc. (API), the same Seattle based corporation that developed the blended winglets; the Split Scimitar winglets produce up to a 5.5% fuel savings per aircraft compared to 3.3% savings for the blended winglets. Southwest Airlines flew their first flight of a 737-800 with Split Scimitar winglets on April 14, 2014. [...] The next generation 737, 737 Max, will feature an Advanced Technology (AT) <b>Winglet</b> that is produced by Boeing.

50|$|Boeing {{announced}} {{a new version of}} the 747 in October 1985, known as the 747-400, with an extended range and capacity. With that particular model, Boeing used a combination of <b>winglets</b> and increased span to carry the additional load. The <b>winglets</b> increased the 747-400's range by 3.5 percent over the 747-300, which is otherwise aerodynamically identical but has no <b>winglets.</b> <b>Winglets</b> are preferred for Boeing derivative designs based on existing platforms, because they allow maximum re-use of existing components. Newer designs are favoring increased span, other wingtip devices or a combination of both, whenever possible.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} wind tunnel {{investigations}} of <b>winglets</b> on four jet transport configurations are presented. Performance and wing root bending moment data were given. Additionally, detailed aerodynamic characteristics are {{presented at the}} design condition and also at several off design conditions for one configuration. Results of the investigations indicate that the <b>winglets</b> improve the cruise lift to drag ratio between 4 and 8 percent. These data also show that the ratios of relative aerodynamic gain to relative structural weight penalty for <b>winglets</b> are 1. 5 to 2. 5 times the ratios for wing tip extensions. The comprehensive investigation {{of the effects of}} <b>winglets</b> indicated that <b>winglets</b> produce no adverse effects on buffet onset, lateral directional stability, and aileron control effectiveness...|$|R
50|$|Some {{airlines}} {{capitalize on}} the visibility of <b>winglets</b> to passengers. American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, WestJet, airberlin and Ryanair advertise their websites on the inboard side of their 737s' <b>winglets.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{some more}} {{advanced}} birds, Confuciusornis lacked an alula, or [...] "bastard wing". In modern birds this is formed by feathers {{anchored to the}} first digit of the hand, but this digit {{appears to have been}} free of feathers and independent of the body of the wing in Confuciusornis. According to Dieter Stefan Peters to compensate for the lack of an alula, the third finger might have formed a separate <b>winglet</b> below the main wing, functioning like the flap of an aircraft. Despite the relatively advanced and long wing feathers, the forearm bones lacked any indication of quill knobs (papillae ulnares), or bony attachment points for the feather ligaments.|$|E
5000|$|The 737 {{has four}} {{different}} <b>winglet</b> types: 737-200 Mini-winglet, 737 Classic/NG Blended <b>Winglet,</b> 737 Split Scimitar <b>Winglet,</b> and 737 MAX Advanced Technology <b>Winglet.</b> [...] The 737-200 Mini-winglets {{are part of}} the Quiet Wing Corp modification kit that received certification in 2005.|$|E
50|$|At {{least three}} {{different}} <b>winglet</b> designs {{have been produced}} for the ASW-20, including a NASA <b>winglet</b> fitted to the Centrair gliders (FP), a design by Peter Masak, and a second generation <b>winglet</b> designed by Prof. Mark D.

50|$|Aircraft {{such as the}} Airbus A340 and the Boeing 747-400 use <b>winglets.</b> Other designs such as some {{versions}} of the Boeing 777 and the Boeing 747-8 omit them in favor of raked wingtips. Large <b>winglets</b> such as those seen on Boeing 737 aircraft equipped with blended <b>winglets</b> are most useful during short-distance flights, where increased climb performance offsets increased drag.|$|R
50|$|The Masak <b>winglets</b> were {{originally}} retrofitted to production sailplanes, but within 10 {{years of their}} introduction, most high-performance gliders were equipped from the factory with <b>winglets</b> or other wingtip devices. It took over a decade for <b>winglets</b> to first appear on a production airliner, the original application that {{was the focus of}} the NASA development. Yet, once the advantages of <b>winglets</b> were proven in competition, adoption was swift with gliders. The point difference between the winner and the runner-up in soaring competition is often less than one percent, so even a small improvement in efficiency is a significant competitive advantage. Many non-competition pilots fitted <b>winglets</b> for handling benefits such as increased roll rate and roll authority and reduced tendency for wing tip stall. The benefits are notable, because sailplane <b>winglets</b> must be removable to allow the glider to be stored in a trailer, so they are usually installed only at the pilot's preference.|$|R
