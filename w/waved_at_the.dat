25|$|In Maidstone {{they lived}} beside the {{railroad}} track, where Mitchell <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> only train that passed through each day. Many of the town's residents were First Nations people. Mitchell seemed athletic rather than academic, but still responded to her mother's love {{of literature and}} her father's love of music, and she briefly studied classical piano.|$|E
500|$|The {{candidates}} <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{crowd of}} 3,000 which {{had come to}} meet the plane, and rode together, with Nixon in place of honor, to a rally at City Island Stadium as Eisenhower chatted to Nixon as if the crisis had never occurred. At the stadium, Eisenhower introduced Nixon as a [...] "colleague" [...] who had been subject to [...] "a vicious and unprincipled attack" [...] but who had [...] "vindicated himself" [...] and who [...] "stood higher than ever before". The presidential candidate finished by reading two telegrams, one from Nixon's mother assuring the general of her son's integrity, and the second from Summerfield stating that the RNC had voted unanimously to retain Nixon on the ticket. Nixon then spoke, telling the crowd that {{this was one of}} two moments when he was most proud to be an American; the other had been at the victory parade in New York in 1945, when he had seen General Eisenhower go by. He called the Wheeling rally [...] "the greatest moment of my life".|$|E
500|$|Magnussen ran wide {{onto the}} first-turn run-off area on lap 38 but rejoined without spinning, and Vergne {{went off the}} track at the second corner. Vettel ran wide off the circuit and into the gravel trap at the S-turns during that lap, {{allowing}} Button to close in on him. Ricciardo closed the gap to Button that lap and attempted to pass him around the inside at the hairpin; Button defended his position, and Ricciardo ran wide. Hamilton recorded the fastest overall lap time of the race during the 39th lap, completing a circuit of one minute and 51.600 seconds. DRS was disabled on lap 41 because weather conditions continued to deteriorate. Visibility was reduced due to fading light and low cloud cover; drivers were dazzled by lights on their steering wheels. Ricciardo attempted to pass Button again that lap by taking the inside lane into the hairpin, but Button took a wide line. He passed Button at the hairpin to move into fourth position on the 42nd lap, and Button made a pit stop for full wet tyres. Sutil lost control of his car due to aquaplaning, spun and collided with the outside tyre barrier {{at the top of}} the hill at Dunlop Curve on the lap. Double yellow flags were <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> corner to warn drivers about the incident, and Whiting did not use the safety car. Sutil's car was extracted from the track by a tractor crane that lap and turned backwards toward a gap in the barrier. Bianchi lost control of his Marussia at [...] on lap 43, veering right towards the run-off area outside the Dunlop Curve. Although he applied his throttle and brake pedals simultaneously, his fail-safe system did not work because the settings of his brake-by-wire system were incompatible.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the start}} of 1998, the FIA decreed that all Formula One grids must be straight: in order to comply with this, the RAC moved the start line forward at Silverstone but not, significantly, the finish line. This led to some {{confusion}} {{at the end of}} the Grand Prix, which was scheduled for 60 laps, but was effectively 59.95 laps: it was more than a little fortunate that the timing was being taken from the finish line and not the start line as the winning car was in the pits {{at the end of the}} race and the Ferrari pit was situated between the two lines. The chequered flag is supposed to be <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> winning car and then showed to the other competitors, but it was <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> second man who thought that he had won! ...|$|E
2500|$|In NASCAR, a {{green and}} yellow flag <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time {{indicates}} that the race is being started or restarted under caution and laps are being counted. This is sometimes called a [...] "running yellow" [...] and usually occurs when a track is drying after a rain delay. The officials will utilize the cars {{in the field to}} facilitate the final drying of the course, but in order to not waste fuel (affecting fuel strategy, etc.), and delay the race further, the laps are counted towards the advertised race distance.|$|E
2500|$|To the end, Guiteau was {{actively}} {{making plans to}} start a lecture tour after his perceived imminent release and {{to run for president}} himself in 1884, {{while at the same time}} continuing to delight in the media circus surrounding his trial. He was dismayed when the jury was unconvinced of his divine inspiration, convicting him of the murder. He was found guilty on January 25, 1882. He appealed, but his appeal was rejected, and he was hanged on June 30, 1882, in the District of Columbia. At his execution, Guiteau famously danced his way up to the gallows and while on the scaffold he <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> audience, shook hands with his executioner and, as a last request, recited a poem he had written called [...] "I am Going to the Lordy". He requested an orchestra to play as he sang the poem; it was denied.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, when David Wells {{made his}} first {{appearance}} at Yankee Stadium after having been traded to the Toronto Blue Jays, his name was chanted. In his tenure with the Yankees, {{he was the only}} Yankee pitcher {{to be included in the}} Roll Call every time he pitched. Alfonso Soriano's name was chanted when he {{made his first}} appearance after being traded to the Texas Rangers. In the 2006 home opener against the Kansas City Royals, the Bleacher Creatures chanted the name of long-time Yankee outfielder Bernie Williams, who was the designated hitter that day, right after the rest of the defensive lineup. Williams, whose future in baseball was uncertain in the offseason, was in the clubhouse at the time and did not hear the Creatures. The chants continued for around 5 minutes until Williams came out and <b>waved.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the 2007 season opener, the Creatures started a chant of [...] "We want Bernie!", a reference to the fact that Williams was no longer with the team.|$|E

The crew saw a German field artillery battery setting up in Bernafay Wood and attacked the gunners with machine-gun fire, from an altitude of [...] The flyers then saw German troops in trenches {{to the east of}} the wood and engaged them with the machine-gun. As the crew flew back, they saw the 16th Manchester enter Montauban and troops of the 18th Division coming up on the left, so flew low over the ridge and <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> infantry. By [...] flashes from the reflectors were seen along the northern fringe of Montauban and a sketch was drawn for the infantry headquarters, showing the extent of the advance onto Montauban Ridge. Balloon observers and the crews of artillery-observation aircraft, spent the day spotting German artillery and directing counter-battery fire onto them, although the quantity of shell-bursts was so great, that only approximate corrections could be given.|$|E
2500|$|Bird set {{the fastest}} overall time {{in all four}} groups with a lap of one minute and 2.806 seconds. He was almost six-tenths of a second faster than Oliver Turvey in second place and di Grassi was third. Dillmann was fourth-quickest and Maro Engel was the fourth group's slowest driver. Engel was {{affected}} a problem which emerged before he could record a maximum power lap, forcing di Grassi to slow because yellow flags were <b>waved.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of group qualifying, the lap times set by Bird, d'Ambrosio, Abt, Lynn and Vergne was fast enough to enable them advancement into super pole. In what was considered [...] "a shock result" [...] by multiple motorsport publications, Lynn clinched the first pole position of his career, with a lap of one minute and 3.296 seconds in his first race meeting. He became the first driver to secure pole position in his debut Formula E race since Vergne at the 2014 Punta del Este ePrix. He was joined on the grid's front row by Abt who recorded a lap time two-tenths of a second slower than Lynn, and was quicker than the driver but lost time in the track's final sector. Abt was 0.003 seconds ahead of third-place qualifier Vergne. Bird's effort in super pole was untidy, and could not match his teammate's pace with two errors at the track's hairpins. He could go no better than fourth. D'Ambrosio could not get his car into a qualifying setup, resulting in him locking his tires at turn six, and was restricted to starting fifth.|$|E

[...] cried Mrs. Vervain, {{rising and}} giving him her hand, which she first <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> trunks and bags {{piled up in}} the vacant space {{in the front of}} the boat, [...] "what do you think of this? We are really going, immediately; we can change our minds too; and I don't think it would have been too much," [...] she added with a {{friendly}} smile, [...] "if we had gone without saying good-by to you.

Your little lot make believe there won't be anything of the sort after this Parliament! They're going to vanish at a few top notes from Altiora Bailey! Remington!--it's foolery. It's prigs at play. It's make-believe, make-believe! Your people there haven't got hold of things, aren't beginning to get hold of things, don't know anything of life at all, shirk life, avoid life, get in little bright clean rooms and talk big over your bumpers of lemonade while the Night goes by outside--untouched. Those Crampton fools slink by all this,"--he <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> woman again--"pretend it doesn't exist, or is going to be banished root and branch by an Act to keep children in the wet outside public-houses. Do you think they really care, Remington? I don't. It's make-believe. What they want to do, what Lewis wants to do, what Mrs. Bunting Harblow wants her husband to do, is to sit and feel very grave and necessary and respected on the Government benches. They think of putting their feet out like statesmen, and tilting shiny hats with becoming brims down over their successful noses. Presentation portrait to a club at fifty. That's their Reality. That's their scope. They don't, it's manifest, WANT to think beyond that.
