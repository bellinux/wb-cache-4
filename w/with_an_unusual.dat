5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological expansion rate allow {{the total amount of}} matter in the universe to be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|The Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, commonly {{known as the}} Diagram Prize for short, is a humorous literary award that is given annually to a book <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> title. The prize is named after the Diagram Group, an information and graphics company based in London, and The Bookseller, a British trade magazine for the publishing industry. Originally organised to provide entertainment during the 1978 Frankfurt Book Fair, the prize has since been awarded every year by The Bookseller and is now organised by the magazine's diarist Horace Bent. The winner was initially decided by a panel of judges, but since 2000 the winner has been decided by a public vote on The Bookseller′s website.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Sadler went to Europe {{and studied}} {{psychiatry}} {{for a year}} under Sigmund Freud. Sometime between 1906 and 1911, Sadler attempted to treat a patient <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> sleep condition. While the patient was sleeping he spoke to Sadler and claimed to be an extraterrestrial. Sadler spent years observing the sleeping man {{in an effort to}} explain the phenomenon, and eventually decided the man had no mental illness and that his words were genuine. The man's identity was never publicized, but speculation has focused on Sadler's brother-in-law, Wilfred Kellogg. Over the course of several years, Sadler and his assistants visited the man while he slept, conversing with him about spirituality, history, and cosmology, and asking him questions. A larger number of interested people met at Sadler's home to discuss the man's responses and to suggest additional questions. The man's words were eventually published in The Urantia Book, and the Urantia Foundation was created to assist Sadler in spreading the book's message. It is not known who wrote and edited the book, but several commentators have speculated that Sadler played a guiding role in its publication. Although it never became the basis of an organized religion, the book attracted followers who devoted themselves to its study, and the movement continued after Sadler's death.|$|E
