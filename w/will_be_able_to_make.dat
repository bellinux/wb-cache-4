In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model.

5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) demands {{compensation}} for her voice work in Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) pornographic video game, Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer. The argument escalates and Liz orders {{them to stop}} their bickering. After Liz leaves for Chicago, Jenna and Tracy decide to conduct a social experiment to see whether Tracy can survive better as a white woman than Jenna can as a black man, after arguing respectively that black men and white women have it harder in society. Later, while on her flight, Liz takes Jack's sedative. Liz realizes that the woman {{sitting next to her}} is Oprah Winfrey. When Liz arrives back at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy is dressed in female drag with his body covered in white makeup and soon after, Jenna enters in blackface and male drag. Jack worries that the situation has gone out of control, but Liz assures him that Oprah, who is coming to the studios, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them come to terms. As it turns out, her inflight conversation with Oprah was a hallucination. The person who Liz thought was Oprah is actually a 12-year-old girl named Pam (Raven Goodwin). Even so, Pam engages Tracy and Jenna in a heart-to-heart, and manages to settle their differences.|$|E

25|$|Fiona {{stops by}} the pawn shop to see Gideon, now that Emma has regained her memories, where {{it turns out}} that Fiona had {{reclaimed}} Gideon's heart with Curse. Then, she uses him to recover her own wand, which she uses to decipher the mysterious writings that Henry had scribbled in the page. Fiona then reads the inscriptions, which details the birth of Light and Darkness, their battle throughout the ages waged via their emissaries, the deaths of the previous Saviors and their enemies at each others' hands, and how the Final Battle will begin after the Emma's birth. After Gideon leaves to find Emma, Gold arrives in the shop, but Fiona fails to trick Gold into thinking that she had only come for her watch. When Gold confronts Fiona about her plans, she tells her son that once the Final Battle is over, the Curse will be lifted and they can be a family again. She also tells Gold that after she destroys all Light Magic, she will have so much power that she will be able to break the Laws of Magic at will, and she will even be able to bring back the dead. She tells him that she can bring back his first-born son, Baelfire, for him. She {{goes on to say that}} with her new powers, she <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his family love him as the Dark One, so that he can keep his power. However, Gold knows that is will come with a steep price and tells her that he refuses to pay the price of magic anymore slipping Fiona's wand into his hand. He forces her onto the ground with magic vowing to make her pay for what she did to Belle. Fiona tells Gold that she had deciphered Henry's writing. She learned that Darkness cannot destroy Light since Darkness isn't strong enough. However, Light can destroy Light. She explains she gave Gideon one final command; to kill Emma, and that even if she dies, Gideon will still be forced to carry out her command. Gold decides to test this and kills Fiona with her own wand, breaking the Dark Curse. This causes Snow, David, Regina, Hook, and Zelena to be transported back to Storybrooke from the Enchanted Forest while Emma and the other residents of Storybrooke regain their memories. Soon afterward Belle returns to Gold and comforts him over his actions, while Gideon arrives at the office with his own enchanted sword in hand. As expected, Gideon confronts Emma and is ready to face off against her.|$|E

500|$|During the {{ratification}} debates {{that took place}} in the states following the convention, Gerry continued his opposition, publishing a widely circulated letter documenting his objections to the proposed constitution. [...] In this document he cited the lack of a Bill of Rights as his primary objection, but also expressed qualified approval of the constitution, indicating that he would accept it with some amendment. [...] Strong pro-Constitution forces attacked him in the press, comparing him unfavorably to the Shaysites. [...] Henry Jackson was particularly vicious: [...] " [...] done more injury to this country by that infamous Letter than he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> atonement in his whole life", and Oliver Ellsworth, a convention delegate from Connecticut, charged him with deliberately courting the Shays faction. [...] One consequence of the furor over his letter was that he was not selected as a delegate to the Massachusetts ratifying convention, although he was later invited to attend by the convention's leadership. [...] The convention leadership was dominated by Federalists, and Gerry was not given any formal opportunity to speak; he left the convention after a shouting match with convention chair Francis Dana. [...] The state ratified the constitution by a vote of 187 to 168. [...] The debate had the result of estranging Gerry from a number of previously friendly politicians, including chairman Dana and Rufus King.|$|E

2500|$|On {{account of}} {{emerging}} as {{the winners of the}} 2009 season of the Indian Premier League. The team participated in the inaugural edition of the T20 Champions League along with two other Indian teams. They were runners-up of IPL 2009, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Daredevils, the toppers of the league-stage points table. They were knocked out in the group stages after losing to the Somerset Sabres and Trinidad & Tobago, who they were drawn against in Group A. After winning 2009, there were lots of expectations on Chargers. Team opened with a loss in their inaugural match against KKR but subsequently won next 3 matches. But thereafter Chargers went on to lose the next 5 matches. With a situation where many doubted whether Chargers <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> to next round but it has made it by winning next 5 consecutive matches and qualifying for playoffs. But Chargers lost both games in play offs i.e. Semi-finals and 3rd place. Before the start of auction Chargers decided not to retain any players and have put all the players in auction. The much awaited Auction in January 2011 lived up to the expectation in fact it exceeded in many ways. Team started the campaign by losing first 2 games but team won next match. Thereafter team started losing badly despite winning some games and was therefore eliminated from the competition. But team bounced back by showing pride by winning final 3 matches which didn't allow a chance for other teams for qualifiers. Team disappointing performance was clearly due to inexperience in the squad especially due to lack of Indian international batsmen. Fans of DC have criticized management for not holding back Rohit Sharma during player retention. Chargers got to play IPL matches at Hyderabad after almost 3 years but dismal performance at their home ground continued with a win against RCB being the only exception. However, in the away matches, Chargers did manage to beat Delhi Daredevils, Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Pune Warriors and Kings XI. They ended on a high with 3 consecutive wins but could not scale above 7th position in the league standings.|$|E
