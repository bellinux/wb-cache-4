2500|$|Andrew Barker of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, stating, [...] "The stock dismissal 'more of the same' {{has rarely been}} more accurately applied to a sequel than to The Hangover Part II, which ranks {{as little more than}} a faded copy of its predecessor superimposed on a more brightly colored background". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press said, [...] "Giving the people <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> one thing. Making nearly the exact same movie a second time, but shifting the setting to Thailand, is just... what, lazy? Arrogant? Maybe a combination of the two". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times also gave the film an average review stating, [...] "The Hangover Part II plays like a challenge to the audience's capacity for raunchiness. It gets laughs, but some of them are in disbelief".|$|E

2500|$|In November 2004, Dobson was {{described}} by the online magazine Slate as [...] "America's most influential evangelical leader." [...] The article explained [...] "Forget Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, who in their dotage have marginalized themselves with gaffes... Dobson is now America's most influential evangelical leader, with a following reportedly {{greater than that of}} either Falwell or Robertson at his peak... Dobson may have delivered Bush his victories in Ohio and Florida." [...] Further, [...] "He's already leveraging his new power. When a thank-you call came from the White House, Dobson issued the staffer a blunt warning that Bush 'needs to be more aggressive' about pressing the religious right's pro-life, anti-gay rights agenda, or it would 'pay a price in four years.'...Dobson has sometimes complained that the Republican Party may take the votes of social conservatives for granted, and has suggested that evangelicals may withhold support from the GOP if the party does not more strongly support conservative family issues: [...] "Does the Republican Party want our votes, no string attached — to court us every two years, and then to say, 'Don't call me, I'll call you' — and not to care about the moral law of the universe? ... Is that <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want?</b> <b>Is</b> that the way the system works? Is this the way it's going to be?
