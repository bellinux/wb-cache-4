25|$|Ælfric {{no doubt}} gained some {{reputation}} as a scholar at Winchester, for when, in 987, the abbey of Cerne (Cerne Abbas in Dorset) was finished, he was sent by Bishop Ælfheah (Alphege), Æthelwold's successor, {{at the request of}} the chief benefactor of the abbey, the ealdorman Æthelmær the Stout, to teach the Benedictine monks there. This date (987) is one of only two certain dates <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> Ælfric, who was then in priest's orders. Æthelmaer and his father Æthelweard were both enlightened patrons of learning, and became Ælfric's faithful friends.|$|E
25|$|Herodotus {{wrote his}} Histories in the Ionian dialect, {{yet he was}} born in Halicarnassus, which was a Dorian settlement. According to the Suda, Herodotus learned the Ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of Samos, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of Lygdamis, tyrant of Halicarnassus and {{grandson}} of Artemisia. The Suda also informs us that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotus's time, we now know that the Ionic dialect was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so {{there is no need to}} assume (like the Suda) that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere. Further, the Suda is the only source which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> the role played by Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.|$|E

25|$|Alderfer, {{expanding}} on Maslow's {{hierarchy of}} needs, created the ERG theory. This theory posits {{that there are}} three groups of core needs — existence, relatedness, and growth, hence the label: ERG theory. The existence group is concerned with providing our basic material existence requirements. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs are those of relatedness- the desire <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> maintaining important personal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others {{if they are to be}} satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs as an intrinsic desire for personal development. Maslow's categories are broken down into many different parts and there are a lot of needs. The ERG categories are more broad and covers more than just certain areas. As a person grows, the existence, relatedness, and growth for all desires continue to grow. All these needs should be fulfilled to greater wholeness as a human being. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization.|$|E

500|$|With the {{publication}} of A Manual of North American Birds in 1887, Robert Ridgway condensed what was known about the continent's birds into a relatively compact 642 pages and 464 outline drawings. [...] A prototype of today's field guides, it was quite successful, going into a second edition in 1896, and was described by Montague Chamberlain as [...] "far away the best thing <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> the working naturalist." [...] Nevertheless, its bulk was unwieldy {{for use in the}} field, and its identification keys depended on characteristics of the bird in the hand, not field marks. [...] Harry Oberholser characterized the quality of the illustrations as [...] "rarely equaled, never excelled" [...] in beauty and accuracy.|$|E
500|$|The Anthony Roll {{provides}} {{detailed information}} about the flags used on the ships. According to the vexillologist Timothy Wilson, the flags depicted flying from the ships are [...] "the most elaborate source <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> the flags flown on the ships of King Henry VIII, being richer in visual detail than all other sources put together." [...] Among the most striking flags in the illustrations are the elongated ceremonial streamers, shown flying from all ships in varying numbers. These feature a Saint George red cross on white ground on the hoist, nearest the flagpole, and a very long tail striped in green and white. They all feature gold paint on the red and green, and silver paint (now oxidized to black) on the white. This artistic device was used either to simulate the fluttering of the flags or to actually display the metallic thread and paint that was sometimes used to decorate them.|$|E
