25|$|Since {{the release}} of the Wii console, people have been {{exploring}} different new ways in which to use the Wii Remote. Many third-party applications are currently in development through Wii homebrew. One popular <b>Windows</b> <b>program</b> called GlovePIE allows the Wii Remote to be used on a personal computer to emulate a keyboard, mouse or joystick. Connecting the Wii Remote to a personal computer is done via a Bluetooth connection. The Bluetooth program BlueSoleil has been proven to successfully connect a Wii Remote to a PC. Still another program (like GlovePIE) is needed to utilize the Wii Remote's protocol and to use the data it offers.|$|E
