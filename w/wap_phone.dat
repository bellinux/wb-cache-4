More people are turning to wireless technology as similar trend as when PC was introduced to the market. Most of the wireless technologies are initially used for business purposes. Now, these technologies are more common for our daily-life reasons for various purposes, such as communication, information surfing, protection, etc. Particularly, the youth`s adoption of the Wireless Application Protocol (<b>WAP)</b> <b>phone</b> has rapidly increased. Unlike adults, the youth have different reasons of using a <b>WAP</b> <b>phone.</b> However, a study on the adoption of a <b>WAP</b> <b>phone</b> using the youth as a study subject is a scant.

40|$|Information {{aggregation}} is {{a method}} of customising content from the Internet for users. There are so many sources of information available to users on the Internet {{that many people are}} finding that they don’t have to time to visit every site they may want to in the small time that they have to browse in a day. The problem of information availability is exacerbated by user’s increasing reliance on WAP/WML technology as a primary information device. Most of the information available on the world wide web is not accessible to such devices. This paper describes a system developed by the authors for providing information aggregation for WAP devices.

Current popular wireless handheld devices, such as <b>WAP</b> <b>phone,</b> Palm and Pocket PC, have many inherent limitations.

Nevertheless, the home system will have to present a global and complete view of smart devices in the home without excluding devices from one or more different high-level home networking technologies. HOUSe-KEEPER proposes an open architecture into which home networking "middleware" can be "plugged". In addition to being independent of the underlying highlevel home networking technologies, it provides a means to monitor and control smart devices remotely over the Internet, as well as to easily grant access control and add some context information to them. These features are still in development for the two main highlevel home networking technologies, Jini and UPnP. Moreover, HOUSe-KEEPER offers a real prototype of a smart home network accessible from the Internet for residential end-users.

The types of information that may become accessible wirelessly are boundless, and include news, stock quotes, airline schedules, and weather and trafficinformation, to name but a few. There are two fundamental information delivery methods for wireless data applications: point-to-point access and broadcast. In point-to-point access, a logical channel is established between the client and the server.
