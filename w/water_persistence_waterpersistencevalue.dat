The persistence of the ponds was strongly tied with rainfall, location and size of the puddles. A simple power-law relationship is found to fit the relationship between the average pond depth and area well. A prognostic water balance model is derived that describes the temporal evolution of the pond area and depth, incorporating the power-law geometrical relation. Pond area increases in response to rainfall, while evaporation and infiltration act as sink terms. Based on a range of evaluation metrics, the prognostic model is judged to provide a good representation of the pond coverage evolution at most sites. Finally, we demonstrate that the prognostic equation can be generalised and equally applied to a grid-cell to derive a fractional pond coverage, and thus can be implemented in spatially distributed models for relevant vector- borne diseases such as malaria...|$|R

In Doñana Natural Area, Abalario and the Biological Reserve of Doñana, Spain (one {{of the most important}} biodiversity reserves in Europe), the {{red swamp crayfish}} was first introduced in 1974 and expanded its range quickly through marsh habitat, but distributed more slowly throughout scrubland ponds. <b>Water</b> <b>persistence,</b> salinity, and substrate can condition the presence of the species in the wild. Before the creation of the Natural Area and the Biological Reserve of Doñana, farmers dug artificial water points in some scrubland ponds to provide water throughout the year for livestock. Once declared a protected area, managers assumed control of the maintenance of the park and opened new water points as a wildlife management tool. The aim of the study presented here was to determine the environmental conditions that favor the spread of crayfish in the temporal ponds of Doñana and whether the occurrence of water points increases the spread of crayfish. For this purpose, we sampled crayfish using a sweep net in 60 randomly selected ponds in two different areas of Doñana. Crayfish occurrence was significantly related to the presence of seasonal streams connecting the ponds with refuge areas and to the presence of artificial water points within the pond. The probability of occurrence of red swamp crayfish in a pond without seasonal streams was more than 5 times lower than that in a pond with seasonal streams.

Dose-response bioassays of lettuce seed germination to increasing concentrations of six fractions of methanol-water extract were conducted and whenever inhibition of germination exceeded 90 % non-germinated seeds were transferred to distilled water and recovery of germination investigated. Only the fractions essentially composed by neutral polar compounds and by acids failed to inhibit total germination. Fractions composed by strong acids, basic compounds and fatty acids plus steroids completely inhibited total germination at 5 mg mL− 1, the former also inhibiting germination by more than 90 % at 1 mg mL− 1. In these three fractions the concentration necessary for 100 % inhibition was estimated to range between 4. 1 mg mL− 1 and 4. 4 mg mL− 1. Time needed for germination to start was always significantly increased even by fractions that failed to affect total germination. Basic compounds were the most effective in delaying the start of germination increasing it more than 4 -fold at 2 mg mL− 1 from 1. 0 to 4. 3 days.

However, {{little is known}} about which handwashing protocol is most efficacious. We evaluated six handwashing protocols (soap and water, alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS), and 0. 05 % sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high-test hypochlorite, and stabilized and non-stabilized sodium hypochlorite solutions) for 1) efficacy of handwashing on the removal and inactivation of non-pathogenic model organisms and, 2) persistence of organisms in rinse water. Model organisms E. coli and bacteriophage Phi 6 were used to evaluate handwashing with and without organic load added to simulate bodily fluids. Hands were inoculated with test organisms, washed, and rinsed using a glove juice method to retrieve remaining organisms. Impact was estimated by comparing the log reduction in organisms after handwashing to the log reduction without handwashing. Rinse water was collected to test for persistence of organisms. Handwashing resulted in a 1. 94 - 3. 01 log reduction in E. coli concentration without, and 2. 18 - 3. 34 with, soil load; and a 2. 44 - 3. 06 log reduction in Phi 6 without, and 2. 71 - 3. 69 with, soil load. HTH performed most consistently well, with significantly greater log reductions than other handwashing protocols in three models. However, the magnitude of handwashing efficacy differences was small, suggesting protocols are similarly efficacious. Rinse water demonstrated a 0. 28 - 4. 77 log reduction in remaining E. coli without, and 0. 21 - 4. 49 with, soil load and a 1. 26 - 2. 02 log reduction in Phi 6 without, and 1. 30 - 2. 20 with, soil load.

40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} a {{research}} carried out in 2001 on nine temporary mountain pools (Northern Apennines, Italy) underlined a major role of hydroperiod in shaping zooplankton communities of temporary habitats. In 2002, the same pools were studied to assess inter-annual differences in zooplankton seasonal patterns. Data on precipitations (both snow and rainfalls) were collected to evaluate the influence of precipitation regimes on hydroperiod and concurrently on hydrochemical features and zooplankton dynamics. Mean annual snow and rainfall abundances were highly similar in both years but precipitation patterns were different. Moreover, different air temperatures were measured in the 2 years of study. These factors influenced <b>water</b> <b>persistence</b> and dry and wet cycles in the pools: in 2001, three pools dried out in summer and remained dry until autumn rainfalls (type A pools), in five pools (type B pools) the summer dry period was interrupted by re-filling due to storms in July and only in one pool water did remain for the entire research period (C 1). In 2002, type A and B pools underwent only one dry phase (June–July) while C 1 showed a hydroperiod {{similar to the one}} that occurred in the previous year. Overall, type A and B pools can be classified as ‘seasonal’ and C 1 as ‘near-permanent or permanent’. Principal component analysis and paired t-tests did not show significant differences between years in the hydrochemical features of the pools. However, the seasonal pools showed a wide range of variation in their hydrochemical parameters while water features of the permanent pool presented less variability. Within the pools, divergences in the number and in the type of zooplankton taxa between the 2 years were limited. Rotifer and copepod density of the seasonal pools were comparable over years and only cladocerans exhibited distinct density dynamics. Cladoceran appeared to be associated with ionic content and influenced by the occurrence of ice-melting and by the wet phase length of the pools. On the contrary, the permanent pool showed diverse zooplankton seasonal patterns in 2001 compared to 2002. Over years, different pH values were measured; pH and conductivity varied with changing water volume, which in turn explained a significant amount of the observed variation in zooplankton densities in 2002...|$|R

Twenty-nine different weather years were used to obtain a set of savings results under each method. Variability of savings was quantified by the average standard deviation of the 29 percent savings results across all post-commissioning periods for each method. For the combined chilled and hot water savings, the average standard deviation is 0. 39 % savings for Option D using the NAC weather normalization approach, 0. 57 % savings for Option D using the standard IPMVP weather normalization approach, 0. 71 % savings for Option C with regression models using the NAC weather normalization approach, and 0. 98 % savings for Option C with regression models using the standard IPMVP weather normalization approach. The variability of savings persistence results deviate a little from variability of savings results. For the combined chilled and hot <b>water</b> <b>persistence</b> of savings, the average standard deviation across all post-commissioning periods is 0. 48 % persistence for Option D using the NAC weather normalization approach, 0. 55 % persistence for Option D using the standard IPMVP weather normalization approach, 0. 52 % persistence for Option C with regression models using the NAC weather normalization approach, and 1. 26 % persistence for Option C with regression models using the standard IPMVP weather normalization approach. Overall, the NAC weather normalization approach shows less variability in savings and persistence than the standard IPMVP weather normalization approach.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of watering with UV-LED treated wastewaters (UV-LED WW) on soil parameters. Solid-state C- 13 NMR shows that watering with UV-LED WW do not change the chemical composition of soil organic matter compared to soil watered with potable water. Regarding microbiological parameters, laccase, cellulase, protease and urease activities increase in soils watered with UV-LED WW which means that organic matter brought by the effluent is actively degraded by soil microorganisms.

Two exposure scenarios were compared: continuous exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (0. 1 - 10 ng/L EE 2) up to 100 days post-hatch (dph) and developmental exposure up to 60 dph, followed by 40 days of depuration in clean <b>water.</b> The <b>persistence</b> of effects was investigated at different biological organization levels from mRNA to population-relevant endpoints to cover a broad range of important parameters.

The site was chosen, as the boundary to a larger area where the control of mink numbers has been proposed, and as a line that will defend against any future control within the Penwith peninsula. Results of the mink raft survey are discussed in relation to otter activity along the site. Mink were found to have a strong presence and are coexisting with otter on the River Hayle. This coexistence is thought to be made possible by the availability of alternative habitats, and as a result, prey for mink. There was a significant gap found either side of the site with greatest otter activity, which suggested that otters may be acting as barriers to mink movement along the river section. Mink control will be necessary for the establishment of future water vole populations in Cornwall. The Hayle has no current records for water vole, and yet, depending on its potential habitat suitability could be selected as an area for future water vole establishment.

After 90 days of exposure, microcystins persisted in the soil and their free extractable concentrations accumulated were very low varying between 1. 6 and 3. 9 μg eq. MC-LR kg− 1 DW. Free MC-LR was detected only in roots and leaves with concentrations varying between 4. 5 and 8. 1 μg kg− 1 DW and between 0. 29 and 0. 55 μg kg− 1 DW, respectively.

To infer the origin of water network isolates and assess their potential health hazard. Methods and Results:  168 P. aeruginosa strains were isolated from tap waters and swabs of tap nozzle aerators {{of a hospital}} unit, over 2 years, and from rectal swabs and nosocomial infections. Genetic diversity among this collection was assessed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SpeI restricted genomic DNA. Virulence gene sets, biofilm properties, and hypochlorite resistance were analysed. Exactly 68 % of the water samples and 74 % of the tap nozzle aerators harboured P. aeruginosa. The strains were divided into 22 clonal lineages, with one dominant clone shown to {{have been involved in}} a nosocomial infection. Conclusions:  An important turnover among the P. aeruginosa hospital population was observed. Some clonal lineages were found to persist, spread in the unit, and diversify into clonal complexes. Rectal carriage appeared an important source of contamination of the water network. Significance and Impact of the Study:  High P. aeruginosa infra-specific population diversity suggested a broad ability in colonizing <b>water</b> networks but <b>persistence</b> analysis indicated a strong selection leading to the emergence of dominant clones...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify the richness and density of aquatic benthic macroinvertebrates after exposure to fungicides and insecticides of the rice paddy fields. In the crop seasons of 2012 / 13 and 2013 / 14, field experiments were performed, which consisted of single-dose applications of the fungicides trifloxystrobin + tebuconazole and tricyclazole, and the insecticides lambda-cyhalothrin + thiamethoxam and diflubenzuron, in 10 m 2 experimental plots, over rice plants in the R 3 stage. Control plots with and without rice plants were maintained in order to simulate a natural environment. Soil samples were collected during rice cultivation for assessment of the macroinvertebrate fauna. Chemical-physical parameters assessed in the experiments included temperature, pH and oxygen dissolved in the <b>water</b> and pesticide <b>persistence</b> in the <b>water</b> and in the soil. The application of a single dose of the pesticides and fungicides in the recommended period does not cause significant negative effects over the richness and density of the macroinvertebrates. Tebuconazole, tricyclazole and thiamethoxam showed high persistence in the irrigation water of rice paddy fields. Thus, the doses and number of applications of these products in crops should be carefully handled in order to avoid contamination of the environment...|$|R
40|$|Salmonella {{species are}} {{pathogenic}} bacteria often detected in sewage, freshwater, marine coastal water, and groundwater. Salmonella spp. can survive {{for long periods}} in natural <b>waters,</b> and the <b>persistence</b> of specific and epidemic strains is of great concern in public health. However, the diversity of species found in the natural environment remains unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the diversity of Salmonella strains isolated from different natural aquatic systems within a Mediterranean coastal watershed (river, wastewater, and marine coastal areas). A total of 574 strains isolated from these natural environments were identified by both conventional serotyping and the ribosomal spacer-heteroduplex polymorphism (RS-HP) method (M. A. Jensen and N. Straus, PCR Methods Appl. 3 : 186 – 194, 1993). More than 40 different serotypes were found, and some serotypes probably mobilized from widespread animal-rearing activities were detected only during storm events. These serotypes may be good indicators of specific contamination sources. Furthermore, the RS-HP method based on the PCR amplification of the intergenic spacer region between the 16 S and 23 S rRNA genes can produce amplicon profiles allowing the discrimination of species at both serotype and intraserotype levels. This method represents a powerful tool that could be used for rapid typing of Salmonella isolates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{persistence}} of influenza A (IA) virus in aquatic habitats {{has been demonstrated}} to be a determinant for virus transmission dynamics in wild duck populations. In this study, we investigated virus strain-related variation in <b>persistence</b> in <b>water</b> for nine wild duck isolated IA viruses of three subtypes (H 3 N 8, H 4 N 6, and H 8 N 4). Results We experimentally estimated the loss of infectivity over time in three different types of water: distilled, filtered surface water, and intact surface water. All viruses persisted longest in distilled water followed by filtered surface water with markedly reduced durations of persistence observed in the intact surface water. Strain-related variations were observed in distilled and filtered surface water but limited variation was observed in the intact surface water. Conclusions Our {{findings suggest that the}} role of surface water for long-term (between years) maintenance of AI viruses in the environment may be limited, and suggest that the physico-chemical characteristics of water, as well as microorganisms, may be of strong importance. Results also indicate that the extent of strain-related variation observed in distilled <b>water</b> may overestimate <b>persistence</b> abilities for IA viruses in the wild and supports the need to develop experiments that account for these effects to assess subtype, genotype, as well as spatial and temporal variation in the {{persistence of}} IA viruses in aquatic habitats. </p...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study examines {{the integration of}} ocean glider Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in support of wide-area oceanographic and acoustic sampling. These collaborative systems could enable the U. S. Navy to conduct multi-month unmanned maritime surveillance. Optimal sensor position in the <b>water</b> column and <b>persistence</b> are critical requirements to reduce surface expressions of such a network. An experiment was conducted in Monterey Bay to evaluate underwater gliders as mobile passive acoustic sensing platforms. Acoustic propagation modeling was used to plan experiment geometry, predict transmission loss (TL), and estimate acoustic communications performance with a USV. A medium frequency acoustic source was deployed at a range of 5. 5 km from a receiver on board a glider conducting a 1000 m dive to demonstrate that a glider can adapt to the local environment to exploit more reliable propagation paths. Results demonstrate that gliders are effective mobile platforms to support persistent acoustic sensing. The glider received transmitted signals at levels {{in close agreement with}} TL predictions. Signals were received while the glider was in motion, and reception improved during a quiet deep loiter. Given the depths, ranges, and environmental conditions studied, research and modeling suggest sufficient acoustic communication performance to promote connectivity of the proposed network.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{territory}} quality {{on the time}} and energy allocation of Oystercatchers was investigated {{on the island of}} Schiernonnikoog in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. Low quality leapfrog territories required a higher level of parental effort for successful reproduction than high quality resident territories. The time budgets of residents and leapfrogs differed slightly, the main difference occurring during the chick-rearing stage when leapfrogs spent on average 8. 2 % of the time available during low water in flight in order to transport food to the chicks, compared to only 2. 9 % in residents. In both residents and leapfrogs, inactivity (including preening) constituted a considerable part of the time budget, comprising almost 50 % of the low water period during the pre-laying stage and decreasing to 23 % during the incubation stage when each bird spent almost hat: the time on the clutch. Analysis of individual time budgets during the incubation stage revealed that time spent inactive must be considered 'surplus time' since this can be reallocated to foraging when the proportion of time devoted to incubation increased. Obligatory inactivity required less than 10 % of the rime available during low <b>water.</b> The <b>persistence</b> of 'surplus' time during the chick-rearing stage suggests that parental effort is not constrained by a shortage of time. Energy expenditure, estimated from time-budgets, agreed well with energy consumption, calculated from observed food intake, and with measurements using doubly labelled water. It varied from 2. 1 x BMR during the incubation stage to 2. 7 x BMR during the chick-rearing stage. These values are much lower than the maximum energy expenditure reported for many other bird species during the reproductive cycle. During the chick-rearing stage, daily energy expenditure of leapfrogs was 6 - 7 % higher than that of residents due to the additional costs involved in the transportation of food. Despite the fact that the reduced reproductive success of leapfrogs, as compared to that of residents, is mainly caused by the failure of the parents to provision their chicks with a sufficient amount of food, leapfrogs did not increase their parental effort to a considerable extent. This would fit the interpretation that long-living species like the Oystercatchers are reluctant to work very hard during one reproductive cycle...|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli is {{regularly}} {{used as a}} fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in recreational <b>waters</b> but its <b>persistence</b> in the environment brings its use into doubt. A secondary FIB known as Bacteroides has been {{under a lot of}} research lately. Because Bacteroides can be measured with quantitative PCR (qPCR) techniques easily, this makes it an effective FIB to detect fecal contamination. Boulevard Lake in Thunder Bay, Ontario experiences instances of elevated levels of E. coli throughout the summer seasons. For the 2011 season the Bacteroides 16 S rDNA markers were monitored and compared with the E. coli population. As both of these FIB are found in feces, influxes of fecal contamination would see increases in both populations. The planktonic E. coli population densities exceeded the Canadian Recreational Water Quality Guidelines of 2. 30 log CFU 100 ml- 1 two times throughout the summer season. These were measured at 2. 86 and 2. 38 log CFU 100 ml- 1 on July 21, 2011 and September 2, 2011, respectively. The Bacteroides biomarkers did have any significant increases during these peak periods of E. coli with p > 0. 05. This would suggest that the increased levels of E. coli may not have been due to fecal contaminants. Further investigations with a microbial source tracking approach will provide insights to the potential source(s) of E. coli in Boulevard Lake. For both 2010 and 2011, the planktonic E. coli population at Boulevard Lake was monitored...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAfter many {{outbreaks}} of enteric virus associated with consumption of drinking water, {{the study of}} enteric viruses in water has increased significantly in recent years. In order {{to better understand the}} dynamics of enteric viruses in environmental water and the associated viral risk, it is necessary to estimate viral persistence in different conditions. In this study, two representative models of human enteric viruses, adenovirus 41 (AdV 41) and coxsackievirus B 2 (CV-B 2), were used to evaluate the persistence of enteric viruses in environmental <b>water.</b> The <b>persistence</b> of infectious particles, encapsidated genomes and free nucleic acids of AdV 41 and CV-B 2 was evaluated in drinking water and surface water at different temperatures (4 °C, 20 °C and 37 °C). The infectivity of AdV 41 and CV-B 2 persisted for at least 25 days, whatever the water temperature, and for more than 70 days at 4 °C and 20 °C, in both drinking and surface water. Encapsidated genomes persisted beyond 70 days, whatever the water temperature. Free nucleic acids (i. e. without capsid) also were able to persist for at least 16 days in drinking and surface water. The usefulness of a detection method based on an intercalating dye pre-treatment, which specifically targets preserved particles, was investigated for the discrimination of free and encapsidated genomes and it was compared to virus infectivity. Further, the resistance of AdV 41 and CV-B 2 against two major disinfection treatments applied in drinking water plants (UV and chlorination) was evaluated. Even after the application of UV rays and chlorine at high doses (400 mJ/cm 2 and 10 mg. min/L, respectively), viral genomes were still detected with molecular biology methods. Although the intercalating dye pre-treatment had little use for the detection of the effects of UV treatment, it was useful in the case of treatment by chlorination and less than 1 log 10 difference in the results was found as compared to the infectivity measurements. Finally, for the first time, the suitability of intercalating dye pre-treatment for the estimation {{of the quality of the}} water produced by treatment plants was demonstrated using samples from four drinking-water plants and two rivers. Although 55 % (27 / 49) of drinking water samples were positive for enteric viruses using molecular detection, none of the samples were positive when the intercalating dye pre-treatment method was used. This could indicate that the viruses that were detected are not infectious...|$|R
40|$|Ocean colour {{remote sensing}} is a {{valuable}} tool for deriving information about key biogeochemical variables over inland, coastal and ocean waters at scales unachievable via in situ techniques. However, broader use of ocean colour data is still limited by the need for users to choose among a seemingly complicated range of available satellite products and to understand the limitations and constraints of these products across {{a wide range of}} water types. This issue could benefit from the capability to seamlessly apply and blend watertype appropriate algorithms into a single output product that provides optimal retrievals over a wide range of water types. The assessment of the fuzzy membership of satellite remote sensing reflectance (Rᵣₛ) to pre-defined regional optical water types (OWTs) provides a framework for application and blending of OWT-appropriate algorithms on a per-pixel basis. This study presents the first characterization of the OWTs in the coastal waters of South Africa. The OWTs are determined through stepwise fuzzy c-means clustering of a systematically expanding and modified database constructed from in situ, synthetic and regionally extracted Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Rᵣₛ. A database division allows separate and more detailed clustering of phytoplankton-dominated Rᵣₛ and backscattering-dominated Rᵣₛ into six and five classes respectively. Chlorophyll α (Chl α) algorithms are assigned per OWT based on lowest error and uncertainty. The blended Chl α product consists of weighted retrievals from five different algorithms, including two 4 th order polynomial exponential algorithms utilizing the blue-green spectral region, two red-NIR band ratio algorithms, and a neural network. The algorithm blending procedure retrieves satellite-derived Chl α concentration ([Chl α]) with lower RMS error and uncertainty compared to individual algorithms and provides improved capability to retrieve [Chl α] for different South African water types with a single product over a range spanning almost four orders of magnitude. The eleven OWTs are utilized in the classification and algorithm blending framework and applied to the full archive of MERIS Level 2 reflectance between the years 2002 and 2012 over South Africa's coastal <b>waters.</b> The <b>persistence</b> of the OWTs is presented and linked to the prominent environmental and physical drivers, whilst regions with low total class membership sums are discussed in terms of satellite data coverage and data quality. A time series of the blended [Chl α] product displays improved capability to capture the ranges of variability observed in the coastal, shelf and offshore environment compared to currently available regional and standard MERIS Level 2 products...|$|R
