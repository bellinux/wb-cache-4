50|$|Many Parisian streets have {{retained}} their ancient denomination {{in spite of}} city growth; today {{it is still possible}} to discern pre-1701 delimitations in Paris by marking the point where a thoroughfare's name changes from rue to rue du faubourg. For instance, the rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis used to be located outside of the city wall and was an extension of the rue Saint-Denis within the <b>walls.</b> The <b>rue</b> du Faubourg Saint-Honoré came about in a similar manner.|$|R

50|$|Although {{at first}} {{populated}} exclusively by the Genoese, the city slowly {{opened to the}} Corsicans while the Ajaccians, almost to the French conquest, were legally citizens of the Republic of Genoa and were happy to distinguish themselves from the insular paesani who lived mainly in Borgu, a suburb outside the city <b>walls</b> (the current <b>rue</b> Fesch was the main street).|$|R

This river has moderate turbidity and its brownish water is somewhat low in velocity due to the slight gradient of the watercourse; pH levels have been measured at 8.13 within the city of Dinan and electrical conductivity of the waters have tested at 33 micro-siemens per centimetre.

The primary purpose {{of this type of}} device is very often an {{aesthetic}} issue but the question of using them to reduce noise may arise. In this context, and as part of a French research project involving other scientific topics, an acoustic measurement campaign was conducted by Cerema around a green <b>wall</b> site (<b>rue</b> de la Préfecture in Cergy, near Paris). The evaluation involved the characterization of the street sound environment, before and after setting up the wall: - by directly measuring the road traffic noise. - by collecting acoustic signals generated by an omnidirectional speaker. It is shown that the infrastructure tends to reduce noise levels in the street, by observing: - moderate noise reduction (between 0 and 6 dB gain) at medium frequency (400 - 2500 Hz) that can be put down to acoustic absorption due to the planting substrate. - maximum efficiency at high frequency (between 0 and 10 dB of gain above 3150 Hz) where a scattering phenomenon caused by the foliage also comes into play...|$|R

60|$|The vessel, which {{appeared}} so inopportunely {{for the safety}} of the ill-manned British cruiser, was, in truth, a ship that had roved from among the islands of the Caribean sea, in quest of some such adventure as that which now presented itself. She was called la belle Fontange, and her commander, a youth of two-and-twenty, was already well known in the salons of the Marais, and behind the <b>walls</b> of the <b>Rue</b> Basse des Remparts, as one of the most gay and amiable of those who frequented the former, and one of the most spirited and skilful among the adventurers who sometimes trusted to their address in the latter. Rank, and influence at Versailles, had procured for the young Chevalier Dumont de la Rocheforte a command to which he could lay no claim either by his experience or his services. His mother, a near relative of one of the beauties of the court, had been commanded to use sea-bathing, as a preventive against the consequences of the bite of a rabid lap-dog. By way of a suitable episode to the long descriptions she was in the daily habit of writing to those whose knowledge of her new element was limited to the constant view of a few ponds and ditches teeming with carp, or an occasional glimpse of some of the turbid reaches of the Seine, she had vowed to devote her youngest child to Neptune! In due time, that is to say, while the poetic sentiment was at the access, the young chevalier was duly enrolled and, in a time that greatly anticipated all regular and judicious preferment, he was placed in command of the corvette in question, and sent to the Indies to gain glory for himself and his country.|$|R
