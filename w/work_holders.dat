The National Association of Social Workers with 150,000 members also offers a Certified School Social Work Specialist (C-SSWS) Certificate in school social work. It is revised form of 1992 School Social Work Credential Exam. Though, it does not replace any license or certification that individual states require of school social workers. The Illinois State Board of Education requires that all students applying to an educator licensure program take and pass the Test of Academic Proficiency (TAP) and submit an ACT plus writing certificate with composite score higher than 19-22 and the same should be dated less than 10 years before submission. A passing score on the Basic Skills Test from the past 10 years will also be accepted.|$|E

40|$|In Indonesia, {{the various}} mining {{commodities}} {{and the amount}} of resources and reserves are promising, as evidence there are numerous large-scale mining companies and small-scale mines in operation. In 2014 there were 41 companies that held the CoW (mineral contract of work) and 13 companies active in production; and 76 CCoW (coal contract of <b>work)</b> <b>holders,</b> and 57 companies active in production. As well as this, {{there are more than a}} thousand small-scale mining companies active for mining commodities. However, mining commodities provide a resource that is not renewable. This will potentially lead to prolonged problems when mining companies do not adhere to good mining practices, particularly in the closing stages of the mine. Mine closure is the final stage in the process of mining activity. In certain circumstances, closure activities can take a long time and of course can have huge costs. In fact, at this stage, the company is no longer making profit, only incurring costs for the project closure. To prevent problems that may arise after the mine is closed, such as abandoned post-mining land, and the bankruptcy of the company at the end of mining operations, etc., then through specific rules, ie rules of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources No. 18 of 2008, the mining company in Indonesia must provide a certain amount of money as a financial guarantee to finance the planned closure project; it must be approved by the government before entering this phase. However, problems are encountered in practice. The government may become overloaded because they have to quickly make a decision on the closure plan submitted by the company. So a tool is needed that can be used to assess the feasibility as soon as the mine closure plan is proposed by a company, these tools can provide an overview and a variety of options for decision making. In this dissertation methodology was developed to create a systems dynamic model of mine closure. The model developed can be applied to a variety of mining methods and for various mining commodities. The model can be used to determine the closure costs, to choose the closure project-financing scenario, and up to micro and macro economic analysis of mining activities in the region. In the case studies conducted in this dissertation, the best scenario of the mine closure planning is to include the everlasting fund in the form of time deposits, and convert the post-mining land for agriculture. The amount of deposit money is about USD 358, 986, 500 should be spare at the end of mine production, and the total of mine closure cost to be approximately USD 440, 757, 384. Agriculture, the economic sector as a substitute for the mining sector, the added value to the GRDP (Gross Regional Domestic Product) is about 0. 25 % / a for the province, and 1. 68 % for the regency, but the contribution of the mining sector to GRDP was 30 % / a at province scale, and 90 % / a at regency scale. So that the substitution value is less significant to GRDP growth. However, this scenario is the best scenario among others, due to consideration is the certainty of ecological and economic sustainability. it is the best goal of corporate social responsibility to the environment in the post- mining land...|$|E

While most regular <b>Work</b> Permit <b>holders</b> are relatively happy and healthy, our study finds that 62 per cent of injury and salary claim workers meet the screening conditions for a Serious Mental Illness. We find that the three main drivers of psychological distress are (1) the housing problems of injury and salary claim workers, (2) threats of repatriation against both injured and regular workers, and (3) agent fee debt. We recommend a range of policy options to address these problems, including alternative housing for injury and salary claim workers; delinking Work Permit holdersâ€™ visas and employment contracts; and regulation of offshore migration agents...|$|R

Economically, the country was up the creek. The miners had been on strike, along with the grave-diggers, the bakers and almost everybody else.
