40|$|Objective: The Aim of {{this present}} study it the planning, growth and {{implementation}} of Environmental Management System ISO 14001 : 2004 in the Hospital of Athens, which has never been implemented in Greece in the public {{as well as in}} the wider private institution. Material -Method: Became imprinting of being in effect situation with regard to the environmental management of medical waste in the hospitals of Administration of Health Region (D. Y. PE.) of Attica. An environmental review which constitutes the first step for the growth of Environmental Management System. Took place in three Public Hospitals of Athens, the Anticancer Hospital "Agios Savvas”, the University Hospital “Laiko" and the General Hospital "Thriasio". A analysis followed: § The choice of Hospital in which the pilot application of Environmental Management System would be implemented. The Hospital that was selected was Anticancer "Agios Savvas" because of the particularity of care that it is granted to the patients with result the production of big quantities of chemotherapy waste. § The fixing of the Committee of Environmental Management of Hospital. § Was determined of the Environmental Policy of Hospital. § Were recorded the environmental aspects and repercussions in all the laboratories, the clinics and departments of Hospital. § Were determined the environmental aims - objectives of Hospital and were determined environmental programs. § Development of questionnaires per category of personnel. § In Hospitals Anticancer “Agios Savvas" and University “Laiko” followed distribution and completion of questionnaires in order to have an estimatation the level of knowledge, attitude and behaviour of personal as long as it concerns the management of medical waste. The questionnaire was supplemented before and after the education. § Realised education of personnel in year 2006 and was organised Training Program. § Developed Argued Processes, Directives, Documents and Files of E. M. S. § Was drawn up Handbook of Environmental Management. § Was drawn up Internal Regulation of Management Medical Dangerous and not Medical Waste. § Was drawn and developed electronic base of data. Results: Observed the changes with regard to the developed beds of Hospitals and the <b>weight</b> <b>list</b> of waste. Moreover, it was observed after the education of personnel, an improvement of environmental conscience with increased degree of concern for the environment. As long as it concerns the Departments of Hospital Infections after the acquisition of specialised knowledge with regard to the EMS, they see to for the education of personnel, so much on issues ecological practices and saving of energy, as long as on issues of environmental management and control. Regard to the departments of Supplies that existed, important changes with regard to the specifications for the supplies of goods and the services of Hospital. The result was that they proceeded in modifications of terms of competitions, placing ecological criteria insofar as really it is feasible, seeking products that are friendly with the environment. The Sanitary staff and remaining auxiliary personnel has existed victim of working accident at the hour of work, in percentage 61, 39 %. It deserves to mark that, from the personnel that has suffered wound percentage 26, 61 % him it has not declared to the Committee of Hospital Infections. The analysis of data has resulted that in percentage 100 % the medical personnel and administrative him has not reported in the Committee of Infections. In percentage 75 % the nursing personnel and the personnel of cleanness, have been injured and him he has not declared while as long as it concerns the scientific not medical personnel the corresponding percentage amounted in 6, 14 %. In the percentage of 26, 37 % the personnel is not vaccinated for Hepatitis B, and in percentage 45 % is not vaccinated for the Tetanus. In regard to the results after the education of personnel it resulted that existed statistically important increase of level of knowledge of all categories of workers with regard to the management of medical waste. Remarkable it is that percentage of equitable answers was altered in most questions by 10 % that was before the education in 70 %, 80 %, 90 % until 100 % after the education. Deductively from above it becomes perceptible that the education constitutes the decisive tool for the equitable application of Environmental Management System. The comprehension of the contribution of application of Environmental Management System in the space of health in the modern season it constitutes subject of more major importance, in which it will be supposed is demonstrated the proportional attention, in view the big changes of devalorisation that exist last the quality of environment and what threaten always more the public health. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method for classifying a dataset that partitions elements into their categories.

A grid-like structure is required {{as part of a}} novel idea of converting a 1 -D row of real values into a 2 -D structure of value bands. Each cell in any band then stores a distinct set of weights, to represent its own importance and its relation to each output category. During classification, all of the output <b>weight</b> <b>lists</b> can be retrieved and summed to produce a probability for what the correct output category is. The bands possibly work like hidden layers of neurons, but they are variable specific, making the process orthogonal. The construction process can be a single update process without iterations, making it potentially much faster. It can also be compared with k-NN and may be practical for partial or competitive updating...|$|R
