5|$|In a 2013 study, Yule et al. {{looked into}} mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and asexuals. The results of 203 male and 603 female {{participants}} {{were included in}} the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual male participants <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they more likely than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to their striking, superficial similarity to contemporary shrimp, Waptia fieldensis were also very shrimp-like in their habits. They were bottom-dwelling (nektobenthic) deposit feeders. The lack of strong feeding appendages indicates that they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> feed by sifting through the sea bottom for edible organic particles. Their tails and the feather-like filaments on their posterior thoracic somites also imply that they were active swimmers.|$|E

5|$|When compared, Black signers {{were more}} likely than were White signers to produce signs outside of the typical signing space and to use two-handed signs. Adverbs are most likely to use a larger signing space. Less marked forms, such as pronouns, determiners, plain verbs, and nouns, tend to be less likely to be {{produced}} outside the typical signing space. The selection of two-handed signs over one-handed signs was found to have systematic constraints on their production. When the sign could be produced with one or two hands, Black signers often produced the variant that matched the handedness of the following sign; if the following sign was two-handed, they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> produce a two-handed variant, while if the following sign was one-handed, they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> produce the one-handed variant.

The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have this symptom, suggesting a contagious condition may be a causal factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, thus possibly suffered from CCD.|$|E

Survival following intentional overdoses with up to 63,000mg (63g) of metformin have been reported. Fatalities following overdose are rare.

40|$|Copyright © 2015 UCLA Law Review-All Rights Reserved. Of the large, public {{companies}} {{that seek to}} remain in business through bankruptcy reorganization, only 70 percent succeed. The assets of the other 30 percent are absorbed into other businesses. Success is important both because it is efficient and because it preserves jobs, communities, supplier and customer relationships, and tax revenues. This Article reports {{the findings of the}} first comprehensive study of the variables that determine whether a business will succeed or fail. Eleven conditions best predict companies' survival prospects. First, a company that even hints in the press release announcing its bankruptcy that it intends to sell its business is highly <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Second, reorganizations assigned to <b>more</b> experienced judges <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Third, companies headquartered in isolated geographical areas <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Fourth, companies that report greater shareholder equity <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Fifth, companies with routinely appointed creditors' committees <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail. Sixth, companies with debtor-in-possession (DIP) loans <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Seventh, companies that prepackage or prenegotiate their plans <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Eighth, companies that file in periods of low interest rates <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Ninth, larger companies <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Tenth, manufacturers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. Eleventh, companies with positive pre-filing operating income <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed. System participants may be able to improve survival rates by shifting cases to more experienced judges and perhaps also by paying greater attention to the decisions to appoint creditors' committees, to prenegotiate plans, to obtain DIP loans, and to publicly seek alliances...|$|R
5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality.

Homosexual women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E
