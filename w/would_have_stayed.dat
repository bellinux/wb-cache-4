5|$|While Árbenz {{was living}} in Montevideo, his wife came to join him. He was also visited by Arévalo a year after his own arrival there. Although the {{relationship}} between Arévalo and the Árbenz family was initially friendly, it soon deteriorated due to {{differences between the two}} men. Arévalo himself was not under surveillance in Uruguay and was occasionally able to express himself through articles in the popular press. He left for Venezuela a year after his arrival to take up a position as a teacher. During his stay in Uruguay, Árbenz was initially required to report to the police on a daily basis; eventually, however, this requirement was relaxed a little. María Árbenz later stated that the couple was pleased by the hospitality they received in Uruguay, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> there indefinitely had they received permission to do so.|$|E

One suggestion was that the new vehicle would be built in Europe and carry a mix of European and U.S. instruments. NASA would provide the rocket to deliver it to Mars and provide the sky crane landing system. Despite the proposed reorganisation, {{the goals of the}} 2018 mission opportunity <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> broadly the same.|$|E

25|$|The prosecution's {{version of}} the story and their counter-points against the defence's version, was based on replies by {{witnesses}} and backed by evidence. The towel that Ahuja was wearing was intact on his body and had neither loosened nor fallen off. In the case of a scuffle, it is highly improbable that the towel <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> intact. After Sylvia's confession, a calm and collected Nanavati dropped his family to the theatre, drove to his naval base and according to the Navy log, had acquired a gun and rounds, under a false pretext. This indicated that the provocation was neither grave nor sudden and that Nanavati had the murder planned. Ahuja's servant Anjani testified that three shots were fired in quick succession and the entire incident took under a minute to occur, thus ruling out a scuffle. Nanavati walked out of Ahuja's residence, without explaining to his sister Mamie (who was present in another room of the flat) that it was an accident. He then unloaded the gun, went first to the Provost Marshal and then to the police to confess his crime, thus ruling out that he was dazed. The deputy commissioner of police testified that Nanavati confessed that he had shot dead Ahuja and even corrected the misspelling of his name in the police record.|$|E
500|$|Washington was {{extremely}} angry with his troops' conduct, calling their actions [...] "shameful" [...] and [...] "scandalous". The Connecticut militia, {{who already had}} a poor reputation, were labeled cowards and held {{to blame for the}} rout. However, others were more circumspect, such as General William Heath, who said, [...] "The wounds received on Long Island were yet bleeding; and the officers, if not the men, knew that the city was not to be defended." [...] If the Connecticut men <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> to defend York Island under the withering cannon fire and in the face of overwhelming force, they would have been annihilated.|$|E

Himself and one squaw and one [...] stayed all night; and being in English clothes, the governor set him at his own table, where he behaved himself as soberly ... as an Englishman.

500|$|After Baldwin was {{defeated}} at the 1929 British parliamentary election, Ramsay MacDonald of the Labour Party became prime minister. MacDonald desired {{a conference of}} Indian and British leaders in London to discuss India's future, {{a course of action}} supported by Jinnah. Three Round Table Conferences followed over as many years, none of which resulted in a settlement. [...] Jinnah was a delegate to the first two conferences, but was not invited to the last. [...] He remained in Britain for most of the period 1930 through 1934, practising as a barrister before the Privy Council, where he dealt with a number of India-related cases. His biographers disagree over why he remained so long in Britain—Wolpert asserts that had Jinnah been made a Law Lord, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> for life, and that Jinnah alternatively sought a parliamentary seat. [...] Early biographer Hector Bolitho denied that Jinnah sought to enter the British Parliament, while Jaswant Singh deems Jinnah's time in Britain as a break or sabbatical from the Indian struggle. [...] Bolitho called this period [...] "Jinnah's years of order and contemplation, wedged in between the time of early struggle, and the final storm of conquest".|$|E
500|$|An early {{title for}} the album was When All Is Said and Done More Is Said Than Done, {{suggested}} by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, just {{because there has been}} this new life breathed into the band with the addition of Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E
500|$|Another {{proposal}} {{would have used}} a Saturn V to achieve a direct ascent mission profile. The spacecraft consisted of four modules. The Retrograde Module would have been powered by an RL10 engine, and used to propel the spacecraft during the trans-lunar coast. During landing, it {{would be used for}} the initial phases of powered descent. At an altitude of [...] above the Lunar surface, the RM would have been jettisoned, and a second module, the Terminal Landing Module, would have performed the final descent. After landing, the spacecraft <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> on the Moon for a day, before it was propelled back to Earth. Launch from the Lunar Surface and trans-Earth injection would have been performed by the Service Module, which would also have contained components of the life support system, and other systems which were located in the Equipment Module of the Earth orbit Gemini spacecraft. The Reentry Module was based on the Gemini capsule, but would have been modified to allow it to reenter the atmosphere at the higher velocity that would have been required by a Lunar flight. It was seen as the last effort by NASA managers and engineers who still advocated the direct ascent mission profile, and was intended to be cheaper, faster and safer than the Apollo lunar orbit rendezvous technique.|$|E

500|$|A {{pre-season}} injury {{kept him}} out of the entire 1980–81 season, during which time he coached the reserves. In this time he converted Steve Bould from a striker into a centre-back. Smith returned from injury in 1981–82, and featured regularly early in the season, and by the time another injury forced him out of the team, Stoke were sitting in 18th-place. He joined York City, who were struggling in the Fourth Division, on a one-month loan in March 1982. He debuted in a 3–1 home defeat to Hull City on 16 March 1982, and scored once for York, in a 4–2 loss away to Wigan Athletic on 2 April. Smith made seven appearances while on loan at York, and exerted his influence on the team by organising the defence; he commented that [...] "They had been crying out for an older head like me". He was recalled by Stoke manager Richie Barker as the defence struggled in his absence, and Smith re-established himself in the team as they avoided relegation. He was handed a free transfer to York in May 1982. He said that if he had been offered a coaching role at Stoke he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed,</b> but that Barker wanted him gone as he saw him as a threat to his position. In total, Smith made 493 appearances for Stoke, a club record for a centre-back.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Pauline embarks on {{a romance}} {{with a new}} character, Joe Macer (Ray Brooks), whom she meets at salsa classes. A {{relationship}} develops, and despite her initial trepidation, Pauline remarries in 2006, after almost a decade alone. Pauline's marriage to Joe {{was an attempt to}} give the character a [...] "new lease of life", and her wedding day was screened to coincide with EastEnders 21st anniversary. Richard was openly opposed to her character remarrying, but she was eventually convinced by the executive producer and battled, successfully, for Pauline to keep the [...] "Fowler" [...] surname. However, in July 2006, Wendy Richard announced that she was leaving EastEnders; she quit due to [...] "creative differences" [...] with the show's producers regarding Pauline's remarriage, which she felt was [...] "disloyal" [...] to her character's beloved first husband, Arthur. According to an interview in The Sun, Richard commented, [...] "I think it's the most terrible shame, I really do. I thought in my heart of hearts it was wrong... I just couldn't believe that Pauline would remarry—anybody... I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> a bit longer if Pauline hadn't got married." [...] Richard felt that she did not have the same chemistry with Ray Brooks, who played Joe, as she did with Bill Treacher, who played Arthur. She refuted producers' opinions that Pauline and Joe [...] "looked good together" [...] and felt that she and Brooks had to work very hard to turn them into a [...] "realistic-looking couple." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, Columbus severed {{their ties}} with Filatov, trading {{him to the}} Ottawa Senators in {{exchange}} for a third-round pick. Filatov left his family vacationing in the Dominican Republic and joined the Senators for their development camp at Scotiabank Place in Ottawa. He made the Senators out of training camp, but was a healthy scratch several times, splitting his time with Ottawa and the Binghamton Senators of the AHL. In November 2011, the Ottawa Citizens Allen Panzeri reported from sources in Columbus that Filatov had refused to play the style the Blue Jackets asked of him, saying to his coach, [...] "Filly [...] don't do rebounds." [...] In December, the Senators offered Filatov the choice to play {{the rest of the season}} with CSKA Moscow of the KHL and Filatov agreed. Senators General Manager Bryan Murray suggested it was better for his development as Murray felt that Filatov needed to work on becoming stronger and compete harder to make it in the NHL. Head Coach Paul MacLean felt Filatov's struggles in the NHL were surprising, considering he had 12 points in 15 games in the AHL. Filatov himself stated that he had to get better. MacLean had hoped that Filatov <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> and worked on his game in Binghamton, but Murray explained that it was more lucrative for Filatov to play in the KHL than at Binghamton, and did not block the transfer. Filatov did not immediately agree to terms with CSKA. For a few days it appeared that Filatov would not sign a contract with CSKA, so the Senators assigned him to Binghamton and threatened to suspend him in order to remove him from the Senators' salary cap. On December 18, 2011, Filatov agreed to a contract with CSKA Moscow.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} when the Prince became lord of the manor of Risborough there was a manor house and hall {{on the west side of}} the church (where there is now a car park), which old books {{describe}} as his [...] "palace". This is misleading. It was the manor house (see below) and he as lord of the manor <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> there when he came to Risborough, but it was hardly palatial and might be better described as a hunting lodge. The Prince seems never to have spent an extended period of time there. The nearest place where he lived for any length of time was Berkhamsted Castle, where he stayed after his marriage to Joan Countess of Kent from November 1361 to January 1362 and occasionally at other times.|$|E

Bob's king no longer plays, because the ace on the board plays as the fifth card in both hands, and a hand is only composed of the best five cards. They therefore tie and split the pot. However, had the last card been a jack or lower (except an eight or a queen which would make a full house, or a ten which would give Carol a higher second pair), Bob's king <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> in the game and would have won.|$|E

Ferguson recorded drums in Berlin, but according to Coleman, was fired because he wasn't able to manage the precise timings, a version of events that Raven later rejected. The latter stated: [...] "I know Paul and when he does something he does it properly. If it wasn't right he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> there 'til it was".
