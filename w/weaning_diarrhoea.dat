40|$|Diarrhoea is {{a common}} {{cause of death in}} {{children}} and weaned animals. Recent research has found that serotonin (5 -HT) in the gastrointestinal tract {{plays an important role in}} regulating growth and the maintenance of mucosa, which protect against diarrhoea. To determine the influence of 5 -HT on intestinal epithelium cell renewal under <b>weaned</b> stress <b>diarrhoea,</b> a weaned-stress diarrhoea mouse model was established with senna infusion (15 mL/Kg) via intragastric administration and stress restraint (SR). Mice with an increase in 5 -HT were induced by intraperitoneal injection with citalopram hydrobromide (CH, 10 mg/Kg). The results demonstrated that compared with the control animals, <b>diarrhoea</b> appeared in <b>weaned</b> stress mice and the 5 -HT content in the small intestine was significantly increased (P< 0. 05). Further, the caspase- 3 cells and cells undergoing apoptosis in the small intestine were significantly increased, but the VH (villus height), V/C (villus height /crypt depth), and PCNA-positive rate significantly decreased. Compared with the control animals, CH increased the intestinal 5 -HT content, caspase- 3 cells and cells undergoing apoptosis but decreased the VH and V/C. Compared with both control and weaned stress animals, weaned stress animals that were pre-treated with CH showed higher 5 -HT concentrations, positive caspase- 3 cells and cells undergoing apoptosis but lower VH, V/C and PCNA-positive rate. In vitro, a low concentration of 5 -HT inhibit, IEC- 6 cell line apoptosis but a higher concentration of 5 -HT promoted it. Therefore, <b>weaned</b> stress <b>diarrhoea</b> mice were accompanied by a 5 -HT increase in the small intestine and vice versa, and the increase in 5 -HT induced by CH caused diarrhoea. In brief, 5 -HT and diarrhoea slowed the intestinal epithelium cell renewal and injured the abortion function and mucosal barrier by decreasing VH, V/C and proliferation and increasing epithelium cell apoptosis. </p...|$|R

A total of 156 pigs (10 to 70 days post <b>weaning)</b> with <b>diarrhoea</b> were randomly selected from 20 herds: The pigs were subjected to necropsy, histopathology, immunohistochemistry and faecal quantification of Lawsonia intracellularis by real time PCR. Results The median Lawsonia intracellularis excretion was significantly higher in pigs with gross lesions of proliferative enteropathy (median excretion: 5. 92 log 10 bacteria/g faeces) compared to pigs without gross lesions of proliferative enteropathy (median excretion: 10 bacteria/g faeces) (P L. intracellularis excretion was 0. 50 (P Lawsonia intracellularis excretion level for increasing proliferative enteropathy histopathology and immunohistochemistry scores was demonstrated (P P L. intracellularis excretion was 0. 67 (P L. intracellularis excretion was 0. 77 (P Conclusions The histological and quantitative PCR detection of Lawsonia intracellularis were correlated in pigs with diarrhoea.

40|$|At {{the time}} of weaning, piglets are under many stress {{factors such as the}} end of milk immunity, {{separation}} from the mother, mixing with other animals, the adaptation to new diets and new pens, etc. Piglets usually show a non infection malabsorption syndrome response and Immunological System depression. Some bacteria such as Escherichia coli can make use of that situation and grow producing the Post <b>Weaning</b> <b>Diarrhoea</b> Syndrome. This syndrome produces an awkward situation for the productive rates and for animal welfare. 	The cause of this disease is multifactorial and therefore {{it makes no sense to}} look for an individual solution. Homeopathic and phytotherapeutic prophylaxis, and in that case, the addition of Origanum vulgare to the piglet’s diet could improve the weaners’ health but, anyway, a slight improvement will be achieved if the stress factors are not reduced or changed. 	Improving the management and the composition of the nourishement, better management of the creep area, avoiding fights at weaning, controlling the feed intake, keeping work organized, weaning animals with similar ages and as late as possible, offering the optimum environment for the different ages, working with trained people, etc. are key points to produce healthy weaners. All these actions can offer a small response if we evaluate them individually but they can significantly improve the Post <b>Weaning</b> <b>Diarrhoea</b> Syndrome if they are working in a synergic way. ...|$|E

Acta vet. scand. 2002, 43, 231 - 245. – The ability of feed related measures {{to prevent or}} reduce post <b>weaning</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> (PWD) was examined in a split litter study including 30 pigs from 6 litters allotted into 5 groups. Four groups were exposed to 3 pathogenic strains of E. coli via the environment at weaning. Three of them were given zinc oxide, lactose+fibres or non-pathogenic strains of E. coli as probiotics. The challenged and the unchallenged control groups were given a standard creep feed. Diarrhoea was observed in all challenged groups but not among uninfected animals, and the incidence of diarrhoea was lower in the group given nonpathogenic E. coli compared to all other challenged groups. The severity of PWD also differed between litters. When corrected for mortality due to PWD, a decreased incidence of diarrhoea was also seen in the groups given zinc oxide or lactose+fibres. The dominating serotype of E. coli within faecal samples varied from day to day, also among diarrhoeic pigs, indicating that diarrhoea was not induced by one single serotype alone. The diversity of the faecal coliform populations decreased in all piglets {{during the first week}} post weaning, coinciding with an increased similarity between these populations among pigs in the challenged groups. This indicated an influence of the challenge strains, which ceased during the second week. The group given lactose+fibres was least affected with respect to these parameters.

40|$|Maternal {{beliefs and}} {{perceptions}} about breastfeeding and weaning were investigated {{in a series}} of in-depth, open-ended interviews with 20 mothers of infants aged 2 - 12 months in a poor neighborhood of metropolitan Cairo during July-September 1990. The traditional pattern of breastfeeding well into or through the second year of life is changing rapidly, although essentially all mothers still wish to breastfeed and do so at least initially. Beliefs and behaviors reported varied somewhat by rural/urban origins of the mother herself, but exhibited consensus on many issues. The ability to breastfeed successfully is perceived to be a blessing, and to require maturity, patience and a sense of responsibility. The quantity and quality of breast milk are believed to be influenced by a wide variety of factors including the childs age and individual characteristics, the psychological and physical state of the mother, and her diet. Mothers reported a number of behaviors that are perceived to influence the quality of breast milk including changes in their diet when the infant was ill and behaviors designed to optimize the humoral qualities (hot/cold, light/heavy) of the milk. Supplementation with sugar water begins very early, and gradual introduction of other foods generally is begun soon after 40 days of age. Mixed formula and breastfeeding is commonly perceived to increase the nutritional quality of the childs diet. Weaning is ideally related to developmental milestones (walking, complete dentition) but often occurs early due to a variety of factors including maternal illness, desire for another pregnancy, and perceptions that breast milk may be inadequate. Weaning is perceived to be a difficult and dangerous transition. The timing of weaning may be influenced by perceptions of summertime as a time of heightened risk of diarrheal illness, by the mothers decision regarding fasting during Ramadan, and by a desire to minimize the period of vulnerability to illness between the time of weaning {{and the beginning of the}} following month in the Islamic calendar. breastfeeding <b>weaning</b> Egypt <b>diarrhoea...</b>|$|R

The epidemiology of porcine group A rotavirus was studied in commercial herds of pigs in New Zealand. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Dakopatts, Copenhagen) was found to be highly sensitive (100 %) and specific (96. 8 %) for the detection of group A rotavirus in pig faeces when compared to electron microscopy (EM). A highly sensitive and specific ELISA test for the measurement of antibody against group A rotavirus in pigs was also developed. Of 521 faecal samples collected from Massey University Piggery in a cross-sectional survey, 47 (9 %) were positive for group A rotavirus by the ELISA test. Only sucking (19. 3 %) and weaner (14. 4 %) pigs were shedding rotavirus. Rotavirus was not detected in the faeces of fattener pigs (over two months old) or adult pigs including sows and boars. Three cohort studies revealed that all pigs became infected with group A rotavirus before they were 40 days of age and shed the virus for an average of eight days. Some of the piglets shed rotavirus a second time approximately 10 days after the first period of shedding. All piglets ceased to shed the virus by two months of age. Rotaviral shedding was associated with the occurrence of milk scours in sucking piglets. <b>Diarrhoea</b> in <b>weaner</b> pigs (post-weaning <b>diarrhoea,</b> PWD) was more closely associated with the presence of haemolytic E. coli than with rotavirus in faeces. Infection with group A rotavirus was transmitted from piglet to piglet and from litter to litter. In one cohort of 50 piglets from five litters, shedding of rotavirus was first detected in one litter, then in the second litter two days later, and finally in other litters of piglets. Over a period of 16 days, all piglets in the five litters were infected. Group A rotavirus was also detected in dust, faeces and effluent collected from the farrowing and weaner houses, and from a weaner house which had not been used for three months. Rotavirus was not detected in any of the sows (11) during the period of investigation. Neither was rotavirus detected in fattener pigs (from two months of age to the time of slaughter), nor in the environments where old pigs (fattener and sow houses) were housed. It was not therefore possible to confirm that adult pigs, especially sows, act as carriers for rotaviral infection of young piglets as has been suggested by other workers. All the piglets acquired maternal antirotaviral antibody from their dams and the levels of antibody in piglets' sera were comparable to those in the colostrum of their dams. The maternally-derived antibody was also detected in piglets' faeces. Antibody in sera and in faeces declined rapidly after birth. Rotaviral shedding commenced in each of the cohorts when the geometric mean ELISA antibody titre fell below 1 / 1600 (equivalent to serum neutralizing antibody titre of 1 / 8 to 1 / 16). However, this correlation between antibody titres and protection was not observed in individual litters. In each of the cohorts studied, rotaviral shedding was usually detected initially in one or two piglets of a litter. The infection then spread to other piglets within the same litter and, finally, to piglets of other litters in the same group. Onset of rotaviral infection in particular litters was related to their location in the farrowing unit rather than to the levels of antibody. The shedding pattern of group A rotavirus was studied further in another five New Zealand piggeries and was found to be similar to that observed at the Massey University Piggery. Faecal samples from these piggeries were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and no common electrophoretype of group A rotavirus was found in these piggeries. More than one electrophoretype of group A rotavirus was detected in three of these piggeries. Faecal samples collected from Massey University Piggery were also analyzed by PAGE and it was found that rotaviruses detected during {{the first two years of}} the present investigation had identical electrophoretypes, but one isolate detected in the third year had a distinctively different pattern. Non-group A rotaviruses were also detected for the first time in New Zealand. Nine samples had an electrophoretic pattern similar to that of group C rotavirus and one was similar to that of group B rotavirus. One of the samples containing group C rotavirus was from two litters of piglets with diarrhoea at two to four days of age. In one of these piggeries, five electrophoretypes of rotaviruses representing three groups were detected. These observations indicate that rotaviral infections are important causes of milk scours in piglets, and are probably significant in exacerbating PWD. The epidemiology of rotaviral infections is complicated by a number of factors. These include the continuous transmission of virus from pig to pig and from litter to litter, the survival of the virus in the piggery environment, the incomplete protection afforded by maternally-derived antibody, and the simultaneous circulation of different strains and different groups of rotavirus in one piggery...|$|R

40|$|Probiotics {{are defined}} {{as a group of}} live microorganisms, {{including}} some microbial stimulants that exert health promoting effects, such as the maintenance of a normal intestinal microbiotia, increased nutritional value of foods, anticarcinogenic activity, reduction of serum cholesterol levels, alleviation of lactose intolerance and stimulation of the immune system. Some of strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are representative probiotics. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the immunomodulatory and antiinfection properties of a new identified LAB strain- Bifidobacterium lactis using two animal models. Two experiments were conducted and reported in this thesis. In the first experiment, a piglet <b>weaning</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> model was used to test the efficacy of Bifidobacterium lactis HN 019 protecting against diarrhoea associated with Rotavirus and E. coli. 17 three-week-old piglets were allocated into two groups balanced for liveweight and litter of origin. The first group (n= 8) was orally administered B. lactis HN 019 (109 cfu/piglet/day) through the experiment; the second group (n= 9) was not given B. lactis HN 019 (control). After one week, the animals were penned individually and weaned onto a weaner diet. Blood samples were taken to measure the antibody responses, cell proliferation, and phagocytic activity of leukocytes (monocytes and neutrocytes). Also the effect of B. lactis HN 019 on <b>weaning</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> was assessed by monitoring the severity of diarrhoea, feed intake and liveweight gain of the piglets on the weaner diet. Compared to the controls, piglets receiving B. lactis HN 019 had lower severity of <b>weaning</b> <b>diarrhoea,</b> higher survival rate and feed conversion efficiency (or liveweight gain). The protection was associated with lower levels of faecal rotavirus and E. coli shedding, higher phagocytie activities and cell proliferative response to mitogens, and higher specific antibody titers. These results suggest that dietary B. lactis can reduce the severity of <b>weaning</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> associated with rotavirus and E. coli, and the probiotic is associated with enhanced immune responsiveness. In the second experiment, the protective effects of Bifidobacterium lactis HN 019 against E. coli O 157 :H 7 and associated immunological parameters were investigated using murine models. After one week acclimatisation on a skim milk powder (SMP) -based diet, eighty-six BALB/c and C 57 mice were selected and randomised to two treatment groups. One group was fed on the SMP-based diet until the end of the experiment, while the other group was fed the SMP-based diet supplemented with B. lactis HN 019 (3 x 108 cfu/g). After one week on these diets, mice were intragastrically inoculated with 0. 1 ml E. coli O 157 :H 7 suspension (109 cfu/ml). Protection against E. coli O 157 :H 7 infection was assessed by monitoring the morbidity, feed intake, bacterial translocation to visceral tissues (spleen and liver) and immune responsiveness. Phagocytic activities of blood and peritoneal cells, and antibody titres against E. coli O 157 :H 7 in intestinal content were also measured. The results showed that B. lactis HN 019 -fed mice conferred a significant degree of protection against E. coli O 157 :H 7 challenge in comparison to the control mice that did not receive B. lactis HN 019. Protection included lower morbidity and higher post-challenge feed intake, reduced pathogen translocation to blood, spleen and liver, as well as significantly higher phagocytic activities of blood and peritoneal cells and anti-E. coli IgA level in gut content. These results suggest that B. lactis HN 019 can enhance the host resistance to E. coli O 157 :H 7 and that the protection is associated with enhanced immune functions. In summary, potential immune enhancing effects of B. lactis HN 019 were investigated in one pig trial and one mice trial. The results showed that supplement of B. lactis HN 019 relieved diarrhoea associated with rotavirus and E. coli infection in piglets and enhance the host resistance to E. coli Ol 57 : 117 challenge in mice. Immunological measurements indicated B. lactis HN 019 fed groups had significant higher phagocytosis and anti-E. coli IgA levels. And the pathogen shedding was also reduced in B. lactis HN 019 fed groups. As concluded, B. lactis HN 019 can provide a protective role against special enteric pathogen infection by its immunomodulatory effects...|$|E

It was followed by the Enteronid group, the control group and the Agrocell group. No difference between groups was found in haptoglobin values. Electrolyte values (sodium, potassium and chloride) coincided with faecal scores: lower faecal score meant better values of electrolytes and conversely.

The majority of the women gave the fermented foods to infants from the age of four months. Although most of the infants were introduced to the fermented and malted foods from the age of four months, the foods were not given to infants very often, with the exception of mahewu.

Segments with a cranial inflow tube and a caudal outflow tube were fitted in the small intestine of 5 -week old anaesthetized piglets. The odd numbered segments were infused with ETEC and the even segments with PBS, whereupon the segments were perfused over 8 h.

Housing and feeding conditions were characterised by a large heterogeneity within and between European countries. On many farms, the feeding regimes seemed suboptimal, leaving ample room for easily feasible improvements. With respect to the health management, some farms made comprehensive use of the various options, whereas many farmers neglected the implementation of preventive measures, including appropriate hygiene and disinfection measures. On the majority of organic farms with indoor housing, the options for disinfection were hindered by the fact that many farms were not able to implement an all-in all-out concept. In correspondence with the large variation in the living conditions for pigs, also production data and mortality rates differed widely between organic pig farms. According to the estimation by the farmer concerning the occurrence of selected animal health problems, mortality of suckling piglets and weaners and <b>weaning</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> were named as the most relevant disease problems. Although dedicated to the same minimum standards, it can be concluded that organic pig farming does not provide the same living conditions or a homogenous outcome of animal health parameters but, like all systems, also depends on the quality of management. Differences in management practices, housing conditions, restrictions in the availability of resources (labour time, financial budget etc.), and a lack of feedback and control mechanism within the farm system appears to be a main reason for the substantial variation between farms...|$|E
40|$|The {{restrictions}} {{on the use of}} antibiotic and anthelmintic treatments in organic pig farming necessitate alternative non-medical control strategies. Therefore, the antibiotic and parasite-reducing effect of a fructan-rich (prebiotic) diet of dried chicory was investigated in free-ranging piglets. Approximately half of 67 piglets from 9 litters were experimentally infected with Ascaris suum and Trichuris suis in the suckling period (1 to 7 weeks of age) and 58 of the piglets were challenged daily with E. coli O 138 :F 8 for 9 days after weaning to induce <b>weaning</b> <b>diarrhoea.</b> The litters were fed either chicory (30 % DM) or a control diet. The effect of chicory on intestinal helminths, intestinal microbiota, especially Bifidobacteria and Campylobacter spp., and E. coli post-weaning diarrhoea was assessed. The weight gain of the piglets was not impaired significantly by chicory. The intestinal A. suum worm burden was reduced by 64 % (P= 0. 034) in the chicory-fed piglets, whereas these same piglets had 63 % more T. suis worms (P= 0. 016). Feeding with chicory elicited no changes among the main bacterial groups in ileum according to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. However, the terminal-restriction fragment (T-RF) 208 bp, which may belong to Lachnospiraceae, was stimulated by the chicory feed (P= 0. 03), and T-RF 370 bp that matches Enterobacter belonging to the Enterobacteria was reduced (P= 0. 004). Additionally, chicory increased the level of Bifidobacteria (P= 0. 001) and the faecal Campylobacter excretion level was transitorily reduced in chicory-fed piglets at 7 weeks of age (P= 0. 029). Unfortunately, {{it was not possible to}} assess the effect of chicory on post-weaning diarrhoea as it did not develop. In conclusion, feeding piglets chicory around the time of weaning caused complex changes of the microbiota and parasite communities within the intestinal tract, and feeding piglets chicory may therefore serve as an animal-friendly strategy to control pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Post <b>weaning</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> is {{a common}} problem in pig production. The causes are multifactorial, but most often {{associated}} with infection of pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli in the small intestine. The aim of these studies was to investigate some of the physiological and managemental factors involved at weaning. The lectin phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) {{is known for its}} growth promoting properties from studies on suckling rats and pigs. The hypothesis was that enteral exposure would induce precocious maturation, leading to a gastrointestinal (GI) tract better prepared for weaning. PHA-treated pigs grew slower during the treatment week before weaning, and in one of the two studies presented here; the PHA-treated pigs had a higher body weight (BW) gain than the control pigs in the week immediately following weaning. PHA treatment resulted in lower diarrhoea scores, a more beneficial feeding pattern and a tendency to greater feed intake. Effects on physiological parameters were shown, with a lower uptake of marker molecules, and a more adult disaccharidase pattern in PHA-treated pigs. No differences were found regarding immunological status, weight and length of the intestinal organs, the pancreatic enzyme activities or feed conversion ratio. It was investigated how pigs of different relative size (small, medium and large) in a group of 10 pigs were affected by receiving feed from a feed dispenser with 2 feeding places per pen, or from a trough where all pigs could eat at the same time. Also, comparisons were made between keeping pigs as unmixed litters staying in their farrowing pen after weaning, or mixing and moving them to a new pen on the day of weaning. Trough feeding resulted in lower diarrhoea scores for the small and large pigs, and higher scores for the medium pigs. All size categories had longer feeding bouts when fed at a trough, and longer total feeding times on day 1 (small pigs) and 5 (large pigs) after weaning. The feed conversion ratio was lower during the second week after weaning for the pigs fed from feed dispensers. The mixing and moving procedure resulted in lower BW gain compared to that of pigs weaned as whole litters, which was most pronounced in small pigs. Mixed and moved pigs also had lower feed intakes and higher diarrhoea scores (small and large pigs) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{inclusion}} in the diet of different sources of soya bean meal (SBM) on growth performance, total tract apparent digestibility (TTAD) and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of major dietary components and mucosal ileum morphology were studied in Iberian pigs weaned at 30 days of age. From 30 to 51 days of age (phase I), there was a control diet based on regular soya bean meal (R-SBM; 44 % CP) of Argentina (ARG) origin and five extra diets in which a high-protein soya bean meal (HP-SBM; 49 % CP) of the USA or ARG origin, either ground (990 μm) or micronized (60 μm), or a soya protein concentrate (SPC; 65 % CP) substituted the R-SBM. From 51 to 61 days of age (phase II), all pigs were fed a common commercial diet in mash form. The following pre-planned orthogonal contrasts were conducted: (1) R-SBM v. all the other diets, (2) SPC v. all the HP-SBM diets, (3) micronized HP-SBM v. ground HP-SBM, (4) HP-SBM of ARG origin v. HP-SBM of US origin and (5) interaction between source {{and the degree of}} grinding of the HP-SBM. Dietary treatment did not affect growth performance of the pigs at any age but from 30 to 51 days of age, post <b>weaning</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> (PWD) was higher (P< 0. 001) and the TTAD and AID of all nutrients were lower for pigs fed the R-SBM diet than for pigs fed the HP-SBM or the SPC diets. However, no differences between the HP-SBM and the SPC containing diets were detected for any trait. The TTAD of organic matter (P= 0. 07) and gross energy (GE) (P= 0. 05) tended to be higher for the micronized HP-SBM than for the ground HP-SBM and that of GE was higher (P< 0. 05) for US meal than for the ARG meal. Pigs fed R-SBM had lower villus height (P< 0. 01) than pigs fed HP-SBM or SPC but no differences in ileal mucosal morphology were detected between SPC and HP-SBM containing diets. It is concluded that feeding the HP-SBM or SPC-reduced PWD and improved nutrient digestibility and ileal morphology as compared with feeding the R-SBM, but had no effect on pig performance. The {{inclusion in the}} diet of added value soya products (micronized SBM or SPC) in substitution of the R-SBM increased the TTAD of all nutrients and reduced PWD but had no advantage in terms of growth performance over the use of ground HP-SBM...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{production}} is perceived by consumers {{as being superior}} in animal welfare and sustainability {{and the demand for}} organic pork products is slowly increasing. Within the past ten years a variety of husbandry and management systems have been developed across the EU, ranging from farms with pigs outdoors all year round using local breeds to farms with housed pigs having concrete outside runs and using conventional breeds (CorePIG, Rousing et al, 2011). So far, mainly clinical parameters have been used to describe the health situation on organic pig farms, identifying some key problems, such as <b>weaning</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> and piglet mortality. Organic pig {{production is}} - amongst others - characterised through a holistic approach based on the EU Regulation (EC) No 834 / 2007 and the IFOAM principles: ‘health, ecology, fairness and care’. This clearly states that health is more than absence of clinical symptoms and, the relation between animals and their environment is identified: ‘Health’ is defined as ‘the wholeness and integrity of living systems. It is not simply the absence of illness, but the maintenance of physical, mental, social and ecological well-being’ (IFOAM; 2006). Concepts of animal welfare include physical and mental welfare as well as the concept of naturalness (Fraser 2003), which is often interpreted as the ability to perform natural behaviour. Verhoog et al (2003) describe three main approaches within organic agriculture’s concept of nature and naturalness: the no-chemicals approach, the agro-ecology approach and the integrity approach. Applying those concepts to organic pig production can highlight potential conflicts: outdoor systems are perceived as the optimal housing system for pigs, as they allow natural behaviour such as rooting. However, this behaviour can cause damage to the grass cover and furthermore the manure fate in outdoor areas needs to be considered. A few studies on outdoor pig production have shown a clear N and P surplus and a high degree of distribution heterogeneity in outdoor areas, increasing the risk of N and P losses (Watson et al. 2003). Robust and competitive organic pig production needs to encompass low environmental impacts and good animal health and welfare. So far few studies have quantified both aspects in different pig husbandry systems. In addition, the theory that improving animal health and welfare reduces environmental impacts through decreased medicine use, improved growth rate and feed conversion efficiency has still to be verified. The aim of the CoreOrganic 2 project ProPIG (2011 - 2014; carried out in eight European countries) is {{to examine the relationship between}} health, welfare and environmental impact. On-farm assessment protocols will be carried out on 75 farms in three pig husbandry systems (outdoor, partly outdoor, indoor with concrete outside run). Environmental impact will be assessed using both Life Cycle Assessment and calculations of nutrient balances at farm and outdoor area level. Animal health and welfare will be evaluated from animal based parameters including clinical and selected behavioural parameters. Results will be fed back and used by the farmers to decide farm specific goals and strategies to achieve these goals. As an outcome, all farms will create their individual health, welfare and environmental plan, which will be reviewed after one year to allow continuous development. This will provide the opportunity not only to investigate, but also improve the influence of organic pig farming systems on animal welfare and environmental impact. This fulfils the fourth IFOAM principle of care: ‘Organic Agriculture should be managed in a precautionary and responsible manner to protect the health and well-being of current and future generations and the environment’ (IFOAM, 2006). ...|$|E
