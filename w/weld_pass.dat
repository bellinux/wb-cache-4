40|$|Though butt-welds {{are among}} the most {{preferred}} joining methods in aerostructures, their strength dependence on inelastic mechanics is generally the least understood. This study investigated experimental strain distributions across a thick aluminum U-grooved weld and identified two weld process considerations for improving the multipass weld strength. One is the source of peaking in which the extreme thermal expansion and contraction gradient of the fusion heat input across the groove tab thickness produces severe angular distortion that induces bending under uniaxial loading. The other is the filler strain hardening decreasing with increasing filler pass sequences, producing the weakest welds on the last <b>weld</b> <b>pass</b> side. Both phenomena are governed by <b>weld</b> <b>pass</b> sequences. Many industrial welding schedules unknowingly compound these effects, which reduce the weld strength. A depeaking index model was developed to select filler pass thickness, pass numbers, and sequences to improve depeaking in the welding process. The result was to select the number and sequence of weld passes to reverse the peaking angle such as to combine the strongest <b>weld</b> <b>pass</b> side with the peaking induced bending tension component side to provide a more uniform stress and stronger weld under axial tensile loading...|$|E

40|$|In current 3 -dimensional multi-pass {{repair weld}} {{simulations}} each pass is generally modelled {{as a single}} continuous weld bead using either a simultaneous bead deposition or a progressive bead deposition moving heat source approach. In reality the length of typical manual metal arc (MMA) repair welds often necessitates {{the use of multiple}} weld beads for any individual pass. To investigate the modelling assumptions associated with this approximation a series of results are presented that simulate the deposition of a multi-bead, single MMA <b>weld</b> <b>pass</b> on a stainless steel flat plate. The simulations make use of a fabricated single bead weld test specimen to define the welding conditions. A number of different heat source models and bead sequencing scenarios have been investigated. These include moving heat source simulations, simultaneous bead laying methods (also called "block-dumped" methods) and combinations of the two. The work provides a useful insight into how certain modelling approximations affect weld residual stress distributions. It is concluded that moving heat source end effects are not sensitive to modelling assumptions made in weld beads remote from the stop end. However, residual stress predictions at the mid-length of a multi-bead <b>weld</b> <b>pass</b> on a flat plate are sensitive to the modelling assumptions. In particular, modelling each bead of a multi-bead <b>weld</b> <b>pass</b> can increase the stresses at mid-length relative to a simulation that deposits the whole pass in one go. One further observation made is that modelling the central bead of a multi-bead <b>weld</b> <b>pass</b> using a block-dumped technique (allowing a symmetry boundary condition to be used perpendicular to the weld bead) can result in inaccurate or misleading results...|$|E

40|$|Weld filler alloys that exploit {{transformation}} plasticity through low austenite to {{martensite transformation}} temperatures offer an effective method of reducing residual stresses in strong steel welds. However, in multipass welds, the heat input from later <b>weld</b> <b>passes</b> may be insufficient to retransform prior <b>welding</b> <b>passes,</b> {{leading to the}} accumulation of thermally induced strains and elevated residual stresses. In this work, the residual stress distributions produced around arc welds fabricated with a martensitic weld filler alloy that transforms at a low temperature have been studied {{as a function of}} the number of passes deposited and the interpass temperature. It is found that when the interpass temperature is above the transformation temperature of the weld metal, the entire multipass weld transforms as a single entity, thus permitting the optimum exploitation of the transformation plasticity. In contrast, the deposition of new metal with a relatively low interpass temperature leads to increased residual stresses in the underlying layers, reducing or eliminating the beneficial stress states previously created...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of microstructure and crystallographic texture {{has been investigated}} in double-sided friction stir welded microalloyed steel, using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The microstructure analyses show that the centre of stirred zone reached a temperature between Ac 1 – Ac 3 during FSW, resulting in a dual phase austenitic/ ferritic microstructure. The temperatures in the thermo-mechanically affected zone and the overlapped area {{between the first and}} second <b>weld</b> <b>pass</b> did not exceed the Ac 1. The shear generated by the rotation probe occurs in austenitic/ferritic phase field where the austenite portion of the microstructure is transformed to a bainitic ferrite, on cooling. Analysis of crystallographic textures with regard to shear flow lines generated by the probe tool, show the dominance of simple shear components across the whole weld. The austenite texture at Ac 1 – Ac 3 is dominated by the B{ 11 ̅ 2 } and ¯B { 1 ̅ 12 ̅ } simple shear texture components, where the bainite phase textures formed on cooling were inherited from the shear textures of the austenite phase with relatively strong variant selection. The ferrite portion of the stirred zone and the ferrites in the thermo-mechanically affected zones and the overlapped area underwent shear deformation with textures dominated by the D 1 { 1 ̅ 1 ̅ 2 } and D 2 { 112 ̅ } simple shear texture components.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the characterisation of residual stress in electron beam welded P 91 ferritic– martensitic steel plates (9 mm thick) by neutron diffraction and contour measurement methods. The novelty {{of the work}} lies in revealing the residual stress profile at a fine length scale associated with a ∼ 1 mm wide fusion zone. A characteristic ‘M’ shaped distribution of stresses across the weld line is observed with high tensile peaks situated just beyond the heat affected zone/parent material boundary. Measured stresses close to the weld centreline are significantly less tensile than the adjacent peaks owing to martensitic phase transformation during cool down of the weld region. The effect of applying a second smoothing <b>weld</b> <b>pass</b> is shown to be undesirable from a residual stress standpoint because it increases the tensile magnitude and spread of residual stress. The results are suitable for validating finite element predictions of residual stress in electron beam welds made from ferritic–martensitic steels. ...|$|E
