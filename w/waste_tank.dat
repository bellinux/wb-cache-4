50|$|The term zinc-air {{fuel cell}} usually {{refers to a}} zinc-air battery in which zinc metal is added and zinc oxide is removed continuously. Zinc {{electrolyte}} paste or pellets are pushed into a chamber, and waste zinc oxide is pumped into a <b>waste</b> <b>tank</b> or bladder inside the fuel tank. Fresh zinc paste or pellets are taken from the fuel tank. The zinc oxide waste is pumped out at a refueling station for recycling. Alternatively, this term may refer to an electrochemical system in which zinc is a co-reactant assisting the reformation of hydrocarbons at the anode of a fuel cell.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the approach used {{to resolve the}} Nuclear Criticality Safety Issue for the Hanford Site high-level <b>waste</b> <b>tanks.</b> Although operational controls {{have been in place}} at the Hanford Site throughout its operating life to minimize the amount of fissile material discarded as waste, estimates of the total amount of plutonium that entered the <b>waste</b> <b>tanks</b> range from 500 to 1, 000 kg. Nuclear criticality safety concerns were heightened in 1991 based on a review of waste analysis results and a subsequent U. S. Department of Energy 1399 review of the nuclear criticality program. Although the DOE review team concluded that there was no imminent risk of a criticality at the Hanford Site tank farms, the team also stated its concern regarding the lack of definitive knowledge of the fissile material inventory and distribution within the <b>waste</b> <b>tanks</b> and the lack of sufficient management support for the overall criticality safety program. An in-depth technical review of the nuclear criticality safety of the <b>waste</b> <b>tanks</b> was conducted to develop a defensible technical basis to ensure that <b>waste</b> <b>tanks</b> are subcritical. The review covered all relevant aspects of nuclear criticality safety including neutronics and chemical and physical phenomena of the waste form under aging waste conditions as well as during routine waste management operations. This paper provides a review of the technical basis to support the conclusion that given current plutonium inventories and operating conditions, a nuclear criticality is incredible. The DOE has been requested to close the Nuclear Criticality Safety Issue. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board is currently reviewing the technicalbasis...|$|R

50|$|Chemical toilets {{are large}} enough for a single occupant, usually about 110 cm square by 210 cm high. While the units are {{typically}} free-standing structures, their stability is augmented {{by the weight of}} the <b>waste</b> <b>tank,</b> which usually contains an empty liquid disinfectant dispenser and deodorizer. Some include both a seated toilet and a urinal. Most include lockable doors, ventilation near the top, and a vent pipe for the holding tank. When wind is blowing over the vent pipe it creates a low pressure area sucking the odor out. Leaving the toilet lid open will reverse the flow of the venting of the tank.|$|E

The fabric was wrapped around hoops of 109 cm diameter, the top hoop was connected to the ceiling. One of the suggestions was for the nozzle of the suction head to be more flexible, increasing its utitlity. The hose for the spray head connected {{at the top of the}} shower.

50|$|Airport GSE {{comprises}} {{a diverse}} range of vehicles and equipment necessary to service aircraft during passenger and cargo loading and unloading, maintenance, and other ground-based operations. The wide range of activities associated with aircraft ground operations lead to an equally wide-ranging fleet of GSE. For example, activities undertaken during a typical aircraft gate period include: cargo loading and unloading, passenger loading and unloading, potable water storage, lavatory <b>waste</b> <b>tank</b> drainage, aircraft refueling, engine and fuselage examination and maintenance, and food and beverage catering. Airlines employ specially designed GSE to support all these operations. Moreover, electrical power and conditioned air are generally required throughout gate operational periods for both passenger and crew comfort and safety, and many times these services are also provided by GSE.|$|E

50|$|Heaton used by {{the main}} express {{operator}} of the East Coast Main Line to store stock overnight. In 2004-06, {{this led to a}} dispute between the RMT and then operator GNER. Legally in the UK, train operators are allowed to discharge 5 imp gal of sewerage per carriage per journey, on to the railtrack. Most Mk3 carriages have only holding tanks, not fully compliant toilet tanks. Further, Heaton then had no toilet clean-out facilities. However, in the 2000s both the RMT and politicians were concerned at the environmental impact of this legacy issue. In 2006 the RMT agreed <b>waste</b> <b>tank</b> and clean out developments at Heaton with GNER, plus new clean out procedures at all other depots, to solve an ongoing dispute over sewerage spray.|$|E
5000|$|Another common pairing are {{portable}} toilets on trailers known commonly as a [...] "toilet trailer". These trailers {{are typically}} found in 1-2 toilet configurations {{with a hand}} wash ability using either a hand washing station or a plastic barrel full of water. These trailers are often seen on agricultural fields or at road construction sites. These restrooms are ideal for situations where the workers (users) are very mobile. However, this configuration has proven problematic; most modern portable toilet <b>waste</b> <b>tank</b> designs have proven inadequate {{to deal with the}} common problem of splash-outs from the waste holding tank while being towed down bumpy roads. Also, when being towed, the high winds blow in from the vents, creating a hurricane effect inside and ejecting any toilet paper rolls from the portable toilet if not secured.|$|E

Regrettably {{only a small percentage of}} carpet cleaning companies use truck mounts as the cost is usually between $10,000.00 to $35,000.00 US, and is therefore out of reach for many small companies and professionals.

The <b>wastes</b> in <b>tank</b> 106 -AP and 107 -AP are primarily from B-Plant strontium processing and PUREX neutralized cladding removal, respectively. The <b>waste</b> in <b>tank</b> 106 -AW originated primarily from the partially concentrated product from 242 -A Evaporator Campaign 94 - 2. Approximately 8. 67 million liters of <b>waste</b> from these <b>tanks</b> will be transferred to tank 102 -AW during the campaign.

5000|$|In the UK train {{operators}} {{are allowed to}} discharge 5 imp gal of sewage per carriage per journey onto the track. Most Mark 3 carriages have no retention tanks, discharging onto the track via a U-bend/pipe near the bogies, and in the 2000s both the RMT trade union and politicians were concerned at {{the environmental impact of}} this legacy issue. The problem was first raised in 2003 after Railtrack staff at [...] abandoned local clean-up and then track maintenance procedures due to an excessive build-up of sewage waste in the area. In 2006 the RMT agreed <b>waste</b> <b>tank</b> and clean-out developments at Northern Rail's Heaton depot in 2006 with GNER, and new clean-out procedures at all other depots, to solve an ongoing dispute over the previous 18 months. By 2011, the European Union had started a formal investigation to see whether trains composed of such carriages were breaking EU environmental and health laws, although the Environment Agency confirmed that train companies claimed special exemptions to dump waste on the track. In 2013, Transport Minister Susan Kramer branded the practice [...] "utterly disgusting" [...] and called on the industry to take action. ATOC responded by stating that, as all new vehicles had to be fitted with compliant toilet tanks, withdrawal of the HSTs by the end of 2017 would solve the problem.|$|E
