5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> {{frustrating}} {{at first but}} eventually we {{found a way to}} communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|I went to New York {{and we were}} in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E

25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
500|$|In an April 2007 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Fey revealed {{that she was}} once called [...] "the c word" [...] by one of her writers. In discussion of this, she said, [...] "That C-word thing actually did happen. I was furious, and I had this weird reaction where I kept saying, 'You can't say that! My parents love me!'" [...] In another interview, she was asked whether the c-word was based on experience, to which she said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> based {{on the experience of}} having someone call you that and not knowing how to deal with it.". [...] In December 2015 Fey revealed that the writer who called her [...] "the c word" [...] was Colin Quinn.|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} was praised by civil libertarians. Former President of the Victorial Council of Civil Liberties, Robert Richter QC, {{said that the}} {{decision was}} important [...] "because the pressure is to say, 'Well, do anything' if the case {{is said to be}} a terrorist case. That is unacceptable, the Court of Appeal has said it's unacceptable." [...] University of Melbourne evidence law professor Andrew Palmer said that [...] "I think that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> naive to think that they could interview somebody and gather admissible evidence... when that person was being held in conditions which were possibly oppressive... I don't really know what they were thinking." ...|$|E

500|$|Following Alive or Just Breathings release, {{the album}} having been written and {{recorded}} for two guitarists, the band decided {{to expand and}} become a fivesome; Dutkiewicz moved to guitar and former Aftershock drummer Tom Gomes filled in the vacant drummer position. [...] After Leach was married on April 20, 2002 and began touring again he fell into a depression. Leach left the band {{a few days before}} the band was meant to play a show and sent the band members an e-mail telling them he had quit.

500|$|Christopher Reeve, {{star of the}} Superman films, {{expressed}} his approval of the show:I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> skeptical when I heard about [...] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what {{they are able to}} do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{fluency in}} several languages, Sarria was {{assigned}} to Intelligence School. However, following a routine background check for security clearance, he was advised that {{he would no longer}} be in the program. Sarria assumed that it was because investigators discovered his homosexuality. [...] "I mean I had no lisp, but I wasn't the most masculine guy in town... So I think that they figured that I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> gay." [...] Sarria officially remained attached to the Signal Corps but was ordered to Cooks and Bakers School and trained as a cook. After graduating from cooking school, he {{was assigned to}} train as a scout, but deliberately failed the training because of the dangerous nature of the assignment. He was then assigned to the motor pool.|$|E

500|$|Missing {{his wife}} {{whom he had}} married two weeks prior to the tour, Jesse Leach left Killswitch Engage {{in the middle of}} their first {{national}} tour. With a combination of depression, missing his wife, and throat problems, Leach sent D'Antonio an email just a few days before the band was scheduled to play a show, announcing his departure. D'Antonio stated in an interview that [...] "after three years of hanging out with the dude, and considering him a brother, to just get an email <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> harsh." [...] Killswitch Engage very quickly set up auditions to fill the vocalist position in the band and eventually settled on Howard Jones, who was at the time the frontman of Blood Has Been Shed. Jones very quickly had to learn a set of songs to tour with the band. Leach and the rest of the band quickly reconciled and remained close friends.|$|E
500|$|Several {{tracks were}} {{recorded}} and mixed {{that were not}} included on Rival Factions. These songs were compiled with their previous remixes to form an EP. A cover of [...] "Lucretia, My Reflection" [...] by the Sisters of Mercy was also included. The Kane Mutiny EP was released exclusively on iTunes in November 2007. [...] Shortly after its release, the band uploaded a cover of [...] "This Time of the Year" [...] by Brenda Lee on iTunes. [...] "Our version <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more like A Nightmare Before Christmas ," [...] declared Schwab. The single was well received and led Project 86 to build an entire EP around the Christmas concept. This Time of Year EP was released in November 2008. Unlike the previous EP, This Time of Year was made available in digital and physical formats. Jason Martin of indie rock outfit Starflyer 59 helped record both albums.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Fellini {{drew his}} three leading players from people {{associated}} with the 1954 film Donne Proibite (Angels of Darkness), directed by Giuseppe Amato, in which Masina played the very different role of a madam. Anthony Quinn was also acting in the film, while Richard Basehart was often on the set visiting his wife, actress Valentina Cortese. When Masina introduced Quinn to her husband, the actor was disconcerted by Fellini's insistence that the director had found his Zampanò, later remembering: [...] "I thought he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> crazy, and I told him I wasn't interested in the picture, but he kept hounding me for days." [...] Not long afterwards, Quinn spent the evening with Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman, and after dinner they watched Fellini's 1953 Italian comedy-drama I Vitelloni. According to Quinn: [...] "I was thunderstruck by it. I told them the film was a masterpiece, and that the same director {{was the man who}} had been chasing me for weeks." ...|$|E

500|$|Television {{director}} Joe Wright {{was hired}} in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his directional feature film debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who {{were looking for a}} fresh perspective; they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, [...] "I didn't know if I was really all that interested; I thought I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But then I read the script and I was surprised I was very moved by it". He next read the novel, which he called [...] "an amazing piece of character observation and it really seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt like it was a true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding how to love other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people... things like that." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{two songs}} {{performed}} by Artie and Quinn were not reviewed as enthusiastically. Both Futterman and Slezak {{approved of the}} harmonies in [...] "I'm Still Standing", though Futterman thought the number felt [...] "more subdued than we'd expect", and Slezak wrote that [...] "the song choice <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a groaner" [...] before he appended a [...] "B" [...] grade. Chaney gave the song a [...] "C" [...] and said that [...] "something about this segment wasn’t as dynamic {{as it should have}} been". Votta and Strecker both described the performance as [...] "pleasant", the latter also added a [...] "B−" [...] grade. Strecker gave a [...] "B" [...] to the other song, [...] "Up Up Up", which she said was [...] "mostly background music" [...] and the song itself [...] "not particularly memorable". Chaney's [...] "B" [...] was far more complimentary: she characterized the performance as [...] "the most energetic set piece of the night" [...] which [...] "made nice use of the infectious Givers song". Futterman thought that [...] "the sugary vocals work well for Artie and Quinn", but Votta wrote that [...] "the vocal is so indistinct it could be anyone".|$|E
500|$|During {{the podium}} ceremony, Schumacher, Coulthard and Berger did not spray the {{traditional}} champagne as {{a mark of}} respect to Senna. Schumacher felt lucky to win the race, conceding that [...] "Damon <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> quicker than me...he ended up going off and that's racing, but I don't think I could have caught him." [...] He also believed that his good start was fortunate, {{as it was the}} first one he had made in the new Benetton car; the team had not practised starts previously due to being short of time. He also specified his evasion of Barrichello's slowing car in the pit-lane entry while making his first stop as a crucial moment of the race. Coulthard admitted that he had been affected by his tonsillitis: [...] "I wasn't able to match Michael and Damon's pace so I settled for running my own race". Berger, meanwhile, was frustrated to finish a lap down on Schumacher, saying that [...] "He was faster everywhere: down the straights, {{going in and out of}} the corners. What can you do in these conditions? Okay, the car's roadholding is not bad. We must work very hard now. But at least I finished, that's something." ...|$|E
