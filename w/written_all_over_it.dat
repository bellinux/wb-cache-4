Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel listed it at number nine on his 2004 {{list of the}} show's [...] "Top 10 Sporting Episodes". Nancy Basile of About.com wrote in her 2003 review that {{the plot of the}} episode [...] "allowed us to see more secondary characters than usual. It also gave Springfield a sense of community that we sometimes don't get in recent seasons. Though the blatant use of guest stars has sweeps <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>it,</b> the tennis stars were funny and able to make fun of themselves. Homer had some wonderful lines, too, such as, 'Take your hands off me. [...] They feel like salad tongs.' [...] Overall, a very funny episode." [...] In July 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Agassi's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show.|$|E

The clip was official released {{few hours after}} she posted a 2000-word thank you message to fans on her official website on August 28, 2013. A part of the letter reads,I may get quiet at times, but when I do have something to say, I mean every word. I decided to share my thoughts with you at length and tell you openly how I feel. Thank you for filling my soul with melody and song … lyrics and love … and giving me a safe place I feel comforted in being brave enough to always bare my soul and come from an honest and genuine place. Be fearless {{enough to be a}} conversation piece … Speak your own truth… As always, thank you for accepting me for who I am. Being human – flaws and all. The music video for [...] "Let There Be Love" [...] was filmed in a DIY style. In the music video, Aguilera is seen in her one-piece swimsuit with the world [...] "love" [...] <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>it.</b> It also featured guest appearances from Nicole Richie, Christina Milian, Chris Mann, Aguilera's son, Max Bratman, and her current boyfriend Matthew Rutler. The video begins with Aguilera' message, [...] "Hey everybody Chrisitina here just thanking you guys so much for filling my life and my heart with so much love continued throughout the years... Standing by me, I appreciate all your support, this one is just for you". Everybody is seen joking around with another friend as they make the [...] "L" [...] sign for [...] "love" [...] with their hands, as well as holding up signs with positive messages such as [...] "Don't judge", [...] "Equality", [...] "Racism sucks", [...] "Accept", and [...] "Amo a mi hijo gay" [...] ("I love my gay son"), while Aguilera's son Bratman [...] "excitedly" [...] "shows off his dancing chops". At the end, Aguilera blows a kiss to the camera.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the liner}} notes for the {{compilation}} album, Natural Selection (October 2003), Seymour described [...] "Back on the Breadline" [...] and wrote [...] "This song spearheaded the North American campaign of 1987. We were signed to I.R.S. Records, and What's a Few Men? would've been our second album with them. Unfortunately they couldn't hear a single. Stoically, we wrote more. 'Back on the Breadline' was one amongst several which {{went on a}} compile {{with the best of}} the rest from the What's a Few Men? album ... I could have sworn this song had 'hit' <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>it.</b> How wrong can you be? Just before getting on the plane, standing at the terminal gate, waiting to fly home after I'd been to what felt like every radio station in North America promoting the track, the managing director of the record company asked me, in all seriousness, 'Hey young fella, can you tell me, exactly what is the breadline?".|$|E

5000|$|In Sid Phillips's book, You'll Be Sor-ree, he {{describes}} the role of Japanese flags played in the Pacific War, [...] "Every Jap {{seemed to have a}} personal silk flag with Jap <b>writing</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>it</b> and a large meatball in the center." [...] There are numerous books describing these souvenirs taken home by U.S. Marines and U.S. Army Infantry. Another example is Eugene Sledge's book With the Old Breed, [...] "The men gloated over, compared, and often swapped their prizes. It was a brutal, ghastly ritual the likes of which have occurred since ancient times on battlefields where antagonists have possessed a profound mutual hatred." [...] In a 2008 article of the Monroe News, a World War II veteran talked about the flag brought from the Pacific theatre. He said he did not search every Japanese soldier he shot, as there was usually not enough time. He found the flag while fighting on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. He said soldiers did not take large souvenirs, such as a katana (sword), for fear that someone would steal it; a flag could be easily concealed. The flag was being returned to Japan through Dr. Yasuhiko Kaji who searches for the owner and/or their family.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{spent much}} of 2007 {{finishing}} their long-delayed second album, [...] "Letters From The Frontline". It featured songs which had been staples of the live set for a while, veering from '50s style ballads like [...] "Tearjerker" [...] to the raucous [...] "Screamers", which harked back to the earlier material but with more of a '70s glam bent. Further pushing the power-pop angle, [...] "The Game Is Up" [...] {{was chosen as the}} next single, as another AA-side (with [...] "Too Much Too Soon"), and was released in October 2007. Despite garnering some positive press (Artrocker magazine described it as having [...] "instant classic <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> it") <b>it</b> again failed to revive the band's profile in the UK.|$|R

There is also a perfect amount of Lupe on this track—he is not tucked away on some last verse ****, rather he is found throughout the song." [...] David Fredrick from music discovery site Gigity wrote, [...] "it is an instant classic that will surely grab your attention." [...] HipHop DX said it [...] "oozed mass appeal without deteriorating into sloshy mainstream". [...] Colin McQuire from Pop Matters wrote that the [...] "piano-laden groove adds the texture it needs to be a bona fide Top 40 hit, and Fiasco’s crisp broken-hearted rhymes illustrate the exact type of accessibility the track needs to gain commercial notoriety." [...] A reviewer for entertainment site Pop Culture Podcast said, [...] "This one has chart topping single <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>it</b> but due to its genuine lyrics and universal subject matter it doesn't feel like one that you have to 'sell out' to make." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameZone's Michael Lafferty {{scored the}} Xbox version 8 out of 10, writing [...] "the {{essence of the}} fantastic {{adventure}} is there, and while the game does chart an extremely linear path through the lands of Middle-earth, there are enough challenges along the route to enable players to joyfully experience the urgency and terror of the journey." [...] IGN's Kaiser Hwang scored it 6.7 out of 10. He was critical of the combat, the enemy AI, and how the plot was handled. He concluded [...] "the book itself is very non-linear in format and can {{be very hard to}} translate into an effective game without leaving some of the detail out. But to reduce to the story to almost childish levels is not what I had in mind. Didn't we learn that from 1978's Lord of the Rings animated movie?" [...] GameSpy's Steve Steinberg scored it 3 out of 5, arguing [...] "the actual gameplay takes a backseat. The die-hard Tolkien will {{get a kick out of}} slugging and spell-casting their way through the first book of the Rings trilogy, but the casual gamer will only be disappointed by an otherwise generic action/adventure title. GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker scored it 5.7 out of 10, writing [...] "even the blessing of Tolkien Enterprises isn't enough to save the game from its bland design and tedious gameplay." [...] He called it [...] "an average game at its best and a frustrating and boring one at its worst." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored it 4 out of 10, comparing it unfavorably with EA's Two Towers; [...] "EA shames Vivendi's effort for presentation and general slickness." [...] He was heavily critical of the inability to invert the camera controls, which he referred to as an [...] "industry standard option" [...] in third-person games. He concluded [...] "this has [...] "licensed toss" [...] <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>it.</b> The goal was [...] "to create the most authentic Lord of the Rings game experience possible."

5000|$|... "What I Am" [...] was {{the lead}} single and big hit from the album, {{reaching}} #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. [...] The follow-up single, [...] "Circle," [...] was about strained relationships. [...] Although described by author Brent Mann as [...] "the perfect follow up single to 'What I Am'" [...] and which [...] "had 'smash' <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> it," [...] <b>it</b> stalled at #48 on the Billboard Hot 100 and fared slightly better on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, reaching #32. [...] Another song from the album, [...] "Little Miss S,," [...] was inspired by Edie Sedgwick and reached #38 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #14 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.|$|R
40|$|This {{special issue}} of Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews is {{dedicated}} to the memory of Sir Gabriel Horn, who died on 2 nd August 2012. In his impressive career that spanned more than 50 years (Bolhuis and Johnson, 2012; Brown, 2013), Horn’s contributions to cognitive neuroscience consistently pioneered new approaches and areas of investigation for others to follow, as illustrated by the papers in this special tribute issue. The contributions to this issue have been inspired particularly by Gabriel’s pioneering work on the neural mechanisms of learning and memory in imprinting. As a medical student at the University of Birmingham, Gabriel already showed great interest in brain and cognition, and during a year working with Solly Zuckerman, Professor of Anatomy, he wrote an essay on ‘The Neurological Basis of Thought’ published in a student journal called ‘The Mermaid’ (Horn, 1952). In this paper, Horn laid the foundations of much of his later work on the neural basis of attention, habituation, memory, and development. Zuckerman immediately recognised the originality of the essay, and <b>wrote</b> ‘Hebb’ <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>it.</b> Donald Hebb had published his seminal book ‘The Organization of Behavior’ in 1949, outlining a theory of memory and neural connectivity, which remains a bible of cognitive neuroscience to this day (Hebb, 1949). Gabriel had never heard of Hebb’s theory at the time, but had independently come up with some similar proposals in his student essay...|$|R

[...] "Give pleasure to Elspeth or away I go," [...] was <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> him. And <b>it</b> had to be the right kind of pleasure, too. The ladies must feel that she was more innocent than they, and talk accordingly. He would walk the flower-garden with none of them until he knew for certain that the man walking it with little Elspeth was a person to be trusted. Once he was convinced of this, however, he was very much at their service, and so little to be trusted himself that perhaps they should have had careful brothers also. He told them, one at a time, that they were strangely unlike all the other women he had known, and held their hands a moment longer than was absolutely necessary, and then went away, leaving them and him a prey to conflicting and puzzling emotions.|$|R
