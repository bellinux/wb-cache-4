5|$|For lines <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> tracks with express service, local stops {{will have}} side {{platforms}} {{and the middle}} one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, express stations typically have two island platforms, one for the local and express in one direction, and another for the local and express in the other direction. Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange between local and express services. Some lines with four-track express service have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.|$|E

5|$|Finally in December, Matilda {{responded by}} {{escaping}} from the castle; the popular {{version of this}} has the Empress waiting until the Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow, being lowered down the walls <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> knights, before escaping through Stephen's lines in the night as the king's sentries tried to raise the alarm. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped {{from one of the}} gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney {{for the remainder of the}} war. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D'Oyly, Robert D'Oyly the younger's son, in 1154.|$|E
5|$|On 26 June, Iraqi {{government}} forces launched an airborne assault on Tikrit <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> commando helicopters flown into a stadium at the University of Tikrit.

The crew of the second helicopter, which included a Lebanese pilot, was then captured by insurgents. Fierce fighting then ensued around the university compound, while army snipers positioned themselves on tall buildings in the university complex. In {{the early hours of}} the assault, a helicopter gunship struck the city's hospital compound. By the next day, sporadic clashes continued at the university as Iranian-trained Shiite militiamen were dispatched and managed to seize control of tall buildings in the university area.|$|E

25|$|While primary chloroplasts have {{a double}} {{membrane}} from their cyanobacterial ancestor, secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside of the original two, {{as a result of}} the secondary endosymbiotic event, when a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed a chloroplast-containing alga but failed to digest it—much like the cyanobacterium at the beginning of this story. The engulfed alga was broken down, leaving only its chloroplast, and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus, forming a chloroplast <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> membranes—the two cyanobacterial membranes, sometimes the eaten alga's cell membrane, and the phagosomal vacuole from the host's cell membrane.|$|E

25|$|Trazodone is well absorbed after oral administration, with {{mean peak}} blood levels {{obtained}} at about one hour after ingestion. Absorption is somewhat delayed and enhanced by food. The mean blood elimination half-life is biphasic: the first phase's half-life is 3 to 6hours, {{and the following}} phase's half-life is 5 to 9hours. The drug is extensively metabolized, <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> major metabolites having been identified in the human body, particularly mCPP, which {{may contribute to the}} side effect profile of trazodone and which probably accounts for trazodone's serotonergic effects.
