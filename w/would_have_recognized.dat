5|$|On 28 May the {{conclave}} unanimously elected Orsini as Pope. He had {{not been}} seen as a serious candidate in past conclaves because he did not have political experience. Orsini was 75 at the time, and it took the cardinals two days to convince him to accept his election. He was recorded to have spent the night before his election sleepless and in tears. Even when the cardinals had taken him into the Sistine Chapel for the formal vote to elect him pope after they had been convinced he would accept, he was still unwilling to accept his own election. Ultimately, he only accepted it after being convinced of it by Agustín Pipia the Master of the Dominican Order, of which he was a member. Upon accepting his election, he attempted to take the name Benedict XIV, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> Antipope Benedict XIII, the last Avignon Pope during the Western Schism. Lawyers from the Roman Curia eventually persuaded Orisini to take the name Benedict XIII.|$|E
25|$|One {{effect of}} the {{financial}} crisis is an increase in support for independence in Catalonia. The Statute of Autonomy included a package of laws that gave more power to the region and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> Catalonia as a nation, although one still within Spain. As with the rest of Spain, Catalonia has had high levels of unemployment. As many as 22% of the economically active population, which is still lower than Spain's national jobless rate, yet higher than Madrid. In 2010, Spain's Constitutional Court weakened the Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia, which further irritated Catalan secessionist organization.|$|E
25|$|Laying {{the main}} stress on {{historical}} arguments, the North Korean authorities were less keen on emphasizing {{the principle of}} effective possession (a keystone of the South Korean standpoint), for this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> the Republic of Korea as a legitimate state entity. Since both the ROK and the DPRK has been prone to consider itself as the sole legitimate government on the Korean Peninsula, the North Korean authorities, though they never consented to Japan's territorial claims, often found it inconvenient to side with Seoul against Tokyo in the dispute. In those periods when North Korea was on better terms with Japan than with the ROK (like 1955–1964, 1970–1977, and 1997–1998), North Korean propaganda essentially ignored {{the problem of the}} Liancourt Rocks. However, if Pyongyang felt threatened by Japanese-South Korean rapprochement (as it occurred in 1965–1968) or sought to cooperate with Seoul against Tokyo (as it happened in 2000–2001), the North Korean media promptly raised the issue, with the aim of causing friction in Japanese-ROK relations.|$|E

Jean Charest recognized the referendum's legitimacy, although a draft post-referendum speech had him interpreting a [...] "Yes" [...] vote {{as a call}} for drastic reform of Canadian federation instead of separation. The New Democratic Party's official position was that the result had to be recognized.|$|E
500|$|Movement 2 {{combines}} three texts, two biblical verses and stanza 6 from Johann Heermann's hymn [...] "", {{which all}} {{make reference to}} old age. An older view suggested this was likely {{a reference to the}} septuagenarian Conrad Meckbach, a member of the city council who was connected to Bach. More recent research lead to thinking that it likely refers to Adolf Strecker, the former mayor who had just left office aged 83 years, since [...] "details of his public and private life match extremely well with the texts chosen for the cantata, and it seems likely that hearers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> Strecker in them".|$|E
500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Lt. Col. Towers, the group derived more from Rabelais than the {{inscription}} over the door. He believes that they used caves as a Dionysian oracular temple, based upon Dashwood’s reading of the relevant chapters of Rabelais. [...] Sir Nathaniel Wraxall in his Historical Memoires (1815) accused the Monks of performing Satanic rituals, but these claims have been dismissed as hearsay. Gerald Gardner and others such as Mike Howard say the Monks worshipped [...] "the Goddess". Daniel Willens argued that the group likely practiced Freemasonry, but also suggests Dashwood may have held secret Roman Catholic sacraments. He asks if Wilkes <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> a genuine Catholic Mass, even if he saw it himself {{and even if the}} underground version followed its public model precisely.|$|E

500|$|Also in 2005, a local Knights of Columbus {{council in}} Canada was fined $2,000 by the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal. The council's Hall Manager signed a {{contract}} {{for the use of}} their facilities with Tracey Smith and Deborah Chymyshyn, but canceled it and returned their money after they became aware that it was for the lesbian couple's wedding reception. [...] The tribunal found that the local council did not have to rent the hall if in so doing they would violate their religious beliefs. But they said the Council [...] "could have taken additional steps that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> the inherent dignity of the complainants and their right to be free from discrimination". Instead of simply canceling the appointment, the court said, the council could have directed the complainants to other halls and assisted them in finding another place to hold their event.|$|E
500|$|It is {{not known}} {{precisely}} why Coates failed to purchase the painting; however, {{it seems likely that}} Coates felt the work was too controversial to acquire. Coates, as Head of Instruction at Eakins' academy, would have been familiar with the subject matter of Eakins' works, and thus it seems unlikely that the nudity in the painting would have surprised or shocked him. Rather, it seems certain that Coates <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> the majority of men in the painting, as all but one were students of Eakins at the academy. He was undoubtedly familiar with the site depicted in the painting too, as it was only a half a mile (800 m) from Haverford College, where Coates studied as an undergraduate. The depiction of a professor and his students together in the nude would have been a sensitive subject for the academy's directors, who had forbidden Eakins from using Academy students as models, as modeling was considered indecent. Coates chose to exchange The Swimming Hole for the [...] "less controversial genre scene" [...] of Eakins' The Pathetic Song—today housed in the Corcoran Gallery of Art— and paid Eakins the $800 he had offered for the original commission.|$|E
500|$|By 1869, Cuban {{nationals}} were in open {{rebellion against}} their mother country Spain, {{due to the}} unpopularity of Spanish rule. American sentiment favored the Cuban rebels and President Grant appeared {{to be on the}} verge of acknowledging Cuban belligerency. Fish, who desired settlement over the Alabama Claims, did not approve of recognizing the Cuban rebels, since Queen Victoria and her government had recognized Confederate belligerency in 1861. Recognizing Cuban belligerency would have jeopardized settlement and arbitration with Great Britain. In February 1870, Senator John Sherman authored a Senate resolution that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> Cuban belligerency. Working behind the scenes Fish counseled Sherman that Cuban recognition would ultimately lead to war with Spain. The resolution went to the House of Representatives and was ready to pass, however, Fish, worked out an agreement with President Grant to send a special message to Congress that urged not to acknowledge the Cuban rebels. On June 13, 1870 the message written by Fish was sent to Congress by the President and Congress, after much debate, decided not to recognize Cuban belligerency. [...] President Grant continued the policy of Cuban belligerent non recognition for the rest of his two administrations. This policy, however, was tested in 1873 with the Virginius Affair.|$|E

500|$|... "White Horse" [...] {{garnered}} generally positive reception from critics. [...] August Brown of The Los Angeles Times {{compared the}} song with Dolly Parton's [...] "Jolene" [...] (1973), saying Parton <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> her own predicament in [...] "White Horse" [...] {{and may have}} congratulated Swift for attempting to move on. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine called [...] "White Horse" [...] a [...] "lovely ballad" [...] with a prominent hook and deemed it [...] "easily the best song" [...] on Fearless. However, Keefer stated, [...] "Even 'White Horse' [...] makes use of a well-worn, clichéd image that Swift doesn't use in any novel way." [...] Josh Love of The Village Voice thought [...] "preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness" [...] shined through the lyrics and theme of [...] "White Horse"; Love also mentioned {{that it was one}} of Fearless [...] "great songs". Lucy Davies of the BBC said it demonstrated how repetitive the lyrical themes on Fearless were. She noted Swift recycled the phrase [...] "face of an angel" [...] from the album's previous track, [...] "Hey Stephen". An uncredited review from Billboard stated, [...] "The second single from Taylor Swift's top-selling CD is a beautiful, understated ballad that showcases her skill with a lyric and shines a spotlight on her signature tender, heart-on-her-sleeve vocals." [...] The review stated that the latter was accomplished by the song's production, which made Swift's vocal performance more palpable and emotive. The review also complimented the song, as something everyone could relate to. Kate Kiefer of Paste recognized it to be one of Swift's best songs. Sean Dooley of About.com attributed the track's effectiveness to be in how Swift captured the heartbreaking moment. While reviewing Fearless, Dooley selected [...] "White Horse" [...] as one of the best tracks on the album. At the 52nd Grammy Awards, [...] "White Horse" [...] won the Grammy Awards for Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.|$|E

[...] The Charlottetown Accord <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> Quebec as a [...] "distinct society" [...] within Canada, but consisted of a much milder reform of the Canadian federal system. While most Liberals supported the Charlottetown Accord, a number of them opposed it and quit the party.|$|E

2500|$|The Progressive Conservative (PC) {{government}} of Brian Mulroney began efforts to gain Quebec's {{support for the}} Constitution Act 1982 and end western alienation.

2500|$|It did attract some criticism, with {{columnist}} William Johnson {{claiming that}} Parliament had not fully analyzed the amendment {{and tried to}} stifle public discussion.

[...] Earlier, this columnist had also charged that enshrining collective rights in the Constitution was [...] "alien to liberalism," [...] and would undermine the individual in favour of a larger group; he also said section 16.1 excluded Aboriginal peoples in New Brunswick and could make them [...] "second-class citizens."

2500|$|Skeptical {{investigator}} Joe Nickell {{said that}} {{stories about the}} Chase Vault were often repeated, but he called them [...] "historically dubious."

2500|$|An 25 October 2009, poll {{suggested}} that Ignatieff {{had a lower}} popularity than Dion at his worst showing as Liberal leader. A month later Dion's wife Janine Krieber wrote a scathing letter on her Facebook page in which she {{suggested that}} the Liberal Party was in full collapse and the future appeared bleak. She questioned Ignatieff's ability to lead the party out of its current woes, alleging that party members were duped by Ignatieff and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> his obvious shortcomings if they'd only {{taken the time to}} read his academic writings. Krieber claimed that Dion was working to rebuild the party after the disappointing 2008 election, but their efforts were stymied by Ignatieff, who turned down the coalition with the other opposition parties, and who [...] "dethroned Dion without a leadership race". Dion was said to have no involvement in the criticism letter and later asked Kreiber to remove the Facebook post, which talks of deep divisions in the Liberal Party.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{controversial}} issue facing Canada {{in the first}} half of 1990 was the Meech Lake Accord. The Meech Lake accord of 1987 proposed a set of constitutional amendments that would have seen a significant devolution of federal powers to the provinces and a clause that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> Quebec as a [...] "distinct society" [...] within Canada. Chrétien had announced in a speech in January 1990 that he was an opponent of Meech Lake, but stated that he would support the accord with amendments such as scrapping the controversial [...] "distinct society" [...] clause as written, instead have the preamble to the constitution declare that Quebec was a [...] "distinct society" [...] and adding in a new clause saying if any conflict arose between the constitutional recognition of Quebec as a [...] "distinct society" [...] and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the latter would always prevail. The “distinct society” clause theoretically could have been the basis of a wide-ranging devolution of federal power as potentially it could have empowered the Quebec government to pass any law short of secession to protect the “distinct society”, which is why the “distinct society” clause was so popular in Quebec while arousing such passionate opposition amongst many quarters in English Canada. In a much talked about essay, Trudeau had warned that giving Quebec the constitutional right to be a [...] "distinct society" [...] would mean that Quebec would quite legally start expelling its Anglo minority. Chrétien's proposed amendments would have meant that the constitution <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> Quebec as a “distinct society” while effectively gutting any attempt to use the constitutional recognition of Quebec as a “distinct society” to grant special powers to Quebec. In private, Chrétien was opposed to Meech, but as the accord was extremely popular in Quebec, to run as an out-and-out opponent of Meech was judged to be too risky politically, hence Chrétien's conditional opposition to Meech Lake. Meech placed Chrétien in a difficult position as it was very popular in Quebec while being loathed by the Trudeau wing of the Liberals whose support Chrétien also needed. Chrétien had tried to avoid talking about Meech as much as possible as it was a minefield issue for him, and instead stuck to generalities about national unity. Martin by contrast had declared himself an unconditional supporter of Meech Lake as it was, and was quite willing to talk about his support for Meech.|$|E
