On 23 December 1975, President Gerald Ford signed Public Law 94-168, the Metric Conversion Act of 1975. This act declares a national policy of coordinating the increasing use of the metric system in the U.S. It established a U.S. Metric Board whose functions as of 1 October 1982 were transferred to the Dept of Commerce, Office of Metric Programs, to coordinate the voluntary conversion to the metric system.|$|E

Several people have told me that they had the same idea at the same time, but were afraid to say so in public because it seemed such a radical idea then. As soon as Claude Shannon's work appeared in 1948, there were bound to be readers who were already familiar with the work of Gibbs and Jeffreys. For any such reader it would be a small step to reverse the usual viewpoint and see it this way: the fact that a certain probability distribution maximizes entropy subject to certain constraints representing our incomplete information, is the fundamental property which justifies us...|$|R

40|$|The three {{articles}} {{included in}} the preceding major contribution on preven-tion are no less than “state-of-the-art ” efforts at understanding and setting an agenda for prevention in counseling psychology (Romano & Hage, 2000 [this issue]) and in examining applications of prevention to address significant personal and social problems (Hage, 2000 [this issue]; Mussell, Binford, & Fulkerson, 2000 [this issue]). I celebrate the decision of The Counseling Psy-chologist (TCP) editorial board to bring attention to prevention before the profession and congratulate the authors on producing excellent contribu-tions. These contributions support a recent lead article, contained in the American Psychologist (Kaplan, 2000), in which the author argues brilliantly for changing the emphasis of health care policy from secondary prevention to primary prevention. All of this work certainly is overdue. WHAT HAS TAKEN SO LONG?

40|$|The {{announcement}} in November 2012 by the Minister of Justice of plans to recruit volunteering organisations as indispensable to his ‘rehabilitation revolution’ crystallised several favoured policy {{themes of the}} coalition government. The speech confirmed the special status that voluntary sector organisations (VSOs) had assumed in governmental thinking about resettling and managing offenders. The proposition that civic-minded volunteers could salvage offenders from lives of crime on a widespread scale was fêted as an idea <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> <b>had</b> <b>come.</b> That appeal resonated with the Big Society project, which promulgated the idea that civil society could play an important, and sometimes more successful, role than the state in tackling entrenched social problems, including crime (Norman, 2010). Within this paradigm, it is claimed that properly trained {{members of the community}} and even former lawbreakers are singularly well placed to help offenders to turn their lives around where the prisons and probation system are deemed to have failed (Carter, 2003; Le Grand, 2007). However, underlying the appeal to socially responsible citizenship was the more sombre warning that discharging offenders back to homelessness, social isolation or substance addiction without help would perpetuate their reoffending, to the eventual cost of public safety: Solving these problems requires a radically different approach. Our central objective is to make the public safer by breaking the cycle of crime. (Ministry of Justice, 2010 : 7, s 15...|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{fertilization}} process breaks down into three essential components: induction of ovulation, fertilization of the oocyte, and development of embryos that are transferred into the uterus. Problems may arise resulting in failure at {{any one of these}} junctions. In 1984, the World Congress on In Vitro Fertilization was held, looking at 9, 641 laparoscopies yielding 1, 101 clinical pregnancies, with an overall pregnancy rate of 11 percent [...] clearly indicating that {{in vitro fertilization}}/embryo transfer (IVF/ET) was an idea <b>whose</b> <b>time</b> <b>had</b> <b>come.</b> Ovulation induction is monitored by both the use of ultrasound and daily estradiol levels, ultrasound indicating the number of oocytes that will be available for capture, and estradiol indicating in an indirect way the quality of those oocytes. It is a major aim in each patient to obtain at least four embryos, since this optimizes success rates. Ovulation induction at Yale is carried out with a high-dose human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) /human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) regimen. This regimen has insured us a success rate of 17 percent clinical pregnancies per laparoscopy. In the future, modification will occur in the process with cryopreservation of oocytes and embryos, and gamete manipulation. The modifications will be effected primarily to increase pregnancy rates. Research will continue mainly to delineate better biochemical markers for oocyte quality, but also to further explain the mystery of implantation...|$|R

Television revolutionized the way citizens and consumers in the United States learned about and communicated with the world; it also recast and re-envisioned the way they experience themselves and others. More than just escapist entertainment, TV reveals the dynamism and diversity of everyday life in the United States and the evolving nature of the nation’s core values. Television is moreover in a continual state of change and renewal. Its history has developed through a prehistory (before 1948) to a network era (1948 – 1975), a cable era (1976 – 1994), and finally the current digital era (1995 –present). Today there are more than 650 networks in the U. S. marketplace whereby members of the typical domestic household receive 189 channels and watch more than eight hours of TV a day on average. TV in the 21 st century also travels anywhere at any time, given its synergistic relationship with the Internet and a wide array of digital devices. It is now increasingly personalized, interactive, mobile, and on demand. Television is presently a convergent technology, a global industry, a viable art form, a public catalyst, and a complex and dynamic reflection of American society and culture...|$|R

The Antiquarian Bookman (later AB Bookman's Weekly) reported in its issue of 5 March 1949 that [...] "A great step forward towards the establishment of a genuine national association of antiquarian booksellers was taken" [...] at this meeting, though [...] "it was recognized that there were a great many differences, a long backlog of personal disputes and dissensions and an enormous field of individual views and prejudices" [...] to deal with. [...] "It was also recognized that all the above were some of the very reasons why a national association of antiquarian booksellers had to be formed: not merely to reconcile the differences but also to advance book-buying, to promote book-collecting, so that all would benefit from such increased activity in the book field." [...] The first general meeting of the new association took place in March, with 81 dealers in attendance; annual dues were set at $10/year.
