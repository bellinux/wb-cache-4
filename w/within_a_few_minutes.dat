5|$|At {{least six}} of the U.S. ships—including Laffey, O'Bannon, Atlanta, SanFrancisco, Portland, and Helena—fired at Akatsuki, which drew {{attention}} to herself with her illuminated searchlight. The Japanese destroyer was hit repeatedly and blew up and sank <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} morning {{surprise}} attack, on June15, 1914, Thomson {{was shot in the}} chest (despite the fact that rebels were attacking behind him) and died <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> It is probable that an Italian sniper was responsible.|$|E
5|$|On 16 July 1964, Vulcan B.1A XA909 {{crashed in}} Anglesey after a midair {{explosion}} caused both No. 3 and No. 4 engines {{to be shut}} down. The explosion was caused by failure of a bearing in No. 4 engine. The starboard wing was extensively damaged, the pilot had insufficient aileron power, and both airspeed indications were highly inaccurate. The whole crew successfully abandoned XA909 and were found <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> and rescued.|$|E

5|$|At a {{distance}} of , the Japanese fleet began to fire on the Chaoyong. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> fires broke out, which quickly engulfed the central superstructure with its numerous wooden partitions covered with thick layers of flammable varnish applied over the years. Yangwei quickly suffered the same fate. As the Chaoyong attempted to make way to a nearby island to beach itself, it collided with the Chinese cruiser , before listing to starboard and sinking in shallow water nearby. Some of the crew were rescued by a Chinese torpedo boat engaged in the battle.|$|E
5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS). A high-speed vibrator {{is applied to}} the glans penis to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation, usually <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E
5|$|The larva is a {{voracious}} predator. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of seizing {{its prey}} with its jaws and injecting it with venom and enzymes, {{it begins to}} suck out the digestion products. The larva is extremely sensitive to ground vibrations, the low-frequency sounds made by an insect crawling across the ground; the larva locates {{the source of the}} vibrations by the differences in timing of the arrival of waves detected by receptors, tufts of hairs {{on the sides of the}} two hindmost thoracic segments.|$|E

60|$|The {{murder of}} Lieutenant Wormwood was {{sufficient}} {{evidence that the}} Tories and their savage allies were prepared to harry us, and <b>within</b> <b>a</b> very <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> after {{the body of the}} officer had been brought in, the men made ready to defend their homes.|$|R
5|$|After the 'panic party' {{had taken}} to the boats and the ship {{appeared}} to be sinking, the U-boat approached to within 80 yards of her port quarter, whereupon Sanders ordered the White Ensign hoisted and Prize opened fire. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> the submarine was on fire and her bows rose in the air, whilst Prize was further damaged. The U-boat disappeared from sight, and was {{believed to have been}} sunk by the crew of Prize and by several of the German crew (including her captain) who had been blown or jumped into the sea. However, neither of the crippled ships had sunk, with Prize being towed in flames back to Kinsale. U-93 struggled back to the Sylt nine days later.|$|E
5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
5|$|In La Pintada, {{a remote}} fishing village of around 400residents {{situated}} {{to the west}} of Acapulco, a mudslide occurred on September14, which <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> swept through the center of town. As such, many residents initially wandered throughout town in a state of panic and confusion; it took two days for word of the mudslide to spread to the public. Throughout the village, 71people were killed. Over half the town, including 20homes, were demolished due to the mudslide. A total of 334people were evacuated by police, though 30elected to stay in the area until all the victims had been identified. Many surviving citizens of La Pintada were also hurt, including one seriously.|$|E

5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the North Korean 7th Division troops {{committed}} all {{of their}} effort into attacking the US 35th Infantry line. At 23:30 on August 31, a North Korean SU-76 self-propelled high-velocity gun from across the Nam fired shells into the position of G Company, 35th Infantry, overlooking the river. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> North Korean artillery was attacking all front-line rifle companies of the regiment from the Namji-ri bridge west. Under cover of this fire a reinforced regiment of the NK 7th Division crossed the Nam River and attacked F and G Companies, 35th Infantry. Other North Korean soldiers crossed the Nam on an underwater bridge {{in front of the}} paddy ground north of Komam-ni and near the boundary between the 2nd Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel John L. Wilkins, Jr., holding the river front and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard G. Teeter's 1st Battalion holding the hill line that stretched from the Nam River to Sibidang-san and the Chinju-Masan highway. The 35th Infantry, facing shortages of equipment and reinforcements, was under-equipped but nonetheless prepared for an attack.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union had not flown {{any further}} flights {{by the time}} MA-7 landed, putting {{both sides of the}} Space Race even at two orbital flights each. While the Soviets had flown for longer, the Mercury program was gaining momentum, with a six-orbit mission {{currently}} planned and press speculation about a one-day mission. However, in mid-August, the Soviet Union launched two orbital missions, Vostok 3 and Vostok 4, within a day of each other. The two craft were in intersecting orbits, but despite much speculation did not attempt to rendezvous; they completed missions of 64 and 48 orbits respectively, just under four and three days, landing <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of each other on August 15. This was far ahead of anything currently planned for Mercury, and NASA quickly considered the prospect of modifying a capsule to have an active manoeuvring and rendezvous capability, using technology being developed for the Gemini program. However, after examining the time and safety implications of this proposal, it was decided to abandon the idea and continue with the planned six-orbit mission.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} ultrafast {{transient}} absorption spectroscopy {{system in the}} visible combining high-sensitivity broadband detection with extreme temporal resolution. The instrument {{is based on an}} ultrabroadband sub- 10  fs optical parametric amplifier coupled to an optical multichannel analyzer with fast electronics, enabling single-shot detection at 1  kHz repetition rate. For a given pump-probe delay τ, we achieve a differential transmission (ΔT/T) sensitivity of the order of 10 − 4 over the λpr = 490 – 720  nm probe wavelength range by averaging over 1000 shots, allowing the acquisition of complete two-dimensional ΔT/T (λpr,τ) maps <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minute</b> measurement time. We present application examples highlighting the capability of this instrument to observe ultrafast dynamical processes, follow impulsively excited vibrational motions with frequency as high as 3000  cm− 1 (11  fs period), and determine the probe wavelength dependence of amplitude and phase of the oscillations...|$|R
5|$|At 18:42 on 10 November 1808, the {{garrison}} of a French defensive gun battery {{on the island}} of Groix saw a frigate moving rapidly westwards. As they had not been informed of any French movements at that time, the battery fired two warning shots at the ship to establish her identity. The frigate, Thétis, replied with her recognition signal and the firing stopped, but the sound had attracted the attention of HMS Amethyst, then approaching Groix from the west. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> Seymour's lookouts had spotted the French frigate and Amethyst immediately gave chase. Pinsum followed his orders to avoid combat and made all sail south-west, intending to escape into the Atlantic. By 21:00, Amethyst was close enough to fire her bow-chasers, small guns positioned {{at the front of the}} ship, at the French frigate and was attacked in turn from the French stern chasers. Certain that his quarry was an enemy, Seymour launched signal rockets in the hope of attracting attention from other ships of the inshore squadron that might intercept the French ship, and he received answering flashes from the north-east as Captain Sir Thomas Hardy joined the chase in HMS Triumph.|$|E
