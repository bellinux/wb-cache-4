60|$|On the 23d {{we still}} had the <b>wind</b> <b>ahead,</b> or calms. We then crossed over again to the {{mainland}} of Gilolo by the advice of our Gani men, who knew the coast well. Just as we got across we had another northerly squall with rain, and had to anchor {{on the edge of}} a coral reef for the night. I called up my men about three on the morning of the 24th, but there was no wind to help us, and we rowed along slowly. At daybreak there was a fair breeze from the south, but it lasted only an hour. All the rest of the day we had nothing but calms, light winds ahead, and squalls, and made very little progress.|$|E
60|$|On the 1st of November I {{called up}} my men at {{one in the}} morning, and we started with the tide in our favour. Hitherto it had usually been calm at night, but on this {{occasion}} we had a strong westerly squall with rain, which turned our prau broadside, and obliged us to anchor. When it had passed we went on rowing all night, but the <b>wind</b> <b>ahead</b> counteracted the current in our favour, and we advanced but little. Soon after sunrise the wind became stronger and more adverse, and as we had a dangerous lee-shore which we could not clear, {{we had to put}} about and get an offing to the W.S.W. This series of contrary winds and bad weather ever since we started, not having had a single day of fair wind, was very remarkable. My men firmly believed there was something unlucky in the boat, and told me I ought to have had a certain ceremony gone through before starting, consisting of boring a hole in the bottom and pouring some kind of holy oil through it. It must be remembered that this was the season of the south-east monsoon, and yet we had not had even half a day's south-east wind since we left Waigiou. Contrary winds, squalls, and currents drifted us {{about the rest of the}} day at their pleasure. The night was equally squally and changeable, and kept us hard at work taking in and making sail, and rowing in the intervals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The dynamic {{mechanisms}} {{that lead to}} high wind events in the deep, narrow Owens Valley {{in the lee of}} the Sierra Nevada in California, are studied using climate data form surface and upper-air observations. Four possible mechanisms are considered including downward momentum transfer, forced channeling, pressure-driven channeling, and frontal passage. The high wind events with winds blowing up-valley from south to north are primarily caused by forced channeling of strong synoptic <b>winds</b> <b>ahead</b> of a deep trough off the coast of California. The high wind events with northerly along-valley winds are associated with cold frontal passages, with post-frontal cold air under-running and displacing warmer air in the valley...|$|R
5000|$|Finally, {{in either}} case, the tiller or wheel should be lashed {{so that the}} rudder cannot move again, and the {{mainsheet}} adjusted so that the boat lies with the <b>wind</b> <b>ahead</b> of the beam with minimal speed forward. Usually this involves easing the sheet slightly compared to a closehauled position, but depending on the relative sizes of the sails, the shape and configuration of the keel and rudder {{and the state of}} the wind and sea, each skipper will have to experiment. After this the boat can be left indefinitely, only keeping a lookout for other approaching vessels.|$|E
50|$|Berg {{winds are}} usually {{accompanied}} by coastal lows. These coastal lows owe their existence to {{the configuration of}} the plateau, escarpment and coastal plain (see diagram on the right, above), in that they are confined to the coastal areas, always below the escarpment. Though they can arise almost anywhere along the coast, they often first appear on the west coast, or even on the Namibian coast. They are then always propagated counter-clockwise along South Africa's coastline at between 30-60 km/h, from the west coast southwards to the Cape Peninsula and then eastward along the south coast, and finally north-eastward along the KwaZuluNatal coastline, to finally dissipate north of Durban, due to the divergence of the coastline from the plateau which disappears altogether {{in the vicinity of the}} Limpopo valley. There is always a hot off-shore berg <b>wind</b> <b>ahead</b> of a coastal low, which can blow for several days or for only for a few hours. This is then followed by cool onshore winds which bring low cloud, fog or drizzle to the region, but may, on occasions, produce substantial precipitation when coupled to an approaching cold front.|$|E

We show through a combined diagnostic and linear modeling study a possible interaction between northern Africa orography and the deepening of the Saharan heat low {{at the time of}} the monsoon onset. The amplification of an anticyclonic circulation above and north of the Hoggar massif leads to an increase and a southeasterly-northeasterly rotation of the <b>wind</b> <b>ahead</b> of the Hoggar which contribute to an increased leeward-trough effect enhancing the Saharan heat low.

Late on July 20, it began a slow weakening trend after passing over cooler waters. Steering <b>winds</b> <b>ahead</b> of an approaching mid-level trough caused Beryl to accelerate northeastward, and early on July 21 the center of the storm crossed the island of Nantucket. The convection diminished as it moved through progressively colder waters, and shortly after 1200UTC on July 21 Beryl became an extratropical cyclone a short distance east of Cape Cod. Hours later, it made landfall in southwestern Nova Scotia, and on July 22 the extratropical remnants of Beryl merged with an approaching cold front over Newfoundland.|$|R

40|$|A quasi-steady {{one-dimensional}} {{hydrodynamic model}} {{is used to}} study the various modes of interaction between the solar wind and a medium-bright water-dominated comet approaching the sun. It is found {{through a series of}} calculations that at large heliocentric distances (greater than 5 AU) the solar wind penetrates {{to the surface of the}} comet. As mass loading reaches a critical value, a standing shock wave is created in the solar wind upstream from the cometary nucleus, and as distance decreases, the cometary atmosphere becomes dense enough to stand off the solar <b>wind</b> <b>ahead</b> of the nuclear surface. It is shown that the present scenario of solar wind/comet interaction is qualitatively valid for comets with different sizes, chemical compositions and optical properties...|$|E
40|$|Previous work {{indicates}} that coronal mass ejection (CME) {{events in the}} solar wind at 1 AU can be identified {{by the presence of}} a flux of counterstreaming solar wind halo electrons (above about 80 eV). Using this technique to identify CMEs in 1 AU plasma data, it is found that most large geomagnetic storms during the interval surrounding the last solar maximum (August 1978 - October 1982) were associated with earth-passage of interplanetary disturbances in which the earth encountered both a shock and the CME driving the shock. However, only about one CME in six encountered by earth was effective in causing a large geomagnetic storm.

30|$|High-speed streams (HSSs) {{originating}} from coronal holes form CIRs when they collide with the slower solar <b>wind</b> <b>ahead.</b> The compressed interaction region contains a southward pointing magnetic field, and geomagnetic activity ensues.

40|$|A {{solar wind}} {{disturbance}} {{produced by a}} fast coronal mass ejection, CME, that departed from the Sun on February 20, 1994 was observed in the ecliptic plane at 1 AU by IMP 8 and at high heliographic latitudes at 3. 53 AU by Ulysses. In the ecliptic the disturbance included a strong forward shock but no reverse shock, while at high latitudes the disturbance was bounded by a relatively weak forward-reverse shock pair. It {{is clear that the}} disturbance in the ecliptic plane was driven primarily by the relative speed between the CME and a slower ambient solar <b>wind</b> <b>ahead,</b> whereas at higher latitudes the disturbance was driven by expansion of the CME. The combined IMP 8 and Ulysses observations thus provide a graphic illustration of how a single fast CME can produce very different types of solar wind disturbances at low and high heliographic latitudes.
