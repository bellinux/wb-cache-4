The BNP know the present system is their only chance of election. This is another example of the increasingly Goebbels-like campaign from the anti-AV people, for whom no lie is too idiotic given the truth is so unpalatable to them. AV makes lazy MPs work harder and reach out beyond their tribe. It is what Britain needs to clean up politics.|$|E

We also looked back at what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll just leave it at that. We can kill bin Laden and eliminate a lot of these other extremists, but that whole belief system is out there. It doesn’t take too many people to buy in to it to cause enormous damage.|$|E
25|$|In 1379 Bishop Buckingham {{confirmed}} {{an important}} ordinance of Thomas Marshall, setting apart certain {{funds for the}} education of one of the canons at Oxford. The prior alludes to the poverty of his house, which was so great that {{were it not for the}} help of friends they would not be able to live decently and honestly, and religion would be diminished. Hitherto there had not been enough canons nor enough money to set apart one for special study; but the prior now wished to do so (partly out of the profits of a chantry established by his own family), 'seeing the advantage of learning and the necessity of preaching, the priory being a populous place where a great number of people come together.' All this certainly points to a satisfactory state of the priory under Thomas Marshall, and accords well <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know of his character from other sources.|$|E

500|$|As {{with many}} other courses, Augusta National's {{championship}} setup was lengthened in recent years. In 2001, the course measured [...] and was extended to [...] for 2002, and again in 2006 to [...] longer than the 2001 course. The changes attracted many critics, including the most successful players in Masters history, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Tiger Woods. Woods claimed that the [...] "shorter hitters are going to struggle." [...] Augusta National chairman Hootie Johnson was unperturbed, stating, [...] "We are comfortable <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are doing with the golf course." [...] After a practice round, Gary Player defended the changes, saying, [...] "There {{have been a lot}} of criticisms, but I think unjustly so, now I've played it.... The guys are basically having to hit the same second shots that Jack Nicklaus had to hit (in his prime)".|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} was received {{with a positive}} response from critics. Jordan Zivitz of Montreal Gazette called the performance [...] "insanely theatrical, Broadway-worthy." [...] Melissa Maerz wrote for Entertainment Weekly that [...] "As visually spectacular as it was narratively [...] heavy-handed, {{it felt like a}} callback to her last tour, 'MDNA', which featured a dark charade that found Madonna wielding a gun on stage. But when the song ended with video footage of the gladiators knocking over a saintly-looking Madonna statue, the tone changed. Madonna has built a career by playing <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> hold sacred, whether it's crucifixes or underground dance crazes. Now the only sacred thing she's tearing down is Madonna herself." [...] The performance of the song at the March 19-20, 2016 shows in Sydney's Allphones Arena was recorded and released in Madonna's fifth live album, Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E

500|$|In {{planning}} the set lists for the tour, Byrne initially considered only promoting this album {{but decided to}} include songs from his previous collaborations with Eno as well, including the TalkingHeads albums MoreSongsAboutBuildingsandFood, FearofMusic, and RemaininLight and Byrne's TheCatherineWheel soundtrack. By playing music from all of their collaborations, Byrne hoped to [...] "draw a line linking this new material <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did 30years ago" [...] {{with the goal of}} clarifying the connection between all of the duo's previous work. In reviewing their past music, he found that [...] "here might be more continuity than I imagined, which I hope is going to work in my favor." [...] Although Eno was invited to participate and early reports indicated that he would, Eno ultimately chose not to tour with Byrne, letting Byrne decide how to present this music live.|$|E
500|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson {{says that}} [...] "there seems ample {{indication}} that Gefjon represents {{one aspect of}} a once powerful goddess of the north, the figure representing in Scandinavian myths as either Frigg, the wife of Odin, or Freyja, sister of fertility god Freyr. Freyja, desired by gods, giants and dwarves alike, acted as dispenser of bounty and inspirer of sexual love {{between men and women}} like the Greek Aphrodite." [...] In addition, Davidson says that [...] "as Axel Olrik (1901) pointed out long ago, we know very little about Gefion, and it is possible that she can be identified with Frigg or Freyja" [...] and not only does the Prose Edda associate her with an afterlife realm of the dead, [...] "in Lokasenna, Loki claims that Gefion was given a jewel by a lover, traditions that would fit in very well <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know of Freyja." ...|$|E

Picking up where the first part left of, the video follows Jean Noel, a human man who has received plastic surgery from aliens to be transformed into the [...] "perfect specimen". In an interview for The Creators Project, Nilsson explained how the videos were conceptualized: [...] "The concept of this was born after long evenings of me and the band talking about gene technology in contemporary science. We share a mutual excitement in what's happening on the medical scene right now." [...] "The Wave" [...] was filmed before [...] "Paddling Out", although the latter was released first. Wyatt explained to Billboard, [...] "We really liked [...] Andreas's images and I think they go together in a way that feels truthful <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do ... and you can read into it in different ways." ...|$|E

500|$|Casting {{director}} Rick Millikan was {{tasked with}} finding a suitable actor {{to play the}} part of the beggar. Millikan's only instructions were to look for [...] "a small all-Indian man with no legs." [...] Eventually, Gurdeep Roy, better known as Deep Roy was chosen to play the part. Deep Roy was a noted stunt man who had notably played Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi. Deep Roy, however, is not an amputee and so a cart with a false bottom was created. Anytime there was a scene where the beggar had to move, blue screen technology was used to add the background in during post-production. The cart featured a distinct [...] "squeak" [...] that Paul Rabwin described as [...] "creepy". He noted, [...] "There was a squeak that had to let us know that it was him. It had to scare us [...] Finally we came up <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> thought was just the right squeak and John [...] said 'Okay, that's the one.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Raine Maida {{first brought}} {{up the idea of}} a concept album after {{excerpts}} from the book began influencing his songwriting. Passing time on the road, he had amassed a backlog of songs and had begun to record demos. He jokingly suggested an album title of Kurzweil. [...] "That was not the most graceful sounding name in the world, so we went with Spiritual Machines instead," [...] Turner said. While the other band-members were less enthusiastic about the idea due to its weighty subject matter, Maida and Turner decided to pursue it and Turner contacted Ray Kurzweil via email to ask for permission to use the title of his book for their project. Kurzweil's excitement at the prospect prompted them to invite him to record spoken excerpts from his book for the album and a correspondence developed. “I think it’s amazing that Ray Kurzweil sent us a bunch of pieces, and for whatever reason, they really tie in <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were trying to say on this record,” said Maida.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{occasional}} performance of [...] "Everything Must Go," [...] {{none of the}} album's songs have been played live since 2010. In the same year, Lazzara answered questions on his Formspring account, commenting that New Again [...] "was a gigantic step backwards" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "not fully satisfied <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> put out". In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it was, it just kind of bummed us out a bit." [...] Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period [...] "the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we all really like, that we can't wait to get out' and things were going pretty good for a little while". However, when the album was released, the [...] "critics seemed to like it, but it didn't really hit , and then when we started the touring cycle for it there was a very decisive mood turn in a band that already was insanely moody all the time".|$|E
