5|$|In the past, it {{was thought}} that {{consumption}} of protein even at normal levels increased the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This {{has been shown to be}} incorrect. Furthermore, many people with chronic liver disease are malnourished and require adequate protein to maintain a stable body weight. A diet <b>with</b> <b>adequate</b> protein and energy is therefore recommended.|$|E
5|$|Animal-sourced foods (meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, dairy) provide zinc. The {{concentration}} of zinc in plants {{varies with the}} level in the soil. <b>With</b> <b>adequate</b> zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, mustard). Zinc {{is also found in}} beans, nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and blackcurrant. Plant phytates interfere with zinc absorption, so people consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet may need to increase zinc intake.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, RAF Bomber Command firmly believed that air power could win wars {{without the need for}} naval and land fighting. It was thought the bomber would always get through. Tightly flown bomber formations with heavy defensive armament were thought capable of warding off enemy fighters even without fighter escort. However, the RAF lacked a four-engine bomber <b>with</b> <b>adequate</b> defensive protection which could carry heavy bomb loads to German targets. The only possible targets that were within range of British bombers were the industrial regions of the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|Breeding convicts is {{as simple}} as having a male and a female in the same tank <b>with</b> <b>adequate</b> water quality and feeding. There is no special {{conditioning}} required.

5|$|Chemotherapy may be {{combined}} with palliative care {{in the treatment of}} the NSCLC. In advanced cases, appropriate chemotherapy improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as improving quality of life. <b>With</b> <b>adequate</b> physical fitness maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and an improvement in quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents. The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered in advanced NSCLC.|$|E

5|$|Freshwater {{resident}} {{rainbow trout}} usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, well oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They are {{native to the}} alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin, but introduced rainbow trout have established wild, self-sustaining populations in other river types such as bedrock and spring creeks. Lake resident rainbow trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes <b>with</b> <b>adequate</b> shallows and vegetation to support production of sufficient food sources. Lake populations generally require access to gravelly bottomed streams to be self-sustaining.|$|E

The city argued that the friars could not claim their civil rights were violated, as the Order of St. Augustine was a foreign organization under the Pope. Furthermore, the city argued that the friars took a vow of poverty {{and could not be}} property owners. The Augustinians ended up proving the Order was incorporated in 1804 and was awarded $45,000.

5|$|Although {{its total}} {{strength}} {{was estimated at}} 185,500 men in late May 1944, the 2nd Panzer Army {{was not able to}} rally more than 16,000 troops for Operation Rösselsprung due to ever-increasing Partisan activity throughout the country. The Germans had to rely on special forces and improved tactics. The Partisans defended the territory they controlled with significant demolition and mining of roads. Roadblocks were manned by patrols and smaller detachments, whose task was to hold off the enemy until reinforcements arrived. During Operation Rösselsprung, the Germans rendered these tactics ineffective by combining strong and fast motorised columns <b>with</b> <b>adequate</b> pioneer support. This combination was especially successful for the column led by the 92nd Motorised Regiment. The second German tactical innovation was the employment of five reconnaissance battalions for independent operations deep inside Partisan-controlled territory.|$|E

The {{fatality}} rate is 1–5%, {{and less than}} 1% <b>with</b> <b>adequate</b> treatment; however those who develop significantly low blood pressure may have a fatality rate of up to 26%. Dengue is common in more than 110 countries. In 2013 it causes about 60 million symptomatic infections worldwide, with 18% admitted to hospital and about 13,600 deaths. The worldwide cost of dengue case is estimated US$9 billion. For {{the decade of the}} 2000s, 12 countries in Southeast Asia were estimated to have about 3million infections and 6,000 deaths annually. It is reported in at least 22 countries in Africa; but is likely present in all of them with 20% of the population at risk. This makes {{it one of the most}} common vector-borne diseases worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{businessman}} and politician William Smith was appointed Lord Warden in 1891, but died in Walmer Castle {{during his first}} visit here in October of that year. Smith had proposed that the historical artefacts in the castle should be protected from being removed by later Lord Wardens and suggested that government pass an Indenture of Heirlooms Bill. The government carried out the plan after Smith's death, protecting almost 70 pieces of furniture and 50 artworks at the castle and forbidding them being moved from the castle without the Secretary of State for War's approval. Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, the Marquess of Salisbury, became the next Lord Warden; <b>with</b> <b>adequate</b> legal protection now in place, the 3rd Duke of Wellington suggested returning his grandfather's possessions to the castle, but Lady Salisbury declined the offer.|$|E
