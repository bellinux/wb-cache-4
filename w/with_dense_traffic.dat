While the primary benefits of ridesharing services are enjoyed by the users, our research seeks to test whether or not there are other unintended consequences to these services. In the following study, we hypothesize that the presence of Uber and Lyft decrease the number of cars on the road, which results in more efficient transportation and greater public safety. Using regression analysis, we analyze New York City car and traffic data from 2007 - 2013 and compare this to data reflecting the growth of the ridesharing economy within New York City. Our time series analysis then allows us to make inferences about the potential benefits of ridesharing economies in similarly sized cities...|$|E

To help the dispatchers in such task, an advanced decision support system, ROMA (Railway traffic Optimization by Means of Alternative graphs), has been recently implemented to optimize railway traffic within a single dispatching area. This paper presents a novel distributed optimization system to control trains running in a Dutch railway network that is divided into two complex dispatching areas <b>with</b> <b>dense</b> <b>traffic,</b> each one controlled by a single dispatcher with the support of a local ROMA.

Our approach is to statistically model traffic behavior classes, at an individual location, in order to detect location-level activity of interest. We then combine the results from multiple locations using a reasoning structure. We present a method for learning this reasoning structure from the data using a Bayesian network structure search.

40|$|Given {{the degree}} of traffic {{conflict}} inherent in their operations, intersections and driveways continue to experience {{a disproportionate number of}} traffic crashes, injuries, and fatalities. Access management strategies, such as the introduction of minimum access point spacing criteria and turning movement restrictions, are important elements to optimizing the operational and safety performance of roadway corridors. The relationship between safety and these types of access policies is a complex issue and the impacts of such features on traffic crashes is in need of further research. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify how driveway density, type, and spacing are related to the rate of crashes among various roadways in Iowa. Data were collected for two types of facilities: (1) priority, or high-growth urban/suburban corridors; and (2) crossroad corridors, beginning at the crossroad terminal of service interchanges. Detailed driveway information was manually collected along each corridor and integrated with traffic volume, roadway geometry, and traffic control information from the Iowa DOT. Police-reported crash data from 2010 to 2014 were also obtained from an Iowa DOT database. A series of safety performance functions (SPFs) were estimated to ascertain how crash rates change in relation to the frequency of access points observed on these corridors. The results of the study show that crash rates are strongly associated with access point density.

This study provides the first published results of direct measurements of size resolved emission factors for particles in the size range 0. 25 – 2. 5 μm using a new approach deriving aerosol emission factors from the CO 2 emission fluxes. Because the aerosol and CO 2 emissions have a common source and because the CO 2 emission per fuel or traffic amount are much less uncertain than the aerosol emissions, this approach has obvious advantages.

In this paper, we propose a novel density model for urban traffic systems and employ this model for the purpose of spatial-temporal analysis of radio overlapping. To model traffic density, we consider a signalized junction and road segments linked to that junction as basic building blocks of urban traffic systems. The density model enables us to derive a framework to explain trends and critical regions of radio overlapping corresponding to VANET scenarios targeted for urban transportation systems, which cannot be derived from uniform density models widely used in existing literature. We apply the derived radio overlapping model to study channel load associated with periodic beaconing, a fundamental mechanism for safety message communication in VANETs. This study also provides a generic analytical framework to investigate other performance aspects of data and safety message communication in VANETs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{emerging}} {{consensus that}} exposure to near-roadway traffic-related pollution causes asthma has implications for compact urban development policies designed to reduce driving and greenhouse gases. OBJECTIVES: We estimated the current burden of childhood asthma-related disease attributable to near-roadway and regional air pollution in Los Angeles County (LAC) and the potential health impact of regional pollution reduction associated with changes in population along major traffic corridors. METHODS: The burden of asthma attributable to the dual effects of near-roadway and regional air pollution was estimated, using nitrogen dioxide and ozone as markers of urban combustion-related and secondary oxidant pollution, respectively. We also estimated the impact of alternative scenarios that assumed a 20 % reduction in regional pollution in combination with a 3. 6 % reduction or 3. 6 % increase {{in the proportion of}} the total population living near major roads, a proxy for near-roadway exposure. RESULTS: We estimated that 27, 100 cases of childhood asthma (8 % of total) in LAC were at least partly attributable to pollution associated with residential location within 75 m of a major road. As a result, a substantial proportion of asthma-related morbidity is a consequence of near-roadway pollution, even if symptoms are triggered by other factors. Benefits resulting from a 20 % regional pollution reduction varied markedly depending on the associated change in near-roadway proximity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there are large and previously unappreciated public health consequences of air pollution in LAC and probably in other metropolitan areas <b>with</b> <b>dense</b> <b>traffic</b> corridors.

Design: Cross-sectional results from a cohort study. Setting: The adult-onset asthma and exhaled nitric oxide (ADONIX) cohort, sampled during 2001 - 2008 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Exposure was expressed as the distance from participants' residential address to the nearest road <b>with</b> <b>dense</b> <b>traffic</b> (> 10 000 vehicles per day) or very dense traffic (> 30 000 vehicles per day). The exposure categories were: low (> 500 m; reference), medium (75 - 500 m) or high (< 75 m). Participants: The source population was a population-based cohort of adults (n= 6153). The study population included 5441 participants of European descent with good quality spirometry and information about all outcomes and covariates. Outcome measures: Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) were measured at a clinical examination. The association with exposure was examined using linear regression adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, smoking status and education in all participants and stratified by sex, smoking status and respiratory health status. Results: We identified a significant dose-response trend between exposure category and FEV 1 (p= 0. 03) and borderline significant trend for FVC (p= 0. 06) after adjusting for covariates. High exposure was associated with lower FEV 1 (- 1. 0 %, 95 % CI - 2. 5 % to 0. 5 %) and lower FVC (- 0. 9 %, 95 % CI - 2. 2 % to 0. 4 %). The effect appeared to be stronger in women. In highly exposed individuals with current asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, FVC was lower (- 4. 5 %, 95 % CI - 8. 8 % to - 0. 1 %). Conclusions: High traffic exposure at the residential address was associated with lower than predicted FEV 1 and FVC lung function compared with living further away in a large general population cohort.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry {{is undergoing a}} revolution where the more traditional mechanical values are replaced by an ever increasing number of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) where advanced algorithms and software development are taking a bigger role. Increased safety, reduced emissions {{and the possibility of}} completely new business models are driving the development and most automotive companies have started projects that aim towards fully autonomous vehicles. For industrial applications that provide a closed environment, such as mining facilities, harbors, agriculture and airports, full implementation of the technology is already available with increased productivity, reliability and reduced wear on equipment as a result. However, it also gives the opportunity to create a safer working environment when human drivers can be removed from dangerous working conditions. Regardless of the application an important part of any mobile autonomous system is the motion planning layer. In this thesis sampling-based motion planning algorithms are used to solve several non-holonomic and kinodynamic planning problems for car-like robotic vehicles in different application areas that all present different challenges. First we present an extension to the probabilistic sampling-based Closed-Loop Rapidly exploring Random Tree (CL-RRT) framework that significantly increases the probability of drawing a valid sample for platforms with second order differential constraints. When a tree extension is found infeasible a new acceleration profile that tries to brings the vehicle to a full stop before the collision occurs is calculated. A resimulation of the tree extension with the new acceleration profile is then performed. The framework is tested on a heavy-duty Scania G 480 mining truck in a simple constructed scenario. Furthermore, we present two different driver assistance systems for the complicated task of reversing with a truck with a dolly-steered trailer. The first is a manual system where the user can easily construct a kinematically feasible path through a graphical user interface. The second is a fully automatic planner, based on the CL-RRT algorithm where only a start and goal position need to be provided. For both approaches, the internal angles of the trailer configuration are stabilized using a Linear Quadratic (LQ) controller and path following is achieved through a pure-pursuit control law. The systems are demonstrated on a small-scale test vehicle with good results. Finally, we look at the planning problem for an autonomous vehicle in an urban setting <b>with</b> <b>dense</b> <b>traffic</b> for two different time-critical maneuvers, namely, intersection merging and highway merging. In these situations, a social interplay between drivers is often necessary in order to perform a safe merge. To model this interaction a prediction engine is developed and used to predict the future evolution of the complete traffic scene given our own intended trajectory. Real-time capabilities are demonstrated through a series of simulations with varying traffic densities. It is shown, in simulation, that the proposed method is capable of safe merging in much denser traffic compared to a base-line method where a constant velocity model is used for predictions...|$|E

We follow a two level approach, where a simplified track topology is used to obtain a macro level schedule and the detailed topology is considered locally on the micro level. To increase the solution space in the interface of the two levels, we propose {{an extension of the}} well-known Periodic Event Scheduling Problem (PESP) such that it allows to generate flexible time slots for the departure and arrival times instead of exact times. This Flexible Periodic Event Scheduling Problem (FPESP) formulation considerably increases the chance to obtain feasible solutions (exact train routings) subsequently on the micro level, in particular for stations <b>with</b> <b>dense</b> peak <b>traffic.</b> Total trip time and the time slot sizes are used as multiple objectives and weighted and/or constrained to allocate the flexibility where it is most useful. Tests on an instance of the 2007 service intention of the Swiss Federal Railways demonstrate the advantage of the FPESP model, while it only moderate increases its solution time in most cases...|$|R
40|$|Regions <b>with</b> <b>dense</b> air <b>traffic</b> has lower {{separation}} between aircrafts {{to maintain the}} throughput. Terminal area generally requires high throughput {{and some of the}} airports need to maintain 3 nmi {{separation between}} two aircrafts. To provide 3 nmi separation RNP 0. 3 is required. In this paper we propose two possible ways to fulfill RNP 0. 3 NSE requirement using LDACS as an alternate system. The first way is to use LDACS in standalone configuration and the other way is to use a hybrid configuration, where position solution is obtained using LDACS combined with DME. The results show that both the proposed methods, standalone and hybrid configuration fulfill RNP 0. 3 NSE requirement. Where standalone configuration is more accurate than hybrid, due to the low ranging error of LDACS system. For our analysis the surveillance data for terminal area of Munich and Frankfurt airports were used. In standalone configuration 5 LDACS stations for Frankfurt and 6 LDACS stations for Munich are sufficient to fulfill RNP 0. 3 NSE requirement. In hybrid mode both Frankfurt and Munich only need 3 LDACS stations...|$|R
