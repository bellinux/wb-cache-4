5000|$|Surveys of {{households}} {{have shown that}} {{there is often a}} gulf between where assets are located and where some people think they ought to be, to provide an optimal tax outcome. Reed's re-balancing model rarely shows a difference of more than 10% after 30 years, unless <b>withdrawals</b> <b>from</b> tax-deferred <b>accounts</b> are at lower rates. So it may be that households are correct. Amromin [...] argues that job income insecurity, penalties and restrictions on <b>withdrawals</b> <b>from</b> tax-deferred <b>accounts</b> explain why people are tax-inefficient with their investments. Employers’ matches in defined contribution retirement plans and the structure of the social security system also play a part in driving low tax equity investments into sheltered accounts.|$|R
5000|$|Lines {{of credits}} may {{require that the}} company deposit all of its funds into a [...] "blocked" [...] account. The lender then approves any <b>withdrawals</b> <b>from</b> that <b>account</b> by the company and {{controls}} when the company pays down the line of credit balance.|$|R

5000|$|The Bankcard-Servicenetz (bank card service network) is a German ATM card interbank {{network group}} {{provided}} by the Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken services group. Technically {{it is not an}} interbank network but uses the pre-existing girocard network. Member banks of this cash credit group charge ATM usage fees at a low level and most customers of the co-operative banks enjoy free <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> their <b>accounts.</b> With 19,200 ATMs the Bankcard-Servicenetz group is the second largest ATM group in Germany (after the savings banks network).|$|R
5000|$|Corralito (...) was the {{informal}} {{name for the}} economic measures taken in Argentina {{at the end of}} 2001 by Minister of Economy Domingo Cavallo in order to stop a bank run, and which were fully in force for one year.

2500|$|Between 1982 and 2002 Australia {{charged a}} bank account debits tax on {{customer}} <b>withdrawals</b> <b>from</b> bank <b>accounts</b> with a cheque facility. Some Latin American countries also experimented with taxes levied on bank transactions. Argentina introduced a bank transaction tax in 1984 before it was abolished in 1992. Brazil implemented its temporary [...] "CPMF" [...] in 1993, which lasted until 2007. The broad based tax levied on all debit (and/or credit) entries on bank accounts proved to be evasion-proof, more efficient and less costly than orthodox tax models.|$|R
50|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} {{contributors}} {{could not have}} intended that <b>withdrawals</b> <b>from</b> the <b>account,</b> and investments then purchased, could be allocated by reference to the order the contributions were made. So the {{first in first out}} rule is more of a default rule. It would not be applied if the result would be ‘impracticable or result in injustice’. It was not intended that {{only a small number of}} investors would get the most out of the fund. They would share rateably, pari passu.|$|R
5000|$|The Fobaproa assumed {{debt for}} 552 billion pesos. Not {{applying}} the Fobaproa would have likely caused an interruption {{of credit and}} <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> saving <b>accounts</b> for millions of families and thousands of companies. In January 1995 the Procapte (Programa de Capitalización Temporal or [...] "Temporary capitalization program") was created while the Fobaproa was assuming outstanding debt to banks. The Procapte allowed faster access to a higher volume of foreign capital and the solvency of banks. A condition for Fobaproa to assume the debt was that stockholders of these financial institutions would re-invest their capital.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{challenge}} in designing concurrent programs is concurrency control: ensuring the correct sequencing {{of the interactions}} or communications between different computational executions, and coordinating access to resources that are shared among executions. Potential problems include race conditions, deadlocks, and resource starvation. For example, consider the following algorithm to make <b>withdrawals</b> <b>from</b> a checking <b>account</b> represented by the shared resource : ...|$|R
40|$|Pension {{reforms that}} {{establish}} individual accounts will diminish {{the relative importance}} of the traditional state pension while creating a significant role for individual accounts in providing income for retirement. This paper surveys the policy issues this new role entails. It offers general advice to countries considering such issues as the restrictions to be placed on the timing, extent, and form of <b>withdrawals</b> <b>from</b> individual <b>accounts</b> and the need for mandatory annuitization (conversion into annuities) of accumulated account balances. The paper also considers the role that private annuity markets should play and related regulatory, social safety net, tax, and administrative questions. ...|$|R
40|$|Six Latin American {{countries}} have levied taxes on <b>withdrawals</b> <b>from</b> bank <b>accounts,</b> {{which have been}} viewed as a convenient tax handle during a difficult fiscal period. The paper reviews the arguments for and against this type of taxation, describes the taxes, and surveys their revenue performance and economic impact. It concludes that the recently implemented taxes {{have been successful in}} raising revenue in the short term, but that adverse allocational impacts have likely been significant. The tax may work better in times of fiscal crisis, when financial intermediation is deep, and when the tax rate is modest. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{jury trial}} {{did not begin}} until May 1934. Harriman and a co-defendant, Harriman Bank {{vice-president}} Albert M. Austin, were tried together. Victims of the alleged fraud, including movie stars Constance Talmadge and Peggy Hopkins Joyce, appeared to testify {{that they had not}} consented to the <b>withdrawals</b> <b>from</b> their <b>accounts</b> that the defendants arranged. [...] After five weeks of testimony, the jury deliberated only two hours before finding Harriman guilty on all sixteen counts (and acquitting Austin). [...] Judge John C. Knox sentenced Harriman to 4½ years on each count, but allowed him to serve them concurrently rather than consecutively.|$|R

Within these four days, the banking system has handled about 180 million (18 crore) transactions. The State Bank of India reported to have received more than [...] in bank deposit in first two days after demonetisation. A spike in the usage of debit card and credit card post demonetisation was also reported.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} issues on whether bloggers {{actually}} earn much from these Nuffnang advertisements which has {{eventually led to}} influencers leaving Nuffnang. Also, the administration fee of S$1 on payments during 2007 created some unhappiness among bloggers due {{to the way it}} was imposed. There were no announcements about it and bloggers only discovered it when they went to make <b>withdrawals</b> <b>from</b> their Nuffnang <b>accounts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{fraudsters}} have attached fraudulent card stripe {{readers to}} publicly accessible ATMs, to gain unauthorised {{access to the}} contents of the magnetic stripe, as well as hidden cameras to illegally record users' authorisation codes. The data recorded by the cameras and fraudulent card stripe readers are subsequently used to produce duplicate cards that could then be used to make ATM <b>withdrawals</b> <b>from</b> the victims' <b>accounts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tax {{deferred}} retirement accounts exist in many jurisdictions, and allow individuals to declare income later in life; if the individuals also have lower income in retirement, taxes paid may be considerably lower. In Canada, contributions to registered retirement savings plans or RRSPs are deducted from income, and earnings (interest, dividends and capital gains) in these accounts are not taxed; only <b>withdrawals</b> <b>from</b> the retirement <b>account</b> are taxed as income.|$|R
30|$|Initially, {{the monthly}} amount was 100 Nuevos Soles (Peruvian local currency). This amount is roughly {{equivalent}} to US$ 37 (in current dollars). Since 2010, however, the amount was doubled (200 Nuevos Soles) but beneficiaries would receive the cash transfer every two months so {{that the level of}} the annual amount remained unchanged (1200 Nuevos Soles). This change was introduced because of the low rate of money <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> bank <b>accounts</b> given the long distances beneficiaries must travel in order to pick up the money. In our context, the monthly transfer was quite generous, representing over 50 % of beneficiaries’ monthly per capita household expenditures.|$|R
