5|$|Nonetheless, Iacob Ber Ghimpel, {{who owned}} a Yiddish theater there, <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a figure of Goldfaden's stature. Goldfaden {{completed}} the play he'd started in Paris, Rabi Yoselman, oder Die Gzerot fun Alsas ("Rabbi Yoselman, or The Alsatian Decree"), in five acts and 23 scenes, based {{on the life of}} Josel of Rosheim. At this time he also wrote an operetta Rothschild and a semi-autobiographical play called Mashiach Tzeiten (Messiah Times) that gave a less-than-optimistic view of America.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Kooman is {{an author}} and playwright. All of Kooman's {{writings}} focus on justice {{and many of the}} issues he writes about are gender-based. Kooman's first literary reaction to human trafficking was to write some short stories. Eventually, he also started writing the play that became She Has a Name in order to bring attention to the issue of human trafficking, specifically in its connections to sexual exploitation. In 2009, the script of She Has a Name was given the Scripts At Work/Alberta Playwrights Network Award. By February 2012, Kooman was working on a screenplay version of She Has a Name in order to expose it to a larger audience. Some Americans expressed an interest in staging She Has a Name in the United States. After starting to write this play, Kooman read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident in a Canadian newspaper and also heard about it through a friend of his who was working at an aftercare centre in Bangkok, Thailand to restore the dignity of former sex workers. Knowing that many of the impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play. There was a tour of She Has a Name in 2012, and the final performances were held in Red Deer. Kooman <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the tour conclude in his hometown because the people of Central Alberta were very supportive of the play. During the tour, Kooman was awarded the Outstanding Alumnus Provincial Award Celebrating Excellence (PACE) by the Alberta Association of Colleges & Technical Institutes (AACTI) and the Alberta Ministry of Enterprise. In conjunction with this award, a $5000 scholarship was set up in Kooman's name, which he chose to have awarded to students who evince creativity, leadership, and a commitment to those who are in need. The PACE Award ceremony is biennial, and took place on June 13 in Edmonton at the AACTI Board of Governors Conference.|$|E

In an interview about the character's impact, Jeanmarie commented that he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a part of the taboo-breaking story.

The production, {{directed}} by Sam Mendes and co-starring Bill Nighy, opened in November 2006. Moore played the role of Nadia, a former war correspondent who finds her views on the 2003 invasion of Iraq challenged. Ben Brantley of The New York Times was unenthusiastic about the production, and described Moore as miscast: in his opinion, she failed to bring the [...] "tough, assertive" [...] quality that Nadia required. David Rooney of Variety criticized her [...] "lack of stage technique", adding that she appeared [...] "stiffly self-conscious". Moore later confessed that she found performing on Broadway difficult and had not connected with the medium, but <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> experimented with it. The play closed in March 2007 after 117 performances.|$|E
500|$|Rousseau {{is named}} after French-Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

Furlan understood Rousseau's decision to not meet her daughter, believing that no one can ever be prepared for that moment. Furlan met Raymonde for the first time just minutes before shooting their reunion scene in the season three finale. The actors believed the scene to be a [...] "huge moment" [...] for their characters, which Furlan described as a [...] "basic human moment."

Historians Kershaw and Shirer believe he courted Braun {{as a way to}} advance his career. Hitler, Himmler and Martin Bormann acted as witnesses at the ceremony. A two-day celebration was then held at Hitler's and Bormann's Obersalzberg mountain homes and the Eagle's Nest. Fegelein was a known playboy and had many extramarital affairs. Hitler's secretaries, Christa Schroeder and Traudl Junge, state Fegelein was popular socially, particularly with women. He could be funny, amusing and charming. After his marriage to Gretl, Eva <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> someone in the entourage with whom she could dance and flirt, as Hitler was distant in social situations and refrained from publicly showing affection. Thereafter, Fegelein worked hard to develop a friendship with Hitler's powerful private secretary, Martin Bormann. Fegelein [...] "never missed" [...] Bormann's drinking parties and told Junge that the only things that mattered were [...] "his career and a life full of fun." ...|$|E

[...] Fichtner was given two days to decide whether he wanted to play the character and, although he was unsure if the experience would be worthwhile, he later said that he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> accepted the role. Fichtner has praised the quality of writing on the series, saying [...] "Television shows live or die on writing. The joy of Prison Break has been the writers. They're great and they forever challenged me, which makes the journey worth it." [...] Fichtner has also had several concerns with the scripts written for him, and talks to the writers {{to make sure that the}} character stays consistent. On at least one occasion, he has sat down with the writer and tweaked the entire script.|$|E

[...] In the early 2000s, Azaria felt he had reached the maximum number of voices he was capable of: [...] "For the first 10 years of The Simpsons, I would develop a bunch of voices. And then... I hit a point when I was tapped out. Every noise I can make, I have made. Even characters like Gargamel, I've done.

500|$|The project caused {{division}} in Blink-182, mostly between DeLonge and Hoppus. Hoppus {{was interested in}} {{being a part of}} the record, but DeLonge did not want it to turn into a Blink-182 album. DeLonge contended that the involvement of Barker was to refrain from having to pay a session musician. Regardless, Hoppus felt betrayed and unresolved tension dogged the band until their 2005 breakup. [...] "Nobody talked about it. It was this strange situation that nobody addressed," [...] DeLonge told Blender. Barker felt guilty when he told Hoppus they were going to tour in support of the album: [...] "I felt like I had let him down [...] but he was ultimately more upset at Tom because they had ten years of history together before me." [...] Despite this tension, Hoppus lent vocals to the track [...] "Elevator" [...] and shared early ideas for the next Blink-182 album. In a later Reddit AMA, Hoppus concluded, [...] "The whole situation sucked. But I sang on the track because, at the heart of it, Tom and Travis are my friends.

500|$|To {{prepare for}} the storyline, Divins {{consulted}} with his gay friends and asked them how to ensure the character was [...] "being represented correctly and honestly". Oprah Winfrey's discussion of the down-low on her talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show also helped Divins better understand the character. Divins {{was unaware of the}} developments in Chad's sexuality until he was given the script four days prior to the filming of the episodes. He said he was surprised by the reveal that Chad's affair was with a man, but thought the soap opera's [...] "storytelling style lends itself to dramatic changes". Divins praised the show for its inclusion of a black, gay character on daytime television regardless of any negative feedback from fans who preferred Chad and Whitney as a couple, and said that he wasn't afraid to take on the role, given the increased visibility of LGBT issues on television and in everyday society {{at the time of the}} storyline's broadcast. Chad's character and storyline were not to every cast member's taste; Tracey Ross, who played Eve Russell, later said she [...] "was never crazy about" [...] the incest plot, though Phillip Jeanmarie, who played Vincent Clarkson, commented that he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been part of the taboo-breaking story.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Lundgren played gladiator Brixos in the Italian-made historical/biblical drama, The Inquiry (L'inchiesta), {{also known}} as The Final Inquiry, {{alongside}} Daniele Liotti, MÃ³nica Cruz, Max von Sydow, F. Murray Abraham and Ornella Muti. It is the remake of the 1986 Italian film directed by Damiano Damiani and starring Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel. Set in AD35 in the Roman Empire, the story follows a fictional Roman general named Titus Valerius Taurus, a veteran of campaigns in Germania, who is sent to Judea by the emperor Tiberius to investigate {{the possibility of the}} divinity of the recently crucified Jesus. The film, shot on location in Tunisia and Bulgaria, featured a score from Andrea Morricone, the son of the acclaimed film score composer Ennio Morricone. It premiered at the Capri-Hollywood and the Los Angeles-Italia Film Festival. One reviewer on a website catering for historical movies said of the film, [...] "The Final Inquiry is one of those movies you are glad you ran into....

500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought the [...] "premise {{was a little}} thinly {{stretched}} over the hour" [...] and believed {{it would have been}} overshadowed by stronger episodes in season one, but <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> another hour of Fringe regardless. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall disliked that the network failed to issue a [...] "disclaimer" [...] about the episode's production date, stating [...] "...maybe the producers assume that all their audiences are brand new to the franchise. Or perhaps, unhappily, it is a sign that Fox has given up on this show, and no longer cares whether its lingering audience is confused." [...] She concluded, [...] "As a standalone episode, this one was of middling interest, and I can see why Fox would have dropped it from the Season One lineup. Fans looking eagerly for more 'mythology' episodes, where the links between the Fringe team, Massive Dynamics, Nina Sharpe, William Bell and, for all I know, the Illuminati are explored, may be disappointed." [...] Jane Boursaw of AOL TV was also critical of Fox for giving no warning about the episode and thought it should actually have been titled 'Walter vs. The Priest.'" [...] She continued, [...] "The whole episode was an interesting intersect between science and faith, not to mention the whole 'being possessed by a dead person because your brain waves crossed during life and death' thing. You can tell it was vintage Fringe -- if indeed it was -- because the storylines are more complex than that these days, what with the alternate universe and Leonard Nimoy and all." [...] Various critics noted guest actress Alice Kremelberg's performance, particularly when she had to give the impression she was possessed by a male ghost; most reviews were negative, though Boursaw praised it, giving Kremelberg [...] "high fives".|$|E
500|$|The Ninth Doctor first {{appears in}} the episode [...] "Rose" [...] where he rescues 19-year-old shopgirl Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) from an Auton attack in the {{department}} store where she works. After Rose helps the Doctor defeat the Nestene Consciousness (living plastic), he invites her to travel {{with him in the}} TARDIS. On their first trip he takes her to witness the destruction of planet Earth in the year five billion. It is revealed that the Doctor's own species, the Time Lords, have been destroyed and the Doctor is the last of his kind. Following from this they visit Cardiff in 1869 where they encounter author Charles Dickens, of whom the Doctor claims to be a big fan. When faced with a near death situation, the Doctor tells Rose that he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> met her. In taking Rose home the Doctor accidentally returns to earth 12 months after they left. Because of his actions he is treated like an Internet predator by Rose's mother Jackie (Camille Coduri) and Rose's boyfriend Mickey (Noel Clarke) has become Rose's murder suspect. After Mickey helps the Doctor and Rose defeat the Slitheen by firing a missile at their base at 10 Downing Street, the Doctor offers Mickey a place in the TARDIS with them but he refuses. In the episode [...] "Dalek" [...] the Doctor encounters a Dalek, though he had believed the race to be extinct as the [...] "Time War" [...] between the Time Lords and Daleks concluded with the mutual annihilation of both racesâ€”an event for which the Doctor himself was responsible. The Doctor tortures the surviving Dalek {{and at the end of}} the episode attempts to kill it in cold blood. He refrains once Rose calls him out on this.|$|E
