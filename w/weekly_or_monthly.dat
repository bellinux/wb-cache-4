5|$|Most of the Scarborough-based {{news media}} have been either <b>weekly</b> <b>or</b> <b>monthly</b> publications. The {{earliest}} newspaper was the Scarborough News and Advertiser {{which was published}} weekly starting in September 1921. It lasted until the 1930s. Other short-lived papers and magazines included The Enterprise (1945–1966), Scarborough Mail (1946–1955) and The News (1952–1995) and 54east magazine (2005–2009). The only remaining English language local newspaper is the Scarborough Mirror, which started publication in 1962 and was later acquired by the Toronto Star's community news division, Metroland.

25|$|The fully {{transparent}} {{nature of}} existing ETFs means that an actively managed ETF {{is at risk}} from arbitrage activities by market participants who might choose to front run its trades as daily reports of the ETF's holdings reveals its manager's trading strategy.

25|$|The {{cash fare}} for Muni Metro, like Muni buses, {{effective}} July 1, 2017, is $2.75 {{for adults and}} $1.35 for youth ages 5–17, seniors, and the disabled. Like Muni buses, the Muni Metro operates on a proof-of-payment system; on paying a fare, the passenger will receive a ticket good for travel on any bus, historic streetcar, or Metro vehicle for 90 minutes. Payment methods depend on boarding location. On surface street sections {{in the south and}} west of the city, passengers can board {{at the front of the}} train and pay their fare to the train operator to receive their ticket; those who already have a ticket, or who have a daily, <b>weekly,</b> <b>or</b> <b>monthly</b> pass, can board at any door of the Metro streetcar. Subway stations have controlled entries via faregates, and passengers usually purchase or show Muni staff a ticket in order to enter the platform area. Faregates closest to an unmanned Muni staff booth open automatically if a passenger has a valid pass or transfer that cannot be scanned. Muni's fare inspectors may board trains at any time to check for proof of payment from passengers.|$|E
25|$|The Freedom Ticket will {{initially}} {{be available}} for sale at the Atlantic Terminal, Nostrand Avenue, and East New York stations in Brooklyn and at the Laurelton, Locust Manor, Rosedale, and St. Albans stations in Queens. Riders, under the pilot, {{would be able to}} purchase one-way, <b>weekly,</b> <b>or</b> <b>monthly</b> passes that will be valid on the LIRR, on buses, and the subway. The fare will be higher than the price of a ride on the MetroCard, but it will be lower than the combined price of an LIRR ticket and a MetroCard, and it will allow unlimited free transfers between the LIRR, buses, and subway. The former head of the MTA, Thomas Prendergast, announced at the January 2017 board meeting that the plan would be explored in a field study to determine fares and the impact on existing service. The plan is intended to fill approximately 20,000 unused seats of existing trains to Atlantic Terminal and Penn Station (or about 50% to 60% of peak trains in each direction), {{while at the same time}} providing affordable service to people with long commutes. The details will be announced in spring 2017, and the pilot will last six months.|$|E
25|$|The {{children}} {{became interested}} in writing from an early age, initially as a game which later matured into a passion. Although they all displayed a talent for narrative, it was the younger ones whose pastime it became to develop them. At {{the centre of the}} children's creativity were twelve wooden soldiers which Patrick Brontë gave to Branwell at the beginning of June 1826. These toy soldiers instantly fired their imaginations and they spoke of them as the Young Men, and gave them names. However, it was not until December 1827 that their ideas took written form, and the imaginary African kingdom of Glass Town came into existence, followed by the Empire of Angria. Emily and Anne created Gondal, an island continent in the North Pacific, ruled by a woman, after the departure of Charlotte in 1831. In the beginning, these stories were written in little books, the size of a matchbox , and cursorily bound with thread. The pages were filled with close, minute writing, often in capital letters without punctuation and embellished with illustrations, detailed maps, schemes, landscapes, and plans of buildings, created by the children according to their specialisations. The idea was that the books were of a size for the soldiers to read. The complexity of the stories matured as the children's imaginations developed, fed by reading the three <b>weekly</b> <b>or</b> <b>monthly</b> magazines to which their father had subscribed, or the newspapers that were bought daily from John Greenwood's local news and stationery store.|$|E

40|$|Howard and Lloyd (1979) {{have shown}} that daily values for {{rainfall}} and potential evapotranspiration are required in estimating recharge with a soil water balance model. However, available data may not be daily but <b>weekly</b> <b>or</b> even <b>monthly.</b> This is true for potential evapotranspiration data which are usually derived from pan evaporation data. This paper examines the effect of using distributed <b>weekly,</b> 10 -daily <b>or</b> <b>monthly</b> potential evapotranspiration values rather than the actual daily values in estimating recharge with a soil water balance model. The results clearly show that in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, the evenly distributed <b>weekly,</b> 10 -daily <b>or</b> even <b>monthly</b> potential evapotranspiration data {{can be used in}} a soil water balance model to obtain realistic groundwater recharge estimates, instead of actual daily potential evapotranspiration data...|$|R

2500|$|Stolle, Sack and Thomasius define binge {{drinking}} as episodic excessive drinking. There is currently no worldwide consensus {{on how many}} drinks constitute a [...] "binge", but in the United States, the term has been described in academic research to mean consuming five or more standard drinks (male), or four or more drinks (female), over a 2-hour period. In 2015, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, citing the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, defines {{binge drinking}} as [...] "a pattern of drinking that brings a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when women consume 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours." [...] and estimated that about 16% of American adults met these binge drinking criteria four times per month. One 2001 definition from the publication Psychology of Addictive Behavior states that 5 drinks for men and 4 drinks for women must be consumed on one occasion {{at least once in}} a two-week period for it to be classed as binge drinking. This is colloquially known as the [...] "5/4 definition", and depending on the source, the timeframe can vary. In the United Kingdom, binge drinking is defined by one academic publication as drinking more than twice the daily limit, that is, drinking eight units or more for men or six units or more for women (roughly equivalent to five or four American standard drinks, respectively). In Australia, binge drinking is also known as risky single occasion drinking (RSOD) and can be classified by the drinking of seven or more standard drinks (by males) and 5 or more standard drinks (by females) within a single day. When BEACH (Bettering the Evaluation of care and health) conducted a study which gathered information of people over the age of 18, it defined binge drinkers as those who consumed six or more standard drinks on one occasion whether that be <b>weekly</b> <b>or</b> <b>monthly.</b>|$|E
