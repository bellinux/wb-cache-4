40|$|Low- and high-anxious {{participants}} performed arithmetical tasks under task-switching or nontask-switching conditions. These {{tasks were}} low or high in complexity. The task on each trial was either explicitly cued or not cued. We assumed that demands on attentional control <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>greater</b> in the task-switching condition {{than in the}} nontask-switching condition, and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>greater</b> with high-complexity tasks than with low-complexity ones. We also assumed that demands on attentional control <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>greater</b> when cues <b>were</b> absent rather than present. According to attentional control theory (Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, & Calvo, 2007), anxiety impairs attentional control processes required to shift attention optimally within and between tasks. We predicted that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>greater</b> negative effects of high state anxiety in the task-switching condition than in the nontask-switching condition. Our theoretical predictions were supported, suggesting that state anxiety reduces attentional control...|$|R

25|$|Some company {{directors}} {{questioned the}} wisdom of acquiring extensive rail systems in northern New York State. A direct line to Albany, New York existed for many years through the canal and river system, {{so most of the}} coal markets in the area were already accessible. These concerns were overruled by the majority, who believed there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> benefit to having an all rail route to Upstate New York that was not nearly as vulnerable to winter weather as the canal. It was also desirable to avoid situations in which the company would have to rely on other railroads to reach its markets. The effort was helped by a report that estimated necessary upgrades to the canal would cost $300,000, an expenditure that would not be needed if rail routes could be purchased or leased.|$|E
25|$|The {{individuality}} of a {{being is}} a certain intricate form, not an enduring substance. In order to understand an organism, it must {{be thought of as}} a pattern which maintains itself through homeostasis – life continues by maintaining an internal balance of various factors such as temperature and molecular structure. While the material substances that compose a living being may be constantly replaced by nearly identical ones, an organism continues functioning with the same identity as long as the pattern is kept sufficiently intact. Since patterns can be transmitted, modified, or duplicated, they are therefore a kind of information. Based on this, Wiener suggests it should be theoretically possible to transmit the entirety of a living person as a message (which is practically indistinguishable from the concept of physical teleportation) – although he admits that the obstacles to such a process <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great,</b> because of the enormous amount of information embodied in a person, and the difficulty of reading or writing it.|$|E

According to Bakshi, Basinger had attempted to rewrite the film halfway into its production because she [...] "thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> [...] if {{she would be able}} to show this picture in hospitals to sick children [...] I said, 'Kim, I think that's wonderful, but you've got the wrong guy to do that with.'
