25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} {{multiple}} effects at the cellular level but is primarily notable for the alertness effect {{that it has}} on people. Research has been performed involving phonological priming and TOTs in which participants took either 200mg of caffeine or a placebo. The participants answered 100 general knowledge questions, each with one correct answer. For each question, participants read 10 priming <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> displayed on a monitor {{for a short period}} of time. Each list of 10 priming words had between two and eight <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> phonologically related to the correct answer of the question, with the remaining words being unrelated. Caffeinated participants had fewer TOT experiences than the placebo group, suggesting better memory recall. However, in the unrelated condition, the caffeinated group did not do as well as the placebo group in their ability to retrieve words. The results suggest that this dose of caffeine (equivalent to two cups of coffee) can temporarily hinder a person’s short-term recall of certain words. Moreover, the general advantageous effect of caffeine on attention can be ruled out.|$|E

God informs Moses of their {{apostasy}} and threatens to kill them all, but relents when Moses pleads for them. Moses comes down from the mountain, smashes the stone tablets in anger, and commands the Levites to massacre the unfaithful Israelites. God commands Moses to make two new tablets on which He will personally write the <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> on the first tablets. Moses ascends the mountain, God dictates the Ten Commandments (the Ritual Decalogue), and Moses writes them on the tablets.|$|E

25|$|Mayan glyphs were {{fundamentally}} logographic. Generally the glyphs used as phonetic {{elements were}} originally logograms that stood for <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> themselves single syllables, syllables that either {{ended in a}} vowel or in a weak consonant such as y, w, h, or glottal stop. For example, the logogram for 'fish fin' (Maya —found in two forms, as a fish fin and as a fish with prominent fins), came to represent the syllable ka. These syllabic glyphs performed two primary functions: they were used as phonetic complements to disambiguate logograms which {{had more than one}} reading, as also occurred in Egyptian and in modern Japanese (i.e. furigana); and they were used to write grammatical elements such as verbal inflections which did not have dedicated logograms, also as in modern Japanese (i.e. okurigana). For example, b'alam 'jaguar' could be written as a single logogram, B'ALAM, complemented phonetically as ba-B'ALAM, or B'ALAM-ma, or b'a-B'ALAM-ma, or written completely phonetically as b'a-la-ma.|$|E
25|$|In {{significant}} respects, Jinsai {{can be seen}} as {{advancing the}} Neo-Confucian project that Zhu Xi, his chief philosophical adversary, had otherwise so effectively and persuasively championed. For example, Jinsai's most comprehensive philosophical text, the Gomō jigi (The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the Analects and Mencius), was first recorded as Jinsai was giving a series of lectures on Chen Beixi's 陳北溪 (1156–1223) Xingli ziyi 性理字義 (The Meanings of Neo-Confucian Philosophical Terms). Much of the philosophical structure of Jinsai's Gomō jigi as well as its methodology of conceptual clarification and analysis clearly derive from Beixi's work. The two texts even share common elements in their titles, jigi and ziyi 字義 (Jpn: jigi) being written with the same characters, referring to the meanings of words. In both cases, however, the <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> discussed and defined were distinctively philosophical terms such as tendō (the way of heaven), tenmei (the decree of heaven), michi (the way), sei (human nature), kokoro (the mind and heart), kotowari (principle), kishin (ghosts and spirits), and many others.|$|E
25|$|To provide clarity, cross-linguistic {{influence}} can {{be understood}} as the various ways that two or more languages relate in the mind and affect a persons linguistic performance or development. Cross-linguistic effects of orthographic and semantic overlap between different languages of cognates and interlingual homographs were also reported in many priming studies. For example, Beauvillain and Grainger had French-English bilinguals make English lexical decisions on target strings primed by French words, which was told to the participants. The homographic primes were French <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> either semantically related to the English words (e.g., coin-money, where coin means corner in French) or not related. The results showed that the bilinguals responded faster in related conditions than unrelated conditions. Even though the participants knew that the prime words were always belonged to their French meaning, they were still affected by the English meaning of the homographic prime words. In the later studies, researchers masked the briefly presented prime words to prevent participants from using conscious strategies. For example, Sáchez-Casas et al. used Spanish-English bilinguals in a semantic categorization task on Spanish target words. They used three types of priming conditions: entirely identical cognates or non-cognates (rico-rico; pato-pato), translations of cognates or non-cognates (rich-rico; duck-pato) and non-word primes combined with cognate or non-cognate targets as a control condition (rict-rico vs. wuck-pato). They found that the bilinguals responded to the cognate translation conditions as fast as the identical conditions, but the non-cognate translation was as slow as the control conditions.|$|E

500|$|The episode makes {{prominent}} use of John 11:25–26 {{from the}} Christian Bible, which reads [...] "Who soever liveth and believeth in me shall never die". These were the <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> {{believed to have}} been said by Jesus when he raised Lazarus of Bethany from the dead; biblical scholars have noted that the verse was also intended as a foreshadow of his resurrection. For this reason, the verse is used in the episode to represent a physical resurrection from the dead. However, Amy Donaldson, in her book We Want to Believe, notes that the verse is used for the wrong reasons in [...] "Millennium"; the necromancer is able to successfully raise the dead by reciting the line, but only their bodies, resulting in mindless zombies. Later, the verse reappears in the eighth season episode [...] "Deadalive" [...] during Mulder's funeral. In this instance, the verse is used to symbolize its true intentions, and Mulder is returned from the dead, both in mind and body.|$|E
500|$|Different title {{sequences}} were inputted to help disambiguate the two universes, {{as well as}} establish other {{versions of}} their world. Blue and red represented the prime and parallel universes, respectively while [...] "Entrada" [...] featured a mixture of blue and red in its title sequence. An episode set in 1985 began with a retro title sequence, and the finale's version of the title sequence was silver-gray and black. Each opening credit sequence contained specific <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> meant to serve as [...] "signposts" [...] for both current and future episodes, such as the finale sequences' use of [...] "thought extraction" [...] and [...] "dual maternity". Like the previous season, the third season was filmed in Vancouver. Because of its heritage buildings and antique storefronts, many of the scenes set in the alternate universe were shot in New Westminster, an area outside Vancouver. Filming of the live action parts of [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] were shot along west Hastings Street. Executive producer Joe Chappelle returned to direct five episodes, while producer Brad Anderson was responsible for directing four. Other new and returning directors included Thomas Yatsko, Jeffrey Hunt, Kenneth Fink, David Straiton, Frederick E. O. Toye, Chuck Russell, and Charles Beeson; [...] they each directed one episode. In addition, Dennis Smith and Jeannot Szwarc each directed two episodes.|$|E
500|$|Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie {{observe that}} [...] "the tale {{is unusual in}} that the hero little deserves his good fortune, that is if his poverty, his being a third child, and his unquestioning {{acceptance}} of the cat's sinful instructions, are not nowadays looked upon as virtues." [...] The cat should be acclaimed the prince of 'con' artists, they declare, as few swindlers have been so successful before or since. The success of Histoires is attributed to seemingly contradictory and incompatible reasons. While the literary skill employed in the telling of the tales has been recognized universally, it appears the tales were set down in great part as the author heard them told. The evidence for that assessment lies first in {{the simplicity of the}} tales, then in the use of <b>words</b> <b>that</b> <b>were,</b> in Perrault's era, considered populaire and du bas peuple, and finally, in the appearance of vestigial passages that now are superfluous to the plot, do not illuminate the narrative, and thus, are passages the Opies believe a literary artist would have rejected in the process of creating a work of art. One such vestigial passage is Puss's boots; his insistence upon the footwear is explained nowhere in the tale, it is not developed, nor is it referred to after its first mention except in an aside.|$|E
