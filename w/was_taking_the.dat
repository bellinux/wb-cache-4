5|$|Planetary {{models of}} atoms were not new, but Bohr's {{treatment}} <b>was.</b> <b>Taking</b> <b>the</b> 1912 paper by Darwin {{on the role}} of electrons in the interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point, he advanced the theory of electrons travelling in orbits around the atom's nucleus, with the chemical properties of each element being largely determined by the number of electrons in the outer orbits of its atoms. He introduced the idea that an electron could drop from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a quantum of discrete energy. This became a basis for what is now known as the old quantum theory.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Stevens {{was elected}} {{to serve on the}} National Council of the National Woman's Party. The {{following}} year, when Alice Paul returned from a two-year trip to Switzerland to establish the World Woman’s Party (WWP), difficulties arose. Paul experienced both challenges to the direction she <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> NWP and had personality conflicts with members, including Stevens. When Alva Belmont died in 1933, the bequest she had promised Stevens for years of personal service was instead directed to the NWP. Stevens sued the estate, eventually receiving US$12,000, but she believed that Paul had sabotaged her relationship with Belmont. After Paul's resignation in 1945, Stevens did not support Paul's hand-selected replacement, Anita Pollitzer and led an unsuccessful attempt to challenge her leadership. Pollitzer was seen as a figurehead for Paul and an internal dispute arose over the NWP’s emphasis on the WWP and international rights rather than domestic organizing. During these tensions, a dissenting faction of NWP members tried to take over party headquarters and elect their own slate of officers, but Pollitzer’s claim to leadership was supported by a ruling of a federal district judge.|$|E
5|$|In September 1935, {{after seven}} years, Briskin {{resigned}} from Columbia, failing {{to reach an}} agreement with Harry Cohn over stock options. For years, many in the film industry knew that Briskin was responsible for many of the successes at Columbia, even though studio head Harry Cohn <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> credit. Shortly after, reports began to circulate that he was headed to 20th Century-Fox. Shortly after that report, he was offered a front-office position at MGM, but turned it down because he wanted to be more actively involved in film production, which was followed by a denial from Fox that he was headed to that studio. One of the rumors which circulated was that Briskin was part of a group aligned with Consolidated Film Industries, which was attempting a takeover of Universal. By year's end, Briskin had agreed to a deal with Warner Bros. to produce 12 films, however that deal never reached fruition and Briskin ended up agreeing to a deal with RKO to join the studio as their vice-president in charge of production. The position was newly created especially for Briskin. B. B. Kahane remained as the overall head of RKO Studios, running all aspects other than production, but there was concern that Briskin would have conflict with long-term RKO producer, Pandro S. Berman. Conflict was averted when Berman received a one-year extension on his contract, wherein he had sole authority over his productions, answering only directly to Kahane.|$|E

The LAX {{control tower}} mistakenly tells the pilot to turn left instead of right to {{head over the}} ocean. BR 15 instead headed north and was maintaining 5000 feet as it headed towards 5700 foot peak Mt. Wilson. EVA was forced to climb to 6000 feet. Air Canada Flight 788, also from LAX <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> same route BR 15 was. Air Canada Flight 788 was forced to climb to over 10000 feet to avoid hitting BR 15. It took almost two minutes for the pilot to make a 180 degree turn to go southbound. An investigation is being held and EVA Air also did not comment.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{televised}} broadcast, Billy Gunn defeated The Brooklyn Brawler {{in a dark}} match. The first match on the pay-per-view event saw Razor Ramon, Randy Savage, the 1–2–3 Kid, and Marty Jannetty face Diesel, Irwin R. Schyster, Rick Martel, and Adam Bomb. Prior to the match, Ramon announced that Savage <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> place of Perfect, who was unable to appear. Martel and Ramon began the match in the ring, but Martel soon tagged out to bring Bomb into the match. Ramon performed a suplex on Bomb and attempted to pin his opponent. Martel tried to rescue his partner but ended up hitting Bomb instead and causing an argument. The 1–2–3 Kid entered the match but was overpowered by Bomb and Diesel. After the Kid tagged out, Savage performed a diving elbow drop on Diesel before getting the pinfall to eliminate Diesel from the match. Ramon was attacked by his opponents but eventually tagged Savage back into the match. Savage got distracted when Crush appeared in the aisle, however, which allowed Schyster to eliminate him from the match. Ramon then performed a Razor's Edge on Schyster and pinned him. Ramon attempted the same move on Martel, but Schyster snuck back into the ring and hit Ramon with a briefcase. Ramon {{fell out of the}} ring and was counted out of the match. The remaining four wrestlers fought back and forth, but the 1–2–3 Kid eventually pinned Martel after a sunset flip. Almost immediately, Jannetty performed a sunset flip on Bomb to win the match for his team.|$|E

25|$|The {{new season}} was placed by Grade at 7.35pm on Monday evenings {{opposite}} the ITV soap opera, Coronation Street. The latter was the most-watched programme on British television, and the viewing figures for Doctor Who suffered accordingly, {{though they were}} frequently the best for any BBC programme broadcast in the slot (viewing figures at the time did not take account of video recordings). The season's quality was also publicly derided by many fans of the programme, although over the following two seasons the criticism was balanced out by some happier viewers, who felt that the young team of writers being assembled by Cartmel <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> programme in the right direction.|$|E

25|$|In 1894 {{while he}} was living in Glendalough, he bought a Dublin Bay Water Wag, a 13-foot type of sailing boat usually sailed in Dun Laoghaire, pear-shaped with a single gaff-rigged sail. He sailed this boat on Lough Dan, close to Glendalough, and he and his brother Henry used to take friends for a sail in the Water Wag. Bigger and better boats followed: by 1895 he <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> half-deck Marguerite across the Channel and in 1897 there was a long cruise to the Frisian Islands, Norderney and the Baltic with Henry in the thirty-foot cutter Vixen: a voyage he {{repeated}} in the following spring.|$|E
