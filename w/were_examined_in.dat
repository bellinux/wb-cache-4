5|$|In 2003, {{evidence}} of tumors, including hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer, and osteoblastoma, {{was described in}} Edmontosaurus bones. Rothschild et al. tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, also tested positive. Although more than 10,000fossils <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> this manner, the tumors were limited to Edmontosaurus and closely related genera. The tumors may {{have been caused by}} environmental factors or genetic propensity.|$|E
5|$|Ampelosaurus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{completely}} known titanosaurian sauropods from Europe. Since 1989, over 500 bones discovered at the Upper Cretaceous Bellevue locality of southern France have been assigned to A. atacis. An abundant amount of well-preserved elements have been uncovered at Bellevue. In the original description, only a tooth and some vertebrae <b>were</b> <b>examined.</b> <b>In</b> 2005, a complete description was made by Le Loueff of all known material, allowing Ampelosaurus to be much better understood. All the material has been assigned to the species, and even though there are some differences in limb proportions, it has all been linked to individual variation.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{set out a}} {{detailed}} study of common descent with modifications by expanding {{on the theme of}} coevolution between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in On the Origin of Species. He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> relation to natural selection to demonstrate how slight variations in similar structures of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with different ways to cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result is demanding to read.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery {{observed}} that antigens could be precipitated by antibodies {{and went on}} to show that antibodies are made of protein. The biochemical properties of antigen-antibody-binding interactions <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> more detail in the late 1930s by John Marrack. The next major advance was in the 1940s, when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that the interactions between antibodies and antigens depend more on their shape than their chemical composition. In 1948, Astrid Fagreaus discovered that B cells, in the form of plasma cells, were responsible for generating antibodies.|$|E

25|$|Reliable {{comprehensive}} incidence {{statistics for}} c-SCLC are unavailable. In the literature, {{the frequency with}} which the c-SCLC variant is diagnosed largely depends on the size of tumor samples, tending to be higher in series where large surgical resection specimens are examined, and lower when diagnoses are based on small cytology and/or biopsy samples. Tatematsu et al. reported 15 cases of c-SCLC (12%) in their series of 122 consecutive SCLC patients, but only 20 resection specimens <b>were</b> <b>examined.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, Nicholson et al. found 28 c-SCLC (28%) in a series of 100 consecutive resected SCLC cases. It appears likely, then, that the c-SCLC variant comprises 25% to 30% of all SCLC cases.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC), {{which was}} {{established}} by Act of Parliament in April 1999, has wide-ranging powers to investigate cases where a miscarriage of justice is alleged, and reviewed Megrahi's case from September 2003. Although the Commission normally expects to review a case and announce its decision within 12 months, it took nearly four years to complete the Megrahi review.

A number of proposals <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> December 1859 and a pontoon bridge, submitted by Fowler Boyd Price, was in favour. The committee planned to establish a Pontoon Bridge Company with a capital of £4,000 in 200 shares of £20 but the engineering experts from the Roads Branch of the New South Wales Department of Public Works objected to the pontoon bridge. The local committee agree to build a pile bridge which was recommended by New South Wales Department of Public Works. After the New South Wales Government refused to support this type of bridge the committee decided to finance it themselves.|$|E

The hearings began in 1904 and continued until 1907, when the Senate finally voted to seat him. During the hearings, Smoot was given a provisional seat on the Senate and was allowed to vote. Smoot's chief opponents in the Senate were Senators Fred Dubois of Idaho and Julius C. Burrows of Michigan, who heavily criticized the church for its practice of polygamy. However, the opposition against Smoot was not universal among the senators with Senators such as Boies Penrose of Pennsylvania making sympathetic remarks on the issue.|$|E
25|$|Fatigue-failure of {{the wing}} of VH-RMQ {{immediately}} raised doubt {{about the validity of}} the retirement life of the inner lower boom in the Type 700 so British Aircraft Corporation and the UK Air Registration Board (ARB) took the precaution of reducing the life from 11,400 flights to 7,000. This soon resulted in British Aircraft Corporation obtaining a number of inner lower booms with time in service greater than 7,000 flights. Nineteen of these retired booms <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> detail. Sixteen contained minor fatigue cracks in different critical locations. The longest crack was 0.054-inch (1.37mm) in a boom that had been in service for 8,194 flights. This evidence convinced British Aircraft Corporation and the UK Air Registration Board that the inner lower boom did not possess the fatigue endurance originally intended so the precautionary life of 7,000 flights was made permanent.|$|E

25|$|The Viggen was {{initially}} developed as an intended {{replacement for the}} Saab 32 Lansen in the attack role and later the Saab 35 Draken as a fighter. In 1955, as Saab's prototype Draken, the most aerodynamically advanced fighter {{in the world at}} that point, performed its first flight, the Swedish Air Force was already forming a series of requirements {{for the next generation of}} combat aircraft; due to the challenging nature of these requirements, a lengthy development time was anticipated, with the first flight intended to be no early than the middle of the next decade. Between 1952 and 1957, the first studies towards what would become the Viggen were carried out, involving the Finnish aircraft designer Aarne Lakomaa. Over 100 different concepts <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> these studies, involving both single- and twin engine configurations, both traditional and double delta wings, and canard wings. Even VTOL designs were considered, with separate lift engines, but were soon identified as being unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{monogenic}} diseases {{for which}} prenatal diagnosis is more commonly applied to include cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia. Both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders {{have been detected}} noninvasively by analyzing paternally inherited DNA. Limitations to single gene disorders are autosomal recessive mutation or when the fetal autosomal dominant mutation is maternally inherited. There are also large sequence mutations that include duplication, expansion, insertion of DNA sequences. cffDNA is fragmented with 200-300bp in length, thus these are harder to detect. One example is achondroplasia, a common autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, caused by FGFR3 gene point mutations. Two pregnancies <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> this study, one fetus {{was found to have}} the paternally inherited G1138A mutation and the other with a G1138A de novo mutation. Another example is the Huntington's disease. It is currently diagnosed at 10–13 weeks at gestation with chronic villus sampling for polymorphic repeats. With qRT-PCR, there has been detection of CAG repeats at 17, 20 and 24, all normal levels.|$|E
500|$|In 1997 a {{suitcase}} belonging to Schindler containing historic photographs and documents {{was discovered in}} the attic of the apartment of Ami and Heinrich Staehr in Hildesheim.

Staehr's son Chris took the suitcase to Stuttgart, where the documents <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> detail in 1999 by Dr. Wolfgang Borgmann, science editor of the Stuttgarter Zeitung. Borgmann wrote a series of seven articles, which appeared in the paper from 16 to 26 October 1999 and were eventually published in book form as Schindlers Koffer: Berichte aus dem Leben eines Lebensretters eine Dokumentation der Stuttgarter Zeitung (Schindler's Suitcase: Report on the Life of a Rescuer). The documents and suitcase were sent to the Holocaust museum at Yad Vashem in Israel for safekeeping in December 1999.|$|E

500|$|The {{first known}} {{bigeye sand tiger}} was a female [...] long caught off Madeira in April 1941, on a {{longline}} set for black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo). The specimen was mounted and later {{formed the basis for}} a scientific description authored by German ichthyologist Günther Maul in a 1955 article for Notulae Naturae. He named the species noronhai in honor of Adolfo César de Noronha, the late Director of the Funchal Museum. Maul assigned his new species to the genus Carcharias, which at the time was used for all members of the sand tiger shark family. When the Odontaspis came to be recognized as a valid genus separate from Carcharias, the bigeye sand tiger was reassigned as well given its resemblance to the smalltooth sand tiger (O. ferox). Until more specimens <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s, some authors speculated that this species represented an extreme variant of the smalltooth sand tiger. Other names for this shark include black sand tiger, oceanic sand tiger, and bigeye ragged-tooth shark.|$|E
