25|$|Welding lead or 'lead burning' {{was much}} {{more common in the}} 19th century to make some pipe {{connections}} and tanks. Great skill is required but can be quickly learned. In building construction today some lead flashing is welded but soldered copper flashing is much more common in America. In the automotive body collision industry before the 1980s, oxyacetylene gas torch welding was seldom used to weld sheetmetal, since <b>warpage</b> was a byproduct besides the excess heat. Automotive body repair methods at the time were crude and yielded improprieties until MIG welding became the industry standard. Since the 1970s, when high strength steel became the standard for automotive manufacturing, electric welding became the preferred method. After the 1980s, the oxyacetylene torch fell out of use for sheetmetal welding in the industrialized world.|$|E

2500|$|The Yamaha Corporation saw {{success in}} the {{marketplace}} in the 1970s and early 1980s with fiberglass racquets made with the small [...] "standard" [...] head size such as the YFG 10. Several other companies introduced racquets made just with fiberglass as well, such as Caldon and Head. As with the Yamaha, these were made with the standard head size. The Fortissimo, however, was made with the new oversize head size, using the improved resistance to <b>warpage</b> (when compared with wood) and lighter weight (when compared with metal) of fiberglass. Fiberglass never achieved market dominance, though, as wood racquets with graphite layering and metal racquets, including oversize models, continued to find popularity. Graphite, which offered better stiffness and resistance to cracking than fiberglass, eventually displaced all other materials as the primary constituent material of a tennis racquet.|$|E

5000|$|Kip Thorne concludes, in remarks {{based on}} Hilbert's 1924 paper, that Hilbert {{regarded}} the General Theory of relativity as Einstein's: [...] "Quite naturally, and {{in accord with}} Hilbert's view of things, the resulting law of <b>warpage</b> was quickly given the name the Einstein field equation rather than being named after Hilbert. Hilbert had carried out the last few mathematical steps to its discovery independently and almost simultaneously with Einstein, but Einstein was responsible for essentially everything that preceded those steps...". However, Kip Thorne also stated, [...] "Remarkably, Einstein {{was not the first}} to discover the correct form of the law of <b>warpage</b> [...] [...] [...] Recognition for the first discovery must go to Hilbert." ...|$|E
50|$|The organ barrels must be sturdy to {{maintain}} precise alignment over time, since {{they play the}} same programming role as music rolls and have to endure significant mechanical strain.

50|$|Finally, {{although}} pre-production engines cast by {{an outside}} foundry performed well, those fitted to production cars were made very poorly in house by a plant troubled with industrial unrest and poor quality control. Poor manufacturing standards also {{gave rise to}} head <b>warpage,</b> and head gaskets that restricted coolant flow, which also led to overheating.|$|E
50|$|Straightening of warped steel weldments is {{done with}} an Oxy-acetylene torch and is {{somewhat}} of an art. Heat is selectively applied to the steel in a slow, linear sweep. The steel will have a net contraction, upon cooling, {{in the direction of}} the sweep. A highly skilled welder can remove significant <b>warpage</b> using this technique.|$|E
5000|$|Symmetrical cross {{sections}} are always preferred to nonsymmetrical {{cross sections}} {{because it contains}} unbalances stresses which lead to <b>warpage</b> in the part and causes damage to the tools. Sometimes if a part cannot be converted into symmetric shape then {{two of them are}} clubbed together to form a symmetric shape and they are cut off in two after extrusion.|$|E
50|$|Non-uniform wall {{sections}} {{can contribute}} to <b>warpage</b> and stresses in molded parts. Sections which are too thin have a higher chance of breakage in handling, may restrict the flow of material and may trap air causing a defective part. Too heavy a wall thickness, on the other hand, will slow the curing cycle and add to material cost and increase cycle time.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{induction}} heating cycle is very short {{in comparison to}} flame brazing, more parts can be processed in {{the same amount of}} time, and less heat is released to the surrounding environment.“An induction brazing system quickly delivers highly localized heat to minimize part <b>warpage</b> and distortion. Brazing in a controlled vacuum or in an inert protective atmosphere can significantly improve overall part quality and eliminate costly part cleaning procedures” (Induction Atmospheres, 1).|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{sheet film}} and glass plate holders {{have been made}} out of wood. Wooden holders, {{properly}} treated, can last a very long time, and apart from possible <b>warpage,</b> many very old specimens are still in service. Some companies continue to make wood models today, particularly for more uncommon film sizes, and as many are mostly handmade, they can be quite expensive. The majority of new sheet film holders are now made out of plastic.|$|E
5000|$|The glass {{transition}} temperature of PPA increases {{as the amount of}} TPA increases. If more than 55% of the acid part of a PPA is made out of IPA, then the copolymer is amorphous. [...] The properties of semicrystalline polymers v amorphous polymers are described elsewhere in detail. Briefly, crystallinity helps with chemical resistance and mechanical properties above the {{glass transition}} temperature (but below the melting point).

5000|$|Buick Special and Oldsmobile F-85 for {{all three}} years shared an {{aluminum}} block 215 cubic-inch V8 engine featuring cast-iron liners to prevent overheating and block <b>warpage</b> problems common with aluminum block engines. Although Buick and Olds shared the same basic engine design, both divisions used different cylinder heads, camshafts, carburetors and compression ratios. The 215 V8 was also available on the Pontiac Tempest for 1961 and 1962 and used the Buick version, but very few Tempests were so-equipped.|$|E
50|$|Generally, thinner {{walls are}} more {{feasible}} with small parts {{rather than with}} large ones. The limiting factor in wall thinness is the tendency for the plastic material in thin walls to cool and solidify before the mold is filled. The shorter the material flow, the thinner the wall can be. Walls also should be as uniform in thickness as possible to avoid <b>warpage</b> from uneven shrinkage. When changes in wall thickness are unavoidable, the transition should be gradual and not abrupt.|$|E
50|$|Long-term use of PMMA or thick {{hydrogel}} {{contact lenses}} {{has been found}} to cause corneal <b>warpage</b> (shape distortion), increased eye irritability, photophobia, blurred vision, and persistent haloes. Collectively, these symptoms constitute Corneal Exhaustion Syndrom (CES), which is associated with corneal endothelium abnormalities including edema, polymegethism, irregular mosaic, and pigment deposition. Patients with CES suffer from compromised corneal endothelium resulting from chronic hypoxia and acidosis. These problems can be alleviated by providing a patient with lenses that allow for greater oxygen permeability.|$|E
50|$|Potentiometers and {{trimmers}} are three-terminal electromechanical parts, {{containing a}} resistive path with an adjustable wiper contact. Along with the failure modes for normal resistors, mechanical wear on the wiper and the resistive layer, corrosion, surface contamination, and mechanical deformations {{may lead to}} intermittent path-wiper resistance changes, which are a problem with audio amplifiers. Many types are not perfectly sealed, with contaminants and moisture entering the part; an especially common contaminant is the solder flux. Mechanical deformations (like an impaired wiper-path contact) can occur by housing <b>warpage</b> during soldering or mechanical stress during mounting. Excess stress on leads can cause substrate cracking and open failure when the crack penetrates the resistive path.|$|E
5000|$|... "A longer rifle barrel has the {{advantages}} of a longer sight radius, theoretically allowing a shooter to obtain {{a higher degree of}} accuracy from the improved precision of the sights alone. A longer barrel also provides a longer path for the projectile to stabilize prior to exiting the barrel, while allotting {{a longer period of time}} for the propellant charge to act on the projectile, often resulting in higher muzzle velocities and more consistent trajectories. A long barrel inherently provides more mass available for heat transfer, increasing the heat transfer rate incurred between shots, in turn allotting less <b>warpage</b> in the barrel, helping to improve consistency (and ultimately accuracy)." ...|$|E
50|$|GE {{engineers}} quickly saw {{the potential}} for improved heat transfer characteristics in several already popular pentode and beam tetrode vacuum tube designs, including the 6L6GB, the 7189, and eventually the 6550. The application of the five-layer (Al-Fe-Cu-Fe-Al) material to anode manufacture solved the problem of irregular heat buildup at high power levels in the anode plates of power pentodes, tetrodes, and triodes. This irregular heat buildup leads to physical distortion of the tube's plate. if allowed to continue, this spot overheating eventually results in <b>warpage</b> which allows physical contact and subsequent short circuits between the plate, grids, and beam formers in the tube. Such contact shorts destroy the tube.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the video}} game, {{there is one}} more {{instance}} of Columbia/Sony having packs produced for production. That would be the packs made for the Universal Studios Florida stage show. As to how much lineage these packs actually have is still up in the air. If the master for these mold was retooled from a production mold, it was heavily modified. There is much extra material added around the EDA, both where the beamline and filler tubes go, as well as between the injector tubes and the EDA. At least {{the bottom half of the}} Booster tube and frame are cast into the shell as well as the N-Filter. There also seems to be much <b>warpage</b> at this point. These packs were also mounted on what seems like MDF motherboards and LC-2 ALICE frames.|$|E

5000|$|Microdroplets: Water vapor with entrained water microdroplets {{can cause}} {{deformities}} or irregularities in wafers {{as the water}} settles on hot surfaces. Microdroplets {{are the result of}} incomplete vaporization of the water source. This is common with boiling and vaporizers where it is difficult to get sufficient heat into the boiling liquid. These microdroplets can cause contamination and problems in uniformity. The boiling action of water creates microdroplets, which act as liquid capsules that entrain particles and molecular contaminants such as ions, organics, and pyrogens. Microdroplets are known to carry particulate and ionic impurities that cannot be carried by pure vapor alone. Furthermore, cold spots occur where microdroplets land leading to non-uniformity and <b>warpage.</b> In order for oxide films to work properly, the film thickness and uniformity are critical.|$|E

50|$|Sharp Corners {{general design}} {{guidelines}} in injection molding suggest that corner radii {{should be at}} least one-half the wall thickness. It is recommended to avoid sharp corners and use generous fillets and radii whenever required. During injection molding, the molten plastic has to navigate turns or corners. Rounded corners will ease plastic flow, so engineers should generously radius the corners of all parts. In contrast, sharp inside corners result in molded-in stress particularly during the cooling process when the top of the part tries to shrink and the material pulls against the corners. Moreover, the first rule of plastic design i.e. uniform wall thickness will be obeyed. As the plastic goes around a well-proportioned corner, it will not be subjected to area increases and abrupt changes in direction. Cavity packing pressure stays consistent. This leads to a strong, dimensionally stable corner that will resist post-mold <b>warpage.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The stroked 250 version {{produced}} [...] for Chevrolet and GMC, with a 37/8 in bore and 317/32 in stroke. Between 1975 and 1984, {{an integrated}} cylinder head was produced (intake manifold and cylinder head were a single casting with a bolt on exhaust manifold), with one-barrel intakes for passenger cars, and two-barrel intakes for trucks after 1978. The [...] "integrated" [...] cylinder head and intake manifold {{claimed to have}} resulted in increased low end torque and fuel economy inclusive of a smoother operation which pre-dated NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness). Some pundits consider the integrated cylinder head as {{a relic of the}} malaise era when it was phased out of production in 1984 prior to the introduction of the 4.3L where it was common to swap the earlier head (or one from the tall deck 292) in place of the integrated head since the extra weight resulted in <b>warpage</b> - especially with light truck and van use including fleets.|$|E
50|$|While all the specs {{from the}} {{original}} RG550 are mirrored in the 20th Anniversary run, Ibanez have addressed one important issue. The original RG550 models sometimes suffered from catastrophic neck <b>warpage,</b> owing to the ultra-slim carve of the neck - {{the very thing that}} made the RG550 such a unique instrument in the first place. Instead of recreating the 2- or 3-piece neck of the late 1980s, which usually had a head piece and a longer neck piece glued together obliquely just behind the nut, Ibanez have revised the entire neck construction with the 20th Anniversary model. The neck on the new RG550 is a 5-piece laminate, with three strips of hard rock maple and two thin strips of walnut. The maple strips are arranged so that the grain on the outer two pieces is parallel, while the grain of the center strip is perpendicular to the other two, thereby granting the neck far more resistance to warping than the originals had. They also feature 2 titanium rods going down each side of the truss rod for added strength and rigidity.|$|E
