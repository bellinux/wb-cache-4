The return followed the failure by RTÉ 2fm in its attempts to target teenagers. Fanning claimed: In fact I so never moved that instead I brought the four people who were working <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> Radio One and their desks into 2FM! I never went over to Radio One, I did all my programmes from 2FM, I never moved. I was also doing 2FM every Sunday so I never left at all so I'm just back to my spiritual home Monday to Friday.|$|E

These concerns proved to be ill-founded, however, as he was voted in on the first ballot. His son Lawrence Taylor Jr. gave his introduction speech at the induction ceremony. Taylor's ex-wife, his three children, and his parents were in attendance and during his induction speech Taylor acknowledged them saying, [...] "hank you for putting up <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> all those years." [...] He also credited former Giants owner Wellington Mara for being supportive of him saying, [...] "e probably cared more about me as a person than he really should have." ...|$|E

She states of this: [...] "Shakespeare keeps coming my way. I love the fact that I get to play people who are much more articulate than I'll ever be". Ayola has performed in Twelfth Night in the lead roles of both Olivia and Viola. She explains: [...] "The role of Viola didn't sit that well <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> some reason but Olivia makes more sense." [...] She has also appeared in modern performances, assuming the title role of Dido, Queen of Carthage at the Globe Theatre in London in 2003, which she described as [...] "a dream of a part". She has deemed her dream role to be that of Isabella in Measure for Measure, as she once lost out on the part and would like to prove herself capable of playing it.|$|E

500|$|In a 1994 interview, Joel {{dismissed}} {{criticism of}} unclear elements in their films: [...] "People {{have a problem}} dealing {{with the fact that}} our movies are not straight-ahead. They would prefer that the last half of Barton Fink just be about a screenwriter's writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the real world...." [...] Talk show host Larry King expressed approval of the movie, despite its uncertain conclusion. He wrote in USA Today: [...] "The ending is something I'm still thinking about and if they accomplished that, I guess it worked." [...] In a 2016 interview, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman said after being asked which film he would want with him on a deserted island, [...] "A movie I really love is Barton Fink. I don’t know if that’s the movie I’d take to a desert island, but I feel like there’s so much in there, you could watch it again and again.

500|$|... "Evermore"'s lamenting melody is {{paired with}} lyrics that express loneliness, {{accompanied}} by heavy orchestration that swells and loudens as the ballad progresses. Both [...] "brooding" [...] and hopeful {{at the same}} time, Jay Jason of Comicbook.com believes that the song's lyrics are inspired by the popular saying [...] "If you love someone, let them go." [...] Stevens' voice quavers with emotion when he sings the phrase [...] "I never needed anybody in my life". Amanda Greever of The Daily Times insists that the song's lyrics will move all listeners to tears. Featuring lyrics that revolve around heartache and heartbreak, [...] "Evermore"'s chorus reads: [...] "Now I know she'll never leave me/Even as she runs away/She will still torment me/Call me, hurt me/Move me, come what may/Wasting in my lonely tower/Waiting by an open door/I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in/And be <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> evermore", which Stevens performs vulnerably. The track also discusses themes such as true love, sacrifice and learning to understand love. Stevens sings within the vocal range of a [...] "deep, resonating baritone" [...] throughout the song, which lasts a total duration of three minutes and fourteen seconds; Channel NewsAsia contributor Genevieve Sarah Loh compared Stevens' voice, whose notes are suspended by the instrumentation, to [...] "melted-chocolate", gradually becoming more human-sounding as the song progresses. Belting comfortably, Stevens' voice {{has been compared to}} that of Terrence Man, the actor who originated the role of the Beast in the Broadway adaptation and recorded [...] "If I Can't Love Her". Some traces of Auto-Tune can be heard in Stevens' performance.|$|E
500|$|Baba himself {{maintained}} an ambiguous profile, unwilling {{to identify with}} {{either of the two}} religions. His Muslim devotees were fully convinced that he belonged to their fold, identifying him as an avaliā. The Hindu bhaktas also viewed him as one of them, since he often identified himself with their gods and customs. Sai Baba wanted to belong to all and be shared by all. When pressed on whether he was Hindu or Muslim, he would often get very angry. Once he told a devotee: [...] "You have been <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> eighteen years now. Does Sai mean for you only these three and a half cubits of height?" [...] Sai Baba was able to avoid clashes between the two communities, and, in fact, succeeded in unifying them in an atmosphere of general harmony. In a verse of the midday arti, devotees sing: Baba would often talk about the Hindu gods, quoting from sacred texts or even commenting upon passages of the Bhagavadgita, the Isha Upanishad, and so forth. The names of Krishna and Rama seem to have been particularly dear to him. With his Muslim followers, Baba would always talk of Allah and the Koran, often quoting Persian verses. One of his favorite expressions was [...] "Allah rakhega vaiia rahena", that is, [...] "Let us be content with what we have, and submit our will to Allah." [...] On several occasions, Sai reassured his listeners by saying that he, like them, was but a devotee of Allah, a humble faqir with two arms and two legs. In later years, Parsis and even a few Christians would come to Shirdi. Sai Baba respected all creeds, true to his conviction that all religions are but particular paths leading to one ineffable goal.|$|E

In an interview with Jonathon Gatehouse, he conceded, [...] "You wouldn't be human if you didn't feel both a sense of responsibility and a deep sadness for those who have lost their lives. That responsibility stays with me now, and will stay <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> the rest of my life. You know, I came to office as prime minister in 1997, focusing on domestic policy and ended up in four conflicts – Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. And it does change you, and so it should." [...] BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said Blair's severest critics would see the donation as [...] "guilt money" [...] for taking the UK to war against Iraq in 2003. The father of a soldier killed there decried the donation as [...] "blood money", while the father of another serviceman who died said Blair had a [...] "guilty conscience." [...] A spokesperson for the Stop the War Coalition supported with the donation, but added, [...] "No proportion of Tony Blair's massive and ill-gotten fortune can buy him innocence or forgiveness. He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." [...] A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was [...] "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice." [...] The announcement was welcomed by Chris Simpkins, director general of The Royal British Legion, who said, [...] "Mr Blair's generosity is much appreciated and will help us to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of injured personnel." ...|$|E

2500|$|Soon after, Kirchner's {{close friend}} and mentor, Botho Graef died and Kirchner {{decided to return to}} Davos for treatment.

Kirchner deeply resented this and did {{everything}} in his power to deceive the doctor: [...] "Spengler didn’t know what to do <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> my deception was totally alien to this excellent man’s way of thinking". To avoid being under constant watch, Kirchner moved to the Reusch Hut on the Stafelalp in the summer of 1917. Kirchner continued to experience depression, occasional pain and paralysis of his limbs but wrote in a more cheerful tone to Dr. Hagemann at the end of July: [...] "I wish to remain in the world and for the world. The high mountains here will help me". The summer was very productive despite Kirchner's illness. He finished some important pieces during the two month, such as [...] "View of the Church in Monstein" [...] and [...] "Rising Moon in the Stafelalp". Together with 11 woodcuts, these works marked the start of Kirchner's Alpine life.|$|E
