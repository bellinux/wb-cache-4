5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One {{of the women}} <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>there</b> had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon {{who had just been}} {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E
5|$|The Actor Rebellion of 1733 was {{an event}} that {{took place at the}} Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London, England when the actors <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>there,</b> disapproving of the changes in the management, {{attempted}} to seize control. Before the rebellion, the theatre was controlled by the managers Theophilus Cibber, John Ellys, and John Highmore. When Theophilus lost his share and was denied a bid to run the theatre, he, along with other actors, attempted to take over the theatre by controlling the lease. When the shareholders found out, they refused to admit the actors to the building and the theatre was closed for several months. The fight spilled over to the contemporary newspapers, which generally sided with the managers.|$|E

In his own account (since disputed by others), he came across the deserted village of Ein Hod, which the Palestinian Arabs had largely discarded during the 1948 exodus. Janco felt that the place should not be demolished, obtaining a lease on it from the authorities, and rebuilt the place with other Israeli artists <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>there</b> on weekends; Janco's main residence continued to be in the neighborhood of Ramat Aviv. His plot of land in Ein Hod was previously owned by the Arab Abu Faruq, who died in 1991 at the Jenin refugee camp. Janco became the site's first mayor, reorganizing it into a utopian society, art colony and tourist attraction, and instituted the strict code of requirements for one's settlement in Ein Hod.|$|E
