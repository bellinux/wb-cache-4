5|$|The {{gray wolf}} {{is one of}} the world's best-known and most-researched animals, with {{probably}} more books <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> than any other wildlife species. It {{has a long history of}} association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds.|$|E
5|$|Rudraveena was {{produced}} {{on a budget}} of 8 million. Released on 4 March 1988, the film received critical acclaim. It was also premiered at the 12th International Film Festival of India. However, it was a commercial failure and Babu had to incur a loss of 0.6 million. It was dubbed as a setback for Chiranjeevi who had starred in a streak of successful films such as Pasivadi Pranam, Swayamkrushi, Jebu Donga (all released in 1987) and Manchi Donga (1988). Babu considered Rudraveena a spiritually awakening film personally and felt that a book could be <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The film was remade into Tamil as Unnal Mudiyum Thambi {{in the same year}} by Balachander himself, with Kamal Haasan reprising Chiranjeevi's role, while Ganesan reprised his role.|$|E

You might be wrong, but you have to think <b>about</b> <b>it</b> very intensely to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> So I use writing as a learning tool.|$|R

25|$|National Security and Nuclear Diplomacy was {{presented}} in bookstores without any unveiling ceremony and simply after limited introduction on a few websites. Therefore, most media and critics actually {{did not know about}} it for quite a time. However, after an interview with Hassan Rouhani by Mehrnameh magazine in May 2012, the book hit the headlines not only in domestic print media, but also in their counterparts outside the country, including the BBC Persian TV, and many critiques were <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to afford}} the asking price, and {{concerned}} that, ostensibly because of the former private owner's tax concerns, Witten refused to reveal the provenance of the map, Yale contacted another alumnus, Paul Mellon, who agreed to buy it (for a price later stated to be about $300,000) and donate it to the university {{if it could be}} authenticated. Recognizing its potential importance as the earliest map unambiguously showing America, Mellon insisted that its existence be kept secret until a scholarly book had been <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Even the three authors of the book were chosen from among the small number of people who had seen the map before Mellon bought it—two British Museum curators and Marston. Only one of them, Dr. Raleigh Ashlin Skelton, keeper of the Museum's map collection, had significant expertise relevant to the problems posed by the map (his colleague George Painter, the first person to whom Davis had shown the map in 1957, was brought in for the transcription and translation of the Relation) and the secrecy almost completely ruled out consultation with specialists. Witten did his best to help during this period, not only answering the authors' questions, but offering suggestions of his own. After years of study, the proofs of the book, The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation, were ready by the end of 1964, and Mellon donated the map to Yale. The book was published, and the map revealed to the world, the day before Columbus Day, 1965. Many academic reviewers of the book took the opportunity to point out evidence that called the map's authenticity into question, so a year later, a Vinland Map Conference was held at the Smithsonian Institution, during which further significant questions were asked, particularly of Witten, who gave very straightforward and helpful answers; but, the proceedings were not published for another five years.|$|E

The loudspeaker was used as studio monitors for controlling the sound quality of broadcasts. Such professional users included Philips and the BBC.|$|E
500|$|After Heseltine's death, {{assessments}} of his musical stature were generous. Newman considered some of Heseltine's choral compositions [...] "among the finest music written for massed voices by a modern Englishman." [...] Constant Lambert hailed him as [...] "one {{of the greatest}} song-writers that music has ever known", a view echoed by Copley. In a tribute published in The Musical Times, van Dieren referred to Heseltine's music as [...] "a national treasure" [...] that would long survive all that was currently being said or <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> In subsequent years his standing as a composer diminished; Brian Collins records how public perceptions of Warlock were distorted by the scandalous reports of his private life, so that his musical importance in the inter-war years became obscured. However, when the Peter Warlock Society was created in 1963, interest in his music began to increase. Collins acknowledges that the Warlock output includes much that can be dismissed as mere programme-fillers and encore items, but these do not detract from numerous works of the highest quality, [...] "frequently thrilling and passionate and, occasionally, innovative {{to the point of}} being revolutionary".|$|E
500|$|Origen's letters do not survive. However, most {{scholars}} {{believe that the}} letters that circulated {{in the era of}} Eusebius and Jerome were genuine. It is also reasonable that Origen, a man with close contacts in the Christian Arab community, would have taken a particular interest in the first Arab emperor. The scholar K. J. Neumann argued that, since Origen would have known the faith of the imperial couple, he must have <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in the letters listed at 6.36.3. Since Eusebius read these letters, and does not mention that the emperor was Christian (Neumann understands the passage at 6.34 to reflect Eusebius' disbelief in Philip's Christianity), we must conclude that Philip was not Christian, and was neither baptized nor made catechumen. Against Neumann, Shahîd argues that, if Eusebius had found anything in the letters to disprove Philip's Christianity, he would have clearly outlined it in this passage—as the biographer of Constantine, it would have been in his interest to undermine any other claimants to the title [...] "first Christian emperor". Moreover, this segment of the Historia is a catalog of Origen's works and correspondence; the contents of the letters are irrelevant.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{influence}} has reached beyond jazz, as musicians of such genres as rock and classical {{have been influenced}} by it, while critics have <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> {{as one of the most}} influential albums of all time. Many improvisatory rock musicians of the 1960s referred to Kind of Blue for inspiration, along with other Davis albums, as well as Coltrane's modal records My Favorite Things (1961) and A Love Supreme (1965). Guitarist Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band said his soloing on songs such as [...] "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" [...] "comes from Miles and Coltrane, and particularly Kind of Blue. I've listened to that album so many times that for the past couple of years, I haven't hardly listened to anything else." [...] Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright said that the chord progressions on the album influenced the structure of the introductory chords to the song [...] "Breathe" [...] on their landmark opus The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). In his book Kind of Blue: The Making of a Miles Davis Masterpiece, writer Ashley Kahn wrote [...] "still acknowledged as the height of hip, four decades after it was recorded, Kind of Blue is the premier album of its era, jazz or otherwise. Its vapory piano introduction is universally recognized". [...] Producer Quincy Jones, one of Davis' longtime friends, wrote: [...] "That [...] will always be my music, man. I play Kind of Blue every day—it's my orange juice. It still sounds like it was made yesterday". Pianist Chick Corea, one of Miles' acolytes, was also struck by its majesty, later stating [...] "It's one thing to just play a tune, or play a program of music, but it's another thing to practically create a new language of music, which is what Kind of Blue did." ...|$|E
