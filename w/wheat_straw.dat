Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, <b>wheat</b> <b>straw</b> and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E

It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have also been shown to biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E

It is {{a useful tool for}} improving the efficiency of energy-resource use. The exergy values of four <b>wheat</b> <b>straws</b> (Absolvant, Max, Monopol and Vuka) were determined in this study. The effects of physical and chemical properties (moisture content, ash content, LHV and S, C, O, H and N contents) were evaluated. The moisture related exergy varied from 281. 834 kJ kg - 1 (Monopol) to 366. 766 kJ kg - 1 (Absolvant), accounting for 1. 311 - 1. 734 % of the total exergy of <b>wheat</b> <b>straws.</b> A negative linear relationship between the exergy value and moisture content was observed. The ash related exergy varied from 53. 468 kJ kg - 1 (Absolvant) to 117. 675 kJ kg - 1 (Vuka), accounting for 0. 253 - 0. 556 % of the total exergy of <b>wheat</b> <b>straws.</b> A negative linear relationship between the exergy value and ash content was observed. The S related exergy ranged from 6. 817 kJ kg - 1 (Max) to 11. 077 kJ kg - 1 (Vuka), accounting for 0. 032 - 0. 052 % of the total exergy of <b>wheat</b> <b>straws.</b> A positive linear relationship between the exergy value and S content was observed. The O/C, H/C and N/C atomic ratios and the correlation factors varied in ranges of 0. 7133 - 0. 7537, 1. 3475 - 1. 5457, 0. 0063 - 0. 0225 and 1. 133 - 1. 138, respectively. The exergy values of the four <b>wheat</b> <b>straws</b> were between 21. 156 MJ kg - 1 (Absolvant) and 21. 503 MJ kg - 1 (Monopol). They were mainly determined by the correlation factors and the LHVs. A positive linear relationship between the exergy value and LHV was observed. The combined contribution of ash, moisture and S related exergy to the total exergy was very small (1. 694 - 2. 212 %) and can be neglected...|$|R

This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the aim of determination of the effects of pellets prepared with addition of different additives (molasses, guar meal and sepiolite) on changes in in vitro rumen pH and temperature. Materials and methods. In the current study sixteen pelleted feeds were prepared with <b>wheat</b> and soybean <b>straws.</b> The Daisy incubator was used for maintaining (mimicing) rumen conditions and feed was incubated for 48 hours. The wireless rumen sensors were used for determination of the changes in in vitro rumen pH and temperature. The data were subjected to one way variance analysis. Results. The tested boluses were found to show similar temperature and pH measurements to digital pH metre measurements. The effect of sepiolite addition on pH and temperature was found insignificant in all treatments. The lowest pH value was determined for <b>wheat</b> <b>straws.</b> Control groups and molasses added in soybean <b>straws</b> and <b>wheat</b> <b>straws</b> were similar in terms of ruminal pH values.

30|$|This work {{presented}} a laser-based approach to synthesize carbonaceous micro/nanofibrous structures from rice husks and <b>wheat</b> <b>straws.</b> To {{the best of}} our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that synthesizing 3 -D micro/nanofibrous structures generated from rice husks and <b>wheat</b> <b>straws</b> using femtosecond laser have been reported. The morphological analyses by SEM confirmed that fabricated structures were composed of approximately uniform 3 -D structure at micro and nano sizes. Further experiments showed that by altering the laser pulse energy and the number of laser pulses, different structures from micro- to nanoarchitectures with different porosities and features could be achieved. The EDS analyses confirmed that laser irradiation affected the chemical composition as well; part of the organic matter is believed to be burned away owing to the laser irradiation. This approach suggests a promising step towards engineering green 3 -D platforms from sustainable materials. The as-engineered carbonaceous materials would have very broad practical applications in a variety of areas, such as environmental, catalytic, electronic, sensing, and biological applications. They can also be utilized to form biodegradable nanocomposites with other materials, e.g., polymers.|$|R

As a result, it has been found that this new vegetable material has a very low bulk density, a high water absorption capacity and an excellent hydric regulator.

He was sorry to give up this place for his bow, for it was convenient and appropriate, {{and for an instant}} he thought that it might remain, if the front door could be kept shut, and visitors admitted through a little side door which the family generally used, and which was almost as convenient as the other--except, indeed, on wash-days, when a wet sheet or some article of wearing apparel was apt to be hung in front of it. But although wash-day occurred but once a week, and although it was comparatively easy, after a little practice, to bob under a high-propped sheet, Pepton's heart was too kind to allow his mind to dwell upon this plan. So he drew the nails from the wall of the hall, and put them up in various places about the house. His own room had to be aired a great deal in all weathers, and so that would not do at all. The wall above the kitchen fireplace would be a good location, for the chimney was nearly always warm. But Pepton could not bring himself to keep his bow in the kitchen. There would be nothing esthetic about such a disposition of it, and, besides, the girl might be tempted to string and bend it. The old ladies really did not want it in the parlor, for its length and its green baize cover would make it an encroaching and unbecoming neighbor to the little engravings and the big samplers, the picture-frames of acorns and pine-cones, the fancifully patterned ornaments of clean <b>wheat</b> <b>straw,</b> and all the quaint adornments which had hung upon those walls for so many years.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate cellulase adsorption and recycling during enzymatic hydrolysis of two differently pretreated <b>wheat</b> <b>straws</b> (WS). Dilute acid treated WS showed lower hydrolysis yield of polysaccharides fraction and adsorbed more cellulase with hydrolyzed residue than dilute alkali treated sample. Four methods capable of recovering and recycling the enzyme bound to the residual substrate and the enzyme free in solution were used for three consecutive rounds of hydrolysis to compare their recycling efficiencies. Compared to the absorption recycling method, ultrafiltration recycling method possessed the capacity to retain p-glucosidase, thereby avoiding the supplementation of fresh p-glucosidase in subsequent rounds of hydrolysis. It was found that whatever recycling method was used, better recycling results were obtained for dilute alkali treated substrate than for dilute acid treated substrate. These results suggested that the great difference in the lignin content between acid treated WS and alkali treated WS would significantly affect enzymatic hydrolysis, cellulase adsorption and cellulase recycling efficiencies.
