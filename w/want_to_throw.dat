25|$|Beginners tend {{to point}} with the rod {{to where they}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw,</b> but the {{movement}} of the hand has to be a controlled speed-up and then come to an abrupt stop. The rod will then start to unfurl and the tip of the rod will reach a high speed in the required direction. The high speed of the rod tip toward the target gives the impulse to make the cast, the abrupt stop and retreat of the rod tip is essential for the formation of a loop. Experienced fishermen also improve the speed of the line leaving the rod tip by a technique called hauling, applying a quick fast pull with the hand holding the line. At the end of the cast when the line is stretched the line as a whole will still have speed and the fisherman can let some extra line through their fingers making a false throw, either forward or backward or to finish the cast and start fishing.|$|E

The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.|$|E
500|$|Far Side Virtual {{appeared}} on several [...] "best of 2011" [...] lists and features. In Tiny Mix Tapes' end-of-year wrap-up column on nostalgia in pop music, Jonathan Dean wrote, [...] "You may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> Far Side Virtual {{against a wall}} upon hearing its relentlessly arch, kitschy blandness, but it manages to successfully turn pop against itself, which, like it or not, is a politically progressive project. Its pure, bold conceptualism stood out in a year that was dominated by the 'febrile sterility' of post-internet microgenres and tail-swallowing postmodernism." [...] Music critic Jonah Weiner cited Far Side Virtual for his end-of-year article on contemporary protest songs, and called it [...] "antagonizingly, alienatingly, wondrously bland." [...] Fact named Hippos in Tanks the best label of the year, listing the signing of Ferraro and subsequent release of Far Side Virtual {{as one of its}} finest accomplishments.|$|E

500|$|A two-part episode, aired to {{coincide}} with the Canadian National Eating Disorder Awareness Week, earned mixed reviews. Laura Betker of the Winnipeg Sun said [...] "Thankfully, the show moves far away from the health-class ideal that anorexia and bulimia simply stem from self-conscious teens. Rather, it displays it as the ugly disease that it truly is... All aspects of the story were done well. The plot was realistic. The display of the disease was truthful and progressive, while the acting was at an all time high... Miriam McDonald's performance was phenomenal. [...] performs with strength and credibility." [...] Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun criticized the episodes' [...] "ham-fisted handling of anorexia" [...] and wrote: [...] "It’s just that, well, the Degrassi foray, while well-intentioned, leaves you hungry for a fresh insight, some relevant information, a compelling storyline, good writing, believable dialogue, anything." [...] Harris even went as far as saying, [...] "That Degrassi episode was so bad it made me <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> up." ...|$|E

The parole officer eventually called the Concord police. Upon the arrival of a police sergeant, Garrido admitted he had kidnapped and raped her. Only after this did Dugard identify herself as Jaycee Dugard. It was later suggested that Dugard was beginning to show signs of Stockholm syndrome. In a 2016 interview with Diane Sawyer of ABC News, Dugard stated that her compassion and willingness to interact with her captor were only means of surviving. Dugard: [...] "The phrase [...] implies that hostages cracked by terror and abuse become affectionate towards their captors." [...] "Well it's, really, it's degrading, you know, having my family believe that I was in love with this captor and wanted to stay with him. I mean, that is so far from the truth that it makes me <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> up. ...I adapted to survive my circumstance." [...] said Dugard. Repeatedly during this segment of the interview she states that, as a way to survive, and hoping to end abuse, many victims are forced to sympathize with their captors.|$|E
500|$|Critics praised Super Meat Boys {{platforming}} elements, {{and often}} {{commented on the}} game's difficulty. X-Play reviewer Alexandra Hall said the game had [...] "riveting platforming action", and added that [...] "Super Meat Boys designers are masters of their craft." [...] Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar felt the platforming was [...] "perfect". He wrote that [...] "while it's always tough and demanding, it never feels cheap, or like the game is cheating you." [...] A reviewer from GameTrailers stated that [...] "the difficulty rides the perfect line between driving you utterly bonkers when you fail and making {{you feel like a}} platform pro when you succeed". Joystiq's Richard Mitchell echoed other reviewers' comments: [...] "Super Meat Boy is tough, as tough as the toughest nails in the toughest universe." [...] Gilbert cited the level of difficulty, which he believed made the game inaccessible to some players, as his reason for not awarding the game a perfect score. Tom McShea of GameSpot praised the game's [...] "precise control", [...] "excellent level design", and [...] "smooth difficulty curve". Reviewer Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer warned that Super Meat Boy is [...] "a hard game. It should make you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> the pad across the room".|$|E

500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} enthusiastic. The Daily Telegraphs Catherine Taylor found the protagonist [...] "a little too credulous." [...] She also found McEwan's [...] "wilful {{narrative}} sadism" [...] sadly {{missing from the}} work. The review in The Economist was even more scathing: referring to Sweet Tooth as [...] "not Mr McEwan's finest book", the reviewer concluded that by the end, [...] "it is hard to feel much of anything for these heroes, who are all notions and no depth." [...] James Lasdun of The Guardian {{found that there were}} [...] "momentous political questions" [...] raised in the earlier parts of the novel, which were not fully addressed by the end. Stylistically, Serena found herself caught in exactly the kind of narrative she disliked, but, asked Lasdun, [...] "to what end?" [...] Particularly the ending of the book was polarising. Kellaway saw it as [...] "a good excuse {{to go back to the}} beginning and read this rich and enjoyable novel all over again", while another reviewer confessed that, though the ending [...] "might be enough to send McEwan acolytes scurrying back through the novel to see how he did it... it made me <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> the book out the window." ...|$|E
500|$|A few modern video gaming {{websites}} reviewed Ninja GaidenIII {{upon its}} release to the Virtual Console in 2008. Nintendo Life's Damien McFerran gave lackluster ratings, {{saying that the}} game [...] "passed under the radar of many a videogame enthusiast". He added that while the presentation was great, he pointed out flaws in the [...] "silly" [...] plot, the inconsistently laid-out level designs, and frustrating difficulty {{in addition to the}} five-continue limit. He said that many gamers would prefer the previous two Ninja Gaiden titles over this one. IGN's Lucas Thomas appreciated the improvement in Ryu's ability to scale and climb on top of walls, his ability to hang overhead, good storyline, and the new items such as the Dragon Sword power-up and the Vacuum Wave. His chief criticism was the game's difficulty, saying that it's not the [...] "rewarding kind of difficult" [...] but instead [...] "the cheap, annoying kind of difficult that makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> your controller at the TV screen and just go read a book". As with the Nintendo Life review, Thomas similarly criticized the inconsistent level design as well as a storyline which becomes progressively more bizarre, including [...] "weird science-fiction themes about bionics and clones".|$|E
500|$|Over 13 {{seasons with}} the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the {{pitching}} staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago's Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, {{as well as a}} changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his back shoulder in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce's early style: [...] "He had a tendency to windmill in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes the life out of it. He flashed his curve-the Yankees always knew when he was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> anything but fast balls in the old days. He laughed at the change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle." [...] After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, [...] "Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days." [...] Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce's ability, reportedly remarking, [...] "That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! He got me out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I'd have needed a telescope to see." [...] Richards became Chicago's manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, [...] "I learned to control my fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because it gave me a third out pitch. I threw it almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, and it took me about two years before it was consistent." [...] After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952 he broke Doc White's 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.|$|E

2500|$|Tia Ra'shone Brooks {{was born}} August 2, 1990 in Saginaw, Michigan to parents Cyd D. Neal and David Brooks. At East Kentwood High School, she {{primarily}} ran sprint events before her coach, John Makinen convinced {{her that she}} was better suited for throwing events. Initially, she fought the change and threatened to quit track and field. [...] "I didn't really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> the shot put," [...] she explained. [...] "I didn't want to be the stereotypical thrower... the big girl who didn't run and wasn't athletic." [...] After a heart-to-heart talk with her mother, Brooks relinquished. During high school, she was a four-time all-state honoree and a two-time regional champion. In her final year, she won the 2008 state title with a 14.65m (48' 0½"). She finished second in both the discus and shot put at the Midwest Meet of Champions.|$|E
2500|$|Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, was September 21, and Marquis {{was glad}} to be slated to pitch the day prior in a day game, as he {{expected}} to be done before sundown.

2500|$|Rothenberg {{said he had}} {{not always}} planned on killing Lexa, but the fact that Debnam-Carey was {{simultaneously}} on another show (Fear the Walking Dead), and was therefore unlikely to ever become a series regular on The 100, he felt use of the character would be limited or absent in the future. This is when the writers decided to craft a death scene for her to propel the story forward. [...] "I remember as we were breaking the season, we talked about reincarnation in the Grounder world and how that was how commanders were selected. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> that out as nonsense, which is how Clarke had received it, but I also didn't want {{to say that it was}} real reincarnation," [...] he said, adding he had been reading The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil at the time, which [...] "talks quite a bit about a future where we'll be able to upload our minds—literally upload our consciousness—into a computer and live forever." [...] This gave Rothenberg the idea for incorporating a [...] "technological reincarnation" [...] storyline. [...] "The commander A.I. would need to be able to pass itself from person to person over time and [...] Lexa was just the most recent recipient of this artificial intelligence augmentation of her consciousness. So once we came up with that idea, that was the point at which everything jelled and sort of came together storytelling-wise," [...] he stated. [...] "And of course, if you're dealing with a story about reincarnation, you've got to die before you can be reincarnated. So Lexa dying became a very tragic necessity." [...] Rothenberg said Clarke was in love with Lexa, that they were soulmates, and Lexa's death will haunt Clarke. [...] " [...] is going to have to figure out how to compartmentalize, the way that all of us have to do in the real world when people are suddenly and tragically taken away from us," [...] he added. [...] "That's kind of the point of The 100 in many ways. These horrible things happen and yet we still have to figure out a way to move on and be the heroes of our own stories." ...|$|E
