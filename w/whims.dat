5|$|Warwick's {{historical}} legacy {{has been a}} matter of much dispute. Historical opinion has alternated between seeing him as self-centred and rash, and regarding him as a victim of the <b>whims</b> of an ungrateful king. It is generally agreed, however, that in his own time he enjoyed great popularity in all layers of society, and that he was skilled at appealing to popular sentiments for political support.|$|E
5|$|Andjar {{was one of}} {{the first}} native Indonesian film directors, with Bachtiar Effendi, Soeska, and Inoe Perbatasari. Said writes that Andjar was forced to follow the <b>whims</b> of the ethnic Chinese film moguls, which {{resulted}} in the films' shift toward commercial orientation, rather than the prioritisation of artistic merit. The film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that Andjar and his fellow journalists, upon joining JIF, brought with them new ideas that helped the company flourish until it closed after the arrival of the Japanese; the company and its subsidiaries released fifteen films in two years.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence. Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head. Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different <b>whims</b> or needs.|$|E

5|$|The rush of {{technology}} and the commercialisation of agriculture {{in the second half}} of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks—many small farmers became dependent on the <b>whims</b> of far-away markets. There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines, and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians. There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption. The railway network provided critical famine relief, notably reduced the cost of moving goods, and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.|$|E

The book's preface claims that it was written in Deià, Mallorca in 2326. According to the book, an entire industry has grown up publishing books about a Montauk named <b>Whim.</b> In reality, <b>Whim</b> was first published as Adventures of <b>Whim</b> in 1986; as <b>Whim</b> in 2002 and a third iteration in 2015 by Permuted Press.|$|R
5|$|After his {{two and a}} {{half years}} of training, Naruto returns to Konoha and begins to deal more {{actively}} with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi to infuse the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, creating the Rasen-Shuriken attack that proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member Kakuzu. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven <b>whims.</b> Over time, though resisting the urge to use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands to the point where he begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything in his path.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{challenges}} to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued {{that to be}} commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the <b>whims</b> of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new method to approach the missing baryons problem. We assume that the missing baryons reside in a form of Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium, i. e. the <b>WHIM.</b> Our method consists of (a) detecting the coherent large scale structure in the spatial distribution of galaxies that traces the Cosmic Web and that in hydrodynamical simulations is associated to the <b>WHIM,</b> (b) map its luminosity into a galaxy luminosity density field, (c) use numerical simulations to relate the luminosity density to {{the density of the}} <b>WHIM,</b> (d) apply this relation to real data to trace the <b>WHIM</b> using the observed galaxy luminosities in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2 dF redshift surveys. In our application we find evidence for the <b>WHIM</b> along the line of sight to the Sculptor Wall, at redshifts consistent with the recently reported X-ray absorption line detections. Our indirect <b>WHIM</b> detection technique complements the standard method based on the detection of characteristic X-ray absorption lines, showing that the galaxy luminosity density is a reliable signpost for the <b>WHIM.</b> For this reason, our method could be applied to current galaxy surveys to optimise the observational strategies for detecting and studying the <b>WHIM</b> and its properties. Our estimates of the <b>WHIM</b> hydrogen column density in Sculptor agree with those obtained via the X-ray analysis. Due to the additional column density estimate, our method has potential for improving the constrains of the physical parameters of the <b>WHIM</b> as derived with X-ray absorption, and thus for improving the understanding of the missing baryons problem.

40|$|Hydrodynamical {{simulations}} {{indicate that}} substantial fraction of baryons in the Universe {{remains in a}} diffuse component - Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (<b>WHIM).</b> To determine physical properties (spatial distribution, temperature and density) of the <b>WHIM,</b> spatial structure of the soft extended X-ray emission surrounding field galaxies is carefully investigated using the XMM-Newton EPIC/MOS observations. Angular correlations between the galaxy distribution and the soft X-ray background extending over several arcmin are determined. The correlations at large scales result from the clustering of galaxies. At small scales (below ~ 2 arcmin) the excess of the soft flux is interpreted as the genuine emission from halos of the <b>WHIM</b> surrounding individual galaxies. Bulk parameters of the average <b>WHIM</b> halos associated with galaxies in the sample are estimated. Typical halo has a characteristic radius of ~ 0. 3 Mpc and a mass of 4 - 7 x 10 ^ 11 M_sun. The average density of the <b>WHIM</b> in the local universe amounts to 7 - 11 x 10 ^{- 32 } g cm^{- 3 } (Omega_WHIM = 0. 7 - 1. 2 %). Observations of the X-ray <b>WHIM</b> emission are in good agreement with the numerical simulations, but accuracy of the observational material is insufficient to constrain the theory of <b>WHIM.</b> A series of deep observations of a moderately numerous sample of low redshift galaxies with high resolution instruments of Chandra would significantly improve our estimates of the <b>WHIM</b> parameters.

40|$|The Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, Myelokathexis (<b>WHIM)</b> {{syndrome}} is an immunodeficiency caused by mutations in chemokine receptor CXCR 4. <b>WHIM</b> patient adaptive immunity defects remain largely unexplained.
