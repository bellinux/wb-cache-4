5|$|Accounts of {{the final}} {{termination}} of the coup attempt vary between historians. Gleijeses stated that while the freighter <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> way to Nicaragua, a CIA employee went to Miller, {{and asked him to}} sign a document on behalf of the munitions department. Miller refused, and instead showed the document to his superiors, who in turn informed Dean Acheson. Gleijeses writes that Acheson immediately spoke to Truman {{as a result of this}} document, and the operation was cut short. Nick Cullather writes that due to Somoza spreading the word about the coup, the State Department decided that the cover of the operation had been lost. Other diplomats began to learn of the operation, and on 8 October Dean Acheson summoned Smith and called off the operation.|$|E
5|$|After Aubers Ridge, {{the corps}} was then rested {{in a quiet}} sector until September, when it {{deployed}} for the Battle of Loos. The initial attack was {{to be made by}} three divisions, with the Meerut Division leading the attack on the Indian front; Blackader's brigade, with two Gurkha battalions and the 2nd Leicesters, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> right flank. Whilst the attack successfully crossed no-man's land under cover of the barrage, the right flank of the brigade was caught up in defensive wire, and only one battalion successfully made their way into the German trenches; the brigade lost momentum and dug in.|$|E
5|$|Although the Whig Party <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> final decline nationally, it {{remained}} strong in Tennessee, and {{the outlook for}} Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary {{to give him a}} chance at the higher offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run. Meredith P. Gentry received the Whig nomination. A series {{of more than a dozen}} vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the nativist positions of the Know Nothing Party. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society. Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.|$|E

5|$|Around 03:00, Hatanaka was {{informed}} by Lieutenant Colonel Masataka Ida that the Eastern District Army <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> {{way to the}} palace to stop him, {{and that he should}} give up. Finally, seeing his plan collapsing around him, Hatanaka pleaded with Tatsuhiko Takashima, Chief of Staff of the Eastern District Army, to be given at least ten minutes on the air on NHK radio, to explain to the people of Japan {{what he was trying to}} accomplish and why. He was refused. Colonel Haga, commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, discovered that the Army did not support this rebellion, and he ordered Hatanaka to leave the palace grounds.|$|E
5|$|At Sandia Base, three Army officers, Captains Albert Bethel, Richard Meyer, and Bobbie Griffin {{attempted}} {{to re-create the}} Little Boy. They were supervised by Harlow W. Russ, an expert on Little Boy who served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was now leader of the Z-11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory's Z Division at Sandia. Gradually, they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts, and figured out how they went together. Eventually, they built six Little Boy assemblies. Although the casings, barrels, and components were tested, no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs. By early 1947, the problem caused by the Wigner effect <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> way to solution, and the three officers were reassigned.|$|E

ERA allows users to manage logistics for sales, finance, service and parts across departments. That same year Reynolds developed a digital, graphical parts catalog program for selecting and ordering automotive parts. This {{was followed by the}} Vehicle Locators and Marketing Network sales toolsets.|$|E

5|$|By July 1943, the 7th Division <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> {{way back}} to Port Moresby. Vasey flew up to work out {{arrangements}} with Herring and the air commander in New Guinea, Major General Ennis Whitehead of the US Fifth Air Force. Probably inspired by his experience on Crete, Vasey proposed using paratroops, and pressed his superiors for an entire regiment instead of the battalion he was originally allotted. The new campaign opened in spectacular fashion on 5 September 1943 with a parachute drop of the US 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment in broad daylight to seize the airstrip at Nadzab in the Markham Valley. They were soon reinforced by Australian and Papuan troops that had advanced overland from Wau, {{and then by the}} 7th Division's 25th Infantry Brigade, which flew in by air.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} days of November, the Yugoslav Navy stopped the Libertas convoy twice for {{inspection}} between the islands of Brač and Korčula as it enforced the blockade.

As Cornwallis had, Washington also called for a council of war. Using the road leading to Princeton, and his council of war agreed to make an attempt against the British garrison there. By 2am on January 3, the army <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> way to Princeton. Washington left behind 500 men and two cannons to keep the fires burning and to make noise with picks and shovels to make the British think they were digging in. By morning, these men too had evacuated, and when the British came to attack, all of the American troops were gone.|$|E
5|$|In July 1915, the Truxtun <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> way to Alaska when {{it broke}} down {{and was unable to}} {{continue}} its mission. Initially, the blame fell on Callaghan, who had apparently ordered incorrect parts for the condenser. He was suspended from duty and ordered to appear before a court-martial. Subsequent investigation, however, found that another man was responsible for the error and Callaghan received a full acquittal and was reinstated. A few months later, he was appointed as commanding officer of the Truxtun, but the stress of his trial appeared to have left its mark—at the age of 25 years, his hair had already turned gray.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, the {{remaining}} Vertigo Tour concerts were postponed when {{the daughter of}} guitarist The Edge fell ill. During the interim, footage from the seven filmed shows was edited together, prompting the crew to request additional wide shots {{from the back of}} the stadium and close-ups of the band members. When the tour <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> fifth leg in November 2006, an additional two shows were filmed in Melbourne to capture the extra footage. At the time, the songs appearing in the final cut of the film had already been selected and therefore only specific songs from the concerts were filmed.|$|E

With Marshall's concurrence, Devers appointed Patch to replace Patton as commander of the Seventh Army and Force 163 on 2 March. While Patch and his staff planned the operation, Devers ensured that the supplies accumulated for it were not dissipated.|$|E

5|$|On {{the left}} side, the first chapel was {{dedicated}} to the Nativity of Mary.

A Ricci painting {{of the birth of}} Mary <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> altar; on its vault were the Four Evangelists, and its walls were decorated with frescoes. The second chapel, dedicated to San Giacomo, had a statue (later replaced by a painting) of the saint above the altar and was the burial place for members of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament. The third chapel, dedicated to the Crucifixion, contained a large sculpture of Christ on the cross.|$|E

5|$|The 17th Brigade's advance {{continued}} {{for the next}} two days until, when the brigade had reached the final ridge before Salamaua, the 29th Brigade arrived to take over. The 2/7th Infantry Battalion, however, still detached to the 15th Brigade, continued on with them and as a result remained in the thick of it until the end when Salamaua fell on 20 September. Meanwhile, the rest of the 17th Brigade <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> way back to Australia and by mid-September, it arrived on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland where it was once again was placed under the 6th Division's command.

5|$|The midterm congressional {{elections}} of 1854 and 1855 were devastating to the Democrats (as {{well as to}} the Whig Party, which <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> last legs). The Democrats lost almost every state outside the South. The administration's opponents in the North worked together to return opposition members to Congress, though only a few northern Whigs gained election. In Pierce's New Hampshire, hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party, the Know-Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated the legislature, and returned John P. Hale to the Senate. Anti-immigrant fervor brought the Know-Nothings their highest numbers to that point, and some northerners were elected {{under the auspices of the}} new Republican Party.|$|E
