5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} {{of two or more}} gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar associations <b>with</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E
5|$|After the Americans {{attacked}} the Philippines, Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands beginning on 10 October, the Japanese implemented their {{plan for the}} defense of these areas that required the transfer of most of Air Group 652 to Formosa and Luzon to attack the American forces, <b>with</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> aircraft retained for carrier operations. Most of these aircraft were lost for little gain as the Americans suppressed Japanese defenses in the Philippines, preparatory to the actual invasion.|$|E

The three get progressively more paranoid and Bart becomes convinced that the other two are conspiring against him.|$|E

The DragonFly developers use the Git version control system to manage changes to the DragonFly source code. Unlike its parent FreeBSD, DragonFly has both stable and unstable releases in a single source tree, due to a smaller developer base.|$|E
5|$|Early {{forecasts}} {{underestimated the}} peak intensity of Pauline by 65mph (105km/h). On October 7, about 41hours before landfall, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a hurricane warning from Tapachula in Chiapas to Punta Maldonado in Guerrero. Shortly after Pauline made landfall, the warning was extended northwestward to Manzanillo, Colima, and later to Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. Pauline's turn to the west-northwest near landfall was unexpected, resulting in hurricane conditions <b>with</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours notice in some areas.|$|E

Most of the dromedaries occur in Western Australia, with smaller populations in the Northern Territory, Western Queensland and northern South Australia.|$|E

5|$|Isabel {{produced}} {{strong winds}} throughout inland areas of eastern North Carolina. Plymouth, located 75miles (120km) {{from where the}} hurricane made landfall, reported gusts to 95mph (155km/h). Sustained winds were lighter, <b>with</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> locations receiving tropical storm strength winds. The passage of the hurricane resulted in moderate rainfall of up to 6.02inches (153mm) in Havelock. Upon making landfall, Isabel produced moderate to severe storm surges along the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers, with a location in Craven County reporting a storm tide of 10.5feet (3.2m) above normal.|$|E

That unit was later awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. A few served as late as 1945 in southern France. It was finally declared obsolete in July 1945. That month, the contractor Brown & McLaughlin converted 90 T19s into M3A1 Half-tracks.|$|E
5|$|Janus and Epimetheus {{are called}} co-orbital moons. They are of roughly equal size, with Janus being {{slightly}} larger than Epimetheus. Janus and Epimetheus have orbits <b>with</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> kilometers difference in semi-major axis, close enough that they would collide if they attempted to pass each other. Instead of colliding, however, their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years.|$|E

Loaded continued to tour and released a live album, , independently, which was recorded and mixed by Nick Raskulinecz. They re-recorded half of Beautiful Disease and received offers from four labels.

5|$|Newly issued Irish {{postage stamps}} are {{available}} from the Philatelic Bureau of An Post in the Dublin, General Post Office. Commemorative and special issue stamps are usually available for one year from the date of issue.

During the 1970s and beyond, the quantity produced rose considerably.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whale pods off {{southern}} California {{have been}} observed in three different groups: traveling/hunting groups, feeding groups and loafing groups. In traveling/hunting groups, individuals position themselves in chorus lines stretching two miles long, <b>with</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> whales underneath. Sexual and age-class segregation apparently occurs in these groups. In feeding groups, individuals are very loosely associated, but may move in the same direction. In loafing groups, whales number between 12 and 30 individuals resting. Mating and other behaviors may take place.|$|E
