Engelbart was awarded The Franklin Institute's Certificate of Merit in 1996 and the Benjamin Franklin Medal in 1999 in Computer and Cognitive Science. In early 2000 Engelbart produced, with volunteers and sponsors, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>The</b> Unfinished Revolution– II, {{also known as}} the Engelbart Colloquium at Stanford University, to document and publicize his work and ideas to a larger audience (live, and online).|$|E
5|$|Eunuchs gained {{unprecedented}} {{power over}} state affairs during the Ming dynasty. One {{of the most}} effective means of control was the secret service stationed in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Depot {{at the beginning of the}} dynasty, later the Western Depot. This secret service was overseen by the Directorate of Ceremonial, hence this state organ's often totalitarian affiliation. Eunuchs had ranks that were equivalent to civil service ranks, only theirs had four grades instead of nine.|$|E
5|$|Bergen, {{a city of}} 212,944 {{people in}} 1990, had {{overtaken}} Tromsø's position as the most vital scene for underground electronic music in Norway, and Röyksopp worked with other Norwegian musicians like Frost, Those Norwegians, Drum Island, and Kings of Convenience's guitarist and singer Erlend Øye in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Bergen Wave. During this time, the duo befriended Geir Jenssen. Under the tutelage of Jenssen, the duo started a band called Aedena Cycle with Gaute Barlindhaug and Kolbjørn Lyslo. In 1994 Aedena Cycle recorded a vinyl EP called Traveler's Dreams. The EP was released under the R Records sublabel Apollo. Following {{the release of the}} EP, Jenssen almost convinced the band to sign a full record deal with Apollo Records.|$|E

5|$|In March 1779 the {{regiment}} was reassigned to the Northern Department, and marched to Springfield, Massachusetts. From Springfield they marched to Charlestown, New Hampshire {{and picked up}} clothing and supplies. They arrived in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Coös Country of northern New Hampshire in May, and were tasked to build a road {{now known as the}} Bayley-Hazen Military Road from the Connecticut River to St. Jean, Quebec. Hazen had been secretly ordered to the area by Washington in April. Along with a large portion of Colonel Timothy Bedel's Regiment and Major Benjamin Whitcomb's New Hampshire rangers, they began to extend the road, a portion of which had been constructed in 1776 under the direction of Colonel Jacob Bayley.|$|E
5|$|Covenant {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are {{described in terms of}} two covenants: the covenant of works and covenant of grace. The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works (sometimes called the covenant of life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> covenant of grace. This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.|$|E
5|$|The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers most {{land in the}} Trout Creek Mountains, {{but there}} are also some private lands and some roads in the area. The private lands are mainly used for {{ranching}} along mountain streams, while the BLM lands include large grazing allotments for local ranchers' cattle. At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892, some of which were staked for gold exploration. Commercial mining has occurred in some areas, mostly near the McDermitt Caldera, where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted. Mines in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Opalite Mining District produced 270,000 flasks of mercury—"the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere"—from cinnabar extracted from the caldera in the 20thcentury. The two leading mercury-producing mines in North America were the Cordero and McDermitt mines {{on the edge of the}} caldera in Nevada. Together, they operated from 1933 to 1989. The McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed three years later, in 1992. However, mineral exploration has continued at the Cordero Mine in the 21stcentury, and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of McDermitt as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup project.|$|E
