25|$|A <b>workplace</b> <b>bully</b> or abuser {{will often}} have issues with social functioning. These {{types of people}} often have psychopathic traits that are {{difficult}} to identify in the hiring and promotion process.

Consequently, when confronted with the accusation of abuse, the abuser is not aware that any harm was done.|$|R

25|$|According to Pamela Lutgin-Sandvik, {{the lack}} of unifying {{language}} to name the phenomenon of <b>workplace</b> <b>bullying</b> is a problem because without a unifying term or phrase, individuals have difficulty naming their experiences of abuse, and therefore have trouble pursuing justice against the bully. Unlike sexual harassment, which named a specific problem and is now recognized in law of many countries (including U.S.), <b>workplace</b> <b>bullying</b> is still being established as a relevant social problem and {{is in need of}} a specific vernacular.|$|E

25|$|<b>Workplace</b> <b>bullying,</b> like {{childhood}} bullying, is {{the tendency}} of individuals or groups to use persistent aggressive or unreasonable behaviour against a co-worker. <b>Workplace</b> <b>bullying</b> can include such tactics as verbal, nonverbal, psychological, physical abuse and humiliation. This type of aggression is particularly difficult because unlike the typical forms of school bullying, workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organisation and their society. Bullying in the workplace is {{in the majority of}} cases reported as having been perpetrated by a manager and takes a wide variety of forms.|$|E
40|$|<b>Workplaces</b> <b>bullying</b> {{has become}} a {{significant}} topic of management research in recent years. This paper follows a study of bullying in the public sector, examining the multiple perspectives of victim, alleged bully, bystander and HR or other senior managers, in which {{the notion of a}} bully as an antisocial perpetrator abusing power over an innocent, less powerful victim appeared simplistic in many ways. To investigate the processes by which people come to be identified as bully or victim, this paper uses Attribution Theory. Propositions concerning the processes by which such attributions are formed are presented as preliminaries to future research. We conclude that identifying individuals as bully or victim is a complicated process, and that greater appreciation of the logic of interpersonal relations would assist both researchers and managers interested in reducing bullying, and discuss the organisational implications...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{highlight}} how <b>workplace</b> <b>bullies</b> manipulate services by presenting themselves as victims. In {{the absence of}} robust screening and assessment tools to distinguish between bully and victim, personnel staff {{are at risk of}} being coerced into perpetuating the abuse of victims. The paper also aims to argue for an in-depth investigation of the psychological motivations of perpetrators to inform the development of a specialised assessment tool. Design/methodology/approach – The paper contains two short case studies drawn from staff attending a workshop on responding to domestic violence in the workplace. Similarities between the coercive behaviour patterns of the domestic violence perpetrator and the <b>workplace</b> <b>bully</b> were striking. The approach taken to discussing the case studies closely follows the approach used in the assessment of domestic violence perpetrators where controlling behaviours and coercive control are captured. Findings – The case studies used in the paper illustrate the dangers of taking a neutral stance in situations where bullying is ongoing. A lack of clarity about who is doing what to whom allows the bully to use any intervention to further abuse. The important issues of victim safety and abuser accountability are absent from the processes employed by personnel staff in the management of these two cases. Research limitations/implications – There are limitations in the process and the scale of the project, but the case studies are indicative of wider issues, and point towards the central dilemma faced by personnel departments generally. Practical implications – The domestic violence field offers many insights into the motivations for abusiveness. This paper draws on those insights and shows how they can be used to think more systematically about accusations of <b>bullying</b> in the <b>workplace.</b> The paper argues for increased caution around accepting the self-reports of bullies who may be presenting as victims. Originality/value – This paper focuses attention on the ways in which bullying individuals attempt to coerce services into perpetuating their abusiveness...|$|R

The research had {{a high level of}} industry engagement, with involvement from Stakeholder Groups for three industry sectors represented in the research: health, education and hospitality. A fourth sector, travel, also participated in the research, but with a limited level of engagement due to the late addition of this sector into the study. The study was conducted in three distinct stages: Exploratory (Stage 1), Methodology design (Stage 2), and Prevalence study (Stage 3).
