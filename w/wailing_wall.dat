5|$|To give {{recognition}} to the immemorial claim that the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> is a Holy Place for the Jews, {{not only for the}} Jews in Palestine, but also for the Jews of the whole world.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the British mandate period that politicisation of the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> occurred. The {{disturbances}} at the <b>Wailing</b> <b>wall</b> in 1928 were repeated in 1929, however {{the violence in the}} riots that followed, that left 116 Palestinian Arabs, 133 Jews dead and 339 wounded, were surprising in their intensity and was the first instance that indigenous Sephardi and Mizrahi had been killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{long series}} of {{incidents}} connected with the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall...</b> These must {{be regarded as a}} whole, but the incident among them which in our view contributed most to the outbreak was the Jewish demonstration at the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> on the 15th of August, 1929. Next in importance we put the activities of the Society for the Protection of the Moslem Holy Places and, in a lesser degree, of the Pro-Wailing Wall Committee.|$|E

Grylls style {{was influenced by}} several Victorian panoramic photographers and by early 1970s work by Jan Dibbets. Grylls has said that his overtly political art tried, {{in the case of}} The <b>Wailing</b> (Western) <b>Wall,</b> Jerusalem, to [...] "examine a cultural and religious icon that has had a far-reaching influence on political events today." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “The Cranes {{have been}} tagged {{with more than}} their share of {{inaccurate}} labels over the years, such as [...] "Gothic", [...] "Ethereal" [...] and even [...] "Industrial", but just as often, they are more accurately described as a band with a furiously creative drive which allows even their simplest songs to sound beautifully honest and original. But as simple as their music seems, the Cranes have always kept things interesting by giving their music an element of edginess and unpredictability. Some of their songs make their point {{with no more than}} three notes played repeatedly on a piano, while others rely on screeching, <b>wailing</b> <b>walls</b> of sound provided by guitarists Matt Cope and Mark Francombe, while still others rely on a clever, sometimes surprising combination of the two. All of these elements are complemented perfectly by Shaw's unmistakable vocal style and her brother Jim Shaw's precise and powerful percussion.”- Andy Dolan, The Michigan Daily, 1995 ...|$|R
60|$|I {{felt the}} fullest {{pressure}} of the problem when I first walked round {{the whole of the}} Haram enclosure, the courts of the old Temple, where the high muezzin towers now stand at every corner, and heard the clear voices of the call to prayer. The sky was laden with a storm that became the snowstorm; and it was the time at which the old Jews beat their hands and mourn over what are believed to be the last stones of the Temple. There was a movement in my own mind that was attuned to these things, and impressed by the strait limits and steep sides of that platform of the mountains; for the sense of crisis is not only in the intensity of the ideals, but in the very conditions of the reality, the reality with which this chapter began. And the burden of it is the burden of Palestine; the narrowness of the boundaries and the stratification of the rock. A voice not of my reason but rather sounding heavily in my heart, seemed to be repeating sentences like pessimistic proverbs. There is no place for the Temple of Solomon but on the ruins of the Mosque of Omar. There is no place for the nation of the Jews but in the country of the Arabs. And these whispers came to me first not as intellectual conclusions upon the conditions of the case, of which I should have much more to say and to hope; but rather as hints of something immediate and menacing and yet mysterious. I felt almost a momentary impulse to flee from the place, like one who has received an omen. For two voices had met in my ears; and within the same narrow space and in the same dark hour, electric and yet eclipsed with cloud, I had heard Islam crying from the turret and Israel <b>wailing</b> at the <b>wall.</b>|$|R
25|$|In one of {{his poems}} he asks himself whether his visits to the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> were {{motivated}} by a desire for God or for the Arab boys there.|$|E
25|$|The Mufti {{believed}} that Jews were seeking {{to rebuild the}} Temple in Jerusalem {{on the site of}} the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque. This led to a long confrontation over the use of the Kotel, also known as the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall,</b> which was owned by the Moslem authorities but was sacred to Jews.|$|E
25|$|As a painter, {{his works}} have been {{presented}} at several collective exhibitions in France, Germany and Lebanon. In 1995, he presented The <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall,</b> a 10x2 meters piece of art, at {{a special edition of}} the Salon des Artistes Décorateurs {{that took place in the}} Beirut Central District (instead of its customary location at Paris’ Grand Palais). This showing produced such controversy that it required special protection.|$|E
25|$|Rav Kook wrote rulings {{presenting}} {{his strong}} opposition to people ascending the Temple Mount, {{due to the}} Jewish Laws of impurity. He felt that Jews should wait until {{the coming of the}} Messiah, when it will be encouraged to enter the Temple Mount. However, he was very careful to express the fact that the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> and the Temple Mount were holy sites which belong to the Jews. Rav Kook also opposed the secular spirit of the Hatikvah anthem, and penned another anthem with a more religious theme entitled haEmunah.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, 16 August {{after an}} {{inflammatory}} sermon, a demonstration {{organized by the}} Supreme Muslim Council marched to the Wall. The Acting High Commissioner summoned Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini and informed {{him that he had}} never heard of such a demonstration being held at the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall,</b> {{and that it would be}} a terrible shock to the Jews who regarded the Wall as a place of special sanctity to them. At the Wall, the crowd burnt prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication left in the Wall's cracks, and the beadle was injured. The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Sharon {{left the}} site, angry demonstrations by Palestinian Jerusalemites outside erupted into rioting. The {{person in charge}} of the waqf at the time, Abu Qteish, was later indicted by Israel for using a loud-speaker to call on Palestinians to defend Al-Aqsa at the time, which action Israeli {{authorities}} claimed was responsible for the subsequent stone-throwing {{in the direction of the}} <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall.</b> Israeli police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, while protesters hurled stones and other projectiles, injuring 25 policemen, of whom one was seriously injured and had to be taken to hospital. At least three Palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets.|$|E
25|$|The Western Wall {{is one of}} the holiest of Jewish sites, sacred {{because it}} is a remnant of the ancient wall that once {{enclosed}} the Jewish Second Temple. The Jews, through the practice of centuries, had established a right of access to the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> for the purposes of their devotions. As part of the Temple Mount the Western Wall was {{under the control of the}} Muslim religious trust, the Waqf. Muslims consider the wall to be part of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, and according to Islamic tradition the place where Muhammad tied his horse, Buraq, before his night journey to heaven. There had been a few serious incidents resulting from these differences.|$|E
25|$|In his {{capacity}} as editor and man of ideas, Mencken became close {{friends with the}} leading literary figures of his time, including Theodore Dreiser, F.Scott Fitzgerald, Joseph Hergesheimer, Anita Loos, Ben Hecht, Sinclair Lewis, James Branch Cabell, and Alfred Knopf, {{as well as a}} mentor to several young reporters, including Alistair Cooke. He also championed artists whose works he considered worthy. For example, he asserted that books such as Caught Short! A Saga of <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> Street (1929), by Eddie Cantor (ghost-written by David Freedman) did more to pull America out of the Great Depression than all government measures combined. He also mentored John Fante. Thomas Hart Benton illustrated an edition of Mencken's book Europe After 8:15.|$|E
25|$|Arlosoroff's {{hope for}} {{peaceful}} cooperation and compromise with Arabs would be severely tested. In 1929, the consciously aggressive Betar Youth Movement, organized under Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Union of Revisionist Zionists, {{took part in}} a coalition to assertively enforce and enlarge a Jewish presence in the proximity of the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall.</b> The activities of Betar and their associates inflamed an explosive reaction from the Arab community, as it was perceived Muslim mosques on the adjacent Temple Mount had been dishonored. The violent Western Wall Uprisings of 1929 ensued, which resulted in the loss of many lives, including civilians. Instead of inciting further Arab tensions, Arlosoroff strongly criticized the Revisionists for insensitively provoking the animosity.|$|E
25|$|With Chancellor abroad, and the Zionist Commission itself, {{with its}} leader Colonel Frederick Kisch, in Zurich for the 16th Zionist Congress (attended also by Ze'ev Jabotinsky), the SMC resumed works, confidentially authorised, on the Haram {{only to be}} met with outcries from the Jewish press. The {{administration}} rapidly published the new rules on 22 July, with a serious error in translation that fueled Zionist reports of a plot against Jewish rights. A protest in London led to a public declaration {{by a member of}} the Zionist Commission that Jewish rights were bigger than the status quo, a statement which encouraged in turn Arab suspicions that local agreements were again being overthrown by Jewish intrigues abroad. News that the Zurich Congress, in creating the Jewish Agency on 11 August., had brought unity among Zionists and the world Jewish community, a measure that would greatly increase Jewish investment in British Palestine, set off alarm bells. On 15 August, Tisha B'Av, a day memorializing the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem, the revisionist Betar movement, despite Pinhas Rutenberg's plea on 8 August to the acting High Commissioner Harry Luke to stop such groups from participating, rallied members from Tel Aviv to join them in the religious commemoration. Kisch, before leaving, had banned Jewish demonstrations in Jerusalem's Arab quarters. The Betar youth gave the ceremony a strong nationalist tinge by singing the Hatikvah, waving the flag of Israel, and chanting the slogan 'The Wall is Ours'. The following day coincided with mawlid (or mawsin al-nabi), the anniversary of the birth of Islam's prophet, Muhammad. Muslim worshippers, after prayers on the esplanade of the Haram, passed through the narrow lane by the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> and ripped up prayer books, and kotel notes (wall petitions), without harming however three Jews present. Contacted by Luke, al-Husseini undertook to do his best to maintain calm on the Haram, but could not stop demonstrators from gathering at the Wall.|$|E
500|$|When {{we visited}} the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> we found a toilet {{attached}} to it ... we decided to remove it and from this {{we came to the}} conclusion that we could evacuate the entire area in front of the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> ... a historical opportunity that will never return ... We knew that the following Saturday , June 14, would be the Jewish festival of Shavuot and that many will want to come to pray ... it all had to be completed by then.|$|E
500|$|During the Jordanian {{rule of the}} Old City, {{a ceramic}} street sign in Arabic and English was affixed to the stones of the ancient wall. Attached [...] up, it {{was made up of}} eight {{separate}} ceramic tiles and said Al Buraq Road in Arabic at the top with the English [...] "Al-Buraq (<b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall)</b> Rd" [...] below. When Israeli soldiers arrived at the wall in June 1967, one attempted to scrawl Hebrew lettering on it. The Jerusalem Post reported that on June 8, Ben-Gurion went to the wall and [...] "looked with distaste" [...] at the road sign; [...] "this is not right, it should come down" [...] and he proceeded to dismantle it.|$|E
500|$|The Western Wall, <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> or Kotel (Hebrew: , translit.: Ashkenazic pronunciation: HaKosel HaMa'arovi; , translit.: Ḥā'iṭ al-Burāq, translat.: the Buraq Wall, or [...] al-Mabkā: the Place of Weeping) is {{an ancient}} {{limestone}} wall in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the [...] "Western Wall". The wall was originally erected {{as part of the}} expansion of the Second Jewish Temple begun by Herod the Great, which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount, in a large rectangular structure topped by a huge flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself and its auxiliary buildings.|$|E
500|$|A British {{inquiry into}} the {{disturbances}} and investigation regarding the principal issue in the Western Wall dispute, namely {{the rights of the}} Jewish worshipers to bring appurtenances to the wall, was convened. The Supreme Muslim Council provided documents dating from the Turkish regime supporting their claims. However, repeated reminders to the Chief Rabbinate to verify which apparatus had been permitted failed to elicit any response. They refused to do so, arguing that Jews had the right to pray at the Wall without restrictions. Subsequently, in November 1928, the Government issued a White Paper entitled [...] "The Western or <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> in Jerusalem: Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies", which emphasised the maintenance of the status quo and instructed that Jews could only bring [...] "those accessories which had been permitted in Turkish times." ...|$|E
2500|$|... the Mufti was {{influenced}} by the twofold desire to confront the Jews and to mobilize Moslem opinion {{on the issue of the}} <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall.</b> He had no intention of utilizing this religious campaign as the means of inciting to disorder.|$|E
2500|$|The Shaw Commission {{stated that}} some {{sections}} of the Arabic Press had reproduced documents concerning the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> which [...] "were of a character likely to excite any susceptible readers." [...] In addition, it stated that [...] "there appeared in the Arabic Press a number of articles, which, had they been published in England or in other western countries, would unquestionably have been regarded as provocative." [...] One consequence was that Jewish worshippers frequently were subjected to beatings and stoning.|$|E
2500|$|After {{returning}} to Paris {{from one of}} his trips, Vollard commissioned Chagall to illustrate the Old Testament. Although he could have completed the project in France, he used the assignment as an excuse to travel to Israel to experience for himself the Holy Land. He arrived there in February 1931 and ended up staying for two months. Chagall felt at home in Israel where many people spoke Yiddish and Russian. According to Jacob Baal-Teshuva, [...] "he was impressed by the pioneering spirit {{of the people in the}} kibbutzim and deeply moved by the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> and the other holy places".|$|E
2500|$|In 1929 {{tensions}} grew {{over the}} Kotel (<b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall),</b> a narrow alleyway where Jews were banned from using chairs or any furniture (many of the worshipers were elderly). The Mufti {{claimed it was}} Muslim property and that the Jews were seeking control of the Temple Mount. This (and general animosity) led to the August 1929 Palestine riots. The main victims were the ancient Jewish community at Hebron, which came to an end. The riots led to right-wing Zionists establishing their own militia in 1931, the Irgun Tzvai Leumi (National Military Organization, known in Hebrew by its acronym [...] "Etzel").|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} Palestinian dignitaries came {{to protest the}} visit, as did three Arab Knesset Members. With the dignitaries {{watching}} from a safe distance, the Shabab (youth mob) threw rocks and attempted {{to get past the}} Israeli security personnel and reach Sharon and his entourage. [...] Still, Sharon's deportment was quiet and dignified. He did not pray, did not make any statement, or do anything else that might be interpreted as offensive to the sensitivities of Muslims. Even after he came back near the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall</b> under the hail of rocks, he remained calm. [...] "I came here as one who believes in coexistence between Jews and Arabs," [...] Sharon told the waiting reporters. [...] "I believe that we can build and develop together. This was a peaceful visit. Is it an instigation for Israeli Jews to come to the Jewish people's holiest site?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Jewish National Fund (JNF) {{produced}} and sold thirty million labels between 1902 and 1914 as [...] "promotional materials" [...] to [...] "help spread {{the message of}} Zionism." [...] The [...] "Zion" [...] label was its biggest seller with 20 million copies of this blue-and-white label with the Star of David and the word [...] "Zion" [...] sold. Four million copies of the [...] "Herzl" [...] label, issued between 1909 and 1914, were sold. The label depicted Theodor Herzl gazing {{at a group of}} workers in Palestine, using the famous image of him on the Rhine Bridge from the First Zionist Congress, superimposed onto a scene of a balcony overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem. Labels with pictures of Max Nordau, David Wolffsohn, the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall,</b> a map of Palestine, and historical scenes and landscape in Palestine, sold about one million copies each. A total of 266 different labels were produced by the JNF's Head Office in Jerusalem between 1902 and 1947.|$|E
2500|$|Raymond E. Brown {{notes the}} {{apparent}} disagreements between the New Testament books in reporting {{the words of}} Jesus concerning his prediction {{of the destruction of}} the Temple. In Mark 13:2 it is reported as a direct statement: [...] "And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down." [...] However, in Mark 14:57-58, the event becomes words from people who [...] "bare false witness against him"; in Mark 15:29, Jesus' words are used to blaspheme him; and in Acts 6:13-14, similar words are again said to be from those bearing false witness. Furthermore, Matthew 26:60-61 and 27:39-40 has people accusing Jesus and blaspheming him as someone who had said such words, while John 2:19-21 reports Jesus saying directly that the sanctuary would be destroyed, but actually speaking [...] "of the sanctuary of his body". Brown suggests that the various accounts show that Jesus did not have God's detailed foreknowledge of what was to happen to the Temple. In evidence for this lack of detailed prescience, he points out that there are many stones left upon other stones in the remains of Herod's temple, for instance in the <b>Wailing</b> <b>Wall.</b>|$|E
