500|$|The premiere, {{originally}} planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th {{because of the}} illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as [...] "a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes..." [...] The audience's appreciation was not reflected {{in the majority of}} the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that [...] "this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a [...] "claque" [...] of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.|$|E
60|$|We were silent, and, {{upon the}} {{reflection}} to which our silence invited us, {{we found that}} we would rather not ourselves think of the image we had invoked. <b>We</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> take up the question at another point.|$|R

60|$|At {{this point}} Bastin retired down the path, {{realising}} {{that he had}} to do with cannibals. We said that <b>we</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> look at the girls alive and would meet them again to-morrow morning, when we hoped that the house would be ready.|$|R
500|$|After {{the season}} finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that [...] "he paid a price—that was {{important}} to us. You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, {{and the fact that he}} literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".|$|E
2500|$|Since 2008, Android {{has seen}} {{numerous}} updates which have incrementally improved the operating system, adding new features and fixing bugs in previous releases. Each major release is named {{in alphabetical order}} after a dessert or sugary treat, with the first few Android versions being called [...] "Cupcake", [...] "Donut", [...] "Eclair", and [...] "Froyo", respectively. During its announcement of Android KitKat in 2013, Google explained that [...] "Since these devices make our lives so sweet, each Android version is named after a dessert", although a Google spokesperson told CNN {{in an interview that}} [...] "It’s kind of like an internal team thing, and <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> be a little bit — how should I say — a bit inscrutable in the matter, I’ll say".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2005, the Church of Nigeria redefined in its {{constitution}} {{its relationship}} to the Anglican Communion as [...] "Communion with all Anglican Churches, Dioceses and Provinces that hold and maintain the Historic Faith, Doctrine, Sacrament and Discipline of the one Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.". In a later press release, Akinola clarified [...] "We want to state that our intention in amending the 2002 Constitution of the Church of Nigeria was to make clear that we are committed to the historic faith once delivered to the Saints, practice and the traditional formularies of the Church. ... We treasure our place within the worldwide family of the Anglican Communion but we are distressed by the unilateral actions of those provinces that are clearly determined to redefine what our common faith was once. [...] We have chosen not to be yoked to them as <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> exercise our freedom to remain faithful. We continue to pray, however, {{that there will be a}} genuine demonstration of repentance." ...|$|E

2500|$|The double slit experiment, {{like the}} other six {{idealized}} experiments (microscope, split beam, tilt-teeth, radiation pattern, one-photon polarization, and polarization of paired photons), imposes a choice between complementary modes of observation. In each experiment we {{have found a way}} to delay that choice of type of phenomenon to be looked for up to the very final stage of development of the phenomenon, and it depends on whichever type of detection device we then fix upon. That delay makes no difference in the experimental predictions. On this score everything we find was foreshadowed in that solitary and pregnant sentence of Bohr, [...] "...it...can make no difference, as regards observable effects obtainable by a definite experimental arrangement, whether our plans for constructing or handling the instruments are fixed beforehand or whether <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> postpone the completion of our planning until a later moment when the particle is already on its way from one instrument to another." ...|$|E

30|$|Although these {{findings}} were promising, the current study had some limitations. For instance, we only used one mRNA marker. <b>We</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> focus on a specific skin marker to detect its degradation pattern as recommended by Lv et al.

30|$|By Theorem  20, one can derive {{the other}} results in [2] but <b>we</b> <b>prefer</b> not <b>to</b> list these here.|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{there is}} a {{movement}} list to prevent cycling in the proposed algorithm. This list prohibits the use of some specific set of solutions for several iterations {{if one of them}} is used in recent iterations. Therefore, the search does not travel around the local optimum points. <b>We</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> determine the size of the list experimentally.|$|R

30|$|Here, <b>we</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> {{employ the}} scheme III for the {{proposed}} PAM design, as it offers the freedom of regenerative feedback current programmability. Consequently, the use of CRST, makes it promising to modulate the hysteresis and alternatively control the switching rate of a PAM system for dynamic power saving. CRST implementation {{for the proposed}} PAM is shown in Fig.  7.|$|R
30|$|Extended {{computational}} saving {{might be}} obtained by adopting a grammar model. As shown in [39], various methods for complexity reduction can be applied. These methods can be adopted by the proposed DFHMM algorithm to reduce the computational complexity without sacrificing performance. However, <b>we</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> leave these extensions for a later study, and to only focus in this paper on dimensionality reduction.|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{estimating}} all four parameters in the Kum-G families of distributions may result in inconsistent estimates. In addition, it can be observed that the estimates are highly dependent on the initial values which may also lead to convergence problems. For this reason when applying these families of distributions <b>to</b> real data, <b>we</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> use genetic algorithms for estimating the parameters.|$|R
30|$|Although {{there are}} many works related to emotion {{classification}} (such as [21] for European languages), <b>we</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> use an open set of response items, as described above, since the appearance of breathiness must not be restricted to emotions, but may also be related to other paralinguistic information, such as attitude-related items. Further, the relationship between voice quality and PI may change according to the language.|$|R

30|$|Instead {{of working}} on complex and {{expensive}} strategies to solve those issues for strongly discontinuous enrichments, <b>we</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> apply a slight reshape of the approximation spaces, {{as it is in}} our sense, the most effective approach to deal with those issues for industrial applications.
