6000|$|... "I {{have not}} said so. But when you promised her a home, <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of finding one for her? Her only fitting home {{is with her}} mother, {{and you know that}} her father will not take her there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the way to}} talk, old horse. Don't beat {{about the}} bush. Tell him {{exactly what you want}} and stand no nonsense. If you don't see what you want in the window, ask for it. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of {{tackling}} him?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Much of Hicks's routine {{involved}} direct {{attacks on}} mainstream society, religion, politics, and consumerism. Asked in a BBC interview why he cannot do a routine that appeals [...] "to everyone", {{he said that}} such an act was impossible. He responded by repeating a comment that an audience member once made to him, [...] "We don't come to comedy to think!", to which he replied, [...] "Gee, <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> go to <b>think?</b> I'll meet <b>you</b> there!"

6000|$|... "You won't have an {{opportunity}} for showing what you can do. I don't know where you got your utilitarian, radical views; but we'll keep to the point. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of going?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been searching}} for Lucy, sir, night and day. I haven't slept a wink since I heard the awful news of her {{sickness}} and escape. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> she can be, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 11. Did I {{tell you}} that old Frowde,(15) the old fool, is selling his estate at Pepperhara, and is skulking about the town nobody knows <b>where?</b> and who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> manages all this for him, but that rogue Child,(16) the double squire of Farnham? I have put Mrs. Masham, the Queen's favourite, upon buying it, but that is yet a great secret; and I have {{employed}} Lady Oglethorpe to inquire about it. I was with Lady Oglethorpe to-day, who is come to town {{for a week or}} two, and to-morrow I will see to hunt out the old fool: he is utterly ruined, and at this present in some blind alley with some dirty wench. He has two sons that must starve, and he never gives them a farthing. If Mrs. Masham buys the land, I will desire her to get the Queen to give some pension to the old fool, to keep him from absolutely starving. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> meddle with other people's affairs for? says Stella. Oh, but Mr. Masham and his wife are very urgent with me, since I first put them in the head of it. I dined with Sir Matthew Dudley, who, I doubt, will soon lose his employment.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah, {{you have}} been talking it over and decided to move?" [...] I said, delighted. [...] "I think you are {{perfectly}} right. Leigh is over-built. Men like you and Jukes {{need a lot of}} space. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of going?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{it was a}} fine {{spectacle}} to {{see this}} mighty hunter scuttling to cover like a hare, going to earth in the Cordelier Convent. Rennes has not seen him since. Rennes would like to see him again. But if he is valorous, he is also discreet. And <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he has taken refuge, this great nobleman who wanted to see the streets of Rennes washed in the blood of its citizens, this man who would have butchered old and young of the contemptible canaille to silence the voice of reason and of liberty that presumes to ring through France to-day? <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he hides himself?
