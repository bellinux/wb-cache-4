50|$|Platanthera praeclara {{arises from}} a fleshy tuber. It grows from 38 to 85 cm tall. Each plant can {{have up to}} two dozen or more flowers {{arranged}} in a stalk. P. praeclara is distinguished from Platanthera leucophaea, the eastern <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid,</b> by its slightly larger flowers, petal shape, and longer nectar spur.|$|R
50|$|The eastern <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid</b> is a {{long-lived}} perennial. Its tuberous rootstalk helps it survive grass fires. Fires {{and rain}} stimulate {{the plant to}} grow and flower. The plant emerges each year in May and flowering begins by late June. The flowers are pollinated at night by large sphinx moths. Certain night-flying insects that are attracted to the orchid's fragrance are able to obtain its nectar with their long probosces. Others cannot because of the flower's long, narrow, oddly positioned nectar spur.|$|R
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} {{is large}} and showy and may have up to 40 white flowers. It is distinguished from Platanthera praeclara, the <b>western</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid,</b> by its smaller flowers (less than one inch (2.5 cm) long), more oval petals, and a shorter nectar spur.|$|E
50|$|The Tall Grass Prairie Preserve {{consists}} {{primarily of}} big bluestem (or turkey foot, resembles the bird's foot), little bluestem, porcupine needlegrass (Stipa spartea), and prairie dropseed grasses. The last known Canadian remnant {{population of the}} endangered <b>western</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid</b> (Platanthera praeclara) is within the preserve. It is the worlds largest Platanthera praeclara population, containing over half the known population of the orchid.|$|E
50|$|This prairie wetland complex hosts a great {{diversity}} of plant species. Of special {{interest is the}} federally threatened <b>western</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid.</b> Other communities found at the preserve include wet and mesic tallgrass prairie and gravel prairie, willow thickets, mixed prairie, sedge meadow, aspen woodlands and emergent marsh. Prairie species at Pembina Trail Preserve include prairie Junegrass, purple prairie clover, big and little bluestem and mat muhly.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to prairie grasses, {{some of which}} including big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) can grow as tall as six feet, the site supports a range of prairie trees, including cottonwoods and honey locust. Invasive sumac plants and (in the absence of fire) eastern juniper trees require control to preserve the original prairie ecology. A total of 392 species of vascular plants and 80 species of birds have been observed at Nine Mile Prairie. Notable species include the federally threatened <b>prairie</b> white <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid</b> (Platanthera praeclara) and the rare regal fritillary butterfly (Speyeria idalia), and {{it is home to}} bluebirds and white-tailed deer; herds of bison would have also passed through the site when it was open prairie until the mid-19th century.|$|R
40|$|A yet {{unresolved}} {{question in}} orchid biology is whether mycorrhizal fungi (= mycobionts) utilized as a carbon source by young seedlings (= protocorms) {{are different from}} those utilized by adult plants. This is the first report documenting the protocorm mycobionts of the Federally threatened eastern <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid,</b> Platanthera leucophaea, and the first report describing a technique to culture mycotrophic seedlings to the green leaf stage. Seeds of P. leucophaea placed in retrievable nylon mesh packets were sown at Hildy Prairie (Grundy Co.), Illinois in November, 2000 and recovered in August, 2002. All resulting protocorms yielded mycobionts assignable to Ceratorhiza goodyerae-repentis (Costantin & Dufour) Moore - the same anamorphic fungus recovered from mature P. leucophaea plants in previous studies. Protocorms cultivated in vitro with a Ceratorhiza mycobiont were placed on a substrate of sand, activated charcoal, and modified oats medium and subjected to chilling (6 ºC) in darkness, followed by exposure to a 12 h photoperiod (L : D, 12 h : 12 h) at 24 ºC. Leaf length accelerated after the second week of incubation in light. Green leaf color became evident during the photoperiod implying that seedlings were capable of photosynthesis. Seedlings also maintained a mycotrophic capability evidenced by the presence of fungal pelotons in root-like organs. This study has significant merit for conservation by providing a protocol for P. leucophaea’s cultivation, and by underscoring the importance of C. goodyerae-repentis in the prairie ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|<b>Western</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>fringed</b> <b>orchid</b> (Platanthera praeciara Sheviak and Bowles) populations at {{one time}} {{extended}} from southwestern Missouri north to northwestern Minnesota, and from eastern Iowa to the Sandhills of north central Nebraska.

The questions are, 2 ̆ 2 Why has it declined in numbers? 2 ̆ 2 How have uses such as mowing for hay or grazing by cattle or no use (control) affected the numbers? In 1987, permanently located individual plants were counted on the Sheyenne National Grasslands of southeastern North Dakota. Population trends of this orchid were compared regarding effects of mowing, grazing, and fire. The evaluation of the permanently located individual plants, and data on total counts per area in 1988 showed a difference between years and significant difference among grazed, mowed, or no use treatments.
