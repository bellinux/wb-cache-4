40|$|This report {{provides}} the first high level look at system design, airplane performance, maintenance, and cost implications of using <b>water</b> <b>misting</b> and <b>water</b> injection technology in aircraft engines for takeoff and climb-out NOx emissions reduction. With an engine compressor inlet <b>water</b> <b>misting</b> rate of 2. 2 percent water-to-air ratio, a 47 percent NOx reduction was calculated. Combustor water injection could achieve greater reductions of about 85 percent, {{but with some}} performance penalties. For the <b>water</b> <b>misting</b> system on days above 59 F, a fuel efficiency benefit of about 3. 5 percent would be experienced. Reductions of up to 436 F in turbine inlet temperature were also estimated, {{which could lead to}} increased hot section life. A 0. 61 db noise reduction will occur. A nominal airplane weight penalty of less than 360 lb (no water) was estimated for a 305 passenger airplane. The airplane system cost is initially estimated at $ 40. 92 per takeoff giving an attractive NOx emissions reduction cost/benefit ratio of about $ 1, 663 /ton...|$|R
25|$|Climatic {{influences}} on vernacular architecture are substantial {{and can be}} extremely complex. Mediterranean vernacular, and that {{of much of the}} Middle East, often includes a courtyard with a fountain or pond; air cooled by <b>water</b> <b>mist</b> and evaporation is drawn through the building by the natural ventilation set up by the building form. Similarly, Northern African vernacular often has very high thermal mass and small windows to keep the occupants cool, and in many cases also includes chimneys, not for fires but to draw air through the internal spaces. Such specializations are not designed, but learned by trial and error over generations of building construction, often existing long before the scientific theories which explain why they work.|$|E
500|$|In 1977, a tunnel-cleaning {{train was}} completed. This {{consisted}} of two 1938 driving motor cars, and three purpose-built vehicles. The middle vehicle of the five contains a fan unit, which supplies large volumes of low pressure air {{to a series of}} nozzles, which disturb the dust on the tunnel walls and track. The cars on either side of it draw the dust-laden air into filter chambers, and are fitted with conveyors for discharging the dust at depots. To enable the train to operate sufficiently slowly for the cleaning process to be effective, a hydraulic drive was fitted to one of the motor cars, with settings to allow speeds of , , [...] and [...] Up to 6 tons of dust can be held in the filter bags, and the units are fitted with carbon dioxide and <b>water</b> <b>mist</b> fire fighting equipment, because of the combustible nature of fine dust particles. There were teething problems when the train began work in 1978, but by 1980, these had been resolved.|$|E
500|$|The ride {{begins with}} a dousing of Floo Powder from Hermione Granger, who asks the guests to say, [...] "Observatory" [...] in order to {{transport}} them to their desired location, and the enchanted bench flies off through the Floo Network to the Astronomy Tower. The guests leave the room of requirement through its fireplace and enter the Observatory, where they look out through the open arches to the hills and lake outside Hogwarts' boundary. As the guests fly {{out of one of}} the Observatory's arches, the ride smoothly switches to a wrap-around projection screen and they follow Harry Potter and Ron Weasley around Hogwarts' buildings and towers to a Quidditch match. As Harry and Ron travel under a bridge, Hagrid yields the riders and asks them if they have seen a dragon. As Harry redirects the riders' attentions back to their journey, Hagrid's pet Hungarian Horntail dragon begins to chase the riders. The bench flies out of the projection screen and into a set of the uneven bridge that crosses the valley behind Hogwarts and, after falling out of a hole in the floor of the bridge, they encounter an animatronic dragon, which breaths pressurized <b>water</b> <b>mist</b> with red lighting pointed to it to make it resemble fire.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the train}} {{stopped in the}} tunnel due to a fire, the {{procedure}} was that the smoke {{had to be removed}} by the high powered ventilation before evacuation could be allowed.

5000|$|<b>Water</b> <b>mist</b> {{systems are}} used for special {{applications}} {{in which it is}} decided that creating a heat absorbent vapor is the primary objective. This type of system is typically used where water damage may be a concern, or where water supplies are limited. NFPA 750 defines <b>water</b> <b>mist</b> as a water spray with a droplet size of [...] "less than 1000 microns at the minimum operation pressure of the discharge nozzle." [...] The droplet size can be controlled by the adjusting discharge pressure through a nozzle of a fixed orifice size. By creating a mist, an equal volume of water will create a larger total surface area exposed to the fire. The larger total surface area better facilitates the transfer of heat, thus allowing more water droplets to turn to steam more quickly. A <b>water</b> <b>mist,</b> which absorbs more heat than water per unit time, due to exposed surface area, will more effectively cool the room, thus reducing the temperature of the flame.|$|E
