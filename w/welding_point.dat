40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{systematic}} method on the weld pitch design of a vehicle sub-frame considering the fatigue life of spot <b>welding</b> <b>points.</b> The input data, which perform the fatigue analysis on the spot welding nuggets, are obtained by both the dynamic analysis of the multi-body vehicle model passing through the virtual proving ground of a typical Belgian road and the quasi-static analysis with the finite element model of the vehicle sub-frame. By utilizing the life cycle data obtained from the fatigue analysis, the <b>welding</b> <b>points</b> to perform the pitch change are determined. The sensitivity analysis on the fatigue life of the <b>welding</b> <b>points</b> is carried out by using the three-level orthogonal array design, and through the results of the sensitivity analysis, the best combination on the welding pitch is determined.
