5|$|His {{government}} {{was recognized by}} the <b>western</b> <b>Allies.</b> Nonetheless Sikorski's government struggled to get its point of view heard by France and the United Kingdom. The <b>western</b> <b>Allies</b> refused to recognize the Soviet Union as an aggressor, despite the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September 1939. Furthermore, he struggled to secure resources needed to recreate the Polish Army in exile.|$|E
5|$|In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> entered western Germany {{and closed}} to the Rhine river. By March, the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> crossed the Rhine {{north and south of}} the Ruhr, {{encircling}} the German Army Group B, while the Soviets advanced to Vienna. In early April, the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg, while Soviet and Polish forces stormed Berlin in late April. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April. On 30 April 1945, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1943, the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> {{invaded the}} Italian mainland, {{following}} Italy's armistice with the Allies. Germany {{with the help}} of fascists responded by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas, and creating a series of defensive lines. German special forces then rescued Mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the Italian Social Republic, causing an Italian civil war. The <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> fought through several lines until reaching the main German defensive line in mid-November.|$|E

5|$|On 6 June 1944 (known as D-Day), {{after three}} years of Soviet pressure, the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> invaded {{northern}} France. After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy, they also attacked southern France. These landings were successful, and led to the defeat of the German Army units in France. Paris was liberated by the local resistance assisted by the Free French Forces, both led by General Charles de Gaulle, on 25 August and the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> continued to push back German forces in western Europe during {{the latter part of the}} year. An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands failed. After that, the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> slowly pushed into Germany, but failed to cross the Ruhr river in a large offensive. In Italy, Allied advance also slowed due to the last major German defensive line.|$|E
5|$|Grosz later {{testified that}} Brand's mission {{had been a}} cover for his own.

5|$|In {{the last}} months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and {{articles}} took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone. By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> preparing to cross the Rhine, he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable. Berlin had {{little in the way of}} fortifications or artillery (or even Volkssturm units, 'civilian soldiers'), as almost everything had been sent to the front. Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the <b>western</b> <b>allies,</b> but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose the confidence of his Führer.|$|E

5|$|On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last {{attempt on}} the Western Front by using most of its {{remaining}} reserves to launch a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes and along the French–German border to split the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies,</b> encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at Antwerp to prompt a political settlement. By January, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled. In Italy, the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Soviets and Poles attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia. On 4 February, Soviet, British and US leaders met for the Yalta Conference. They agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{offensive}} into central Germany, what {{later became}} East Germany, had two objectives. Stalin {{did not believe}} the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> would hand over territory occupied by them in the post-war Soviet zone, so he began the offensive on a broad front and moved rapidly to meet the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> as far west as possible. But the overriding objective was to capture Berlin. The two goals were complementary because possession of the zone could not be won quickly unless Berlin were taken. Another consideration was that Berlin itself held useful post-war strategic assets, including Adolf Hitler and the German atomic bomb programme. On 6 March, Hitler appointed Lieutenant General Helmuth Reymann commander of the Berlin Defence Area, replacing Lieutenant General Bruno Ritter von Hauenschild.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Joseph Ferdinand Galland (19 March 1912 – 9 February 1996) was a German Luftwaffe {{general and}} flying ace who served {{throughout}} the Second World War in Europe. He flew 705 combat missions, and fought on the Western Front {{and in the}} Defence of the Reich. On four occasions, he survived being shot down, and he was credited with 104 aerial victories, all of them against the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies.</b>|$|E

It {{served on the}} Eastern Front of the European Theatre of World War II with the 1st Air Army. The regiment is notable for being {{one of only three}} units from <b>Western</b> <b>Allied</b> countries to see combat on the Eastern Front during World War II, and Normandie-Niemen was the only <b>Western</b> <b>Allied</b> unit to fight with the Soviet forces {{until the end of the}} war in Europe.|$|R

The city's garrison surrendered on 2 May but fighting continued to the north-west, west, and south-west of the city {{until the end of the}} war in Europe on 8 May (9 May in the Soviet Union) as some German units fought westward so that they could surrender to the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> rather than to the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|Joachim Müncheberg (31 December 1918 – 23 March 1943) was a German Luftwaffe {{military}} aviator during World War II, {{a fighter}} ace credited with 135 enemy aircraft {{shot down in}} over 500 combat missions. The majority of his victories were claimed over the Western Front, with 33 claims over the Eastern Front. Of his 102 aerial victories achieved over the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies,</b> 46 were against Supermarine Spitfire fighters.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{disagreed}} {{about how}} the European map should look, and how borders would be drawn, following the war. Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war security. The <b>western</b> <b>Allies</b> desired a security system in which democratic governments were established as widely as possible, permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through international organizations.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{established}} occupation administrations in Austria and Germany. The former {{became a}} neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. The latter {{was divided into}} western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> and the USSR, accordingly. A denazification programme in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals {{and the removal of}} ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.|$|E
5|$|The wartime Allies {{initially}} {{worked together}} {{under the auspices of}} the Allied Control Council (ACC) for Germany. Cooperation between the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> and the Soviets ultimately broke down because of disagreements over Germany's political and economic future. In May 1949, the three western occupation zones were merged to form the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) with a freely elected government. The Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR), under communist rule.|$|E
5|$|With {{relations}} deteriorating {{between the}} Soviet Union and the United States, the three <b>western</b> <b>Allies</b> met in March 1948 to merge their zones of occupation {{and allow the}} formation of what became the Federal Republic of Germany, commonly known as West Germany.

5|$|After World War II (Great Patriotic War), Molotov was {{involved}} in negotiations with the <b>Western</b> <b>allies,</b> in which he became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, when he fell out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to Andrei Vyshinsky. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov {{in a speech to}} the 19th Party Congress. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. Molotov defended Stalin's policies and legacy until his death in 1986, and harshly criticised Stalin's successors, especially Khrushchev.|$|E
5|$|Commando raids {{were made}} by the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies</b> during much of the Second World War against the Atlantic Wall. The raids were {{conducted}} by the armed forces of Britain, the Commonwealth and a small number of men from the occupied territories serving with No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando during the Second World War. All the operations took place between the Arctic Circle in Norway to the French border with Spain, along what was known as the Atlantic Wall.|$|E
5|$|Despite Germany's reorganization, their {{manpower}} {{was still}} incomparable {{to that of}} the <b>Western</b> <b>Allies.</b> While Germany's Army Group B was able to increase their armored strength from 100 to 239 vehicles, these were opposed by 2,300 Allied tanks. Field Marshal Model reported that only 6,500 replacements had been sent to cover the 75,000 casualties suffered during the month of September. General Eisenhower commanded three army groups, totaling eight field armies with 55 divisions; these provided a two-to-one advantage in artillery guns and a twenty-to-one advantage in tanks, and could count on almost 14,000 combat aircraft, as compared to the Luftwaffe's 573.|$|E
