500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{creative}} direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became {{the starting point for}} a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of {{the rise and fall of}} their former bandmate. Waters commented: [...] "Because I wanted to get as close as possible to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt...</b> indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd." ...|$|E
500|$|Milian met actor Nick Cannon {{on the set}} {{of their}} film, Love Don't Cost a Thing, in 2003, and they began dating. After being {{together}} {{for two and a half}} years, Milian ended her relationship with Cannon in 2005 because of his cheating. Cannon revealed that he refused to stay faithful to Milian because their relationship was becoming too much like a [...] "Christian romance". When Cannon married Mariah Carey on April 30, 2008, Milian said, [...] "regardless of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in the past at the time, I actually forgive him and I'm very much over that." ...|$|E

Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... and I wanted to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E
500|$|Richard {{herself has}} been less {{complimentary}} about her alter ego's departure. She has spoken of her disappointment regarding Pauline's [...] "changing character" [...] and [...] "depressing final storyline". In {{an interview with the}} Biography Channel she explained: [...] "I did say, promise me you won't make Pauline nasty before she goes, and unfortunately they did... I wasn't too happy with the way it was done. They were changing Pauline's character... Pauline would never have remarried. She would have remained a widow, sitting in that chair in the corner. That's what [...] Julia Smith wanted, and that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> was right, so I resigned... I think it's a shame because the Fowlers have gone completely now... There was so much history with that family." ...|$|E

We {{talked a lot about}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the song needed in order to reach as many young people as possible. I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power. Because after what you did to me, you don't even know how much stronger I am.' ...|$|E

500|$|... "Teen Spirit" [...] {{is widely}} {{interpreted}} to be a teen revolution anthem, an interpretation {{reinforced by the}} song's music video. In an interview conducted the day Nevermind was released, Cobain stated the song was about his friends, explaining, [...] "We still feel as if we're teenagers because we don't follow the guidelines of what's expected of us to be adults [...] It also has kind of a teen revolutionary theme." [...] As Cobain did more interviews, he changed his explanation of the song and rarely gave specifics about the song's meaning. When discussing the song in Michael Azerrad's biography , Cobain revealed that he felt a duty [...] "to describe <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> about my surroundings and my generation and people my age." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} stage of recording, Sly and Robbie focused {{primarily}} on constructing difficult grooves for songs. To record their rhythm tracks, Dunbar worked in the studio alone and cut a drum part without having a melody in mind. He recounted his approach for the album to Musician, saying that [...] "I just played <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> working {{from a sense of}} 'now I'll do 103 beats per minute.' And Robbie would come in the next night and lay a bass part." [...] Unlike most reggae or funk bassists, Shakespeare approached his playing as a jazz soloist and attempted numerous subtle variations to his riff. He said that his inspiration [...] "comes from God. Sometimes endless ideas just keep coming to me. Sometimes I'll change the drum pattern to a bass line and Sly will play the bass line on the drums." [...] Along with live percussion, Dunbar played Simmons drums, and the duo integrated contemporary electronic music technology such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer in the album's recording. Dunbar used his recorded live drums to trigger the synthesizer's sampled drum sounds.|$|E
500|$|After several weeks, Waters {{began to}} visualise another concept. [...] The three new {{compositions}} from 1974's tour {{were at least}} {{a starting point for}} a new album, and [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" [...] seemed a reasonable choice as a centrepiece for the new work. [...] Mostly an instrumental twenty-minute-plus piece similar to [...] "Echoes", the opening four-note guitar phrase reminded Waters of the lingering ghost of former band-member Syd Barrett. [...] Gilmour had composed the phrase entirely by accident, but was encouraged by Waters' positive response. [...] Waters wanted to split [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", and sandwich two new songs between its two halves. [...] Gilmour disagreed, but was outvoted three to one. [...] "Welcome to the Machine" [...] and [...] "Have a Cigar" [...] were barely veiled attacks on the music business, their lyrics working neatly with [...] "Shine On" [...] to provide an apt summary of {{the rise and fall of}} Barrett; [...] "Because I wanted to get as close as possible to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt...</b> that sort of indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd." [...] "Raving and Drooling" [...] and [...] "You Gotta Be Crazy" [...] had no place in the new concept, and were set aside until the following album, 1977's Animals.|$|E

500|$|During the follow pre-season, Holdsworth allowed Nix {{to attend}} a trial with Dutch Eerste Divisie side Sparta Rotterdam. Nix {{described}} it as a [...] "chance of a lifetime" [...] to pursue his dream of playing for the Australian national side with Sparta having an Australian coach. However, his trial was unsuccessful and he returned to Mansfield and he immediately scored in a friendly ahead of the new Conference season. Nix was not included in Mansfield's squad for the first three games of the season, and during the third match with the side losing, the club's fans were singing Nix's name. After eventually winning 3–1, Holdsworth said: [...] "I know Kyle is a very good player and I respect the fans have individuals they like. But we have a healthy squad here and I picked <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> was a winning side today which proved to be right." [...] His first game of the season was as a late substitute for Adam Smith moments after Mansfield conceded an equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Kettering Town. His first start of the season came as Holdsworth made changes to personnel and formation for a game at Southport on 11 September. A 2–1 victory was Mansfield's third consecutive win. Before the end of the month, he had scored his first goal of the month, during a 5–0 victory against York City which put Mansfield second in the table.|$|E
500|$|The Robot Masters {{featured}} {{in some of}} the previous Mega Man games were the result of design contests held in Japan, in which fans of the series would submit their character ideas to Capcom. Keeping with the tradition, Japan held a design contest for Mega Man 6. After the release of Mega Man 5, the magazine Nintendo Power held a similar contest in North America. Only eight out of the more than 200,000 worldwide character submissions for Mega Man 6 were accepted for the game. Six of the Robot Masters were designed by Japanese fans, while the remaining two (Knight Man and Wind Man) were designed by North American fans who entered the Nintendo Power contest. The North American cover of the game pays homage to the two designers by featuring their Robot Masters on it. [...] Inafune admitted that it was stressful when the last characters being designed for the game were not meeting with the development team's schedule. He concluded, [...] "For having hit a lot of roadblocks, I feel like we got a lot done for 6. The theme for our designs was 'The world is our stage,' and I really enjoyed bringing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> was the unique flavor of different countries into the game." [...] Yuko Takehara, credited as [...] "Yuko", composed the musical score for Mega Man 6. Takehara collaborated with several other composers for the follow-up Mega Man 7 in 1995.|$|E

2500|$|Amy Sherman-Palladino, {{who came}} from a {{background}} of writing for half-hour sitcoms, had Gilmore Girls approved by The WB after several of her previous pitches were turned down. On a whim, she suggested a show about a mother and daughter but had put little thought into the idea. Having to create a pilot, she drew inspiration for the show's setting of [...] "Stars Hollow, Connecticut" [...] after making a trip to Washington Depot, Connecticut, where she stayed at the Mayflower Inn. She explained: [...] "If I can make people feel this much of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> walking around this fairy town, I {{thought that would be}} wonderful ... At the time I was there, it was beautiful, it was magical, and it was feeling of warmth and small-town camaraderie ...

2500|$|Shore {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to Henry and Charlotte Shore. She was the {{youngest}} of seven children. She was drawn to both painting and nature at a young age, remarking [...] "I was on my way home from school and saw myself reflected in a puddle. It was the first time I had seen my image completely surrounded by nature, and I suddenly had an overwhelming sense of belonging to it—of actually being part of every tree and flower. I was filled with a desire to tell <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> through painting." [...] Shore's mother supported Shore's artistic ambitions, but advised her to learn practical matters as well. After taking a domestic education class, at the age of 15, Shore began studying painting with the Canadian Impressionist Laura Muntz Lyall. Her works at this time are mostly genre scenes and thus conform to subject matter that would have been popular in Toronto's traditional art scene during the period.|$|E

They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, [...] "What have you got to say?" [...] I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E

One performance {{has been documented}} on the CD The Return of Mel Powell (Chiaroscuro Records). The recording includes 20 minutes of Powell discussing {{his life and his}} reasons for leaving jazz. In an interview with The New Yorker magazine jazz critic Whitney Balliett, Powell said: [...] "I have decided that when I retire I will think through my decision to leave jazz – with the help of Freud and Jung. At the moment, I suspect it was this: I had done <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> I had to do in jazz. I had decided it did not hold the deepest interest for me musically. And I had decided that it was a young man's music, even a black music. Also, the endless repetition of material in the Goodman band – playing the same tunes day after day and night after night – got to me. That repetition tended to kill spontaneity, which is the heart of jazz and which can give a lifetime's nourishment." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a {{drowsiness}} similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.|$|E

[...] I did not imagine life could be this amazing many years ago after being released from a horrid Nigerian prison for being different. Then all I could think was I could die in this prison and no one will know or care. [...] Being imprisoned felt justifiable, considering I was being punished for being 'gay' as they assumed due to my feminine features and mannerisms. [...] I wasn't gay, I am a woman born differently due to natural defects. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> did not match my outward appearance. Being assigned male at birth doesn't make me a man or a woman, nobody was born a man or a woman, you are born male or female, then you develop into your preferred gender as you grow up thus making you a man or a woman. For me that gender was female. I was born male but my brain, gestures, features and carriage functioned as that of a female. Growing up and not knowing what was happening to my body made me confused and lost. I couldn't discuss it with my family because my femininity was frowned upon due to religion and I could not talk to my friends because they would not understand what I was going through.
