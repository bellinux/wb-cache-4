[...] Dawud Walid, head of the Michigan branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, commented in the report that The Simpsons [...] "is a very prolific show. Now [...] is addressing this anti-sharia fear mongering issue, and perhaps it may gain some currency and ... more people will make fun of it." [...] The segment was met with mixed reception from students at University of Michigan–Dearborn. A number of them were interviewed by Gallagher in his report. One student said: [...] "It's pretty cool showing how ridiculous the hate is.

It has been credited with creating {{a climate in which}} musicians from around the world felt inclined to follow. According to The New York Times Stephen Holden, since the release of [...] "We Are the World", it has been noted that movement has been made within popular music to create songs that address humanitarian concerns. [...] "We Are the World" [...] was also influential in subverting the way music and meaning were produced, showing that musically and racially diverse musicians could work together both productively and creatively. Ebony described the January 28 recording session, in which Quincy Jones brought together a multi-racial group, as being [...] "a major moment in world music that showed <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> the world". [...] "We Are the World", along with Live Aid and Farm Aid, demonstrated that rock music had become more than entertainment, but a political and social movement. Journalist Robert Palmer noted that such songs and events had the ability to reach people around the world, send them a message, and then get results.|$|E

In the spring of 1968, Mann played {{a leadership role in}} the Columbia University student strike led by SDS and the Black Student Union, demanding that Columbia shut down its Institute for Defense Analysis, and that it “integrate” the gymnasium, which only gave Blacks and Puerto Ricans limited access and a separate entrance. As a regional coordinator for SDS, Mann organized and spoke at rallies at Boston University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and other New England colleges. “The Columbia strike more than any other event in our history,” Mann said, “has given the radical student movement the belief that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> this country.” ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the core}} of Unger's {{philosophy}} are two key conceptions: first the infinity of the individual, and secondly the singularity {{of the world and}} the reality of time. The premise behind the infinity of the individual is that we exist within social contexts but we are more than the roles that these contexts may define for us—we can overcome them. In Unger's terms, we are both [...] "context-bound and context-transcending; [...] "we appear as [...] "the embodied spirit;" [...] as [...] "the infinite imprisoned within the finite." [...] For Unger, there is no natural state of the individual and his social being. Rather, we are infinite in spirit and unbound in what we can become. As such, no social institution or convention can contain us. While institutions do exist and shape our beings and our interactions, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> both their structure and the extent to which they imprison us.|$|E

Both are indeed mysterious, and their genuine mystery needs {{none of the}} hype with which this film relentlessly and noisily belabours us", concluding that the film is [...] "tosh". Professor Clive Greated wrote that [...] "thinking on neurology and addiction are covered in some detail but, unfortunately, early references in the film to quantum physics are not followed through, leading to a confused message". Despite his caveats, he recommends that people see the movie, stating: [...] "I hope it develops into a cult movie in the UK {{as it has in}} the US. Science and engineering are important for our future, and anything that engages the public can only be a good thing." [...] Simon Singh called it pseudoscience and said the suggestion [...] "that if observing water changes its molecular structure, and if we are 90% water, then by observing ourselves <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> at a fundamental level via the laws of quantum physics" [...] was [...] "ridiculous balderdash". According to João Magueijo, professor in theoretical physics at Imperial College, the film deliberately misquotes science. The American Chemical Society's review criticizes the film as a [...] "pseudoscientific docudrama", saying [...] "Among the more outlandish assertions are that people can travel backward in time, and that matter is actually thought." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Active {{inference}} {{provides a}} simple and neuro-biologically plausible account of how action and percep-tion are coupled in producing (Bayes) optimal behaviour. This can be seen most easily as minimising prediction error: <b>we</b> <b>can</b> either <b>change</b> our predictions to explain sensory input through perception. Alternatively, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> actively <b>change</b> sensory input to fulfil our predictions. In active inference, this action is mediated by classical reflex arcs that minimise proprioceptive prediction error created by descending proprioceptive predictions. However, this creates a conflict between action and perception; in that, self-generated movements require predictions to override the sensory evidence that one is not actually moving. However, ignoring sensory evidence means that externally generated sensations will not be perceived. Conversely...|$|R
