6000|$|Where, as in {{the great}} staple trades of this country, you have {{powerful}} organisations on both sides, with responsible leaders able to bind their constituents to their decisions, conjoined with automatic scales, or arbitration or conciliation {{in case of a}} deadlock, there you have a healthy condition of bargaining, which increases the competitive power of the industry, which continually weaves more closely together the fortunes of Capital and Labour, and which enforces a constant progression in the standards of living and of productive power. But where, as in what we call [...] "Sweated trades," [...] you have no organisation at all on either side, no parity of bargaining between employers and employed, where the good employer is continually undercut by the bad, and the bad again by the worse; where the worker whose whole livelihood depends on the trade is undercut by the worker to whom it is only a second string; where the feebleness and ignorance of the workers and their isolation from each other render them an easy prey to the tyranny of bad masters, and middlemen one step above them upon the lowest rungs of the ladder, and themselves held in the grip of the same relentless forces--there you have a condition not of progress but of progressive degeneration. And just {{as in the}} former case the upward tendency will be constant if it is not interrupted by external power, so in the latter case the demoralisation <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> squalid welter for periods which are quite indefinite so far as our brief lives are concerned.|$|E
60|$|But the {{argument}} from temperature {{does not end}} here. There remains to be noticed a more conspicuous and still more significant fact. If the Solar System was produced by the concentration of diffused matter, which evolved heat while gravitating into its present dense form; then there is an obvious implication. Other things equal, the latest-formed mass will be the latest in cooling--will, for an almost infinite time, possess a greater heat than the earlier-formed ones. Other things equal, the largest mass will, because of its superior aggregative force, become hotter than the others, and radiate more intensely. Other things equal, the largest mass, notwithstanding the higher temperature it reaches, will, in consequence of its relatively small surface, be the slowest in losing its evolved heat. And hence, {{if there is one}} mass which was not only formed after the rest, but exceeds them enormously in size, it follows that this one will reach an intensity of incandescence far beyond that reached by the rest; and <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of intense incandescence long after the rest have cooled. Such a mass we have in the Sun. It is a corollary from the Nebular Hypothesis, that the matter forming the Sun assumed its present integrated shape at a period much more recent than that at which the planets became definite bodies. The quantity of matter contained in the Sun is nearly five million times that contained in the smallest planet, and above a thousand times that contained in the largest. And while, from the enormous gravitative force of his parts to their common centre, the evolution of heat has been intense, the facilities of radiation have been relatively small. Hence the still-continued high temperature. Just that condition of the central body which is a necessary inference from the Nebular Hypothesis, we find actually existing in the Sun.|$|E

40|$|Health service {{managers}} {{and policy makers}} are increasingly concerned about the sustainability of innovations implemented in health care settings. The increasing demand on health services requires that innovations are both effective and sustainable however {{research in this field}} is limited with multiple disciplines, approaches and paradigms influencing the field. These variations prevent a cohesive approach and therefore the accumulation of research findings <b>in</b> development of <b>a</b> body of knowledge. A theoretical framework serves to guide research, determine variables, influence data analysis and is central to the quest for ongoing knowledge development. If left unaddressed, health services research <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ad hoc manner preventing full utilisation of outcomes, recommendations and knowledge for effective provision of health services. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide an integrative review of the literature and introduce a theoretical framework for health services innovation sustainability research based on integration and synthesis of the literature. Finally recommendations for operationalising and testing this theory will be presented...|$|R

50|$|Main {{sequence}} stars accumulate helium {{in their}} cores {{as a result}} of hydrogen fusion, but the core does not become hot enough to initiate helium fusion. Helium fusion first begins when a star leaves the red giant branch after accumulating sufficient helium in its core to ignite it. In stars around the mass of the sun, this begins {{at the tip of the}} red giant branch with a helium flash from a degenerate helium core and the star moves to the horizontal branch where it burns helium in its core. More massive stars ignite helium in their cores without a flash and execute a blue loop before reaching the asymptotic giant branch. Despite the name, stars on a blue loop from the red giant branch are typically yellow giants, possibly Cepheid variables. They fuse helium until the core is largely carbon and oxygen. The most massive stars become supergiants when they leave the main sequence and quickly start helium fusion as they become red supergiants. After helium is exhausted in the core of a star, it <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shell around the carbon-oxygen core.|$|E
50|$|Ring Outs {{occur when}} one of the fighters is {{forcibly}} removed from the games arena (or ring), instantly ending the round and resulting in a round point for their opponent. The idea of Ring Outs in 3D fighting games was originally conceived by the Virtua Fighter series of fighting games and adopted by Namco for Soul Edge. A combatant cannot be knocked out of the ring without being eliminated by some effort from themselves or by their opponent. Later games introduced new ring designs that modified the way Ring Outs were handled (Soulcalibur allowed rings to take different shapes instead of a basic square, Soulcalibur II introduced stages with walls that blocked off parts of the ring and made Ring Outs possible only in certain parts of the stage or removing that condition altogether, and Soulcalibur III introduced low walls that can be destroyed to create a Ring Out opportunity). Soulcalibur V introduced a new aspect of Ring Outs; if a Ring Out is declared on certain stages, the battle <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new location that is below the point where the Ring Out occurred. V also includes infinite stages (the stages have no edges of any kind, allowing the battle to continue in any direction with no limit) {{for the first time in}} the history of the series.|$|E
