5|$|A film {{adaptation}} of Christ the Lord {{was reported to}} be {{in the early stages of}} development in February 2012. It was reported that Chris Columbus had signed on to produce, and that Cyrus Nowrasteh had already completed the script. On November 8, 2014, during an interview with her long-time editor, Victoria Wilson, at the Chicago Humanities Festival, Rice revealed that filming had finished on the movie and <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> post-production. The film, titled The Young Messiah, was released in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Several {{rumors and}} misconceptions {{have grown up}} around the film, one being that Ronald Reagan was {{originally}} chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the studio {{early on in the}} film's development, but by that time the studio already knew that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> the Army, and he was never seriously considered. George Raft claimed that he had turned down the lead role. Studio records make clear that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.|$|E
5|$|When rehearsals {{opened in}} September 1955, Rodgers {{assembled}} {{the cast and}} told them that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> the hospital for a minor operation. In fact, Rodgers had been diagnosed with cancer of the jawbone. He spent the weekend before the operation writing one final song for Pipe Dream. The surgery required removal of part of the jawbone and tongue, and some of the lymph nodes. The operation took place on September 21, 1955; within ten days of the operation he was back in the theatre watching rehearsals, though for some time only as a spectator.|$|E

5|$|As {{the fire}} <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> its sixth hour it had spread {{up to the}} 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched hoses up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire. While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to get control of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but the fire was still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E
25|$|When {{investigators}} analysed the 727's voice recorder, {{the recording}} {{revealed that the}} pilots believed that the shaking of the stick shaker mechanism {{was caused by the}} airliner reaching the speed of sound, and not a warning that it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> a stall.|$|E

25|$|By November 1923, the {{directors}} decided {{they could not}} continue and announced that the company <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> liquidation. Frederick Cleeve had stepped down as managing director several years earlier {{and was replaced by}} Sir Thomas Cleeve's son, Francis. The company was bought as a going concern by a syndicate of local businessmen led by Andrew O'Shaughnessy, a member of Dáil Éireann. Francis Cleeve remained on as managing director for another year to facilitate the transition.|$|E
25|$|Davidson made a {{deal with}} Time-Life, a company that <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> the movie-making {{business}}. However, it quickly left the business after making two films that were not financially successful. He was understandably upset and {{a couple of days later}} he went out to dinner and met a secretary who had worked on his first film. He told her what had happened to his film, and she gave his script for Eddie and the Cruisers to her business partners. In a relatively short time, a deal was struck with Aurora and Davidson was given a $6 million budget.|$|E
25|$|On October 28, 2015, it was {{announced}} that Jones would be fighting former WBO cruiserweight champion Enzo Maccarinelli, 35, who had a career record of 40 wins and 7 losses, for the WBA 'super' world cruiserweight title. However, this was a 'false rumour'. It was however announced that they would fight on December 12, 2015 in a non-title Cruiserweight battle. This was Jones' first fight since being granted Russian citizenship and he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> it with 8 straight victories, with the last 4 inside the distance. The fight took place at the VTB Ice Palace in Moscow.|$|E

25|$|While the Ferraris {{pulled away}} (Alesi {{pulling away from}} Berger), Häkkinen passed Herbert (in the spare Lotus, an older car) who retired on lap 13 when his {{alternator}} failed. Alesi then pitted but his car refused {{to engage a gear}} when he tried to rejoin resulting in his retirement. During Berger's stop, he was blocked by another car which <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> the pit. In his frustration, he accidentally stalled the car exiting his stop and lost over 10 seconds, dropping back to third. Coulthard also got ahead of Hill during the stops, however Hill passed Coulthard on lap 29 to take the lead.|$|E
25|$|In all, Lockheed built a {{total of}} 35 Orions costing $25,000 each new. It is not known if any survived past the 1940s except the one that survives to the present day. This lone {{remaining}} Orion was originally built as an experimental Altair with a metal fuselage. This Altair (built in 1931) was damaged in a belly landing accident in Columbus, Ohio, in 1933. It was returned to Lockheed where it was converted in 1934 to an Orion 9C configuration by the original designer of the Orion, Richard A. von Hake, and others who worked for free during a slow period when the Lockheed factory <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, June 3, 1989, Scully {{was doing}} the play-by-play for the NBC Game of the Week in St. Louis, where the Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs in 10 innings. Meanwhile, the Dodgers were playing a series in Houston, where Scully flew to be on hand to call the Sunday game of the series. However, the Saturday night game between the teams <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> extra innings when Scully arrived in town, {{so he went to}} the Astrodome instead of his hotel. He picked up the play-by-play, helping to relieve the other Dodger announcers, who were doing both {{television}} and radio, and broadcast the final 13 innings (after already calling 10 innings in St. Louis), as the game went 22 innings. He broadcast 23 innings in one day in two different cities.|$|E

25|$|Bonne Citoyenne {{was among}} the many vessels of the Malta {{blockade}} sharing in the prize money accruing from the capture on 18 February of the French warship Genereux. The first distribution of the proceeds of the hull, provisions and stores totaled £24,000. On 2 April the squadron captured the Guillaume Tell, with the vessels of the squadron sharing in the prize money. Similarly Bonne Citoyenne shared in the capture on 6 April of the French polacca Vengeance, which <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> La Valletta. Next, on 27 June, vessels of the squadron captured the French privateers Redoubtable and Entreprenant. Bonne Citoyenne was also among the vessels sharing in the proceeds from the capture of the French frigate Dianne on 25 August off Malta as she and Justice attempted to escape. Although the British captured Dianne, Justice was able to slip away in the dark.|$|E
25|$|Gleason {{was raised}} by his mother. When she died in 1935 of sepsis from a large neck {{carbuncle}} (which young Jackie had tried to lance), Gleason was 19, he had nowhere to go, and he had 36 cents to his name. The family of his first girlfriend, Julie Dennehy, offered to take him in; Gleason, however, was headstrong and insisted that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> {{the heart of the}} city. His friend Sammy Birch made room for him in the hotel room he shared with another comedian. Birch also told him of a weeklong gig in Reading, Pennsylvania, that would pay $19, more money than Gleason could imagine. The booking agent advanced him bus fare for the trip against his salary. This was Gleason's first job as a professional comedian; henceforth, he would always have regular work in small clubs.|$|E

500|$|Wałęsa's BBWR {{performed}} {{poorly in}} the 1993 parliamentary elections; at times his popular support dwindled to 10 percent and he narrowly lost the 1995 presidential election, winning 33.11 {{percent of the}} vote in the first round and 48.28 percent in the run-off against Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who represented the resurgent Polish post-Communists the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD). Wałęsa's fate was sealed by his poor handling of the media; in televised debates he appeared [...] incoherent and rude; [...] in response to Kwaśniewski's extended hand at the end of the first of the two debates, he replied that the post-Communist leader could [...] "shake his leg". After the election Wałęsa said he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> [...] "political retirement" [...] and his role in politics became increasingly marginal.|$|E
500|$|It did {{not take}} long for Smith to earn {{recognition}} in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest fielding play only ten games into his rookie season. The Padres played host to the Atlanta Braves on April 20, 1978, and with two out {{in the top of}} the fourth inning, Atlanta's Jeff Burroughs hit a ground ball up the middle. Smith described the play by saying, [...] "He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch it with my bare hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first." ...|$|E
500|$|At the time, the National Hockey League was {{considered}} to be where the best hockey players played, and its best players consisted largely of Canadians. The public consensus of hockey pundits and fans in North America was that other countries, the Soviets in this case, were simply no match for Canada's best. The Soviets were not expected to even give the Canadians a challenge, and Canada <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>into</b> this series expected to win handily. According to Team Canada Coach Harry Sinden: [...] "Canada is first in the world in two things: hockey and wheat." [...] Alan Eagleson said [...] "We gotta win in eight games. Anything less than an unblemished sweep of the Russians would bring shame down on the heads of the players and the national pride." [...] The Soviets downplayed themselves, stating that they were in the series to learn.|$|E
