500|$|Roger Newcomb and Matt Richenthal, {{writing for}} {{websites}} We Love Soaps and TV Fanatic respectively, both described {{the decision to}} replace Russ with Nichols as surprising. Allison Waldman of AOL TV said the recast was [...] "bad news", as Russ was [...] "doing just fine as Tucker McCall, new billionaire in Genoa City". However, she also wrote that the role would be [...] "better suited" [...] for Nichols with Tucker becoming more of a [...] "romantic figure". Tara Blake of TVSource speculated that the character would be tied to a [...] "major Genoa City player" [...] {{and that was the}} reason for the recast. Gwen Morrett of About.com said that Nichols joining The Young and the Restless was [...] "truly their gain" [...] from Days of Our Lives (where the actor had previously portrayed Steve Johnson). Upon Nichols' debut, Megan Lynn of SoapNet wrote: [...] "Stephen certainly has soap experience — he's previously played Steve Johnson on Days of our Lives and Stefan Cassadine on General Hospital, but then again — <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> of warming up to William."

[...] In August 2010, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News wrote of Nichols' portrayal, saying: [...] "Now going into the 21st century, Stephen has reinvented another part of himself and inhabits Genoa City as the town’s newest and most handsome billionaire on CBS’s number-one daytime drama The Young and the Restless." ...|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Saltram {{made a great}} {{affair of}} her right to be {{informed}} where {{her husband had been}} the second evening he failed to meet his audience. She came to me to ascertain, but I couldn't satisfy her, for in spite of my ingenuity I remained in ignorance. It wasn't till much later that I found this had not been the case with Kent Mulville, whose hope for the best never twirled the thumbs of him more placidly than when he happened to know the worst. He had known it on the occasion I speak of--that is immediately after. He was impenetrable then, but ultimately confessed. What he confessed was more than I shall now venture to make public. It was of course familiar to me that Saltram was incapable of keeping the engagements which, after their separation, he had entered into with regard to his wife, a deeply wronged, justly resentful, quite irreproachable and insufferable person. She often appeared at my chambers to talk over his lapses; for if, as she declared, she had washed her hands of him, she had carefully preserved the water of this ablution, which she handed about for analysis. She had arts of her own of exciting one's impatience, the most infallible of which was perhaps her assumption that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> to her because we liked her. In reality her personal fall had been a sort of social rise--since I had seen the moment when, in our little conscientious circle, her desolation almost made her the fashion. Her voice was grating and her children ugly; moreover she hated the good Mulvilles, whom I more and more loved. They were the people who by doing most for her husband had in the long run done most for herself; and the warm confidence with which he had laid his length upon them was a pressure gentle compared with her stiffer persuadability. I'm bound to say he didn't criticise his benefactors, though practically he got tired of them; she, however, had the highest standards about eleemosynary forms. She offered the odd spectacle of a spirit puffed up by dependence, and indeed it had introduced her to some excellent society. She pitied me for not knowing certain people who aided her and whom she doubtless patronised in turn for their luck in not knowing me. I dare say I should have got on with her better if she had had a ray of imagination--if it had occasionally seemed to occur to her to regard Saltram's expressions of his nature in any other manner than as separate subjects of woe. They were all flowers of his character, pearls strung on an endless thread; but she had a stubborn little way of challenging them one after the other, as if she never suspected that he HAD a character, such as it was, or that deficiencies might be organic; the irritating effect of a mind incapable of a generalisation. One might doubtless have overdone the idea that there was a general licence for such a man; but if this had happened it would have been through one's feeling that there could be none for such a woman.|$|E
