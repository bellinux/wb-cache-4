40|$|A Zimbabwian {{designer}} {{has been}} testing a two-wheeled <b>winch</b> <b>tractor</b> on small farms {{for the last}} few years, with encouraging results. Small farmers in tropical regions with distinct dry and rainy seasons often experience great difficulty in field preparation. During the dry season, animal-powered tillage is usually not possible, as the animals become weak due to the shortage of green fodder and deep ploughing in dry soil usually needs a heavy tractor, which is too expensive. A small tractor incorporating a winch and anchor permits a light- weight machine to exert a high pull which can be used for deep ploughing during the dry season. Two people are required to operate a <b>winch</b> <b>tractor,</b> a driver and a plough controller. The plough is attached {{to the end of the}} winch chain which is wrapped around the winch drum on the traction unit. As the tractor driver propels his machine forward the winch chain unwinds from the drum and the plough remains at rest. When the chain is unwound from its drum the driver disengages the power from the wheels and engages it to the winch drum. The tension in the chain digs the tractor anchor into the ground and then, as the chain re winds onto its winch drum the plough is controlled by its operator as it is pulled up to the anchored tractor unit The two processes of driving the traction unit forward and then pulling the plough up to the anchored traction unit are repeated across the length of the field, until the machine is turned at the ends of the field. The area ploughed in a day is similar to when using animals and the fuel consumed is similar to that used when ploughed with a medium-sized tractor. The deep ploughing obtained from using the <b>winch</b> <b>tractor</b> permits the crop to be planted at the start of the rainy season and also encourages soil moisture conservation and plant root establishment.

40|$|A winch and a sulky can {{transform}} a farm tractor into an effective small-scale logging machine, closely resembling a wheeled cable skidder. The additional cost of these implements is very small, but they offer significant benefits when extracting timber under {{the conditions of}} small-scale forestry. The authors developed a productivity model for skidding timber with wheeled farm <b>tractors,</b> equipped with <b>winch</b> and sulky. The origin data pool contained over 300 individual skidding cycles, extracted from 8 separate tests. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} allowed calculating a simple mathematical relationship for estimating skidding productivity as a function of significant work conditions, such as: piece size, <b>winching</b> distance, <b>tractor</b> power, skidding distance and crew size. This model can provide useful directions to prospective users, contributing to operation planning, costing and optimization. It can predict {{a large proportion of the}} variability in the data and was successfully validated using reserved cycle records, extracted from the same data pool and not used for model development. Depending on tractor power and piece size, the average turn volume and productivity can exceed respectively 2 m 3 per cycle and 4 m 3 per Scheduled Machine Hour (SMH). Top performance can reach 8 m 3 SMH - 1, with heavy tractors and large logs. © 2011 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} this paper present the {{morphological}} analysis of nine different types of tractor assemblies used in forestry practice in timber forwarding from thinning operations of lowland forests. Among these tractor assemblies 4 types are older, equipped mechanical cranes. The remaining 5 tractor assemblies, manufactured more recently, are equipped with hydraulic cranes, {{and two of them}} are additionally equipped with double-drum winches. According to the research results, older tractor assemblies have very favourable morphological characteristics, according to which they are classified as ecologically acceptable vehicles for the timber forwarding from thinning operations in lowland forests. However, work technology requires from the vehicle to reach each timber assortment processed in the stand, which also means higher possibility of damage to forest soil of poor bearing strength in lowland areas. Technical design of more recent types of tractor assemblies ensures environmental suitability in timber forwarding from thinning operations. The installation of an articulated joint on the semi-trailer shaft ensures small turning diameter and hence lower risk of causing damage to standing trees. The adequate breadth of tractor assemblies is achieved by use of narrower tyres on rear tractor wheels. Installation of the forest <b>winch</b> on the <b>tractor</b> assembly causes lower soil tracking and lower damage to soil and standing trees. They also exert imaginary pressure on the soil between 2 kPa and 4 kPa and hence they are more adequate for the work on forest soils of poor bearing strength than forwarders, as the lowest imaginary pressure exerted by forwarders is around 4 kPa...|$|R

Leonard for the degree of Master of Forestry in Forest Operations presented on September 8 th. 2003 Title: Applications for Synthetic Rope in Logging Steel wire rope is used for many logging applications. This material has served the logging industry well in terms of strength, durability, and longevity. Steel wire rope is difficult to use because of properties that make it stiff, heavy, and unyielding. These same properties cause fatigue, exhaustion, and may contribute to worker injuries. Our research placed synthetic rope samples in the hands of selected loggers to try out alternatives to steel wire rope. Few studies have addressed the use of synthetic rope for logging applications. Initial trials with cooperating logging contractors showed positive ergonomics and logging productivity efficiencies. The logging industry is slow to change; so, not all of these initial trials were accepted. Designed research of synthetic rope in logging is needed to determine when synthetic rope is a suitable replacement for steel Vllfe rope. replace In our trials, we assessed static line applications (guylines, intermediate support lines, tree straps, and snap guylines) and running line applications for yarding and ground-based logging systems. Our running line applications using synthetic rope included two skidder / crawler <b>tractor</b> <b>winching</b> trials, a Boman Mark IV carriage trial, and a Koller K 300 mainline trial. Static line applications such as guylines, intermediate support lines, tree straps, and snap guylines are acceptable replacements of steel wire rope with synthetic rope. Loggers were more likely to try additional applications once they used synthetic rope as tree straps and were confident of its strength. Cost was an initial drawback for most logging contractors. Additional {{research is needed to determine}} damage, replacement, and wear criteria for synthetic rope in logging applications. Running line applications showed positive results in the skidder / crawler winching trials with faster cycle times and increased efficiencies for using synthetic rope. The Koller K 300 mainline trials also produced positive results as a running line. The Boman Mark IV internal drum carriage trial showed no significant differences between steel wire rope and synthetic rope. We believe designed research is necessary to evaluate carriage applications with synthetic rope. Future studies for static line applications should include guyline taglines, skyline taglines, haywire (rigging line) replacement, and various other applications. Putting synthetic rope into the hands of users will help identify valuable applications where synthetic rope has merit. Future studies for running lines should focus on designed trials to adequately observe the effects of synthetic rope in specific applications such as side-hill lateral yarding, uphill lateral pulling in winching trials, and other difficult logging conditions. Preliminary results show synthetic rope is a good candidate for the replacement of steel wire rope in selected logging applications. More research is needed to determine damage, replacement, and wear criteria for all applications of synthetic rope in logging...|$|R
