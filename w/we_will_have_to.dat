For water waves, this is already the case, as water waves propagate only {{on the surface of the}} water. For light, we can often neglect one dimension if the diffracting object extends in that direction over a distance far greater than the wavelength. In the case of light shining through small circular holes <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take into account the full three-dimensional nature of the problem.|$|E

Amnesty International similarly condemned the government crackdown and asked for an independent investigation into the events. Anonymous, an online hackers grouping, issued a statement condemning the crackdown and expressed its solidarity with the protesters: [...] "By interfering with the freedom to hold peaceful protests, the Bahrainian [...] government has made itself a clear enemy of its own citizens and of Anonymous.

A goal by Overmars, eleven minutes from the end gave Arsenal the win; Geoff Thomas equalised for Nottingham Forest after Petit headed in the opening goal. A goalless draw against Liverpool was followed by successive 0–0 draws, at home to Charlton Athletic and away to Chelsea. Stephen Hughes scored a last minute equaliser at Filbert Street on 12 September 1998 to deny Leicester City a win. After the match, Wenger admitted the club {{were looking for a}} new striker to replace Ian Wright, being impressed with Leicester City's goalscorer Emile Heskey: [...] "We will still be buying a striker but unfortunately Leicester do not want to sell Heskey so <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go somewhere else … I'm impressed by Heskey. Today he did very well offensively and tried like crazy; too much for me." [...] In Arsenal's next match, at home to Manchester United, goals from Tony Adams, Anelka and Freddie Ljungberg helped the champions inflict a 3–0 defeat; the result was Wenger's third consecutive win over rival manager Alex Ferguson. However, in the following match, Arsenal lost {{for the first time in}} the season, against Sheffield Wednesday. Substitute Lee Briscoe scored in the 89th minute, lobbing the ball precisely over goalkeeper Alex Manninger after Sheffield Wednesday striker Paolo Di Canio was sent off for pushing the referee.|$|E
