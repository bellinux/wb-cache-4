60|$|He bit his under lip {{as though}} he were {{somewhat}} unwilling, but arose. I opened the door, and stood on the step, while he stood in the doorway. There was the Danger-light. There was the dismal mouth of the tunnel. There were the high, <b>wet</b> <b>stone</b> walls of the cutting. There were the stars above them.|$|E
60|$|Feeling much depressed, I {{sat down}} on a <b>wet</b> <b>stone,</b> in my wet garments, and lunched off a moist biscuit, a piece of tongue, and a lump of cheese. This was consoling, as far as it went, but it did not go far. The misty clouds obliterated the mountains, the rain drizzled from the skies, percolated through the brim of my hat, trickled down my nose, and dropped upon my luncheon.|$|E

60|$|A {{breath of}} {{fragrance}} seemed to blow with her shifting senses.

60|$|He sat himself down, dripping, disconsolately, on a <b>wet</b> <b>stone.</b> What {{was to be}} done? Where was he {{to shelter}} himself? The hour of repose was approaching; the birds were seeking their nests, the bat began to flit about in the twilight, and the night-hawk soaring high in heaven, seemed to be calling out the stars. Night {{gradually}} closed in, and wrapped every thing in gloom; and though it was {{the latter part of}} summer, yet the breeze, stealing along the river, and among these dripping forests, was chilly and penetrating, especially to a half-drowned man.|$|E
60|$|Twenty minutes {{had passed}} when Thurston {{stood on the}} brink of a chasm where some {{movement}} of the earth's crust had rent the rocks asunder. Beside him was a mining engineer, whose fame for skill was greater than his reputation for integrity. Both men had donned coarse overalls, and Melhuish, the mining expert, held his candle so that its light fell upon his companion as well as upon the dripping surface of the rock. Moisture fell from the <b>wet</b> <b>stone</b> into the gloomy rift, and a faint monotonous splashing rose up from far below. Melhuish, however, was watching Thurston too intently to notice anything else. He was a middle-aged man, with a pale, puffy face and avaricious eyes. He was well-known to speculative financiers, who made much more than the shareholders of certain new mining companies.|$|E
60|$|The view, as I have said, is charming; {{but in the}} day {{you must}} keep the lattice-blinds close shut, or the sun would drive you mad; and when {{the sun goes down}} you must shut up all the windows, or the {{mosquitoes}} would tempt you to commit suicide. So {{at this time of the}} year, you don't see much of the prospect within doors. As for the flies, you don't mind them. Nor the fleas, whose size is prodigious, and whose name is Legion, and who populate the coach- house to that extent that I daily expect to see the carriage going off bodily, drawn by myriads of industrious fleas in harness. The rats are kept away, quite comfortably, by scores of lean cats, who roam about the garden for that purpose. The lizards, of course, nobody cares for; they play in the sun, and don't bite. The little scorpions are merely curious. The beetles are rather late, and have not appeared yet. The frogs are company. There is a preserve of them in the grounds of the next villa; and after nightfall, one would think that scores upon scores of women in pattens were going up and down a <b>wet</b> <b>stone</b> pavement without a moment's cessation. That is exactly the noise they make.|$|E

60|$|And so it was--an {{enormous}} eel, {{that went}} twirling round the pole in wondrous fashion until it freed itself, and, after twisting round the limbs of Olaf and Thorward, who in vain sought {{to hold it}} fast, made off over the <b>wet</b> <b>stones</b> {{as if they were}} its native element, and slid into another large pool, where it disappeared.|$|R
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour brought them to the brink of a ravine, at the bottom of which there flowed a muddy little stream. Here another halt was called, and another {{consultation}} took place. The landlord, still clinging pertinaciously to the idea of reaching the 'point,' voted for crossing the ravine, and going on round the slope of the mountain. Mr. Goodchild, to the great relief of his fellow-traveller, took another view of the case, and backed Mr. Idle's proposal to descend Carrock at once, at any hazard--the rather as the running stream was a sure guide to follow from the mountain to the valley. Accordingly, the party descended to the rugged and stony banks of the stream; and here again Thomas lost ground sadly, and fell far behind his travelling companions. Not much more than six weeks had elapsed since he had sprained one of his ankles, and he began to feel this same ankle getting rather weak when he found himself among the stones that were strewn about the running water. Goodchild and the landlord were getting farther and farther ahead of him. He saw them cross the stream and disappear round a projection on its banks. He heard them shout the moment after as a signal that they had halted and were waiting for him. Answering the shout, he mended his pace, crossed the stream where they had crossed it, and was within one step of the opposite bank, when his foot slipped on a <b>wet</b> <b>stone,</b> his weak ankle gave a twist outwards, a hot, rending, tearing pain ran through it at the same moment, and down fell the idlest of the Two Idle Apprentices, crippled in an instant.|$|E

50|$|As the {{penetrating}} power of tung oil is excellent {{and it will}} adhere to porous minerals, it is often used by stonemasons on granite or marble installed in kitchens, bathrooms, and other staining fluid environments. Applied at a 1:1 to 1:5 ratio (oil to naphtha or limonene), it gives a finish like that of <b>wet</b> <b>stone.</b> Often several thin layers are applied at a high solvent-to-oil ratio to make the coating more durable and permanent.|$|E
50|$|The family {{consists}} {{of more than}} 1300 species belonging to 44 genera.

They feed on algae, bacteria, protozoans and detritus on <b>wet</b> <b>stones</b> and plant matter.The larvae, although preferring damp habitats near water, are non-aquatic and tend to drown easily. They have a distinct labrum and well developed galea of maxillae. 9th abdominal tergum has a pair of apical, re-curved ventral hook and 2-segmented urogomphi.|$|R
5000|$|Adult wasps run on <b>wet</b> <b>stones</b> {{exposed in}} gravel stream beds, flying {{between them and}} the stream banks, also found at the margins of pools formed in sand and gravel pits. The flight period is from June to September in Britain. In the {{northern}} German lowlands there may be two generations per year. A. concinnus overwinters in the last larval stage and the males appear from the end of May. The males often break into cells to mate with newly emerged females [...]|$|R
50|$|The Lower Nahe subregion {{follows the}} Nahe past Bad Kreuznach {{north to the}} river's {{confluence}} with the Rhine at Bingen. Vineyards in the area tend to be quartzite and slate. In addition to Riesling, Scheurebe, Silvaner and Pinot blanc all have significant plantings in this area. The wines of the Lower Nahe {{tend to have more}} similarities to the wines of the Mittelrhein rather than the wines {{from other parts of the}} Nahe. This includes characteristic flavors of <b>wet</b> <b>stones</b> and minerals with citrus and stone fruit notes.|$|R
50|$|Some stone tiles such as {{polished}} granite, marble, and travertine {{are very}} slippery when <b>wet.</b> <b>Stone</b> tiles with a riven (split) surface such as slate {{or with a}} sawn and then sandblasted or honed surface will be more slip-resistant. Ceramic tiles for use in wet areas can be made more slip-resistant either by using very small tiles so that the grout lines acts as grooves or by imprinting a contour pattern onto {{the face of the}} tile.|$|E
5000|$|The Comitium {{was open}} towards the Forum. At the {{boundary}} were the monuments and statues recording political events and recognizing famous Romans. There were four sacred fig {{trees in the}} city, three of which were within the Forum. A tree planted near the Temple of Saturn was removed when its root system began undermining a valued statue. In the medio foro a fig tree stood aside an olive tree and a grape vine. Verrius Flaccus, Pliny and Tacitus state that a third tree stood in the Comitium near the statue of the augur Attus Navia who, legend says, split a <b>wet</b> <b>stone</b> with a razor in the Comitium and transferred the Ficus ruminalis or its sacred importance {{from the base of}} the Palatine hill to the assembly area. Scholars still refer to the Ficus Navia as the Ficus Ruminalis while excepting the difference. Livy reports that a statue to Publius Horatius Cocles was erected in the Comitium. There existed another grandstand within the Comitium beside the Rostra. The graecostasis was located on the northwest side of the forum. Beside the Rostra and the Graecostasis was the Columna Maenia. In 338 BC, Consul Gaius Maenius erected a column that some historians believe to be from the atrium of his home which was sold to Cato and Flaccus as mentioned by Pseudo-Asconius (Caec. 50). Pliny states that the accensus consulum announced the supremam horam, the time when the sun had moved downward from the Columna Maenia to the Carcer. This was done from the same location as the call for midday, the Curia. The column was south of the place of observation or on a line which passed from the Rostra and Graecostasis. The Tabula valeria was one of the first public works of its kind in the City. In 263 BC, consul Manius Valerius Maximus Corvinus Messalla placed a painting of his victory over Heiro and the Carthaginians in Sicily, on the side of the ancient curia. Samuel Ball Platner states in his book, The topography and monuments of ancient Rome (1911): ...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, the {{propagation}} of cracks from these defects and in this plane could be favoured due to the relatively smaller toughness of the <b>wet</b> <b>stone</b> compared to a drier one [29].

40|$|There {{is nothing}} {{stronger}} than stone, {{but it can}} be broken by the flow of time and by the flow of water, which proves to be a more reliable storage of memory than the stone. Storage is a process in time. In stone, this process relates to unchangeability of the crystalline substance, to constancy. Water, however, is always in the process of recovery and movement. Neurophysiologists {{came to the conclusion that}} memory of living organisms is embodied in recovery processes, but not in untransformable substances. The main material in these processes is water. Water running over the surface of the stone changes its visible surface pattern and reveals its hidden beauty. Besides, it provides information on the history of the formation of the world. The symbol of memory – stone, and the substrate of memory – water in the <b>wet</b> <b>stone</b> remind of the mystery and fragility of existence...|$|E
40|$|Rice slurry” {{made from}} brown rice with <b>wet</b> <b>stone</b> milling, which was {{developed}} as a new liquid food material. Raw brown rice is hard to be chewed and eaten unlike cooked rice. Therefore, “rice milk”, a beverage made from rice slurry, was developed to ingest raw brown rice. The rice particles in the rice slurry settled to the bottom when the slurry was allowed to remain for several hours. Two conditions, overly fine particles or {{an increase in the}} viscosity, suppress the sedimentation velocity of the particles. A separated milling method was established, which reduced the particle size to less than 20 μm. Moreover, the sedimentation velocity decreased exponentially with the viscosity and was steady at more 80 mPa s when the concentration of xanthan gum exceeded 0. 1 wt%. A sensory evaluation indicated a favorable rate of 55. 6 % for the rice slurry containing 0. 3 wt% xanthan gum...|$|E
60|$|The {{deer and}} the pig had tramped {{all day in}} search of {{something}} better than dried bark and withered leaves.

They curled round <b>wet</b> <b>stones,</b> and never offered to strike when the nose of a rooting pig dislodged them. The river-turtles had long ago been killed by Bagheera, cleverest of hunters, and the fish had buried themselves deep in the dry mud. Only the Peace Rock lay across the shallows like a long snake, and the little tired ripples hissed as they dried on its hot side.|$|R

Their great place of congregating is still some country smiddy, which is also their frequent meeting-place when bent on black-fishing. The flare of the black-fisher's torch still attracts salmon to their death in the rivers near Thrums; and you may hear in the glens on a dark night the rattle of the spears on the <b>wet</b> <b>stones.</b> Twenty or thirty years ago, however, the sport was much more common.

Except in the eddies and shallows, the ice had broken up, and the stream swirled by in raging flood, thick with heavy masses which it had brought down from its higher reaches. The ice crashed upon the gleaming spurs that here and there {{projected}} from the half-thawed fringe, and smashed with a harsh crackling among the boulders, and there was no doubt as to what would befall the stoutest swimmer who might attempt the passage. So far as Wyllard afterwards remembered, none of them said anything when they lay down among the <b>wet</b> <b>stones,</b> but with the first of the daylight they started up stream. The river was not a large one, and it seemed just possible that they might find a means of crossing higher up, though they afterwards admitted that this was a great deal more than they expected.|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{freshwater}} {{species are}} consumed or exploited through artisanal fisheries in the rivers {{of the islands}} of Guadeloupe, French West Indies. Autochthonous production of organic matter is limited in these flowing rivers and is mainly represented by scarce filamentous green algae and an abundant epilithic biofilm growing on <b>wet</b> <b>stones</b> in the river bed. Stable isotope {{analysis was used to}} quantify the relative importance of biofilm and other riverine allochthonous and autochthonous food sources in the diet of tropical shrimps (Palaemonidae, Atyidae and Xiphocarididae) and fishes (Gobiidae and Eleotridae) consumed by the local people. The epilithic biofilm was exploited by most species, constituted an important source of autochthonous carbon and was an important source of organic matter production at the base of freshwater food webs in Caribbean rivers. Biofilm percentages in the diet reached 32 % for molluscs, 85 % for atyid shrimps, 29 % for xiphocaridid shrimps, 14 % for palaemonid shrimps and 13 % for fish. Assessment of biofilm in nine rivers showed that blue and red cyanobacteria were quantitatively dominant with a moderately rich diatom flora. These results address the interactions between river biofilm and Caribbean freshwater fauna where trophic links between consumers and their potential resources have poorly been documented.
