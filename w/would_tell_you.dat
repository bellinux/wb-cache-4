[...] "He {{came from a}} {{management}} background, and I guess he himself <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> he was a conservative Republican and a management-oriented person.

2500|$|Rumours that Faith No More would reunite for {{shows in}} the UK {{in the summer of}} 2009 were {{circulating}} in late November 2008, but were originally dismissed by bassist Billy Gould. He explained: [...] "If anything like this were to happen, it would have to come from the band, and I haven't spoken with any of them in over a year. So as far as I know, there isn't anything to talk about, and I'm pretty sure that if you were to contact Patton, he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the same thing." ...|$|E

And I am not just speaking as a father here, though I am a pretty angry father.” ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a Muslim scholar about {{performing}} a specific action, the reply {{will be a}} fatwa explaining which of these five categories this action would fall under. So if you ask a Muslim scholar to give a fatwa about adultery, they <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that it is [...] "Not Permitted". If you ask about fasting in Ramadan, they would answer that it is [...] "Obligatory". Muslims are usually encouraged to ask for reasoning and evidence behind any fatwa, and should avoid blindly following the opinions of Muslim scholars without understanding the reasons behind them. This is because Muslims should always {{feel that they are}} practicing Islam to gain the pleasure of God, and not to gain the pleasure of acceptance of any human being.|$|E
2500|$|Various prose {{versions}} {{were published}} {{during the late}} 17th century and early 18th century in chapbook form. They follow {{the plot of the}} poem reasonably closely, though some, such as The Famous and Renowned History of Sir Bevis of Southampton (1689), also add new episodes and characters. Such books were often read by the common people, including such children as the one described by the 18th century essayist Richard Steele: [...] "He <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the mismanagement of John Hickerthrift, find fault with the passionate temper in Bevis of Southampton, and loved St. George for being the champion of England; and by this means had his thoughts insensibly moulded into the notions of discretion, virtue, and honour." [...] After the mid 18th century interest in Beves began to decline, and the printer of a 1775 reprint says the story is [...] "very little known".|$|E
2500|$|The two actual {{founders of}} the Bond party were a German man named Borckenhagen who lived in Bloemfontein, and an Afrikaner named Reitz, who {{afterwards}} became the state secretary of the Transvaal. There are two recorded interview that show the true aims of the {{founders of the}} Bond from the very beginning. One occurred between Borckenhagen and Cecil Rhodes, the other between Reitz and T. Schreiner, whose brother later became prime minister of Cape Colony. In the first interview, Borckenhagen remarked to Rhodes: [...] "We want a united Africa," [...] and Rhodes replied: [...] "So do I". Mr Borckenhagen then continued: [...] "There is nothing in the way; we will take you as our leader. There is only one small thing: we must, of course, be independent of the rest of the world." [...] Rhodes replied: [...] "You take me either for a rogue or a fool. I should be a rogue to forfeit all my history and my traditions; and I should be a fool, because I should be hated by my own countrymen and mistrusted by yours." [...] But as Rhodes said in Cape Town in 1898, [...] "the only chance of a true union is the overshadowing protection of a supreme power, and any German, Frenchman, or Russian <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that the best and most liberal power is that over which Her Majesty reigns." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 9, {{during a}} segment of Mad Money, Cramer admitted, [...] "OK, I'm a tempting target. Plenty of people come in and give their {{criticism}} on this show. But we're dealing with serious issues here; we need solutions, which I offer almost every night. I don't want ad hominem attacks. Take The New York Times columnist Frank Rich and Jon Stewart; I criticize Obama, so both of them seize on the urban legend that I recommended Bear Stearns the week before it collapsed, when I simply told an e-mailer that the deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe. 'Your money is safe in Bear Stearns,'" [...] Cramer repeated, referring to his own quote during a March 11, 2008 segment of Mad Money. Moreover, Cramer outlined, [...] "But through a clever sound bite, Stewart, and subsequently Rich—neither of whom have bothered {{to listen to the}} context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, I <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that the common stock might be worthless, but I would never tell you to pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency. Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear. The fact that I was right rankles me even more." ...|$|E
2500|$|I am sure every Englishman {{who has a}} {{heart in}} his breast {{and a feeling of}} justice in his mind, sympathizes with those unfortunate Danes (cheers), and wishes that this country could have been able to draw the sword {{successfully}} in their defence (continued cheers); but I am satisfied that those who reflect on the season of the year when that war broke out, on the means which this country could have applied for deciding in one sense that issue, I am satisfied that those who make these reflections will think that we acted wisely in not embarking in that dispute. (Cheers.) To have sent a fleet in midwinter to the Baltic every sailor <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> was an impossibility, but if it could have gone it would have been attended by no effectual result. Ships sailing on the sea cannot stop armies on land, and to have attempted to stop the progress of an army by sending a fleet to the Baltic would have been attempting to do that which {{it was not possible to}} accomplish. (Hear, hear.) If England could have sent an army, and although we all know how admirable that army is on the peace establishment, we must acknowledge that we have no means of sending out a force at all equal to cope with the 300,000 or 400,000 men whom the 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 of Germany could have pitted against us, and that such an attempt would only have insured a disgraceful discomfiture—not to the army, indeed, but to the Government which sent out an inferior force and expected it to cope successfully with a force so vastly superior. (Cheers.) ... we did not think that the Danish cause would be considered as sufficiently British, and as sufficiently bearing on the interests and the security and the honour of England, as to make it justifiable to ask the country to make those exertions which such a war would render necessary.|$|E
