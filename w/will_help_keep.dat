25|$|Physical {{activity}} is body movement that works your muscles and requires {{more energy than}} resting. According to a blog by the American Intercontinental University, college students should make time for exercise to maintain and increase motivation. AIU states that regular exercise has impeccable effects on the brain. With consistent running routines, there are more complex connections between neurons, meaning the brain is able to access its brain cells more flexibly. By performing well physically, motivation will be present in education because of how well the brain is performing. After exercising, the brain can have more desire to obtain knowledge and better retain the information. In addition, exercise can relieve stress. Exercising can ease anxiety and relieve negative effects of stress on the body. Without stress factors, individuals can perform better and more efficiently, since their minds will have a more positive outlook. This positive mood <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> students motivated and more open and willing to succeed academically. Lastly, exercise increases focus and concentration that could also help students maintain their motivation and focus on their studies. AIU claims that exercise may have improved the students' ability to participate and retain information during the class after they had exercised. Being able to retain information and being willing to participate keeps students motivated and performing well academically.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that mammalian species which invest in longer sleep times are investing in the immune system, as species with the longer sleep times have higher white blood cell counts. Mammals born with well-developed regulatory systems, such as the horse and giraffe, tend to have less REM sleep than the species which are less developed at birth, such as cats and rats. This appears to echo the greater need for REM sleep among newborns than among adults in most mammal species. Many mammals sleep for a large proportion of each 24-hour period when they are very young. The giraffe only sleeps 2 hours a day in about 5–15 minute sessions. Koalas are the longest sleeping-mammals, about 20–22 hours a day. However, killer whales and some other dolphins do not sleep during the first month of life. Instead, young dolphins and whales frequently take rests by pressing their body next to their mother’s while she swims. As the mother swims she is keeping her offspring afloat to prevent them from drowning. This allows young dolphins and whales to rest, which <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> their immune system healthy; in turn, protecting them from illnesses. During this period, mothers often sacrifice sleep for the protection of their young from predators. However, unlike other mammals, adult dolphins and whales are able to go without sleep for a month.|$|E
500|$|Abramski's first {{defense was}} that the {{misrepresentation}} was not material since his uncle was legally capable of making the purchase himself, and {{that the answer to}} the question of whether he was purchasing the gun for himself was not required to be kept on the firearms dealer's record. When reaching the Supreme Court, Abramski modified his defense and claimed that the law only cares about the person buying the gun from the dealer, not the final receiver of the gun. The Court did not agree with this interpretation and held that the law cared about the final receiver, which is properly considered the person buying the gun. Such straw arrangement, the Court held, are different from allowed transfers where a person buys a gun for himself and later decides to sell it. The court therefore found that the misrepresentation was material and also that the answer was required to be kept on the dealer's record. The Court thus held that the purchase violated 18 U.S.C. §922(a)(6), which makes it unlawful to falsify facts [...] "material to the lawfulness of the sale,” and 18 U.S.C. §924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits misrepresentation with respect to information which a is required to maintain on record. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the declaration about the ultimate recipient of the gun was not material to the sale, and that it is not included in the information that the dealer is required to keep on the records. After the ruling, proponents of gun control stated that the Court's decision <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> guns out of the hands of dangerous people, while opponents of gun control stated that the ruling is a [...] "horrible injustice".|$|E
