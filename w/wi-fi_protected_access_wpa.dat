40|$|Abstract. The fast {{growth of}} Internet {{technology}} {{has suggested that}} the next Generation Wireless Network (NGWN) will be an all-IP based integrated wireless network architecture. This evolving network will realize a great number of novel mobile network applications and innovated ubiquitous computing services. As more and more emerging interactive service developments proceed within the wireless network, the security of confidential data and individual privacy become a critical issue. Current wireless security technologies have faced potential challenges; thus they {{might not be able to}} satisfy some special requirements of NGWN. We have been devoted to a long term research project to provide solutions to meet the requirements of mobility and security for NGWN. This paper is demonstrating our first stage research accomplishment, a novel wireless security mechanism called Multi-Key Encryption (MKE) mechanism. This mechanism enhances the key management of <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>Protected</b> <b>Access</b> 2 (<b>WPA</b> 2), which has a strong robustness and the similar computation overhead. Through the formal proof and experimentation result, we can show that our mechanism is effective and able to provide necessary security.

40|$|A {{wireless}} router is a networking device that enables a user {{to set up}} a wireless connection to the Internet. A router can offer a secure channel by cryptographicmeans which provides authenticity and confidentiality. Nowa-days, almost all routers use a secure channel by default that is based on <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>Protected</b> <b>Access</b> II (<b>WPA</b> 2). This is a security protocol which is believed not to be sus-ceptible to practical key recovery attacks. However, the passwords should have sufficient entropy to avert brute-force attacks. In this paper, we compose a strategy on how to reverse-engineer embedded routers. Furthermore, we de-scribe a procedure that can instantly gather a complete wireless authentication trace which enables an offline password recovery attack. Finally, we present a number of use cases where we identify extremely weak password generating algorithms in various routers which are mas-sively deployed in The Netherlands. The algorithms are used to generate the default WPA 2 password. Such a password is loaded during device ini-tialization and hardware reset. Users that did not explic-itly change their wireless password are most likely vul-nerable to practical attacks which can recover their pass-word within minutes. A stolen password allows an ad-versary to abuse someone else’s internet connection, for instance compromising the firewall, making a fraudulent transaction or performing other criminal activities. Together with the Dutch National Cyber Security Cen-tre we have initiated a responsible disclosure procedure. However, since these routers are also used by many other companies in various countries, our findings seem to re-late an international industry wide security issue. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Wi-Fi network {{offers an}} {{inexpensive}} and convenient way {{to access the}} Internet. It becomes even more important nowadays as we are moving from the traditional computer age to the current mobile devices and Internet-of-Things age. <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>Protected</b> <b>Access</b> II (<b>WPA</b> 2) - Pre-shared key (PSK) is the current security standard used to protect small 802. 11 wireless networks. Most of the available dictionary password-guessing attacks on WPA 2 -PSK are based on capturing the four-way handshaking frames between an authorized wireless client and the Access Point (AP). These attacks will fail if an attacker is unable to capture the four-way handshaking frames of a legitimate client. An attacker also can apply an active dictionary attack by sending a pass-phrase to the AP {{and waiting for the}} response. However, this attack approach could only achieve a low attack intensity of testing a few pass-phrases per minute. In this paper, we develop a new scheme to speed up the active pass-phrase guessing trials intensity based on two novel ideas: First, the scheme mimics multiple Wi-Fi clients connecting to the AP at the same time—each emulated Wi-Fi client has its own spoofed MAC address; Second, each emulated Wi-Fi client could try many pass-phrases using a single wireless session without the need to pass the 802. 11 authentication and association stages for every pass-phrase guess. We have developed a working prototype and our experiments show that the proposed scheme can improve active dictionary pass-phrase guessing speed by 100 -fold compared to the traditional single client attack.

50|$|Wireless {{security}} is {{the prevention of}} unauthorized access or damage to computers using wireless networks.

WPA2 uses an encryption device that encrypts the network with a 256-bit key; the longer key length improves security over WEP.|$|E
