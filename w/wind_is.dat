5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants point to the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing. The barbs in the figure at the right are located at the Northern Hemisphere, because the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> circling counter clock-wise around a low-pressure area at the Northern Hemisphere (the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> blowing in the opposite direction at the Southern Hemisphere, see also Buys Ballot's law).|$|E
5|$|The solar <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> quite {{different}} from a terrestrial wind, in that its origin is the sun, and it is composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere. Similar to the solar wind, the planetary <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> composed of light gases that escape planetary atmospheres. Over long periods of time, the planetary wind can radically change the composition of planetary atmospheres.|$|E
50|$|<b>Winds</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{light to}} moderate with some strengthening in force {{during the summer}} and monsoon seasons. During the southwest monsoon season, <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> mainly south-westerly to westerly. In the post-monsoon season, <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> light and variable. In the winter and summer seasons, <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> mostly from directions between southwest and northwest.|$|R

5|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>is</b> {{the flow}} of gases on a large scale. On {{the surface of the}} Earth, wind {{consists}} of the bulk movement of air. In outer space, solar <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while planetary <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspects, an important one being its velocity (wind speed); another the density of the gas involved; another its energy content or wind energy.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon winds usually {{die down}} in the evening, {{prompting}} behavioral modifications in the herd. The deer avoid the dry wind by being more active at night when the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> not blowing. In 1991 there was a three-year average of 420 mule deer.|$|E
5|$|Like {{much of the}} British Isles, Coatbridge {{experiences}} a temperate maritime climate with relatively cool summers and mild winters. The prevailing <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> from the west. Regular but generally light precipitation occurs throughout the year.|$|E
50|$|<b>Winds</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{light to}} moderate with some strengthening in force {{during the summer}} and monsoon seasons. During the southwest monsoon season, <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> mainly south-westerly to westerly. In the post-monsoon season <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> light and variable in directions in the mornings and north-easterly to easterly in the afternoon. In the winter and summer seasons <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> mostly from directions between south-west and north-west, with northerly or north-easterly winds blowing on some afternoons.|$|R
30|$|With the {{development}} of <b>wind</b> energy, it <b>is</b> necessary to develop equivalent models to represent dynamic behaviors of wind farms in power systems. The equivalent <b>wind</b> method <b>is</b> investigated for the aggregation of doubly-fed induction generator wind turbines. The detailed procedures for the calculation of equivalent <b>wind</b> <b>are</b> analyzed. The necessity of classifying incoming <b>winds</b> <b>is</b> shown. To improve the performances of the method, incoming <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> classified according to mean wind speeds and positive/negative semi-variances of wind speeds, {{and a group of}} turbines with similar incoming <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> aggregated together. The effectiveness of the method is verified through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.|$|R
50|$|Gap <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> {{low-level}} <b>winds</b> and can <b>be</b> {{associated with}} strong winds of 20-40 knots and on occasion exceeding 50 knots. Gap <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> generally strongest close to gap exit.|$|R
5|$|The wind enables this moderating effect. The {{windward}} {{side of a}} land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear {{on the east coast}} on parallels with mild climates {{on the other side of}} the ocean. In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.|$|E
5|$|Wind farms {{consist of}} many {{individual}} wind turbines which {{are connected to}} the electric power transmission network. Onshore <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. Offshore <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations.|$|E
5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, {{a process known as}} saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as a sand blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E
30|$|Horizontal <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> {{estimated}} from radial winds {{measured from}} the six beam directions. The <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> calculated at the range resolution of 150  m {{and at the}} height sampling of the vertical beam. The vertical shear of horizontal <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> then estimated using a two-point symmetric quotient scheme.|$|R

50|$|During the monsoon, the sky {{is heavily}} clouded, and <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> strong during this period. <b>Winds</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} light during the post-monsoon and winter months.|$|R
5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> not strong enough to oppose it.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field stops its atmosphere from being stripped {{away by the}} solar wind. Venus and Mars do not have {{magnetic field}}s, {{and as a result}} the solar <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space. Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material {{from the surface of the}} Sun. The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{winds are}} strongest {{immediately}} under the tropopause (except locally, during tornadoes, tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference {{caused by the}} density difference (which ultimately causes <b>wind)</b> <b>is</b> highest within the transition zone. The wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area, but is deflected by the Coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the core}} <b>is</b> round, the <b>winding</b> <b>is</b> less secure and may rotate freely around the core, {{especially}} if the <b>winding</b> <b>is</b> damaged after use.|$|R
30|$|In {{simulation}}s, {{the train}} speeds are 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400  km/h. The mean <b>wind</b> speeds <b>are</b> 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30  m/s. The simulation time of fluctuating <b>winds</b> <b>is</b> 600  s, and the fluctuating <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> generated every 0.05  s.|$|R
30|$|Climatological {{results of}} the wind fields over Koto Tabang from an earlier EAR dataset {{indicate}} that the meridional <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> normally weak, while the zonal winds sometimes exceed about 30  m s− 1. In particular, both zonal and meridional <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> weak in April; then, the vertical beam could capture the RASS echo in the entire troposphere. On the other hand, zonal <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> stronger in October–December. Throughout the year, the zonal <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> westward at 10 – 14  km, so the antenna beam was mostly steered toward the east for the RASS experiment.|$|R
5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly when the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> blowing towards the animals, indicating {{the sense of}} smell {{is more important than}} sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E
5|$|Special unpitched stops {{also appear}} in some organs. Among {{these are the}} Zimbelstern (a wheel of {{rotating}} bells), the nightingale (a pipe submerged in a small pool of water, creating {{the sound of a}} bird warbling when <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> admitted), and the effet d'orage ("thunder effect", a device that sounds the lowest bass pipes simultaneously). Standard orchestral percussion instruments such as the drum, chimes, celesta, and harp have also been imitated in organ building.|$|E
5|$|The corona is {{the next}} layer of the Sun. The low corona, near {{the surface of the}} Sun, has a {{particle}} density around 1015m−3 to 1016m−3. The average temperature of the corona and solar <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000–20,000,000 K. Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the strongest}} <b>winds</b> {{reported}} <b>were</b> at Lamap (Malakula Island), where hurricane-force <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> recorded between 3 and 5 p.m. that day. Gale force <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> also reported {{for a time}} from Aneityum. It is estimated from the meteorological information available, sustained winds during between 75 and 80 knots.|$|R
40|$|ALASKA The remarkably high {{frequency}} of strong surface winds {{in the region}} of Big Delta, Alaska, is studied with respect to its cause, characteristics, and local effects. During the winter, the <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> predominantly east-southeast and, unlike glacier or valley <b>winds,</b> <b>are</b> caused by a topographically induced convergence of the flow of air down the Tanana Valley which occurs at times of southeast gradient winds aloft. Strong south <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> also experienced the year round. A noteworthy characteristic of the east-southeast <b>winds</b> <b>is</b> their persistence; an extreme case is described in which gusts in excess of 40 m. p. h. endured for 7 % days (January 20 - 28, 1952). Another characteristic of these <b>winds</b> <b>is</b> the marked diurnal variation in the frequency of their commencement, by which a strong control by atmospheric tides is inferred. An important effect of the <b>winds</b> <b>is</b> to interrupt periods of very low temperature, but sometimes to create severe “wind chill. ” The paper concludes with a brief account of the forecast problem. 1...|$|R

5|$|Typically, {{conventional}} hydroelectricity complements {{wind power}} very well. When the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided {{they have the}} generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>is</b> another {{resource}} that Wales has in abundance. The Gwynt y Môr {{is one of}} several offshore wind farms off the coast of North Wales and Anglesey, and is the second largest such wind farm in the world. Other wind farms are found on inland, mostly upland sites, but there are none in the Snowdonia and Brecon Beacons national parks.|$|E
5|$|Wind power {{capacity}} has expanded rapidly to 336 GW in June 2014, and {{wind energy production}} was around 4% of total worldwide electric power usage, and growing rapidly. The actual amount of electric power that <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> able to generate is calculated by multiplying the nameplate capacity by the capacity factor, which varies according to equipment and location.
