2500|$|Energy {{conversion}} efficiency {{is measured by}} dividing the electrical output by the incident light power. Factors influencing output include spectral distribution, spatial distribution of power, temperature, and resistive load.

5000|$|For example: in Thailand it is 3.43, in EU {{countries}} it is 2.93, etc. This {{factor is}} used in calculation of [...] "Total <b>Watt-Peak</b> Rating" [...] while designing the size of solar photovoltaic cells. Therefore, [...] "Total <b>Watt-Peak</b> Rating" [...] = [...] "Total Watt-hours per day needed/generated from the PV modules" [...] divided by [...] "PGF"."Total Watt-Hours per Day" [...] = [...] "Total Watt-hours per day needed by appliances" [...] Multiplied by [...] "1.3 times" [...] (the energy lost in the system).Now, to calculate [...] "size of PV cells" [...] OR [...] "number of PV cells" [...] just divide the above obtained [...] "Total <b>Watt-Peak</b> Rating" [...] by [...] "Watt-Peak of each cell OR <b>Watt-Peak</b> of each square meter size", whichever is convenient.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{characteristics}} include {{nominal power}} (PMAX, measured in W), {{open circuit voltage}} (VOC), short circuit current (ISC, measured in amperes), maximum power voltage (VMPP), maximum power current (IMPP), peak power, (<b>watt-peak,</b> Wp), and module efficiency (%).|$|E
50|$|Most {{countries}} {{refer to}} installed nominal nameplate capacity of PV systems and panels by counting DC power in <b>watt-peak,</b> denoted as Wp, or sometimes WDC, as do most manufacturers and organizations of the photovoltaic industry, such as SEIA, SPE or the IEA-PVPS.|$|E
50|$|In addition, TEL Solar {{claimed to}} be the only {{supplier}} of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) technology with haze on demand. This proprietary effect is seen to enable the trapping of light in the photovoltaic thin-film, maximizing conversion efficiency, thus directly enhancing the performance of its solar module and reducing its cost per <b>watt-peak.</b>|$|E
50|$|Deployment {{figures on}} a global, {{regional}} and nationwide scale are well documented {{since the early}} 1990s. While worldwide photovoltaic capacity grew continuously, deployment figures by country were much more dynamic, as they depended strongly on national policies. A number of organizations release comprehensive reports on PV deployment on a yearly basis. They include annual and cumulative deployed PV capacity, typically given in <b>watt-peak,</b> a break-down by markets, as well as in-depth analysis and forecasts about future trends.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>watt-peak</b> is a {{convenient}} measure, {{and is the}} standardized number in the photovoltaic industry on which prices, sales and growth numbers are based, it is arguably {{not the most important}} number for actual performance. Since a solar panel's job is to generate electric power at minimal cost, the amount of power that it generates under real-life conditions in relation to its cost should be the most important number to evaluate. This [...] "cost-per-watt" [...] measure is widely used in the industry.|$|E
50|$|As {{of the end}} of 2014, {{solar power}} in Austria {{amounted}} to 766 megawatt (MW) of cumulative photovoltaic (PV) capacity, of which more than three quarters were installed within the last three years. Solar PV generated 766 gigawatt-hours, or about 1.4% of the country's final electricity consumption. As with most other European countries, 99.5 percent of all solar power systems are connected to the electrical grid. The nation's installed PV capacity by inhabitant (<b>watt-peak</b> per capita) stood at 91 watts, still below the European Union's 2014-average of 172 watts.|$|E
50|$|For non-dispatchable power, {{particularly}} renewable energy, {{nameplate capacity}} refers to generation under ideal conditions. Output is generally limited by weather conditions, hydroelectric dam water levels, tidal variations and other outside forces. Equipment failures and maintenance usually contribute less to capacity factor reduction than the innate {{variation of the}} power source.In photovoltaics, capacity is rated under Standard Test Conditions usually expressed in the non-SI compliant unit <b>watt-peak</b> (Wp). In addition, a PV system's nameplate capacity is sometimes denoted by a subindex, for example, MWDC or MWAC, in order to clarify, whether the raw DC or already converted AC power output is referred to.|$|E
50|$|Systems using high-concentration {{photovoltaics}} (HCPV) especially {{have the}} potential to become competitive in the near future. They possess the highest efficiency of all existing PV technologies, and a smaller photovoltaic array also reduces the balance of system costs. Currently, CPV is not used in the PV rooftop segment and is far less common than conventional PV systems. For regions with a high annual direct normal irradiance of 2000 kilowatt-hour (kWh) per square meter or more, the levelized cost of electricity is in the range of $0.08-$0.15 per kWh and installation cost for a 10-megawatt CPV power plant was identified to lie between €1.40-€2.20 (~$1.50-$2.30) per <b>watt-peak</b> (Wp).|$|E

50|$|It {{can happen}} that a panel from brand A and {{a panel of}} brand B give exactly the same <b>watt-peak</b> in {{laboratory}} test, but their power output is different in a real installation. This difference {{can be caused by}} different degradation rates at higher temperatures. At the same time, though brand A can be less productive than brand B it may as well cost less, thus it has a potential of becoming financially advantageous. An alternative scenario can also be true: a more expensive panel may produce so much more power that it will outperform a cheaper panel financially. An accurate analysis of long-term performance versus cost, both initial and on-going, is required to determine which panel may lead the owner to better financial results.|$|E
50|$|However, in {{some places}} of the world, a system's rated {{capacity}} is given after the power output has been converted to AC. These places include Canada, Japan (since 2012), Spain, and {{some parts of the}} United States. AC instead of DC is also given for most utility-scale PV power plants using CdTe-technology. The major difference lies in the small percentage (about 5%, according to the IEA-PVPS) of energy lost during the DC-AC conversion. In addition, some grid regulations may limit the output of a PV system to as little as 70% of its nominal DC power (Germany). In such cases, the difference between nominal peak-power and converted AC output can therefore amount to as much as 30%. Because of these two different metrics, international organizations need to reconvert official domestic figures from the above mentioned countries back to the raw DC output, in order to report coherent global PV-deployment in <b>watt-peak.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The International Bureau of Weights and Measures, which {{maintains}} the SI-standard, {{states that the}} physical unit and its symbol {{should not be used}} to provide specific information about a given physical quantity and that neither should be the sole source of information on a quantity. Nonetheless, colloquial English sometimes conflates the quantity power and its unit by using the non-SI unit <b>watt-peak</b> and the non-SI symbol Wp prefixed as within the SI, e.g. kilowatt-peak (kWp), megawatt-peak (MWp), etc. As such a photovoltaic installation may for example be described as having [...] "one kilowatt-peak" [...] in the meaning [...] "one kilowatt of peak power". Similarly outside the SI, the peak power is sometimes written as [...] "P = 1 kWp" [...] as opposed to [...] "Ppeak = 1 kW". In the context of domestic PV installations, the kilowatt (kW) is the most common unit for peak power, sometimes stated as kWp.|$|E

50|$|The smallest, often {{portable}} {{photovoltaic systems}} are called pico solar PV systems, or pico solar. They mostly combine a rechargeable battery and charge controller, {{with a very}} small PV panel. The panel's nominal capacity {{is just a few}} <b>watt-peak</b> (1-10 Wp) and its area less than a tenth of a square meter, or one square foot, in size. A large range of different applications can be solar powered such as music players, fans, portable lamps, security lights, solar lighting kits, solar lanterns and street light (see below), phone chargers, radios, or even small, seven-inch LCD televisions, that run on less than ten watts. As it is the case for power generation from pico hydro, pico PV systems are useful in small, rural communities that require only a small amount of electricity. Since the efficiency of many appliances have improved considerably, in particular due to the usage of LED lights and efficient rechargeable batteries, pico solar has become an affordable alternative, especially in the developing world. The metric prefix pico- stands for a trillionth to indicate the smallness of the system's electric power.|$|E
50|$|The EPBT {{has always}} been longer for PV systems using {{crystalline}} silicon than thin-film technology. This {{is due to the}} fact, that silicon is produced by the reduction of high-grade quartz sand in electric furnaces. This carbo-thermic smelting process occurs at high temperatures of more than 1000 °C and is very energy intensive, using about 11 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per produced kilogram of silicon. However, the energy payback time has shortened significantly over the last years, as crystalline silicon cells became ever more efficient in converting sunlight, while the thickness of the wafer material was constantly reduced and therefore required less silicon for its manufacture. Within the last ten years, the amount of silicon used for solar cells declined from 16 to 6 grams per <b>watt-peak.</b> In the same period, the thickness of a c-Si wafer was reduced from 300 µm, or microns, to about 160-190 µm. Crystalline silicon wafers are nowadays only 40 percent as thick {{as they used to be}} in 1990, when they were around 400 µm. The sawing techniques that slice crystalline silicon ingots into wafers have also improved by reducing the kerf loss and making it easier to recycle the silicon sawdust.|$|E
40|$|The use of polymer {{materials}} for photovoltaic applications {{is expected to}} have several advantages over current crystalline silicon technology. In this paper, we perform an environmental and economic assessment of polymer-based thin film modules with a glass substrate and modules with a flexible substrate and we compare our results with literature data for multicrystalline (mc-) silicon photovoltaics and other types of PV. The functional unit of this study is ‘ 25 years of electricity production by PV systems with a power of 1 <b>watt-peak</b> (Wp) ’. Because the lifetime of polymer photovoltaics is at present much lower than of mc-silicon photovoltaics, we first compared the PV cells per <b>watt-peak</b> and next determined the minimum required lifetime of polymer PV to arrive at the same environmental impacts as mc-silicon PV. We found that per <b>watt-peak</b> of output power, the environmental impacts compared to mc-silicon are 20 – 60 % lower for polymer PV systems with glass substrate and 80 – 95 % lower for polymer PV with PET as substrate (flexible modules). Also in comparison with thin film CuInSe and thin film silicon, the impacts of polymer modules, per <b>watt-peak,</b> appeared to be lower. The costs per <b>watt-peak</b> of polymer PV modules with glass substrate are approximately 20 % higher compared to mc-silicon photovoltaics. However, taking into account uncertainties, this might be an overestimation. For flexible modules, no cost data were available. If the efficiency and lifetime of polymer PV modules increases, both glass-based and flexible polymer PV could become an environment friendly and cheap alternative to mc-silicon P...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{and small}} form factor cells have been {{researched}} lately by several research groups around the world due to possible lower assembly costs and reduced material consumption with higher efficiencies. Given the popularity of these devices, {{it is important to}} have detailed information about the behavior of these devices. Simulation of fabrication processes and device performance reveals some of the advantages and behavior of solar cells that are thin and small. Three main effects were studied: the effect of surface recombination on the optimum thickness, efficiency, and current density, the effect of contact distance on the efficiency for thin cells, and lastly the effect of surface recombination on the grams per <b>Watt-peak.</b> Results show that high efficiency can be obtained in thin devices if they are well-passivated and the distance between contacts is short. Furthermore, the ratio of grams per <b>Watt-peak</b> is greatly reduced as the device is thinned...|$|E

40|$|If a {{photovoltaic}} (PV) {{technology is}} assessed {{today in a}} technical framework, then efficiency is the most commonly addressed parameter, followed by service lifetime. Cost, as the third parameter of the "magic triangle", is even less often reported. However, if a new technology is prepared to enter a market, other important parameters have to be considered, especially if non-standard PV applications are targeted. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) is a well known but young PV technology of the so called third generation, which offers unique advantages for integrated products such as building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). In this contribution {{we would like to}} highlight some of the advantages and challenges which are specific to the application of OPV in the field of building integration. Architectural design features of OPV include the ability to adapt semi-transparency, color and shape of the module. Moreover, glass-laminated OPV modules are deemed suitable for BIPV because of their ease of integration, good fire resistance, high energy harvest per nominal <b>watt-peak</b> and long lifetimes...|$|E
30|$|Silicon {{solar cells}} {{contribute}} {{by far the}} largest share to the world's photovoltaic facilities [1]. An important property to classify these silicon solar cells is the base material, where two fundamentally different approaches can be observed in the photovoltaic industry: multicrystalline and monocrystalline cells. While the fabrication of monocrystalline silicon is more expensive, the efficiency potential of these cells is higher. The world record efficiency for monocrystalline silicon solar cells is 25.0 % [2] and 20.4 % for multicrystalline silicon [3]. As different as these base materials are as different as the arising challenges in the industrial production: To realize the efficiency potential and to lower the price per <b>Watt-peak</b> of monocrystalline cells, sophisticated cell structures with doping microstructures including selective emitters, laser fired back surface fields [4], and backside contacts have been introduced and are partly already adopted in the industrial production. For multicrystalline silicon, the photovoltaic industry tries either to use less pure and cheaper silicon ("upgraded metallurgical grade silicon") and to improve this material during the solar cell process by high temperature and gettering steps, to reduce the costs, or to use multicrystalline material with low defect densities to increase the efficiency potential. From these strategies, two important fields of microscopic research emerge: the detailed characterization and improvement of doping microstructures and the research on microdefects, which limit the performance of multicrystalline cells. Both fields require the development and application of electrical characterization techniques which provide a high spatial resolution of at least 1 μm.|$|E
40|$|New {{generation}} photovoltaic (PV) {{devices such}} as polymer and dye sensitized solar cells (DSC) have now reached a more mature stage of development, and among their various applications, building integrated PVs {{seems to have the}} most promising future, especially for DSC devices. This new generation technology has attracted an increasing interest because of its low cost due to the use of cheap printable materials and simple manufacturing techniques, easy production, and relatively high efficiency. As for the more consolidated PV technologies, DSCs need to be tested in real operating conditions and their performance compared with other PV technologies to put into evidence the real potential. This work presents the results of a 3 [*]months outdoor monitoring activity performed on a DSC mini-panel made by the Dyepower Consortium, positioned on a south oriented vertical plane together with a double junction amorphous silicon (a-Si) device and a multi-crystalline silicon (m-Si) device at the ESTER station of the University of Rome Tor Vergata. Good performance of the DSC mini-panel has been observed for this particular configuration, where the DSC energy production compares favorably with that of a-Si and m-Si especially at high solar angles of incidence confirming the suitability of this technology for the integration into building facades. This assumption is confirmed by the energy produced per nominal <b>watt-peak</b> {{for the duration of the}} measurement campaign by the DSC that is 12 % higher than that by a-Si and only 3 % lower than that by m-Si for these operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractResearch and {{development}} of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells has seen a marked increase since the recent expiry of core patents describing SHJ technology. SHJ solar cells are expected to offer various cost benefits compared to conventional crystalline silicon solar cells. This paper analyses the production costs associated with five different SHJ cell designs, including an interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) design. Using life-cycle costing, we analyzed the current cost breakdown of these SHJ designs, and compared them to conventional diffused junction monocrystalline silicon modules. Coupling the results for current designs with literature data on technological improvements, we also present a prospective analysis of production costs for the five SHJ cells and modules. For current designs, module costs were calculated to be 0. 48 – 0. 56 USD per <b>Watt-peak</b> (Wp) for SHJ modules, compared to 0. 50 USD/Wp for a conventional c-Si module. The efficiency bonus for SHJ modules compared to conventional c-Si modules is offset by a strong increase in metallization costs for SHJ designs, as comparatively large amounts of low-temperature silver-paste are required. For module materials, the requirement for conductive adhesives results in a small cost penalty for SHJ modules compared to c-Si modules, {{which is more than}} balanced by the effect of higher efficiency in SHJ modules. Our prospective study showed that improvements in cell processing and module design could result in a significant drop in production costs for all module types studied. The SHJ modules gain much advantage by reducing and replacing silver consumption, increased cell efficiency and thinner wafers and have prospective production costs of 0. 29 – 0. 35 USD/Wp. Conventional c-Si module cost is less sensitive to silver paste consumption, limiting the potential for cost reduction, and has prospective production costs of 0. 33 USD/Wp. Replacement of indium-tin-oxide was not found to contribute substantially to a reduction in module costs...|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{research}} and technological innovation have brought major progress to mankind. However, {{the scale of}} human activities is enormous and exceeds {{the capacity of the}} environment to cope with the resulting impacts. Large environmental problems are a consequence. In order to evaluate potential harmful effects of technologies and products, they have to be systematically assessed, referred to as ‘technology assessment’. It is crucial that new materials and technologies are evaluated before they have entered the market, allowing measures to be taken if adverse effects appear. For novel technologies, the focus should therefore be ‘ex-ante’ (i. e. future-oriented). This thesis evaluates two new technologies, i. e. nanotechnology and white biotechnology. More specifically, it examines polymer nanocomposites, polymer photovoltaics and three chemicals produced with white biotechnology, i. e. polytrimethylene terephthalate, polyhydroxyalkanoates and ethanol. These technologies have been evaluated using a methodology referred to as ‘life cycle engineering (LCE) ’. LCE comprises an environmental and an economic assessment and takes into account the entire life cycle from cradle (i. e. raw materials extraction) to grave (i. e. waste management). Since for laboratory stage technologies industrial process data are often not readily available, this thesis has also contributed to assessing industrial data from laboratory data to represent large scale industrial practice. Twenty-three different nanocomposites have been studied based on thermoplastic and thermosetting polymer matrices and organophillic montmorillonite, silica, carbon nanotubes (singlewalled and multiwalled) and calcium carbonate as filler. It appeared that for seventeen nanocomposites the environmental impacts expressed per kilogram decreased with increasing filler content. The conclusion is drawn that reinforcing polymers with nanoobject can have environmental benefits. An economic assessment has been conducted for a polypropylene- organophillic montmorillonite nanocomposite for different applications. It appeared that at a maximum price of € 5000 /tonne there are economic advantages of this type of nanocomposite for all studied applications compared to conventional materials. A concern of this technology however are the nanoobjects. If they are released from the polymer matrix they can be very toxic to humans. Therefore, exposure should always be avoided. A desktop study in this thesis showed that there are possibly risks that nanoobjects are not safely removed when nanocomposites are incinerated in municipal solid waste incinerators. Further research is required. Polymer photovoltaics (PV) are a promising new type of renewable energy. It appeared that the environmental impacts per <b>watt-peak</b> compared to mc-silicon PV are considerably lower. The costs are approximately 20 % higher. The main challenge of this technology, however, is to increase the lifetime of the solar cells. A risk assessment has been conducted for chemicals produced with white biotechnology compared to petrochemical production taking into account risks to human health. Our results showed that risks are lower for biobased production. However, there are considerable uncertainties. Further research is required. Regarding methodological issues, it appeared that realistic data representing industrial practice can be obtained by using the material indices developed by Ashby and by combining laboratory data for material and energy use with data of industrial equipmen...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the price per <b>watt-peak</b> for {{photovoltaic}} modules are decreasing rapidly, there is a large population of people which have still not implemented photovoltaic technology in their everyday lives. An important reason why PV is still not the main source of electrical energy for these people is the uncertainty that comes with installing a PV system on the roof of a house. Consumers are afraid that an investment in a PV system will cost them too much money, while it {{will take a long time}} before their investment is paid back for. Therefore, it is important to accurately estimate the energy yield of PV systems before installation. By doing so, consumers will be more likely to see the benefits of a PV system, thus implementing the technology on their houses. This thesis aims to improve the accuracy of the annual energy yield estimation using LiDAR data and a new model for the albedo component of irradiance. LiDAR has been used to determine the irradiance on a surface previously, however, this thesis uses LiDAR data in the Unity 3 D game engine, which enables the user to apply changes and build on the environment rapidly. This eliminates the disadvan- tage of LiDAR data, which is often outdated, thus missing crucial objects surrounding the location of the potential PV system. Ray-casting is used extensively to determine the sky view factor, view factor, shading factor and to determine the surfaces visible to the PV module. Being able to determine the sky view factor without doing any field work greatly reduces the time required to design a PV system. The albedo component is often neglected entirely when estimating the irradiation on a surface, while it may significantly contribute to the energy yield, reaching up to 10 % of the total. The albedo com- ponent is mainly important for highly tilted PV modules or BIPV. The albedo component is also crucial for bifacial PV modules. Measurements have shown that the albedo of a material is not determined easily using a sample of the material along with two inversely installed pyranometers making up an albedometer. It has been found that the albedometer is only able to determine the specific albedo of a location for the weather condition and the time in which the measurement has been done. Extensive research has been done in order to determine the factors which have an influence on the albedo of a location. The spectral reflectivity of materials is expected to play an important role in finding a final model which describes the albedo factor accurately. In order to estimate the irradiance due to reflectance, first the irradiance on the surfaces that are visible to the PV module are estimated one by one along with the view factor of each of the visible surfaces to the PV module in question. Finally using the reflectivity of the material of each surface, the contribution of each surface to the irradiance on the PV module as a result of reflectance is summed up resulting in the albedo component of the irradiance. The same method is used for the back side of the PV module to determine the irradiance on the back side of a bifacial PV module. This research aims to play an important part in the automation of PV system design, striving to com- pletely eliminate necessary field work, while improving the accuracy of the predicted annual energy yield.
