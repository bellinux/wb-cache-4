25|$|Particulate {{scrubbers}} <b>Wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> {{is a form}} {{of pollution}} control technology. The term describes a variety of devices that use pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from other gas streams. In a <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber,</b> the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid, by forcing it through a pool of liquid, or by some other contact method, so as to remove the pollutants.|$|E
25|$|Many coal-firing power {{stations}} use flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% {{or more of}} the SO2 in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> which is commonly used. A <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral calcium sulfate that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> {{are used}} {{in a range of}} {{industries}} for exhaust gas cleaning and are the Australian sugar industry’s most effective means of removing dust from boiler flue gas, being responsible for significantly reducing its environmental footprint. In virtually all cases, the collection efficiency of <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> is high enough for boilers with them installed to comfortably comply with the dust emission limits set by environmental authorities. However, <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> often cause boiler operational problems such as excessive vibration, deposit build-up and wear of boiler induced draft fans due to water droplet carryover and reduced boiler steam output due to blockages in and/or around the scrubber. In some cases, blockages become so severe that a boiler has to be taken off line for scrubber cleaning. Sugar milling operations are adversely affected by the reduced throughput and/or factory stoppages caused by these problems. This paper describes modelling and experimental investigations carried out as part of a project that aims to improve the design and operation of the tangential entry fixed vane <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> that are widely used in the Australian sugar industry...|$|R

5000|$|The {{recovery}} process used in magnesium-based sulfite pulping the [...] "Magnefite" [...] process is well developed. [...] The concentrated brown liquor is burned in a recovery boiler, producing magnesium oxide and sulfur dioxide, {{both of which}} are recovered from the flue gases. Magnesium oxide is recovered in a <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> to give a slurry of magnesium hydroxide.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber,</b> or venturi scrubber, {{is similar}} to a cyclone but it has an orifice unit that sprays water into the vortex in the cyclone section, {{collecting}} all of the dust in a slurry system. The water media can be recirculated and reused to continue to filter the air. Eventually the solids must be removed from the water stream and disposed of.|$|E
50|$|If the {{gas stream}} {{contains}} both particulate matter and gases, <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> are generally the only single {{air pollution control}} device that can remove both pollutants. <b>Wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> can achieve high removal efficiencies for either particles or gases and, in some instances, can achieve a high removal efficiency for both pollutants in the same system. However, in many cases, the best operating conditions for particles collection are the poorest for gas removal.|$|R
30|$|The {{conventional}} {{air treatment}} systems include; precipitators, cyclones, <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers,</b> fiber filters, ceramic filters {{and so on}} [1, 2, 3, 4].|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> or any air {{pollution}} control device depends on the industrial process conditions {{and the nature of}} the air pollutants involved. Inlet gas characteristics and dust properties (if particles are present) are of primary importance. Scrubbers can be designed to collect particulate matter and/or gaseous pollutants. The versatility of <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> allow them to be built in numerous configurations, all designed to provide good contact between the liquid and polluted gas stream.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{the dust}} is collected. This is done via {{a variety of}} means, {{depending}} on the application and the dust being handled. It {{can be as simple}} as a basic pass-through filter, a cyclonic separator, or an impingement baffle. It can also be as complex as an electrostatic precipitator, a multistage baghouse, or a chemically treated <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> or stripping tower.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} parameter in {{wet scrubbing}} systems is {{the rate of}} liquid flow. It is common in <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> terminology to express the liquid flow {{as a function of}} the gas flow rate that is being treated. This is commonly called the liquid-to-gas ratio (L/G ratio) and uses the units of gallons per 1,000 actual cubic feet or liters/cubic meter (l/m³).|$|E
50|$|The {{exhaust gases}} of {{combustion}} may contain substances considered {{harmful to the}} environment, and the scrubber may remove or neutralize those. A <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> is used for cleaning air, fuel gas or other gases of various pollutants and dust particles. Wet scrubbing works via the contact of target compounds or particulate matter with the scrubbing solution. Solutions may simply be water (for dust) or solutions of reagents that specifically target certain compounds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> {{have been}} used in a variety of {{industries}} such as acid plants, fertilizer plants, steel mills, asphalt plants, and large power plants.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{critical}} sized particles {{are those in}} the 0.1 to 0.5 micrometres range {{because they are the}} most difficult for <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> to collect.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 85% of {{the flue}} gas {{desulfurization}} units {{installed in the}} US are <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers,</b> 12% are spray dry systems, and 3% are dry injection systems.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on {{scrubber}} design, {{a minimum}} {{volume of liquid}} is required to [...] "wet" [...] the scrubber internals and create sufficient collection targets. After a certain optimum point, adding excess liquid to a particulate <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> does not increase efficiency and in fact, could be counter-productive by causing excessive pressure loss. Liquid-to-gas ratios for gas absorption are often higher, {{in the range of}} 20 to 40 gallons per 1,000 actual ft³ (3 to 6 litres per actual m³).|$|E
50|$|A dry or {{semi-dry}} scrubbing system, {{unlike the}} <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber,</b> does not saturate the flue gas stream {{that is being}} treated with moisture. In some cases no moisture is added, while in others only the amount of moisture that can be evaporated in the flue gas without condensing is added. Therefore, dry scrubbers generally {{do not have a}} stack steam plume or wastewater handling/disposal requirements. Dry scrubbing systems are used to remove acid gases (such as SO2 and HCl) primarily from combustion sources.|$|E
5000|$|This type of {{technology}} {{can be used for}} example as a <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> for air pollution control. Countercurrent flow exposes the outlet gas with the lowest pollutant concentration to the freshest scrubbing liquid.Many nozzles are placed across the tower at different heights to spray all of the gas as it moves up through the tower. The reason for using many nozzles is to maximize the number of fine droplets impacting the pollutant particles and to provide a large surface area for absorbing gas.|$|E
50|$|Some {{disadvantages}} of <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> include corrosion, {{the need for}} entrainment separation or mist removal to obtain high efficiencies {{and the need for}} treatment or reuse of spent liquid.|$|R
