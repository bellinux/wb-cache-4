5|$|Rumours spread {{throughout}} London that more rioting <b>was</b> <b>imminent,</b> including in Bermondsey and the Wood Green shopping centre near Broadwater Farm. On 1 October, there were disturbances in Toxteth, Liverpool, {{and on the}} same day police stopped and searched all vehicles entering the Farm, finding a petrol bomb there the next day, David Rose wrote in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Secrecy for the {{operation}} was so tight that not all German ground and naval forces had been informed of {{the operation}} and some units suffered casualties from friendly fire. British signals intelligence (Ultra) recorded the movement and buildup of German air forces in the region, but did not realise that an operation <b>was</b> <b>imminent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Slowly {{fighting}} {{their way}} up the Italian peninsula, the Allies took Rome and then Florence in the summer of 1944 and later that year they began advancing into northern Italy. With the final collapse of the German army's Gothic Line in April 1945, total defeat for the Salò Republic and its German protectors <b>was</b> <b>imminent.</b>|$|E

5|$|The XXII Corps was {{supported}} by the majority of the Yildirim Army's heavy artillery for counter battery operations. Here, three of the five Ottoman Army heavy artillery batteries in Palestine (the 72nd, 73rd and 75th Batteries) were deployed. Further, the Ottoman front line regiments had been alerted that a major attack <b>was</b> <b>imminent.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of the year 2012, Nostradamus's prophecies started to be co-opted (especially by the History Channel) as {{evidence}} suggesting {{that the end of the}} world <b>was</b> <b>imminent,</b> notwithstanding the fact that his book never mentions the end of the world, let alone the year 2012.|$|E
5|$|Camus was the {{supposed}} {{leader of a}} Norse expeditionary force defeated by the armies of King Malcolm II at the Battle of Barry. Tradition, popularised {{in the sixteenth century}} by historian Hector Boece, states that Camus fled the battle scene when defeat <b>was</b> <b>imminent,</b> and was caught and slain {{at the point where the}} cross now stands. The battle, and its main protagonists, including Camus, are now known to be historically inauthentic.|$|E

5|$|Generalfeldmarshall Günther von Kluge was the German supreme {{commander}} in the West. After Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel was injured by Allied aircraft on 17 July, Kluge also took over direct command of Army Group B, the formation conducting the battle in Normandy. He had warned Hitler on 22 July that {{the collapse of the}} front <b>was</b> <b>imminent,</b> but Hitler continued to order him to stand fast.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{received}} the final {{part of his}} father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich, Germany. Hitler was called up for conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army, so he journeyed to Salzburg on 5 February 1914 for medical assessment. After he was deemed by the medical examiners as unfit for service, he returned to Munich. Hitler later claimed {{that he did not}} wish to serve the Habsburg Empire because of the mixture of races in its army and his belief that the collapse of Austria-Hungary <b>was</b> <b>imminent.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1935 he {{returned}} to Germany {{as a member of}} the International Force supervising the Saarland plebiscite. Afterwards, he joined the German Intelligence Section at the War Office. In 1937 he became Assistant Military attaché in Berlin to Noel Mason-Macfarlane. As such, Strong got to know many senior German military officers personally, including Wilhelm Keitel. Like Mason-Macfarlane, he became convinced that war with Germany <b>was</b> <b>imminent</b> and inevitable.|$|E

The Alsos Mission joined T-Force in Strasbourg on 25 November. The German nuclear laboratory was discovered {{on the grounds of}} the Strasbourg Hospital, where the physicists attempted to pass themselves off as medics. Fleischmann was taken into custody, but Weizsäcker and von Haagen had fled the city.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 2001, the Competition Authority granted {{permission}} for SAS to purchase Braathens. The rationale {{was that there}} were no other realistic purchasers for the airline, and that a bankruptcy <b>was</b> <b>imminent</b> without the take-over. As a condition, the authority decided to regulate a ban on frequent flyer programs, and stated that it would ban cross-subsidization aimed at underbidding or operating at a loss to force new entrants out of the market.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July the Allies invaded Sicily in Operation Husky. German signals {{intercepted by}} GC showed that even four {{hours after the}} {{invasion}} of Sicily began, twenty-one aircraft left Sicily to reinforce Sardinia. For a considerable time after the initial invasion, Hitler was still convinced that {{an attack on the}} Balkans <b>was</b> <b>imminent,</b> and in late July he sent General Erwin Rommel to Salonika to prepare the defence of the region. By the time the German high command realised the mistake, {{it was too late to}} make a difference.|$|E

5|$|To {{preserve}} surprise, the Allies did not bombard Morotai {{prior to}} the invasion and conducted only a few photographic reconnaissance flights over the island. An Allied Intelligence Bureau patrol had been landed in the island in June but the information it collected was not {{passed on to the}} Sixth Army. Although the Tradewind Taskforce had little information on the invasion beaches or Japanese positions, the Sixth Army did not land any of its own reconnaissance patrols on Morotai, as it was feared that these could warn the island's defenders that an attack <b>was</b> <b>imminent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vandegrift {{ordered the}} {{withdrawal}} {{because of the}} receipt of intelligence from coastwatchers, aerial reconnaissance, and radio intercepts that a major Japanese reinforcement effort <b>was</b> <b>imminent.</b> Indeed, the Japanese {{were in the process}} of attempting to deliver the 10,000 remaining troops from the 38th Division to Guadalcanal in order to reattempt to capture Henderson Field. The resulting efforts by the Americans to stop this reinforcement attempt resulted in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the decisive naval battle of the Guadalcanal campaign, in which the Japanese reinforcement effort was turned back.|$|E
5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} patrol from the 13th Parachute Battalion reported a large gathering of Germans in Bréville and suspected an attack <b>was</b> <b>imminent.</b> At 08:00 a massive artillery and mortar bombardment fell along the 1st Special Service Brigade lines, while the 857th Grenadier Regiment, which had {{gathered in the}} village, attacked No. 6 Commando. By 10:30, the attack on No. 6 Commando had been driven back, but to their left at Hauger No.4 Commandos had to win a hand-to-hand fight before the Germans withdrew. Twice more during the day the commandos were attacked unsuccessfully, from Sallenelles {{in the north and}} again from Bréville.|$|E
