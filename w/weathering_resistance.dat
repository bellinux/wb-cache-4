50|$|ASA is {{structurally}} {{very similar}} to ABS. The spherical particles of slightly crosslinked acrylate rubber (instead of butadiene rubber), functioning as an impact modifier, are chemically grafted with styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer chains, and embedded in styrene-acrylonitrile matrix. The acrylate rubber differs from the butadiene based rubber by absence of double bonds, which gives the material about ten times the <b>weathering</b> <b>resistance</b> and resistance to ultraviolet radiation of ABS, higher long-term heat resistance, and better chemical resistance. ASA is significantly more resistant to environmental stress cracking than ABS, especially to alcohols and many cleaning agents. n-Butyl acrylate rubber is usually used, but other esters can be encountered too, e.g. ethyl hexyl acrylate. The latter has lower glass transition temperature than the former, -65 °C vs -45 °C, providing better low-temperature properties to the material.|$|E

The degradation of <b>weather</b> <b>resistance</b> can be considered as the accumulation of environment and loads. The ultraviolet radiation and the temperature mainly affect the mechanical properties of yarns, while the preloading before aging tests can change the crimp degrees and decrease the coating thickness. The effect of loads should not be ignored in the <b>weather</b> <b>resistance</b> analysis of PVDF-coated polyesters.

40|$|Ethylene {{propylene}} diene monomer rubber (EPDM) is {{an excellent}} rubber for outdoor use. Natural rubber (NR) containing EPDM may show improved <b>weathering</b> <b>resistance.</b> EPDM was blended with natural rubber with various blend ratios, after which the processing, cure characteristics, and mechanical properties of the NR/EPDM blends were determined. The results of the experiments show that the tensile strength of the blends progressively decreased with an increased amount of EPDM.

The heat and <b>weathering</b> <b>resistance</b> of the NR/EPDM blends were determined in terms of tensile properties of the blends with various blend ratios.

No matter what percentage of CaO, β-CaSiO 3 and Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7 was in calcined ginger nut, for thousands of years, the site of housing was buried under loess of farm land of hillside. Non-hydraulic and hydraulic materials mainly changed into porous CaCO 3 through their interaction with CO 2 and H 2 O. So after more than five thousand years, F- 901 floor material at Dadiwan is similar to modern No. 100 cement mortar floor in compressive strength. However for centuries, the Aga soil used in Tibetan building floors and roofs was never burned at high temperature.
