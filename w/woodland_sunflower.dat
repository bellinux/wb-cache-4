50|$|Helianthus microcephalus is a {{perennial}} species of Helianthus {{also known as}} small <b>woodland</b> <b>sunflower</b> or small-wood sunflower or small-head sunflower or simply as <b>woodland</b> <b>sunflower.</b> It {{is a native of}} Northern America, and is to be found growing in open woodlands.|$|E
5000|$|Helianthus divaricatus, {{commonly}} known as the rough sunflower, <b>woodland</b> <b>sunflower</b> or rough <b>woodland</b> <b>sunflower,</b> is a North American species perennial herb in the composite family. It is native to central and eastern North America, from Ontario and Quebec in the north, south to Florida and Louisiana and west to Oklahoma and Iowa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>woodland</b> <b>sunflower</b> {{is similar}} to Helianthus hirsutus, but its stem is rough. It is up to 1.5 m tall with short stalked, {{lanceolate}} to oval leaves, 1-8 cm wide with toothed margins. Its flowers have 8 to 15 rays, each 1.5 to 3 cm (0.6-1.2inches) long, surrounding an orange or yellowish brown central disk.|$|E
30|$|In general, {{the results}} of these groundcover {{vegetation}} surveys indicate that > 50 % canopy reduction from an EF 4 -intensity tornado increased the species richness and abundance of groundcover plant species indicative of fire-maintained open habitats and severe anthropogenic disturbance. The increase in species richness resulted in large part from increased occurrence of annual ruderals and short-lived perennials (e.g., Canadian horseweed, American burnweed, dogfennel, spoon-leaf purple everlasting), which is not a desirable response in the context of maintaining the biotic distinctiveness of upland oak-pine ecosystems. On the other hand, tornado damage also increased the abundance of species indicative of rare, fire-maintained open habitats (e.g., Boscâ€™s panicgrass, creeping lespedeza, hairy lespedeza, small <b>woodland</b> <b>sunflower,</b> smooth ticktrefoil, and Atlantic pigeonwings; Brewer et al. 2012). The increase resulted from {{the fact that many of}} these perennial species were already present, but at low densities, most likely having been suppressed by shade prior to canopy damage. Canopy reduction created the environmental conditions necessary to promote the natural increase of species indicative of fire-maintained open habitats (Clewell and Aronson 2013). Such a result mirrors responses to experimental canopy reduction and biennial fires in a more mesic oak-dominated forest in the loess plains of northern Mississippi (Brewer et al. 2015). Such responses provide support for the fire tolerance hypothesis and are consistent with a primary restoration goal in oak-pine woodlands and forests of the eastern United States (Smith 1994, Taft 1997, Laatch and Anderson 2000, Hutchinson et al. 2005, Ruffner and Groninger 2006, Phillips and Waldrop 2008, Kinkead et al. 2013).|$|E
