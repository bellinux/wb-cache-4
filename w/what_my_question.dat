40|$|Junior or {{community}} college reading programs {{are one of}} the areas most open for innovation. The two-year college itself is still a relatively new concept and reading programs designed to fit the still evolving function of these schools offer the reading specialist both freedom and frustrations. To date, I have taught reading courses at a junior college which was affiliated with a university and at a community college with an open door policy. In the first instance, the courses were offered through the continuing education department and dealt largely with marginal admittance students. Presently I am within the English department and the reading courses are credit courses, some of which carry transfer credit to local universities. At this point, there are probably many more questions than answers. In this article, I would like to discuss these questions and perhaps this will lead to an exchange of ideas from other reading specialists w-ho may have solutions. Particularly at this level, it is easy to become isolated from dialogue with other reading personnel. <b>What</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> may serve to do is offer an outline of topics to which you may want to respond...|$|R
40|$|Accountability in {{education}} is an increasingly common activity. However, accountability tends to assess progress made in various subject matters, {{and it never}} seems to face the more basic question of how important any subject matter is. Two teachers, who {{have had the same}} training, teaching the same subject to two very similar groups of children, using the same book, and covering the same content material may end up producing quite different effects in those two groups of children. Accountability, therefore, should require us to specify clearly the kinds of effects we need to produce in our children. As a student in the College of Education and the Department of Speech-Communication, I have been bombarded with theories of what should be taught and of what children need to learn. Regardless of <b>what</b> is taught, <b>my</b> <b>question</b> is this: Is there any valid way of defining and measuring what any population believes should be taught to children, and to what extent are the future teachers who are now in the College of Education acquiring these professed values...|$|R

40|$|Modern-day {{heirs of}} the Cartesian {{revolution}} have {{been fascinated by}} the thought that one could utilize certain hypotheses – that one is dreaming, deceived by an evil demon, or a brain in a vat – to argue at one fell swoop that one does not know, is not justified in believing, or ought not believe most if not all of what one currently believes about the world. A good part of the interest and mystique of these discussions arises from the contention that the seeds of such arguments lie in our ordinary epistemic practices, so that external world skepticism can arise “from within”. But is this contention correct? I doubt it. Taking skepticism seriously requires that we address this question head on. To do so, I will approach skeptical arguments from a certain vantage point. I will try to stand, as far as possible, with both feet squarely in ordinary life. I will start out with all of our ordinary commitments about what is the case, about what we know or have reason to believe, about when someone knows, is justified, or has good reason to believe something, and about how one should proceed in deciding <b>what</b> to believe. <b>My</b> <b>question,</b> then, will be this.
