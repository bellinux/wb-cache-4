5|$|In {{the early}} Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship-grey Bentley 4½ Litre with an Amherst Villiers supercharger. After Bond's car was written off by Hugo Drax in Moonraker, Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> in the {{remaining}} books of the series. During Goldfinger, Bond was issued with an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to track Goldfinger across France. Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels.|$|E
5|$|Viète {{began by}} solving the PPP case (three points) {{following}} {{the method of}} Euclid in his Elements. From this, he derived a lemma corresponding {{to the power of}} a point theorem, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to solve the LPP case (a line and two points). Following Euclid a second time, Viète solved the LLL case (three lines) using the angle bisectors. He then derived a lemma for constructing the line perpendicular to an angle bisector that passes through a point, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to solve the LLP problem (two lines and a point). This accounts for the first four cases of Apollonius' problem, those that do not involve circles.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{physicists}} to use Monte Carlo methods, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to model electron and proton initiated particle showers. He invented the quantometer so that he could measure the intensity of high-energy X-ray beams.|$|E
5|$|After Ellis {{defeated}} the Reds by {{a score of}} 1-0 in a 1973 game, Joe Morgan claimed that Ellis threw a spitball. Anderson had the umpire check Ellis, but found no evidence. In his 1980 book, Ellis admitted that wearing hair curlers produced sweat on his hair, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to throw {{a modified version of}} a spitball.|$|E
5|$|Birch {{went to work}} in the Engineering Department of the New York Telephone Company. He {{applied for}} and {{received}} an American Field Service Fellowship in 1926, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to travel to Strasbourg, and study at the University of Strasbourg's Institut de Physique under the tutelage of Pierre Weiss. There, he wrote or co-wrote four papers, in French, on topics such as the paramagnetic properties of potassium cyanide, and the magnetic moment of Cu++ ions.|$|E
60|$|Nor {{does he mean}} merely when we were {{children}} in age. The Greek word <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>uses,</b> means infants, people not come to years of discretion. Indeed, the word <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>uses</b> means very often a simpleton, an ignorant or foolish person; one who does not know who and what he is, what is his duty, or how to do it.|$|R

5|$|Cheap at Half the Price was {{recorded}} by Frith {{at his home}} in New York City on a 4-track machine. He played all the instruments himself, with the exception of bass guitar on two tracks, and drums, for <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> tapes and samples previously recorded by other drummers. The record differed from Frith's previous experimental albums in that it consisted largely of pop-like songs, and he sang for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, he drew {{inspiration}} from nature, making studies of insects, landscapes, and plants such as lichens, all of <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> as details in his artworks. He traveled in Italy and Spain, sketching buildings, townscapes, architecture and the tilings of the Alhambra and the Mezquita of Cordoba, and became steadily more interested in their mathematical structure.|$|E
5|$|His first {{encounter}} with photography came after he took {{a position in the}} household of Lady Vivian, widow of Hussey Vivian, 3rd Baron Vivian; Lady Vivian's twin daughters each had a camera, and Brooks was entrusted with developing the films. Paying by weekly shilling installments, he bought a camera himself <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to take pictures of prominent people for publication; his first portrait was sold to several newspapers through an agency, earning him seven guineas.|$|E

50|$|The newuniversal {{version of}} Justice also has {{different}} abilities - although their extent {{is as yet}} unrevealed, he appears to possess a limited form of telepathy, allowing him to read misdeeds from someone else's mind. He also manifests solid constructs made from glowing energy; these appear as either flat, rectangular panels <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>uses</b> as shields or platforms, or angular shapes <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>uses</b> as cutting blades.|$|R
5|$|In 1933, Bainbridge {{was awarded}} a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to travel to England and work at Ernest Rutherford's Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. While there he {{continued}} his work developing the mass spectrograph, and became friends with the British physicist John Cockcroft.|$|E
5|$|In the storyline {{behind the}} match between The Big Boss Man and Nailz, Nailz claimed {{that while he}} was serving time in prison, the Big Boss Man, who was a guard at the prison, mistreated Nailz. In early 1992, Nailz {{appeared}} in introductory vignettes to talk about his hatred of the Big Boss Man. Upon his debut in the WWF, Nailz attacked Bossman and stole his nightstick, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to attack his opponents over the following months.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn was a {{fine and}} {{enthusiastic}} artist in pencil and watercolour, a skill <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> throughout his life for his own amusement {{and that of his}} friends.

5|$|Ptolemy of Alexandria mapped {{the stars}} in BooksVII and VIII of his Almagest, in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> Sirius as the {{location}} for the globe's central meridian. He depicted {{it as one of}} six red-coloured stars (see the Colour controversy section below). The other five are class M and K stars, such as Arcturus and Betelgeuse.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{severely}} curtailed {{tobacco production}} {{in favor of}} more sustainable crops, including wheat, corn, rye, and barley. This reduced the soil depletion inherent to tobacco production, and allowed for the practice of crop rotation. He also planted fruit orchards, including peach and apple trees, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to produce spirits. In 1801 Richard constructed a dairy, which ran primarily under the supervision of his wife Elizabeth Collins Lee.|$|E
5|$|The Advisory Committee on Uranium {{provided}} {{money for}} Fermi to buy graphite, and {{he built a}} pile of graphite bricks {{on the seventh floor}} of the Pupin Hall laboratory. By August 1941, he had six tons of uranium oxide and thirty tons of graphite, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to build a still larger pile in Schermerhorn Hall at Columbia.|$|E

5|$|The Nice were {{primarily}} a live band. Their stage performances were bold and violent, with Emerson incorporating feedback and distortion. He manhandled his Hammond L-100 organ, wrestling it and attacking it with daggers (<b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> {{to hold down}} keys and sustain notes during these escapades). Emerson's playing was inspired by Jimi Hendrix, Billy Ritchie of Clouds, and Don Shinn as well as earlier figures such as pianist Jerry Lee Lewis.|$|E
5|$|After {{his band}} The Crosswalk was dropped from Hollywood Records in 1997, Cody Chesnutt spent several months {{recording}} The Headphone Masterpiece in his bedroom, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> as a makeshift studio called the Sonic Promiseland, in Valley Village, California. He used a 4-track recorder, and recorded the songs entirely by himself with equipment worth $10,000, including one microphone, an organ, a guitar, bass, and keyboard. He used {{a pair of}} Sony MDR-7506 headphones as a studio monitor {{in order not to}} wake up his roommate. It was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, {{drastic changes}} to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as {{a way that they}} increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>used</b> to control them.|$|E
