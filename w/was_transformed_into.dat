5|$|For example, {{near the}} mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and had lived with her step-father, whom she had longed to get away from. The step-father wanted to trade her since she would have been sold for a great sum of money, but as they were {{crossing}} the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in, and they were drenched. The step-father, enraged, tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river. Before being drowned in the river, she <b>was</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a dolphin, and swam away from her abusive step-father, who also fell in and <b>was</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a porpoise.|$|E

50|$|Solids can <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> liquids by melting, and liquids can <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> solids by freezing.

5|$|Christian Lee Novetzke of the University of Washington {{suggests}} that Vithoba's worship migrated from Karnataka to the formerly Shaiva city of Pandharpur {{some time before}} 1000CE; but under the possible influence of a Krishna-worshipping Mahanubhava sect, the town <b>was</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a Vaishnava center of pilgrimage. This proposal is consistent with contemporary remnants of Shaiva worship in the town.|$|E

5|$|In {{an early}} account, Sophocles wrote that Tereus {{was turned into}} a large-beaked bird whom some {{scholars}} translate as a hawk while a number of retellings and other works (including Aristophanes' ancient comedy, The Birds) hold that Tereus was instead changed into a hoopoe. Various later translations of Ovid state that Tereus <b>was</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> other birds than the hawk and hoopoe, including references by Dryden and Gower to the lapwing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, after Napoleon had crowned himself first French Emperor, the Italian Republic <b>was</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> the first Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, or Italico, under his direct rule.

500|$|Thus, if P lies {{outside the}} circle, then P' lies within, and vice versa. When P {{is the same}} as O, the {{inversion}} is said to send P to infinity. (In complex analysis, [...] "infinity" [...] is defined in terms of the Riemann sphere.) Inversion has the useful property that lines and circles <b>are</b> always <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> lines and circles, and points <b>are</b> always <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> points. Circles <b>are</b> generally <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> other circles under inversion; however, if a circle passes {{through the center of the}} inversion circle, it <b>is</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a straight line, and vice versa. Importantly, if a circle crosses the circle of inversion at right angles (intersects perpendicularly), it is left unchanged by the inversion; it <b>is</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> itself.|$|R

5|$|The {{theme of}} {{swimming}} through flames {{is connected to}} the depiction of Guido Guinizelli, a poet who influenced Dante, seeking such a state in Purgatorio XXVI. However, the depiction of swimming <b>was</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> an image of dancing, an act that appears throughout Yeats's poetry, within purgatorial flames. The critic Dominic Manganiello suggests that, in combining the image of dancing with purgation, Eliot merges Dante's and Yeats's poetic themes.|$|E
