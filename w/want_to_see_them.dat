Some say {{he went into the}} square hoping a conciliatory gesture would gain him leverage against hard-liners like Premier Li Peng. Others believe he supported the protesters and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> hurt when the military was called in. After the incident, Zhao was placed under indefinite house arrest.|$|E

And usually women feel stupid and silly and they blame themselves 'cause {{you have all the}} signs most of the time, but you love the guy so you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> go. And in this song, it's kind of like a celebration of the breakup...|$|E

[...] Akai who wants to produce better films stated, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> for a long time. Just thinking about them sends shivers down my spine." [...] Lawrence Eng stated that without the Daicon animations, Gainax might never have existed. In 2001, the anime magazine Animage ranked the Daicon animations as the 35th of the [...] "Top 100" [...] anime of all time.|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{contains}} minor {{scenes from}} Crichton's Jurassic Park and The Lost World novels that were ultimately not {{featured in the}} film versions, such as the Pteranodon aviary {{and the use of}} the boat. Laura Dern's cameo was shot in a day. In an earlier draft, Neill and Dern's characters were a couple in the process of splitting up. Johnston said, [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> as a couple anymore. For one thing, I don't think they look like a couple. It would be uncomfortable to still see them together. And Laura Dern doesn't look like she's aged for the past fifteen years!" [...] The film's longest rough cut was approximately 96 minutes, without credits. According to Johnston, [...] "We lost maybe 8 minutes, so it was never really that long." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{announced}} by Fox in July 2013 to premiere {{in the fall}} of 2014. In May 2014, the network presented two clips from the episode at their annual upfront presentation. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly about the episode, MacFarlane stated that the key to a good crossover episode is [...] "really about the character interaction. People want to see Peter interact with Homer. They want to see Bart interact with Stewie. In a way, the story in a crossover episode, while it has to be there, is never quite as important as how the characters interact with each other." [...] The Simpsons creator Groening added, [...] "In this case, it's two really vivid shows and seeing what they can do together. You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> having a good time and you want to see Peter and Homer duke it out".|$|E

500|$|After being {{attacked}} by the crows, Homer is seen being treated by Dr. Hibbert at the Springfield General Hospital. While there are no visible scars on him, the character instead has a slightly curled hair. During a color screening of the scene, Homer's body looked [...] "a little too bloody" [...] and damaged, prompting the staff to change it. [...] "One thing I learned {{a long time ago}} is, you gotta be careful how you change [...] basic model pack", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary. He also said that he was happy that many viewers identify with the characters and don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> get hurt or injured in any way. [...] "They don't mind if [...] falls down a cliff but [...] he should recover." [...] While working on the episode, the series' staff debated what size to make Homer's pupils when he is under the influence of marijuana. Because a common effect of smoking marijuana is to get dilated pupils, the animators initially suggested to widen them, but settled on only dilating Homer's pupils slightly.|$|E
500|$|The Infected, a core {{concept of}} the game, were {{inspired}} by {{a segment of the}} BBC nature documentary Planet Earth (2006), which featured the Cordyceps fungi. Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing it to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the {{concept of the}} fungus evolving and infecting humans, and the direct results of an outbreak of this infection. The game does not directly explain the cause of the virus; Straley attributed this to the team's focus on the characters, as opposed to the virus. They preferred to explain the events through subtext, rather than explicitly explaining the cause of the infection. Straley compared the subtext included in The Last of Us to that of BioShock Infinite (2013). He felt that the latter had spawned various conversations within the industry, which he sees as a sign of a maturing industry. [...] "I've seen enough good stories in books and film. Now I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> in video games," [...] said Straley. The team used the concept of the Infected to force players to explore the limits of human perseverance. Throughout development, the team assured everyone that the Infected were strictly different from zombies.|$|E
500|$|In chapter seven, Cochrane {{approaches}} {{issues relating}} to animals and the environment. He first argues {{for the importance of}} this kind of analysis, before saying that, under the interest-based rights approach, non-conscious entities (including species, ecosystems and plants) cannot be understood to have rights; he then defends the necessity of consciousness for the possession of interests. Cochrane considers, but rejects, the land ethic of Aldo Leopold as a basis for the moral status of the environment, but instead defends the environment on welfare grounds. Though he rejects the notion that wild animals might own the land on which they live, Cochrane concludes that we have strict environmental obligations due to the rights and interests of sentient animals. Concerning endangered species, Cochrane rejects the notion of [...] "superkilling" [...] (that a special wrong is involved in wiping out a species) and the idea of [...] "compensatory justice" [...] (that more is owed to members of endangered species as a form of compensation). Instead, Cochrane argues that unconscious species may have contingent value, and members of rare conscious species may have a stronger right to life due to the interests of humans who will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> and the interests of other animals in their ecosystems Cochrane then argues that animals possess a concrete right not to be killed in order to preserve a favoured ecosystem, whether because of overpopulation of the species or because species are nonnative. However, control by contraception is argued to be acceptable.|$|E

50|$|Rob Van Dam and Sabu {{first met}} in December 1989 and became close friends. The pair {{started out as}} enemies in ECW when Van Dam debuted in 1996. Both men were trained by Sabu's uncle, Ed Farhat, and fans <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> face each other since they both {{utilized}} high-flying, daredevil techniques.|$|R
500|$|The diverse {{sources of}} funding {{meant that the}} {{production}} team had to field opinions from various sources. Millesime was unhappy with {{certain aspects of the}} story, for instance wanting the entire Lyme sequence removed because they considered it [...] "too boring". WGBH gave the BBC detailed notes, which were then integrated into the script. One change concerned the ending. To display the climax when Anne and Wentworth finally approach each other with their feelings, two different scenes were shot, one in which they kiss and one in which they do not. Dear first wrote a scene closely modelled after Austen's ending: Anne reunites with Wentworth on the streets of Bath, and the two exchange words and hold hands. Eaton felt that after hours of waiting, audiences [...] "would go nuts with frustration and irritation" [...] if the two did not kiss. Eaton also thought [...] "a kiss would be an emotional pay-off", and WGBH believed it would give the film a wider appeal. Michell agreed to compromise, opting to shoot one British version and one American version—the latter included the kiss. The American ending is reflected on the international poster, which shows the two protagonists embracing. While the kiss attracted some criticism among fans, actress Amanda Root defended it. [...] "After the great suspense of the story, by the end you're desperate for Anne and Captain Wentworth to get together, desperate! Film is a visual medium, after all. You don't necessarily <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> in bed together, but you do want to see something like a kiss", she said.|$|E
2500|$|Costume {{designer}} Nolan Miller designed approximately 3,000 costumes {{over the}} course of the series, saying [...] "I never <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> wearing the same outfit twice". His weekly wardrobe budget was $35,000.|$|E
2500|$|Many sportswriters {{and fans}} {{were a bit}} upset that the Bills {{advanced}} to their fourth consecutive Super Bowl. They were distressed with Buffalo having lost the three previous Super Bowl games and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> lose again. Some Bills fans appeared to be defensive about their team's presence in the game; during Buffalo's victory in the AFC Championship Game a week earlier, one fan displayed a banner defiantly proclaiming, [...] "We're back; deal with it, America!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Multiple critics {{praised the}} game's dark humor. David Sanchez, {{reviewer}} for GameZone, stated [...] "the little blue Swarmites are completely stupid, {{and they have}} a ridiculous charm to them that makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> meet their demise." [...] Sanchez further noted that seeing the swarmites die was [...] "strangely satisfying and totally hilarious." [...] IGN's Colin Moriarty called the swarmite deaths [...] "saddening and necessary," [...] but added that players will [...] "never grow tired of seeing it happen." [...] Ben Reeves of Game Informer also enjoyed the game's humor, but felt that there was not enough variety to keep a player's interest. [...] "It may be fun to watch these little guys die, but there were too many moments where I wanted to kill the power to my console." ...|$|E
2500|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} St. Guillen {{spoke with her}} friend, Brooklyn police {{received}} an anonymous phone call alerting them to a dead woman's body. They soon identified it as St. Guillen. Her body was nude, wrapped in a comforter. Her broken fingernails showed she fought against her attacker. Her hands and feet were tied, a sock had been shoved down her throat, and her head was wrapped in packing tape. Some of her hair had been cut off. An autopsy revealed {{that she had been}} beaten and sexually assaulted before being asphyxiated. According to forensic psychologist Dr. Stephanie Stolinsky, the killer [...] "tried to dehumanize her completely. ...
