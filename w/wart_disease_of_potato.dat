40|$|The obligate biotrophic, soil-borne fungus Synchytrium endobioticum causes <b>wart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> (Solanum tuberosum), {{which is}} a serious problem for crop {{production}} in countries with moderate climates. S. endobioticum induces hypertrophic cell divisions in plant host tissues leading to the formation of tumor-like structures. Potato wart is a quarantine disease and chemical control is not possible. From 38 S. endobioticum pathotypes occurring in Europe, pathotypes 1, 2, 6 and 18 are the most relevant. Genetic resistance to wart is available but only few current potato varieties are resistant to all four pathotypes. The phenotypic evaluation of wart resistance is laborious, time-consuming and sometimes ambiguous, which makes breeding for resistance difficult. Molecular markers diagnostic for genes for resistance to S. endobioticum pathotypes 1, 2, 6 and 18 would greatly facilitate the selection of new, resistant cultivars. Two tetraploid half-sib families (266 individuals) segregating for resistance to S. endobioticum pathotypes 1, 2, 6 and 18 were produced by crossing a resistant genotype with two different susceptible ones. The families were scored for five different wart resistance phenotypes. The distribution of mean resistance scores was quantitative in both families. Resistance to pathotypes 2, 6 and 18 was correlated and independent from resistance to pathotype 1. DNA pools were constructed from the most resistant and most susceptible individuals and screened with genome wide simple sequence repeat (SSR), inverted simple sequence region (ISSR) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Bulked segregant analysis identified three SSR markers that were linked to wart resistance loci (Sen). Sen 1 -XI on chromosome XI conferred partial resistance to pathotype 1, Sen 18 -IX on chromosome IX to pathotype 18 and Sen 2 / 6 / 18 -I on chromosome I to pathotypes 2, 6 and 18. Additional genotyping with 191 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers confirmed the localization of the Sen loci. Thirty-three SNP markers linked to the Sen loci permitted the dissection of Sen alleles that increased or decreased resistance to wart. The alleles were inherited from both the resistant and susceptible parents...|$|E

40|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops in New Zealand and internationally. Potato plants are susceptible to a range <b>of</b> pathogenic <b>diseases,</b> including the Rhizoctonia diseases, which are globally ubiquitous. Since synthetic fungicide control of the causal pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani Kühn, is not always efficacious, combined with a current drive to reduce synthetic agrichemical inputs in New Zealand agriculture, alternatives should be sought. The present study examined the potential for biological control (biocontrol) <b>of</b> Rhizoctonia <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> from a New Zealand agricultural perspective. The study included investigations into inundative biocontrol (introduction of single/multiple strains of soil microorganisms) and conservation biocontrol, including organic matter amendments and crop rotation practice. To investigate inundative biocontrol, isolations were conducted from New Zealand potato cropping soils for members of the genera Trichoderma, Pseudomonas and Bacillus, identified as strong potential biocontrol candidates from previous published studies. Comparisons between the bacterial isolates in dual culture with two R. solani strains suggested that one soil (from the Pukekohe region) harboured Pseudomonads with greater suppressive potential than those from three other soils. In greenhouse assays, selected isolates (89) were applied to plant growth medium as fungal spore or bacterial cell suspensions, to test for their capacity to suppress Rhizoctonia <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>potato.</b> Initially, 22 isolates demonstrated positive impacts on either Rhizoctonia canker symptoms and/or on plant parameters (e. g. tuber number or weight). However, no isolates gave strong and consistant suppression <b>of</b> Rhizoctonia <b>diseases</b> in repeated assays. The results indicated that inundative biocontrol was insufficient to achieve strong, consistent suppression <b>of</b> Rhizoctonia <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>potato,</b> when applied in this commercially realistic manner. Investigations into conservation biocontrol included testing several organic matter (OM) amendments previously suggested as potential suppressors <b>of</b> Rhizoctonia <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>potato.</b> These OMs were based on pine bark compost, chitin or biochar. Very slight disease suppression was detected. Results from analysis of soil community substrate utilisation showed that increases in activity or diversity as a result of OM amendment, at commercially viable concentrations, were insufficient to suppress Rhizoctonia diseases. The soil population of R. solani AG 3 and AG 2 - 1, and fungal and bacterial soil community structure, as a result of four crop rotation treatments (including potato monoculture) from the Pukekohe region were assessed. No rotation treatment increased pathogen inoculum. Soil bacterial community was not affected by rotation treatment. Fungal community was affected by the most recent crop, but not crop sequence. The impact of the four rotation treatments on Rhizoctonia disease expression was also assessed. Soils from all four treatments gave similar disease expression. Culture dependent and independent techniques used to determine soil fungal and bacterial community richness, diversity or metabolic activity demonstrated that increases in these parameters did not correlate with decreases in Rhizoctonia disease measures. The study concluded that consistent biocontrol <b>of</b> Rhizoctonia <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> probably requires the presence and stimulation of a specific, small group of suppressive organisms. For biocontrol <b>of</b> these <b>diseases</b> to be a reliable option for potato growers, biocontrol agents will probably require appropriate and economically feasible nutritional support when introduced into crop disease management strategies...|$|R
