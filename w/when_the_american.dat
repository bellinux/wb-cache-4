5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> {{magazine}} Cinema asked Kubrick in 1963 to {{name his}} favorite films, the film director listed Federico Fellini's I Vitelloni as {{number one in}} his Top 10 list.|$|E
5|$|After 1994, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> musicians Curtis Mayfield and Frank Sinatra {{were both}} issued Grammy Legend Awards, the honors {{have been given}} to {{recording}} artists intermittently. Italian operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti was the 1998 recipient of the award. The following year, British singer-songwriter Elton John was recognized with the honor. The Bee Gees became the first recipients of the award in the 21st century when the brothers were acknowledged by the Grammys in 2003. Overall, fourteen solo musicians and one band have received the Grammy Legend Award.|$|E
5|$|Another {{breakthrough}} came in 1931, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza {{and several}} other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. In 1949, John Franklin Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins grew polio virus in cultured human embryo cells, the first virus to be grown without using solid animal tissue or eggs. This work enabled Jonas Salk to make an effective polio vaccine.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, the palace and its owners became {{symbols of the}} {{slightly}} risqué glamour and decadence that were associated with Monte Carlo and the French Riviera. Glamour and theatricality became reality <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> film star Grace Kelly became chatelaine of the palace in 1956. In the 21st century, the palace remains the residence of the current Prince of Monaco.|$|E
5|$|Ephedrine: Ephedrine, {{known as}} ma huang in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine, originally as an extract of the herb Ephedra sinica, {{has been documented}} in China since the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) as an antiasthmatic and stimulant. The industrial manufacture of ephedrine in China began in the 1920s, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> pharmaceutical company Merck began marketing and selling the drug as ephetonin. Ephedrine exports between China and the West grew from 4 tonnes to 216 tonnes between 1926 and 1928.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, there were rumours about {{surviving}} mammoths in Alaska. In October 1899, Henry Tukeman detailed his {{killing of a}} mammoth in Alaska and his subsequent donation of the specimen to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. The museum denied the story. Bengt Sjögren believed that the myth began <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> biologist Charles Haskins Townsend travelled in Alaska, saw Eskimos trading mammoth tusks, asked if there were still living mammoths in Alaska, and provided them with a drawing of the animal.|$|E

5|$|Law {{originally}} {{found a job}} as {{a traveling}} carpet salesman. He continued until he discovered that his employer was misrepresenting domestic rugs as being imported and was also charging premium prices. His next employer, an outfitter of steamships and hotels, went out of business in the 1860s, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Civil War affected the business. Law struggled through unemployment, and even while working, pay was low. At one point, Law was employed at a store and was making eight dollars a week.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Revolutionary War {{began in}} 1775, the Ohio River marked a tenuous {{border between the}} American colonies and the American Indians of the Ohio Country. Ohio Indians—Shawnees, Mingos, Delawares, and Wyandots—were divided over {{how to respond to}} the war. Some Indian leaders urged neutrality, while others entered the war because they saw it as an {{opportunity}} to halt the expansion of the American colonies and to regain lands previously lost to the colonists.|$|E
5|$|A {{new article}} about the Turk did not turn up until 1899, <b>when</b> <b>The</b> <b>American</b> Chess Magazine {{published}} {{an account of the}} Turk's match with Napoleon Bonaparte. The story was basically a review of previous accounts, and a substantive published account would not appear until 1947, when Chess Review published articles by Kenneth Harkness and Jack Straley Battell that amounted to a comprehensive history and description of the Turk, complete with new diagrams that synthesized information from previous publications. Another article written in 1960 for American Heritage by Ernest Wittenberg provided new diagrams describing how the director sat inside the cabinet.|$|E

5|$|Because the Columbia was at {{the same}} {{latitude}} as {{the headwaters of the}} Missouri River, there was some speculation that Gray and Vancouver had discovered the long-sought Northwest Passage. A 1798 British map showed a dotted line connecting the Columbia with the Missouri. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark charted the vast, unmapped lands of the American West in their overland expedition (1803–05), they found no passage between the rivers. After crossing the Rocky Mountains, Lewis and Clark built dugout canoes and paddled down the Snake River, reaching the Columbia near the present-day Tri-Cities, Washington. They explored a few miles upriver, as far as Bateman Island, before heading down the Columbia, concluding their journey at the river's mouth and establishing Fort Clatsop, a short-lived establishment that was occupied for less than three months.|$|E
5|$|Born {{in rural}} Connecticut, Allen had a {{frontier}} upbringing but also received an education that included some philosophical teachings. In the late 1760s he {{became interested in}} the New Hampshire Grants, buying land there and becoming embroiled in the legal disputes surrounding the territory. Legal setbacks {{led to the formation of}} the Green Mountain Boys, whom Allen led in a campaign of intimidation and property destruction to drive New York settlers from the Grants. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Revolutionary War broke out, Allen and the Boys seized the initiative and captured Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. In September 1775 Allen led a failed attempt on Montreal that resulted in his capture by British authorities. First imprisoned aboard Royal Navy ships, he was paroled in New York City, and finally released in a prisoner exchange in 1778.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stanwix {{occupied}} a strategic western portage {{known as the}} Oneida Carrying Place (site of modern Rome, New York) between the Mohawk River, which flowed southeast to the Hudson River, and Wood Creek, whose waters ultimately led to Lake Ontario. Built by the British in 1758 during the French and Indian War on the only dry ground in the area, the fort had fallen into disrepair. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Revolutionary War widened in 1776 to include the frontier areas between New York and the Province of Quebec, the site again became strategically important.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{inclement weather}} also {{hampered}} the Americans' advance, and until May 15 the recapturing forces were unsure {{of whether the}} Japanese had held their position or retreated. When the fog lifted on that day, {{it became clear that}} the Japanese had retreated further west. However, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> forces gave chase, they were immediately slowed by an accidental air strike upon them by an American aircraft. By May 29, the Japanese forces numbered only 700–1,000, and these troops attempted to run through the advancing American forces as a last show of defiance against the recapturing forces. By May 30, the Americans had recaptured Attu, and although a few small pockets of Japanese troops remained on the island, the Battle of Attu had essentially concluded.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, McAleer became player-manager of the Cleveland Lake Shores (a {{predecessor}} of the Cleveland Indians) {{and continued}} with the franchise in 1901, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> League {{became a major}} league and the club was renamed as the Blues, a name borrowed from a team that {{had participated in the}} National League during the 1870s and 1880s. The Blues made their major league debut on April 24, 1901, with an 8–2 loss to the Chicago White Sox. Two other league games were canceled due to inclement weather, and the contest between the Blues and White Sox served as the inaugural game of the AL.|$|E
5|$|In March–April 1918, Battleship Division Nine escorted the Scandinavian Convoy {{two more}} times. Both {{missions}} were hampered by storms {{that made the}} going particularly slow, but were otherwise uneventful. Still, confidence in the wisdom of using battleships as an escort was fading at the Admiralty, and Admiral Beatty in particular was opposed to it. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> ships returned to the new Grand Fleet base at Rosyth {{at the end of}} the second mission on 20 April, it was the last time they were used to escort the Scandinavian Convoy.|$|E

50|$|The first bombing raids killed over 1,000 {{civilians and}} only 23 German soldiers. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> {{returned}} later and used napalm, they destroyed {{the entire city}} and killed another 1,700 civilians.|$|R
5|$|Marcelo Adonay (organist), Simplicio Solis (organist), Diego C. Perez (pianist), Jose Conseco (pianist) and Doña Dolores Paterno (composer) {{were some}} of the {{recognized}} musicians in this era. Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and going out of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December, The Washington Post {{reported}} an incident involving Montanan. While {{headed down the}} Pacific coast of Mexico with a cargo of dried fruits and canned goods, Montanan was approached by a Japanese warship, which fired a warning shot for Montanan to stop. After doing so, a boarding party with Japanese officers in a launch headed to Montanan. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> identity of Montanan was established {{to the satisfaction of}} the Japanese, they returned to their ship without boarding Montanan. The news report did not identify the type or the name of the Japanese warship, which had been searching for a German vessel thought to be operating in the area.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{concerns}} {{have focused on}} international communication on cultivated plant taxonomy, organisation of international symposia, and general communication on topics of interest. In 1988 a Horticultural Taxonomy Group (Hortax) was formed in the UK and a parallel organisation, the Nomenclature and Registration Working Group of the Vaste Keurings Commissie in the Netherlands. One development promoting discussion was the newsletter Hortax News which was superseded in February 2006 by {{the first issue of}} Hanburyana, a journal produced by the Royal Horticultural Society in London and dedicated to horticultural taxonomy. This filled a gap left <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> journal Baileya ceased publication in the early 1990s. Another development was the launch, in 2007, at the Sixth Symposium on the Taxonomy of Cultivated Plants at Wageningen of the International Association for Cultivated Plant Taxonomy. Hortax also publishes Plant Names: A Guide for Horticulturists, Nurserymen, Gardeners and Students.|$|E
