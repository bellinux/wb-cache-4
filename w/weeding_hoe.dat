Hand weeding exposes workers to sustained static loading to spinal soft tissues, {{which can lead to}} the initiation of a cycle of inflammatory response. Assessment of injury risks and investigation of current and new methods of manual weeding are the focus of this study. Nine subjects (7 males and 2 females) participated in this study. Trunk kinematics were monitored while workers performed four weeding tasks using different methods; long- and short-handled <b>weeding</b> (<b>hoe</b> and weed Puller), hand weeding, and a newly developed "Eater". The Eater consists of two conveyor belts working simultaneously in an intermesh design to simulate the pulling and grabbing action of the hands. Hoe weeding is considered a less hazardous alternative to hand weeding with regards to back injuries but, our results showed otherwise. The worker’s sagittal position with the hoe weeding was not significantly different from the short-handled tool. Also, workers weeding with the hoe displayed the highest trunk velocities. On the other hand, the Eater showed promising results by significantly reducing biomechanical risk factors. However, productivity results are not as promising...|$|E

40|$|Weeds {{are a major}} {{constraint}} to rice {{production in}} labor-limited, upland rice-based systems in West Africa. The effects of weeding regimes and rice cultivars on weed growth and rice yield were investigated at two upland locations (Abomey-Calavi and Niaouli) in the degraded coastal savanna zone of Benin in 2005 and 2006 with below-average rainfall. Four <b>weeding</b> regimes (<b>hoe</b> <b>weeding</b> at 21 d after sowing [DAS], delayed <b>hoe</b> <b>weeding</b> at 31 DAS, <b>hoe</b> <b>weeding</b> at 21 and 42 DAS, and a no weeding control) were the main plot treatments. Cultivars comprising three interspecific upland rice cultivars (NERICA 1, NERICA 2, and NERICA 7) and the parents (Oryza sativa WAB 56 - 104 and O. glaberrima CG 14) were tested in subplots. The most dominant weed species identified were Jamaican crabgrass, Mariscus, and silver spinach. Rice yield was generally low because of drought stress; none of the experiments had a higher mean yield than 1, 400 kg ha- 1 across cultivars. Across cultivars, the best weeding regimes in terms of weed control and rice yields were single weeding at 31 DAS (W 31) and double weeding at 21 and 42 DAS (W 21 + 42). Under these weeding regimes, WAB 56 - 104 out-yielded the three NERICA cultivars. CG 14 showed the strongest weed suppressive ability (WSA) in Abomey-Calavi but did not have strong WSA in Niaouli because of lower biomass accumulation.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the impact of tillage system in combination with different herbicides on weed density, diversity, crop growth and yields on 18 farms in Kadoma, Zimbabwe. Experiments were set up as a split plot design with three replications on each farm. Tillage was the main plot (Conservation Tillage (CT), Conventional Tillage (CONV)) and weeding option (hand weeding, cyanazine, atrazine, glyphosate only and mixture of cyanazine + alachlor and atrazine + alachlor) as the sub-plots. Due to the heterogeneous nature of farmers' resource base, the farms were grouped into three farm types: high (Type 1), medium (Type 2) and poorly resourced farmers (Type 3). The hand <b>hoe</b> <b>weeded</b> treatments had 49 percent higher total weed densities in CT relative to CONV, and was statistically similar to the glyphosate treatment. The mixed pre-emergence herbicides reduced the diversity indices by 69 and 70 percent {{when compared to the}} hand <b>hoe</b> <b>weeded</b> treatment under CT in cotton and maize, respectively. The effectiveness of all pre-emergence herbicides were not influenced by tillage but were affected by farmers resource endowments with pronounced effect in Farm Type 1. Maximum plant heights of 85 and 238 cm were recorded for mixed pre-emergence herbicides under CT for cotton and maize, respectively. Minimum plant heights of 75 and 217 cm were recorded for the respective hand <b>hoe</b> <b>weeded</b> treatments.

The experiment was conducted in a B. decumbens established pasture, where hybrid eucalyptus urograndis (clone GG 100) was planted, spaced 8 x 3 m. A randomized block design was used, with six replicates. Treatments consisted of five crown diameters (0. 0, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, and 3. 0 m) surrounding the eucalyptus plants. Five <b>weeding</b> <b>hoes</b> were performed throughout the experiment, according to the different crown diameters, aiming to maintain the eucalyptus plants free from B. decumbens interference.

The trials consisted of factorial combinations of eight weed control treatments which include application of proprietary mixtures of (Atrazine + Acetochlor + Terbuthylazine {{at a ratio of}} 1 : 1 : 1, Atrazine + Metolachlor at a ratio of 1 : 2 each at 3. 0 and 4. 0 kg a. i/ha, Atrazine at 4. 0 and 5. 0 kg a. i/ha, <b>Hoe</b> <b>weeded</b> at 3 and 6 weeks after sowing and a weedy check) with four cow dung manure levels at (0, 4, 8 and 12 t/ha and a recommended NPK mineral fertilizer check at the rate of 120 kg N, 26 kg P and 50 kg K/ha. The treatments were laid out in a split plot design with three replicates.

40|$|Constraints to {{effective}} weed management {{may be the}} main reason for the small area under minimum tillage (MT) in smallholder farming in southern Africa. The effect of maize residue mulching and intensity of hand <b>hoe</b> <b>weeding</b> on the growth of weeds, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata cv. IT 86 D- 719) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor cv. Macia) was investigated in the fifth and sixth years of a conservation agriculture (CA) field experiment at Matopos Research Station (28 ° 30. 92 ′E, 20 ° 23. 32 ′S). The experiment was a split-plot randomized complete block design with three replications. Tillage was the main plot factor (conventional tillage – mouldboard plough compared against MT systems – ripper tine and planting basins) and maize residue mulch rate (0, 4 and 8 t ha− 1) the sub-plot factor. <b>Hoe</b> <b>weeding</b> was done either four times (high weeding intensity) or twice (low weeding intensity) during the cropping season. Planting and weeding were done {{at the same time in}} all treatments. There was markedly greater early season weed growth in MT systems relative to mouldboard plough (MBP) in both crop species. In sorghum, MT (planting basins: 40. 3 kg ha− 1; ripper tine: 34. 8 kg ha− 1) systems had higher cumulative weed biomass measured after planting than MBP (29. 9 kg ha− 1) system. Maize mulching was generally associated with increased mid- to late-season weed growth in the two crops probably due to improved soil moisture conservation during periods of low precipitation. Weed suppression by the maize mulch was observed only in sorghum and limited to early in the cropping season with no effect observed for the remainder of the sorghum rotation phase. The high weeding intensity treatment had lower weed growth in both crops and better sorghum yield than low weeding intensity. The MT systems had poor crop establishment which translated into low yields. Cowpea grain yield obtained from MT systems was less than 300 kg ha− 1 compared to 413 kg ha− 1 in MBP. The poor sorghum establishment in MT systems translated into low grain yield as sorghum grain yield was lowest in planting basins (2602 kg ha− 1) and highest in MBP with 4159 kg ha− 1. Results suggest that CA systems require early and frequent <b>hoe</b> <b>weeding</b> even after four years to reduce weed infestations and improve crop growth. This higher demand on a smallholder household's limited labor supply throughout the cropping season will be a key determinant of the spread and adoption of CA in southern Africa...|$|R
40|$|Smallholder {{farmers in}} {{southern}} African countries rely primarily on cultural control and <b>hoe</b> <b>weeding</b> to combat weeds, but often times, {{they are unable}} {{to keep up with the}} weeding requirements of the crop because of its laboriousness, causing them to incur major yield losses. Optimisation of crop planting pattern could help to increase yield and suppress weeds and to reduce the critical period of weed control and the weeding requirements to attain maximum yield. Experiments were carried out in Zimbabwe during two growing seasons to assess the effect of maize density and spatial arrangement on crop yield, growth and seed production of weeds and to determine the critical period for weeding. Planting maize at 60 cm row distance achieved higher yields and better weed suppression than planting at 75 or 90 cm row distance. Increasing crop densities beyond the customary three to four plants m- 2 gave modest reductions in weed biomass but also diminished crop yields, probably because of increased competition for water and nutrient resources. Maize planted in narrow rows (60 cm) intercepted more radiation and suffered less yield reduction from delaying <b>hoe</b> <b>weeding</b> than those planted in wider rows (75 or 90 cm), and the duration of the weed-free period required to attain maximum grain yield was 3 weeks shorter in the narrow spacing than that in the 75 - and 90 -cm row spacings. Weeding was more effective in curtailing weed seed production in the narrow row spatial arrangements than in the wide row planting. The results of these studies show that narrow row spacings may reduce weeding requirements and increase yield...|$|R
40|$|A {{participatory}} rural appraisal {{was performed}} {{in order to identify}} farmers’ pearl millet production constraints, preferred varietal traits and their knowledge about Striga hermonthica. This was conducted in Dutse (Madobi and Kudai), Birninkudu (Kantoga and Kafingana) and Kiyawa (Karfawa and Shuwarin) local governments of Jigawa state Nigeria. Questionnaires and focus group discussion were used to gather information from 143 respondents. Results shows that the five most important traits selected were resistance to Striga infestation, resistance to downy mildew, tolerance to shattering, good quality local beverage, and tolerance to lodging. The major constraints to production across all the districts were low soil fertility, Striga, downy mildew, and high labour costs. Farmers had a good knowledge about Striga and their control methods across the locations were hand-pulling and or <b>hoe</b> <b>weeding...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{pineapple}} fields, weed {{competition is}} exacerbated {{by the fact that}} the crop is small and has a very slow vegetative development. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of herbicides on growth, yield and quality of pineapple, cultivar 'Pérola'. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with four treatments and four replications. Treatments consisted of <b>weeding</b> by <b>hoe</b> and the herbicides diuron; fluazifop-p-butyl and atrazine + S-metolachlor applied in post-emergence. The characteristics evaluated monthly during the vegetative stage were stem diameter, D-leaf length, number of leaves, number of emitted leaves and percentage of natural floral induction. In the reproductive phase, evaluations were made of average fruit weight (g) with and without crown, fruits length and diameter, number of slip, slip-sucker and sucker type seedlings, determination of soluble solids and pH in the pulp. There was no effect of herbicide treatment on the vegetative growth characteristics. Stem diameter increased until 330 days after planting, showing a decrease after this period. The D-leaf grew over time in all treatments, although phytotoxicity symptoms were observed after the first application of herbicides. The traits evaluated on the reproductive phase showed no significant differences in response to treatments. Therefore, the use of diuron fluazifop-p-butyl and atrazine + S-metolachlor did not affect growth, yield and fruit quality of pineapple, cultivar 'Pérola'...|$|R
50|$|The changed {{social attitudes}} is {{reflected}} by the occupational structure in 2011. Whilst men dominate ‘skilled trades’ (labour jobs that require specific training such as a carpenter or electrician), more women work in ‘professional occupations’ than men. The fact that more women in Finningham work in the tertiary sector highlights {{the difference in the}} role of women in society between 1881 and 2011. 77 women had an ‘unknown occupation’ in 1881, whereas only 0.6% are unemployed or have never worked in 2011. 'In the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s and 1990s, it became increasingly diﬃcult to ﬁnd women to <b>hoe,</b> <b>weed,</b> pick stones, and the like, work which on the whole was neither skilled nor unduly heavy'. This, combined with increasing mechanisation and changing patterns of land use meant that the demand for such jobs declined, so women had to find work in the manufacturing and tertiary sectors.|$|R
40|$|Speargrass (Imperata cylindrica) is {{difficult}} to control in the tropics. Farmers allocate {{most of their time}} and labour to weeding speargrass. We investigated in a joint experiment concluded with farmers, how effectively grain legumes suppress speargrass, and the relationships between speargrass suppression, legume grain yield, and subsequent maize yield. Without management, speargrass shoots and rhizomes increased with 31 and 17 % per month, respectively. The integration of deep ridging, deep <b>hoe</b> <b>weeding</b> and shading suppressed speargrass more effectively than farmers' practices. Creeping varieties of cowpea that produced most biomass were most successful in suppressing speargrass and in enhancing subsequent maize yields, but erect cowpea cultivars produced more grain. Farmers traded off cowpea yield against speargrass suppression to bridge the hungry gap. They preferred the erect cowpea cultivar wan. The need to forego a harvest and the fact that pigeonpea is not consumed in the area makes pigeonpea presently unsuitable for integration into the cropping system...|$|R

Os tratamentos foram: 1 - capina em área total; 2 - grade nas entrelinhas e herbicida nas linhas de plantio; 3 - capina em área total + subsolagem; 4 - subsolagem + feijão-de-porco (Canavalia ensiformis) nas ruas da cultura; 5 - Subsolagem + crotalária (Crotalaria juncea) nas ruas da cultura; 6 - subsolagem + caupi (Vigna uguiculata) nas ruas da cultura; 7 - subsolagem + calagem + gesso agrícola e feijão-de-porco nas ruas da cultura; 8 - subsolagem + vegetação nativa nas ruas da cultura, roçada quando necessária. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi em blocos casualizados, com três repetições. Cada parcela foi composta por 36 plantas das quais 16 úteis, em espaçamento de 3 x 2 m. A subsolagem foi realizada de forma cruzada antes do plantio nos tratamentos correspondentes. As leguminosas foram plantadas em maio/junho e roçadas em setembro/outubro. O controle do mato nas linhas foi mecânico (T 1 e T 3) e químico com glifosato na dose de 1 % v/v nos demais. Os tratamentos manejados nas entrelinhas da cultura do mamão com leguminosas proporcionaram as maiores alterações nas propriedades físicas de um Latossolo Amarelo álico coeso.

The statistical design was randomized blocks with three replications. Experimental plots contained 36 plants, of which 16 useful, in spacing 3 x 2 m. The treatments with subsoiling was performed in the experimental area in a crossed way before the planting. Leguminous plants were sowed in May/June and mowed in September/October. The weed control in rows was mechanical (T 1 and T 3) and chemical with glyphosate at dosages of 1 % (v/v) in the other treatments.
