Kimlinger gave unreserved praise for Production I.G's illustration and animation, only faulting the CGI segments and expression limitations of CLAMP's character designs. He also praised Satō's musical score. THEM Anime gave the film 3/5 stars, enjoying its animation quality and action choreography despite some pacing issues.
