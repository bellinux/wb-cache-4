500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hell</b> of a journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
