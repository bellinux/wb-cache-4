"On my return, {{he asked}} me how she was, and I answered, half in a dream, 'Oh, bonny, she's trying to read a little,' and he raised himself on his elbow and called out to her, and for answer there came back silence--not the silence that is silence, but the silence that is as a voice.

Are they stronger than I?--Ought I not to fear them, to try to please them, to keep them favourable to me?" ...|$|E
60|$|I'd better explain <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that.</b> There was a girl. Now, a girl, {{as far as}} I am concerned, is a {{thing that}} belongs in a seminary or an album; but I conceded the {{existence}} of the animal in order to retain Kerner's friendship. He showed me her picture in a locket--she was a blonde or a brunette--I have forgotten which. She worked in a factory for eight dollars a week. Lest factories quote this wage by way of vindication, I will add that the girl had worked for five years to reach that supreme elevation of remuneration, beginning at $1.50 per week.|$|E
60|$|ELLIE. Of course I shall {{get over}} it. You don't suppose I'm {{going to sit}} down and die of a broken heart, I hope, or be an old maid living on a pittance from the Sick and Indigent Roomkeepers' Association. But my heart is broken, all the same. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> is that I know that what has {{happened}} to me with Marcus will not happen to me ever again. In the world for me there is Marcus {{and a lot of other}} men of whom one is just the same as another. Well, if I can't have love, that's no reason why I should have poverty.

Since first I saw Clara Desmond, the only wish of {{my life has been}} that I might have her for my wife. I have longed for her as a child longs--if you know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that.</b> When I saw that she was old enough to {{understand}} what love meant, I told her what was in my heart, and she accepted my love. She swore to me that she would be mine, let mother or brother say what they would. As sure as you are standing there a living man she loved me with all truth. And that I loved her--! Herbert, I have never loved aught but her; nothing else!--neither man nor woman, nor wealth nor title. All I ask is that I may have that which was my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘My picture,’ Mr. Grewgious proceeded, ‘goes on to {{represent}} (under correction from you, Mr. Edwin), the true lover as ever impatient {{to be in}} the presence or vicinity of the beloved object of his affections; as caring very little for his case in any other society; and as constantly seeking that. If I was to say seeking that, as a bird seeks its nest, I should make an ass of myself, because that would trench upon what I understand to be poetry; and I am so far from trenching upon poetry at any time, that I never, to my knowledge, got within ten thousand miles of it. And I am besides totally unacquainted with the habits of birds, except the birds of Staple Inn, who seek their nests on ledges, and in gutter-pipes and chimneypots, not constructed for them by the beneficent hand of Nature. I beg, therefore, to be understood as foregoing the bird’s-nest. But my picture does represent the true lover as having no existence separable from that of the beloved object of his affections, and as living at once a doubled life and a halved life. And if I do not clearly express <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that,</b> it is either for the reason that having no conversational powers, I cannot express what I mean, or that having no meaning, I do not mean what I fail to express. Which, {{to the best of my}} belief, is not the case.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, nay, {{it shall}} be my fault now. Whose {{it shall be}} in future, Vivian, time will show. My dear Vivian, you have now spent upwards of a year under this roof, and your conduct has been as correct as the most rigid parent might require. I have not wished to {{interfere}} with the progress of your mind, and I regret it. I have been negligent, but not wilfully so. I do regret it; because, whatever may be your powers, Vivian, I at least have the advantage of experience. I see you smile at a word which I so often use. Well, well, were I to talk to you for ever, you would not understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> single word. The time will come when you will deem that single word everything. Ardent youths in their closets, Vivian, too often fancy that they are peculiar beings; and I {{have no reason to believe}} that you are an exception to the general rule. In passing one whole year of your life, as you have done, you doubtless imagine that you have been spending your hours in a manner which no others have done before. Trust me, my boy, thousands have done the same; and, what is of still more importance, thousands are doing, and will do, the same. Take the advice of one who has committed as many, ay more, follies than yourself; but who would bless the hour that he had been a fool if his experience might be of benefit to his beloved son." ...|$|E

You {{will not}} wonder <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> when I {{tell you that in}} the light which {{streamed}} from the uncurtained window everything in the room was distinctly visible to me. Was I dreaming, child, or were you indeed assenting to the embrace of the man whose arms were surely around you? Him, I could not see, for his back was turned to the window; but will you laugh at me, I wonder, if I tell you that I felt strangely jealous of him. I am a foolish old man, Margharita, but all the love of my heart is yours, and I had begun almost to look upon you--in my thoughts--as my own child. I cannot bear the thought of giving you up to any one. You will not think me very, very selfish. I have only a few more months to live, and I know that you will not grudge that much out of your future, that you will stay by me to the end. Afterwards, I have no wish save for your happiness; and although I must confess that I had hoped you might have married one of the sons of our own country, still it is you who must choose, and I owe you, or shall owe you soon, too great a debt to press upon you any desire of mine which is not at one with your wishes. But tell me this--Is he an Englishman? Alas! I fear so. Send me a word by the bearer, and tell me; tell me, too, of what family he is, and whether he is noble. But of that I feel already assured, if he be indeed the man to whom your love is given.|$|E
6000|$|Since {{you want}} to know, I will inform you that an eight-stamp water mill, put up and ready for {{business}} would cost about $10,000 to $12,000. Then, the water to run it with would cost from $1,000 to $30,000--and even more, according to the location. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that,</b> is, that water powers in THIS vicinity, are immensely valuable. So, also, in Esmeralda. But Humboldt is a new country, and things don't cost so much there yet. I saw a good water power sold there for $750.00. But here {{is the way the}} thing is managed. A man with a good water power on Carson river will lean his axe up against a tree (provided you find him chopping cord-wood at $4 a day,) and taking his chalk pipe out of his mouth to afford him an opportunity to answer your questions, will look you coolly in the face and tell you his little property is worth forty or fifty thousand dollars! But you can easily fix him. You tell him that you'll build a quartz mill on his property, and make him a fourth or a third, or half owner in said mill in consideration of the privilege of using said property--and that will bring him to his milk in a jiffy. So he spits on his hands, and goes in again with his axe, until the mill is finished, when lo! out pops the quondam wood-chopper, arrayed in purple and fine linen, and prepared to deal in bank-stock, or bet on the races, or take government loans, with an air, as to the amount, of the most don't care a-d---dest unconcern that you can conceive of. By George, if I just had a thousand dollars--I'd be all right! Now there's the [...] "Horatio," [...] for instance. There are five or six shareholders in it, and I know I could buy half of their interests at, say $20 per foot, now that flour is worth $50 per barrel and they are pressed for money. But I am hard up myself, and can't buy--and in June they'll strike the ledge and then [...] "good-bye canary." [...] I can't get it for love or money. Twenty dollars a foot! Think of it. For ground that is proven to be rich. Twenty dollars, Madam--and we wouldn't part with a foot of our 75 for five times the sum. So it will be in Humboldt next summer. The boys will get pushed and sell ground for a song that is worth a fortune. But I am at the helm, now. I have convinced Orion that he hasn't business talent enough to carry on a peanut stand, and he has solemnly promised me that he will meddle no more with mining, or other matters not connected with the Secretary's office. So, you see, if mines are to be bought or sold, or tunnels run, or shafts sunk, parties have to come to me--and me only. I'm the [...] "firm," [...] you know.|$|E
60|$|I or Henrietta {{must have}} told you {{that one of my}} {{privileges}} has been to see Wordsworth twice. He was very kind to me, and let me hear his conversation. I went with him and Miss Mitford to Chiswick, and thought all the way that I must certainly be dreaming. I saw her almost every day of her week's visit to London (this was all long ago, while you were in France); and she, who overflows with warm affections and generous benevolences, showed me every present and absent kindness, professing to love me, and asking me to write to her. Her novel is to be published soon after Christmas, and I believe a new tragedy is to appear about the same time, 'under the protection of Mr. Forrest.' Papa has given me the first two volumes of Wordsworth's new edition. The engraving in the first is his own face. You might think me affected if I told you all I felt in seeing the living face. His manners are very simple, and his conversation not at all prominent--if you quite understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that.</b> I do myself, for I saw at the same time Landor--the brilliant Landor!--and felt the difference between great genius and eminent talent; All these visions have passed now. I hear and see nothing, except my doves and the fireplace, and am doing little else than [words torn out] write all day long. And then people ask me what I mean in [words torn out]. I hope you were among the six who understood or half understood my 'Poet's Vow'--that is, if you read it at all. Uncle Hedley made a long pause at the first part. But I have been reading, too, Sheridan Knowles's play of the 'Wreckers.' It is full of passion and pathos, and made me shed a great many tears. How do you get on with the reading society? Do you see much or anything of Lady Margaret Cocks, from whom I never hear now? I promised to let her have 'Ion,' if I could, before she left Brighton, but the person to whom it was lent did not return it to me in time. Will you tell her this, if you do see her, and give her my kind regards at the same time? Dear Bell was so sorry not to have seen you. If she had, you would have thought her looking very well, notwithstanding the thinness--perhaps, in some measure, on account of it--and in eminent spirits. I have not seen her in such spirits for very, very long. And there she is, down at Torquay, with the Hedleys and Butlers, making quite a colony of it, and everybody, in each several letter, grumbling in an undertone at the dullness of the place. What would I give to see the waves once more! But perhaps if I were there, I should grumble too. It is a happiness to them to be together, and that, I am sure, they all feel....|$|E

5000|$|The National Rifle Association has criticised {{the tactics}} used by OCT and similar groups.

5000|$|In a pre-release interview, {{scriptwriter}} Orloff said that, {{with the}} exception of whether Shakespeare wrote the plays or not, [...] "The movie is unbelievably historically accurate... <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> is that I, like Henry James, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Derek Jacobi and John Gielgud, don't think Shakespeare wrote the plays, but obviously a lot more people do think Shakespeare wrote the plays. Obviously, in my movie, he didn't, {{so a lot of people}} will say that's not historically accurate and they are totally welcome to that opinion.

5000|$|The {{reason that}} this compels me is, first of all, I can drop {{into a world}} that feels new and, yet, familiar. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> is this: you know the {{characters}} and you've been with them for four years, but you don't know what happened for the last four, and you can drop the audience into new situations. The actors can play closer to their age, and we've {{done a lot of}} what we would do in college in high school, in terms of that accelerated behavior. The other cool thing it does, and this was not by design, I'm not smart enough to design it this way, but the fact that Lucas and his mom and his dad, Dan, the fact that there was history, that we can always reach back and grab a piece of something over the last four years, like what happened with Dan and Karen, what happened before Lucas joined the team, etc. Like we dropped the audience into this world, but there was so much life before that, that you could always go back and grab a piece when you needed it. If Lucas is with a girl that we've never met, or with Peyton, or with Brooke, or living with Haley and Nathan or whatever, how did that happen and what choices framed that? ...|$|E

5000|$|On February 8, 2013, {{the album}} was first {{announced}} on the Strange Music blog. During the preview on the Strange Music blog, Tech N9ne spoke about {{what to expect from}} the album, saying: [...] The beats sound nothing like anything you've ever heard me on. The features that I'm going for are something you would never imagine. All I can say about it now is that it's a very human album. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> is that it's contradictory. On one song I say, 'The saint is ours', like we're in the saint's corner and then I have another song called 'I'm Not A Saint'. It's so beautiful because the King, the Clown, and the G are still present on this album. There's no apologies in what I'm saying. I don't mind that it contradicts itself because that's what people do. The album is everywhere. It feels like it's Hell, Purgatory and Heaven all over again. I'm telling stories that I've never told - that I was afraid to tell on some songs. It's super personal and I've got a big chip on my shoulder again. It's always been there, but it's getting bigger having to prove to fans and critics that we ain't goin' nowhere. Tech N9ne [...] In March 2013, during an interview with The Arizona Daily Wildcat, Tech N9ne revealed the album has divided into three separate parts titled Fire, Water and Earth. The [...] "Fire" [...] section is a darker within the themes while the [...] "Earth" [...] section was shorter and has heavenly themes, similar to Tech's earlier album Anghellic. Tracks 2-10 are the Fire part, 11-13 the Water part and 14-24 the Earth section.|$|E
