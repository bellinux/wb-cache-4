500|$|The two mascots were officially {{introduced}} by Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan on 21 November 2009 at Suntec City. He {{commented that the}} duo are [...] "an interesting play on fire and water". He added that [...] "there are aspects of [...] we clearly can identify with as Singaporeans, but really <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> is these mascots will be embraced by Singaporeans {{as well as the}} visitors who come". Before and throughout the Youth Olympics, the mascots appeared in various activities and programmes, including events in schools, launches and roadshows. The Olympic theme featured in Singapore's 2010 National Day Parade, also held in the month of August, and Lyo and Merly participated in pre-parade activities.|$|E
500|$|Read by all ages, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is {{targeted}} at a teenage audience. The book addresses {{a range of}} themes dispassionately. These themes include drugs, friendship, body image, first love, suicide, eating disorders and sexuality. Chbosky appreciates the importance of entertainment in adolescence: [...] "Books, songs, and movies are more than entertainment when we're young. They help all of us discover who we are, what we believe, and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> our life can be." [...] As such, the book contains several cultural references across all mediums: musically the book references The Smiths and Fleetwood Mac, literarily the book references This Side of Paradise, On the Road, To Kill a Mockingbird and theatrically the book references The Rocky Horror Picture Show.|$|E

Welcome to the Universe. With a powerful line up of phenomenally talented opening bands and having an environmentally acceptable 'green' tour, we are looking forward to yet another chance for us to share something unique with our family of fans that have supported us so passionately and also invite and introduce many others to the world of Thirty Seconds to Mars. Taking this approach gives us the opportunity to set an example and share with others the possibilities of real alternatives for a safer, cleaner world. We will see you all very soon for what will be an exciting, chaotic circus of insanity, and an unforgettable tour." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{because of}} this hope we hold, we may never exist harmoniously in a society such as ours {{which is based on}} sin. When {{following}} the Theology of Hope, a Christian should find hope in the future but also experience much discontentment with the way the world is now, corrupt and full of sin. Sin bases itself in hopelessness, which can take on two forms: presumption and despair. [...] "Presumption is a premature, selfwilled anticipation of the fulfillment of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> for from God. Despair is the premature, arbitrary anticipation of the non-fulfillment of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> for from God." ...|$|E

Theo Epstein was quoted as saying that [...] "I think the bullpen is already a strength of the club, but acquiring a pitcher the caliber of Éric Gagné only makes it stronger and helps give us <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> will be a truly dominant bullpen {{for the remainder of the}} year." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Condoleezza Rice criticized Spain for {{not doing}} more to support dissidents in {{communist}} Cuba. American officials were irked {{by the fact that}} Miguel Ángel Moratinos, Minister of Foreign Affairs, chose not to meet with Cuban dissidents during a visit to the United States in April 2007. [...] "There is no secret that we have had differences with Spain on a number of issues, but we have also had very good cooperation with Spain on a number of issues", Rice remarked. Moratinos defended his decision, believing it better to engage with the Cuban regime than by isolating it. [...] "The U.S. established its embargo", he remarked. [...] "We don't agree with it but we respect it. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> is that they respect our policy", Moratinos remarked. [...] "What Spain is not prepared to do is be absent from Cuba. And what the U.S. has to understand is that, given they have no relations with Cuba, they should trust in a faithful, solid ally like Spain." [...] On the relationship between Cuba and Spain, Daniel Fried, U.S. Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, has commented in 2007 that: ...|$|E

Still the work went on through all the centuries, till at last there stood forth to the world a mighty monument of beauty and of truth to command the admiration and inspire the reverence of mankind. So let it be with the British Commonwealth.

The complete statement makes a pile three inches high, and is of no use when it is made except to keep in work thousands of officials to check the returns. Is that administration? By God! we call it so, but we multiply officials by the twenty, and they are not administration. What country is such a fool? Look at our Government offices eaten up with clerks!

60|$|How, then, can {{you make}} the New Year a blessed one for yourselves? I know but one way, my friends. The ancient way. The Bible way. The way by which Abraham, and Jacob, and David, and all the holy men of old, and all the saints, and martyrs, and righteous and godly among men, made their lives blessed among themselves, in spite of sorrow, and misfortune, and distress, and persecution, and torture, and death itself; the one only old way of being blessed, which was from the beginning, and will last for ever and ever, through all worlds and eternities; {{the way of the}} old saints, which St. Paul sets forth in the {{eleventh}} chapter of the Hebrews; and that is, FAITH. Faith, which is the substance of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> for, the evidence of things not seen. Faith, of which it is written, that the just shall live by his faith.|$|E
60|$|Let us then seek {{to impress}} {{year after year}} upon the British Empire an {{inclusive}} and not an exclusive character.

The House has to-night a considerable and important opportunity. If in rejecting this vote of censure, which is so ill-conceived and so little deserved, we choose to adopt the Amendment, we shall have written upon the records of Parliament a profound political truth, which will not, I think, soon be challenged, and which, I believe, will never be overthrown.|$|E

Death is as vain as life; the common impression of it, as false and as absurd. A mere change of circumstances. What more? And how near these spirits are, how conscious, how full of active energy and tender reminiscence and interest, who shall dare to doubt? For myself, I do not doubt at all. If I did, I should be sitting here inexpressibly sad--for myself, not you....|$|R
