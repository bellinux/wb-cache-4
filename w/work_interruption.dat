50|$|The National Theatre of Kosovo {{was founded}} in 1946 in Prizren {{and it was the}} first {{professional}} theatre in Kosovo after the World War II. In the beginning it was called People`s Provincial Theatre and it was placed in the “Partizan” sport center. This object had a very small stage and did not fulfill the basic requirements for a place which could be used as a theatre. The founders of the first professional theatre in Kosovo were Pavle Vugrinac, Milan and Cica Petrovic who gathered young talented actors willing to work for the theatre and named Shefqet Musliu as their general director. After the staff was completed with 14 art enthusiasts who delivered two premiers, People`s Provincial Theatre was officially established on October 7, 1945. The first official show released by this theatre was called “The sugar ball” (Albanian: Topi i sheqerit”) from the author Glishiq which was followed by 16 other successful premiers and two tours across Kosovo.On 1946, the theatre was moved to Pristina, where there was a <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> due to construction of a new theatre facility, meanwhile the young actors working for the theatre spread to search for a job in another active theatre. Two years later, the official rebirth of the theatre was announced by the Ministry of Education and Culture of Serbia on May 1, 1949. Milutin Jansic was named general director and the first show to be performed in the new theatre facility in Pristina two years after the pause was “Most” directed by Dragutin Todic. On 1951 the Law for People`s Provincial Theatre was declared and this made it possible for the theatre to be developed rapidly. There were many new actors who joined the theatre, but in the absence of professional directors, two of them (Abdurrahman Shala and Muharrem Qena) were trained under the supervision of Dobrica Radenkovic and were turned into successful and famous theatre directors and stage managers. During the following years the theatre had very capable general directors such as Azem Shkreli and Ramiz Kelmendi, who developed theatre activity in Kosovo and made the theatre a very important art institution. In the 90s follow the violent Serbian occupation measures in Kosovo, which affected theatrical activity as well. Right after the war, the name of this theatre was changed from Peoples Provincial Theatre to National Theatre of Kosovo.|$|E
40|$|Background. During {{medication}} administration process, including preparation, administration, and documentation, {{there is}} {{high proportion of}} <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> that results in medication administration errors that consequently affect the safety of patients. Thus, {{the main purpose of}} this study was to assess the prevalence of <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> and associated factors during medication administration process. Methods. A prospective, observation-based, cross-sectional study was conducted on 278 nurses. Structure observational sheet was utilized to collect data. EPI Info version 3. 5. 3 and SPSS version 20 software were utilized for data entry and analysis, respectively. Binary and multivariable logistic regression were fitted to identify the associated factors using an odds ratio and 95 % CI. Results. The incidence of <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> was found to be 1, 152 during medication administration process. Of this, 579 (50. 3 %) were major/severe work interruptions. Unit of work, day of the week, professional experience, perceived severity of <b>work</b> <b>interruption,</b> source/initiator of interruption, and secondary tasks were factors significantly associated with major work interruptions at p< 0. 05. Conclusion. In this study, more than half of <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> was major/severe. Thus, the authors suggest raising the awareness of nurses regarding the severity of work interruptions, with special attention to those who have lower work experience, sources of interruption, and secondary tasks by assigning additional nurses who manage secondary tasks and supportive supervision...|$|E

The study utilizes a data set of individual productivity and machine conditions, where each worker faces a chance that her machine breaks down randomly on a daily basis. The analysis finds that compared with a workday with smooth production, experiencing machine breakdown is associated with a decline in individual productivity the following day. The paper dis-cusses possible explanations, including proficiency loss and negative emotion induced by <b>work</b> <b>interruption,</b> for the observed effect. The findings suggest the importance of understanding and managing interruption in the workplace, and contribute to unfold-ing the hidden determinants of productivity at the micro level...|$|E
40|$|Background: The post {{anesthesia}} {{care unit}} (PACU) is a busy {{environment in which}} nurses communicate with patients, family members, and a large team of perioperative professionals. PACU nurses were experiencing an unmanageable number of <b>work</b> <b>interruptions</b> due to a higher patient census which increased the daily surgical caseload. Aim: The purpose of this project was to improve efficiency and nurses’ job satisfaction by making <b>work</b> <b>interruptions</b> manageable in the PACU. Methods: Based on Kotter’s Change Theory, a quality improvement initiative was implemented using {{a change in the}} communication process. Qualitative and quantitative data was gathered in the PACU and on other units with the intervention roll-out. A pre and post-intervention survey was used to evaluate <b>work</b> <b>interruptions</b> and their effects experienced by nurses in the PACU environment. Results: The use of communication technology impacted <b>work</b> <b>interruptions,</b> but not significantly enough to improve nursing efficiency and nurse satisfaction in the PACU. Conclusion and Implications for CNL® Practice: The next step is to recommend adding a CNL® as a surgical nurse liaison (SNL) to the perioperative team. Ideally, a CNL® with excellent communication and quality improvement skills will exemplify the roles of lateral integrator and patient advocate to improve efficiency. This physical solution, coupled with the communicative technology tool being widely integrated to all members of the perioperative team is expected to influence <b>work</b> <b>interruptions</b> and improve nurse satisfaction more dramatically...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the moderating effects of work beliefs in the {{relationship}} between <b>work</b> <b>interruptions</b> and general health, wellbeing and reports of psychosomatic symptoms. Self-report data were gathered from 310 employees from different occupational sectors. Results revealed that beliefs in hard work and morality ethic moderated the positive appraisal of <b>work</b> <b>interruptions</b> and acted as protective factors on impaired general health and wellbeing. The relationship was stronger among employees who endorsed strong beliefs in hard work and did not have regard for morality/ethics as a value. Likewise, beliefs in delay of gratification and morality/ethics moderated positive appraisal of <b>work</b> <b>interruptions</b> and reduced psychosomatic complaints. More specifically, the relationship was stronger among employees who had strong belief in the values of delayed gratification and weaker morality/ethics. These findings indicate that organisations should adopt work ideology or practices focused on work values particularly of hard work, delay of gratification and conformity to morality as protective factors that reduce the impact of <b>work</b> <b>interruptions</b> on employees’ general health and wellbeing...|$|R
40|$|According to the Effort-Recovery model, {{mental or}} {{physical}} detachment from work {{is an important}} mechanism of work related recovery, as delayed recovery {{has been associated with}} range of negative health symptoms. In this paper, we examine whether recovery from work (in the form of mentally disengagement from work) is affected by the concept of ‘work ethic’, which refers to beliefs workers hold about their work and leisure and the effects of experiencing interruptions at work. Two indices of post-work recovery were utilized: problem solving pondering and psychological detachment. The study was conducted with 310 participants employed from diverse occupational sectors. Main effects of positive and negative appraisal of <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> and beliefs were analysed using mediated and moderated regression analysis on problem-solving pondering and detachment. Weakened belief in wasted time as a partial mediator, reduced problem-solving pondering post work when interruptions were appraised as positive, and a high evaluation of leisure partially mediated problem-solving pondering when interruptions were appraised as positive. The results also showed that a high evaluation of centrality of work and leisure moderated the effect of negative appraisal of <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> on elevated problem-solving pondering. Positive appraisal of <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> was related to problem-solving pondering, and the strength of this association was further moderated by a strong belief in delay of gratification. In addition, employees' positive appraisal of <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> was related to work detachment, and the strength of this association was further moderated by strong beliefs in hard work and self-reliance. These findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical implications for employees who are strongly influenced by such work beliefs...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the earnings effect of skill-biased technological change (SBTC), {{focusing on the}} comparison of science and engineering (S&E) and non-S&E occupations. In the analysis, we assert that S&E occupations and non-S&E occupations differ {{in the nature of}} skill requirements and their susceptibility to technological change; and consequently the earnings effects of SBTC also demonstrate a similar impact. For the empirical analysis, the modified Mincerian earnings equations are estimated by quantile regressions as well as the ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage estimation method. Fitted to Korean panel data, the earning-enhancing effect of SBTC is observed for male workers, not only for those in S&E occupations but also for those in non-S&E occupations. Such an effect is not observed for women in S&E occupations, and rather turns even negative for women in non-S&E occupations; envisaging a relatively large occurrence of <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> of married women in Korea, we conjecture that this may reflect women workers' skill deterioration taking place during a <b>work</b> <b>interruption.</b> The earnings effect of SBTC is most apparent for male workers in the higher quantiles of earnings distribution, implying that those who are highly educated and have high unobserved ability gain most from SBTC.

Data was collected through a paper-and-pen questionnaire and 402 complete questionnaires were analyzed using multivariate regression.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This study empirically investigates women’s work inter-ruption {{behavior}} in Taiwan and this behavior’s influence on women’s earnings. The most striking finding from {{our analysis of}} women’s work history patterns is that a husband’s negative attitude toward a working wife will more greatly discourage his wife from attaching to the labor market than will the presence of young children in the family. Thus, {{it is critical to}} educate men to give up their traditional attitudes toward gender roles in order to raise the female labor force participation rate in Taiwan. As to the effect of <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> on earnings, a depreciation rate of 2. 8 % is found for women with at least a high-school level of education, while no penalty of foregone ex-perience is shown for less-educated women. Since this depreciation effect may discourage women from re-entering the labor market, gov-ernment programs encouraging self-employment should be helpful, as self-employed women find it easier to overcome the conflict between family obligations and work needs...|$|E
40|$|Background: Interruptions of {{hospital}} doctors ’ workflow are a frequent stressor, eventually jeopardising quality of clinical performance.

Results: The frequency of workflow interruptions was high, especially on the intensive care unit and emergency ward. Telephones and bleepers were the most frequently recorded type of <b>work</b> <b>interruption.</b> The combined analysis of doctors ’ activities and concurrent workflow interruptions revealed that the likelihood of the occurrence of certain types of interruption depended on the tasks being carried out by the doctor.

40|$|This study investigates how the {{duration}} of the <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> and the labor market status of mothers upon their return affect the division of housework in couples after a birth. By observing several parental leave policy reforms in Britain and West-Germany, this research also explores how extended leave entitlements for mothers influence the division of housework. The analysis uses multilevel multiprocess models for 1220 birth events of British couples and 1785 births to German couples based on data from the British Household Panel Survey (1991 - 2008) and the German Socio-Economic Panel (1985 - 2009). The results suggest that mothers increase their housework hours with every additional month of employment interruption. Mothers' full-time return seems more effective than a short labor market time-out in altering men's housework contributions and reducing the trend towards a more traditional division of housework. Parental leave policy extensions for mothers were associated with the division of housework only indirectly through their impact on the length of women's work interruptions.

40|$|Bone {{lead levels}} for 367 active and 14 retired lead smelter workers were {{measured}} in vivo by X-ray fluorescence in May-June 1994. The bone sites of study were the tibia and calcaneus; magnitudes of concentration {{were used to}} gauge lead body burden. Whole blood lead readings from the workers generated a cumulative blood lead index (CBLI) that approximated the level of lead exposure over time. Blood lead values for 204 of the 381 workers were gathered from workers returning from a 10 -month <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> that ended in 1991; their blood level values were compared to their tibia and calcaneus lead levels. The resulting relations allowed constraints {{to be placed on}} the endogenous release of lead from bone in smelter works. Calcaneus lead levels were found to correlate strongly with those for tibia lead, and {{in a manner consistent with}} observations from other lead industry workers. Relations between bone lead concentration and CBLI demonstrated a distinctly nonlinear appearance. When the active population was divided by date of hire, a significant difference in the bone lead-CBLI slope emerged. After a correction to include the component of CBLI existing before the workers' employment at the smelter was made, this difference persisted. This implies that the transfer of lead from blood to bone in the workers has changed over time, possibly as a consequence of varying exposure conditions...|$|E

30|$|As {{reported}} in column 2 of Table 3, {{the results are}} quite different {{when it comes to}} the effects of work absences for men. The negative effect of a spell of unemployment on wages is between 0.2 and 0.5 % and not significant in the short and long term. 26 While we find that at the mean, women experience a 2 % loss in wages in the short term, men do not. As we control for education, work experience, hours of work and individual fixed effects in both regressions, these estimates are for similar workers. When we look again at the results for men, non-work in the short term leads to a loss of 1.4 – 1.9 % if the spell occurred during the most recent two years. In the longer term, the loss decreases to 0.6 % but remains significant. Interesting are the findings on the category of work absence that captures work interruptions or compulsory service. We find that a spell of <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> during the current year leads to a wage gain of 3.2 % on the return to work. If more time has passed since the interruption, the wage effects do not contain a clear pattern. Only in the short term is the effect significant and positive. The size of the effect is quite substantial as it amounts to slightly less than half of the annual return to recent work experience (3.2 compared with 7.2 %). A positive effect is consistent with human capital theory if compulsory service teaches general skills that can be used in the main job as a skilled worker.|$|E
40|$|The growing need of {{responsiveness}} {{for manufacturing}} companies facing the market volatility raises a strong demand for flexibility in their organization. This flexibility {{can be used}} to enhance the robustness of a baseline schedule for a given programme of activities. Since the company personnel are increasingly seen as the core of the organizational structures, they provide the decision-makers with a source of renewable and viable flexibility. First, this work was implemented to model the problem of multi-period workforce allocation on industrial activities with two degrees of flexibility: the annualizing of the working time, which offers opportunities of changing the schedules, individually as well as collectively. The second degree of flexibility is the versatility of operators, which induces a dynamic view of their skills and the need to predict changes in individual performances as a result of successive assignments. The dynamic nature of workforce’s experience was modelled in function of learning-by-doing and of oblivion phenomenon during the <b>work</b> <b>interruption</b> periods. We firmly set ourselves in a context where the expected durations of activities are no longer deterministic, but result from the number and levels of experience of the workers assigned to perform them. After that, the research was oriented to answer the question “What kind of problem is raises the project we are facing to schedule?”: therefore the different dimensions of the project are inventoried and analysed to be measured. For each of these dimensions, the related sensitive assessment methods have been proposed. Relying on the produced correlated measures, the research proposes to aggregate them through a factor analysis in order to produce the main principal components of an instance. Consequently, the complexity or the easiness of solving or realising a given scheduling problem can be evaluated. In that view, we developed a platform software to solve the problem and construct the project baseline schedule with the associated resources allocation. This platform relies on a genetic algorithm. The model has been validated, moreover, its parameters has been tuned to give the best performance, relying on an experimental design procedure. The robustness of its performance was also investigated, by a comprehensive solving of four hundred instances of projects, ranked according to the number of their tasks. Due to the dynamic aspect of the workforce’s experience, this research work investigates a set of different parameters affecting the development of their versatility. The results recommend that the firms seeking for flexibility should accept an amount of extra cost to develop the operators’ multi functionality. In order to control these over-costs, the number of operators who attend a skill development program should be optimised, as well as the similarity of the new developed skills relative to the principal ones, or the number of the additional skills an operator may be trained to, or finally the way the operators’ working hours should be distributed along the period of skill acquisition: this is the field of investigations of the present work which will, in the end, open the door for considering human factors and workforce’s flexibility in generating a work baseline program...|$|E
