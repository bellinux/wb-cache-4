500|$|Vince Gilligan, {{who wrote}} the episode, was {{inspired}} by Cops, which he describes as a [...] "great slice of Americana." [...] Gilligan first pitched the idea to the X-Files writing staff and to series creator Chris Carter during the show's fourth season. Carter was concerned that the concept was too [...] "goofy". Fellow writer and producer Frank Spotnitz concurred; however, he was more uncomfortable with Gilligan's idea of using videotape instead of film to shoot the episode. The show's production crew liked to use film to create [...] "effective scares", and Spotnitz worried that shooting exclusively on videotape would be too challenging as the series {{would be unable to}} cut and edit the final product. However, during the show's seventh season, Carter relented. Many critics and fans believed, erroneously, that the seventh season of The X-Files would be the show's last. Similarly, Carter felt that the show had nearly run its course. Seeing the potential in Gilligan's idea, he decided to green-light the episode. Gilligan noted that [...] "the longer we've been on the air, the more chances we've taken. <b>We</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the show fresh... I think [...] appreciates that". [...] "X-Cops" [...] was not Gilligan's first attempt at writing a cross-over. Almost three years before, he had been working on a script that would involve a story being presented by Robert Stack of Unsolved Mysteries, with unknown actors playing Mulder and Scully. This script was later aborted, and re-written as the fifth season episode [...] "Bad Blood".|$|E

When we would tour for two years even the most resilient person in the band, at the end of that, was fucking miserable." [...] He further elaborated on their ideas in an interview with MTV saying, [...] "We do have a really great head start. We've got some great music, some good ideas.

[...] Shinoda told Complex that they spent a year in making the album, as well as elaborating on the album's sound, saying that [...] "It doesn't lose any of the creativity of the newer stuff and it brings in the energy of the older stuff. It's kind of a comprehensive sound. I feel like we've been able to take all the stuff we've learned on the way and put it all together in each song and still keep it fresh and forward-thinking." [...] Shinoda told HitFix that the process of the album [...] "felt like a drug trip...we were looking to redefine everything." ...|$|E

The plaintiffs refused to do so for their daughter, named Little Bird of the Snow, as they claimed use of this number outside her choosing to do so when she came of age, a form of spiritual self-actualization, would violate their religious beliefs. Their belief was that using a social security number to identify her would diminish her spiritual uniqueness and [...] "rob her spirit."
