500|$|On 10 March 2015, Dontnod {{announced}} {{they had already}} completed the story for a possible sequel, Remember Me 2. Dontnod creative director Jean-Maxime Moris said [...] "We know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> for Remember Me 2. The main story has been written {{we know what we}} would add to the recipe. We know what we would fix. It's a game that's ready to be made, but that decision is Capcom's to make". However, Moris added that Dontnod intended to work on another season of Life Is Strange before proceeding with the sequel to Remember Me. A sequel is reportedly no longer viable with Capcom; Dontnod CEO Oskar Guilbert admitted that while [...] " [...] did OK", only Life Is Stranges unexpected success saved the company from [...] "a very difficult" [...] financial situation.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Gray said of her character's persona: I never {{wanted her to be}} boring. She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact is she going to make on her life, on John Ross's life, on her future? Who is she? ...|$|E
500|$|Up {{until the}} middle of 1991, Sega of America had been kept largely uninformed of the details of the project, without a {{functioning}} unit to test (although Sega of America was provided with preliminary technical documents earlier in the year). According to former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham, [...] "When you work at a multinational company, there are things that go well and there are things that don't. They didn't want to send us working Sega CD units. They wanted to send us dummies and not send us the working CD units until the last minute because they were concerned about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> with it and if it would leak out. It was very frustrating." [...] Even though they were not provided a functioning unit, Latham and Sega of America vice president of licensing Shinobu Toyoda put together a functioning Sega CD by acquiring a ROM for the system and installing it in a dummy unit. Further frustrating the Sega of America staff was the construction of the add-on. [...] "The Mega-CD was designed with a cheap, consumer-grade audio CD drive, not a CD-ROM," [...] stated Scot Bayless, former Sega of America senior producer. [...] "Quite late in the run-up to launch, the quality assurance teams started running into severe problems with many of the units—and when I say severe, I mean units literally bursting into flames. We worked around the clock, trying to catch the failure in-progress, and after about a week we finally realized what was happening," [...] citing the need for game titles to utilize more time seeking data than the CD drive was designed to provide.|$|E

2500|$|Childhood friends Eric Lewis and Merwyn Sanders {{were born}} and raised in Chicago, United States. At first, they formed a band called Quadraphonics in middle school, with Lewis on guitar, Sanders on drums, DJ Calvin on bass, and [...] "another friend named Edgwick" [...] on guitar. In high school, only Lewis and Sanders stuck together, a time when they {{acquired}} a drum machine, a Moog synthesizer and other equipment used by the burgeoning Chicago house scene. They had discovered house music at high school parties (like Mendel Catholic High School) and nightclubs such as Ron Hardy's Muzic Box, the Power Plant and The Warehouse; the duo also frequented nightclubs in Toronto, Canada. Sanders recalls: [...] "That was '80 or so, '81. We just started doing a bunch of music at home. At that time we got a 4-track. So, that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> go to school, and we would hang out and do music... and go shoot some ball, then work some more music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nava {{began writing}} the script after {{recording}} the Quintanilla family on their stories about Selena. Suzette informed on how Nava took [...] "hours {{and hours of}} little stories {{of our lives and}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> and how we felt." [...] Nava explained on how some stories [...] "had came out" [...] during his recording sessions with the family and published the first draft on March 4, 1996. The incident where Selena and Perez eloped was written in the draft which Abraham expressed disagreements on it. Citing the singer's popularity with children, he was concerned that they could get the wrong message about elopement as being the best decision. Nava took a few days to persuade Abraham about the scene's content before he agreed to it, noting that Selena's elopement was a major part of her story. He further insisted that his character's embracement after the scene would shade a more positive tone after his earlier negative judgments on Selena and Perez's relationship in the film. Curious on how Nava found out about the elopement, Abraham asked the director and found out that he had interviewed Perez. Abraham discovered that Selena had coaxed Perez into elopement; with earlier assumption that Perez had pressured her into secretly getting married.|$|E
