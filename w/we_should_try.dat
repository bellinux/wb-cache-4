The City Club of Portland held a {{significant}} meeting in 1992 {{about the fate}} of the Central Park Blocks, also called the Commercial Park Blocks. Moyer and the PDC opposed [...] "the downtown parking magnate" [...] Greg Goodman's plans to turn the block into a 550-space 12-story parking structure in 1995, which was to be called the Park Avenue Plaza. Neil Goldschmidt said the parking structure would be [...] "like putting lipstick on a dead corpse" [...] and Bill Naito said that a [...] "12-story garage won't go away.

Hall said that [...] "We [...] attach identities to people, saying, 'It’s too late to reach this person,' or 'This person here, there’s still some good there, so <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> on this one,' or 'This one’s a lost cause, we just need {{to get him out of}} here'.

500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} {{his nose was}} made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The first {{thing that comes to}} mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't have a lot of time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E

Guggenheim said: I've never had so much fun writing a script before ... It was such a blast to work on... I keep telling everyone that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> for Avengers. It's these two heroes together with a big production value. ... There's the opportunity for inside jokes, and seeing all of the characters together. What happens when Cisco gets his eyes on Thea? There are moments like that, that you just can’t do in a normal episode....It's just so much fun. In October 2014, the title of The Flash episode was announced as [...] "Flash vs. Arrow". Kreisberg {{revealed that}} the writers' rooms for both shows were merged while working on the scripts for the episodes, similar to [...] "throwing two casts together".|$|E
500|$|After some {{errors in}} her {{pronunciation}} of Sanskrit shloka [...] "Yoga Taravali" [...] during the song [...] "Shanti/Ashtangi", the BBC arranged for Madonna to take telephonic lessons {{to learn the}} basic correct pronunciation of Sanskrit words from eminent scholar Dr B P T Vagish Shastri. She then made the necessary pronunciation corrections on the album. In an interview with MTV, Madonna recalled the recording of the album, and said her business partner Guy Oseary was a helpful friend, and that after she and Orbit played him the tracks, he, to their dismay, said nothing and left the studio. [...] "He really hates those icy strings. Right when I think the track's done, he sort of pushes us another step further. 'Maybe <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> this', or 'I really don't want to hear that'. And then of course, later on, it creeps in my brain, and I'm like, 'maybe I should have done a background vocal on that'. And then she comes in and happily does it, right?", Madonna said. Orbit also recalled during an interview with Q magazine that Madonna recorded [...] "Swim" [...] the day her friend and fashion designer Gianni Versace was killed in Miami, Florida. He also commented that this is probably why the track has an emotional impact.|$|E

500|$|... "Do or Die" [...] is 1 {{minute and}} 59 seconds long {{and is in}} the key of A major. The {{instruments}} used on the track are tuned slightly sharper than standard. The song begins with an intro featuring a lead guitar and keyboard melody, which plays twice, accompanied by a rhythm guitar riff alternating between A and D chords, drums and bass. The track breaks down to just rhythm guitar, drums and bass for the first verse which begins after 13 seconds. The first chorus begins after 23 seconds with a distorted guitar playing the chord sequence D5, C5, B5 and A5 twice while Rhys sings [...] "If we do or die <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>try,</b> if we don't try I say bye-bye, and if I say bye-bye, I'll wonder why we didn't try to do or die" [...] backed by high harmony backing vocals and occasional keyboard noises. The song breaks down again for a second verse before the second chorus enters at 46 seconds. An instrumental passage follows with the lead guitar and keyboard reprising the melody which plays during the intro. The instrumental leads into a double chorus. At the end of the final chorus the track crescendos, with Rhys singing [...] "yeah, yeah, yeah" [...] and all instruments {{with the exception of the}} keyboard coming to an abrupt silence after 1 minute and 43 seconds. Keyboard noises continue and gradually fade out until the track ends.|$|E

It’ll take some time to come together and everything. To do that, we’d have to, the way the four of us are, we would take quite some time, I think, re-associating ourselves musically, and then just letting it come about naturally, because it would have to be a natural thing.

2500|$|Canadian philosopher Neil McArthur {{writes that}} Hume {{believed}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> to balance our demands for liberty {{with the need}} for strong authority, without sacrificing either. McArthur characterises Hume as a [...] "precautionary conservative", whose actions would have been [...] "determined by prudential concerns about the consequences of change, which often demand we ignore our own principles about what is ideal or even legitimate." [...] Hume supported the liberty of the press, and was sympathetic to democracy, when suitably constrained. American historian Douglass Adair has argued that Hume was a major inspiration for James Madison's writings, and the essay [...] "Federalist No. 10" [...] in particular.|$|E

Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform {{for the first time this}} year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion.

2500|$|Holmes {{held against}} West Virginia's {{claim that the}} amount of debt should be reduced because the debt paid for {{improvements}} outside the boundaries of West Virginia. Although West Virginia was correct in observing that improvements were outside its boundaries, he wrote, the improvements were financed by state bonds and purchases of stock in corporations making the improvements. Since bond sales and stock purchases were made by the state on behalf of all citizens, all citizens shared in the risk and all citizens shared in the benefit. [...] "...we should be lost in futile detail if <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> to unravel in each instance the ultimate scope of the scheme. ... All the expenditures had the ultimate good of the whole state in view. Therefore we adhere to our conclusion that West Virginia's share of the debt must be ascertained in a different way," [...] Holmes concluded. Nor was ascertaining the amount of debt to be left solely to the West Virginia legislature. Holmes pointed out the danger and inequitable nature of such a scheme, and asserted the Court's jurisdiction over the case: ...|$|E
