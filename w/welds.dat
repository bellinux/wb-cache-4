5|$|As {{the weather}} warmed and work resumed {{on the main}} pipeline, Alyeska administrators were distracted by a {{controversy}} about pipeline <b>welds</b> {{that had been done}} the previous year. In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed suit against the company, alleging that he had been laid off because he would not participate in a conspiracy to falsify quality control X-Rays of pipeline <b>welds.</b> The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was unique among pipeline projects to that point in that it required all <b>welds</b> of the main pipeline to be verified by X-Ray. This was a time-consuming process, and the quality-control procedures continually lagged behind the welders.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1975, Alyeska {{terminated}} Ketchbaw's {{contract and}} took responsibility for analyzing weld X-Rays itself. The controversy continued, however, as Kelley's lawsuit moved forward, a Ketchbaw manager was found dead of cyanide poisoning, and photographs of <b>welds</b> {{were stolen from a}} pump station construction camp. Alyeska began a review of all 30,800 <b>welds</b> that had been done in 1975, and submitted its report to the Interior Department in April 1976. In May, it submitted its technical analysis and a report on repair work under way. The review produced a list of 3,955 questionable welds—10 percent of 1975's work.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some <b>welds,</b> known as autogenous <b>welds,</b> do not require it. A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E
50|$|<b>Welding</b> Software is {{a general}} term for <b>welding</b> related software, i.e. {{applications}} addressing variety of topics associated with the <b>welding</b> industry, including base metal selection software, filler metal selection, machine <b>welding</b> settings/instructions, <b>weld</b> automation and tracking, <b>welding</b> code reference, <b>welding</b> documentation (Procedures and Personnel), <b>welding</b> gas distribution & supply, <b>welding</b> health & safety, <b>welding</b> inspection, <b>welding</b> material tracking, <b>weld</b> imaging / measurement, <b>welding</b> patterns and layouts, <b>welding</b> planning, <b>welding</b> production management, <b>welding</b> robotics, <b>welding</b> simulation and optimization, and other categories continuously being introduced.|$|R
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} <b>welding,</b> {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a <b>weld,</b> even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for <b>welding</b> dissimilar materials, such as the <b>welding</b> of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state <b>welding</b> processes include friction <b>welding</b> (including friction stir <b>welding),</b> magnetic pulse <b>welding,</b> co-extrusion <b>welding,</b> cold <b>welding,</b> diffusion bonding, exothermic <b>welding,</b> high frequency <b>welding,</b> hot pressure <b>welding,</b> induction <b>welding,</b> and roll <b>welding.</b>|$|R
25|$|Other arc <b>welding</b> {{processes}} include {{atomic hydrogen}} <b>welding,</b> carbon arc <b>welding,</b> electroslag <b>welding,</b> electrogas <b>welding,</b> and stud arc <b>welding.</b>|$|R
5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of <b>welds</b> and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that <b>welds</b> are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow <b>welds.</b> Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow <b>welds,</b> while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper <b>welds.</b> Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration <b>welds.</b> One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile <b>welds.</b> Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW <b>welds,</b> normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E

5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create <b>welds</b> with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong <b>welds,</b> but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), or {{tungsten inert gas}} (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate filler material.

5|$|The actual welding {{technique}} utilized {{depends on the}} electrode, {{the composition of the}} workpiece, and the position of the joint being welded.

5|$|The welders {{who worked}} on the {{pipeline}} itself came from Pipeliners Local 798 out of Tulsa, Oklahoma, which specialize in providing welders for large-scale pipeline projects. Members of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing, Pipefitting and Sprinkler Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada performed all welding that was {{not a part of the}} pipeline itself, including pump stations, feeder pipelines, and work at the Valdez Marine Terminal. The welders were the highest paid of all the workers on the pipeline, with a normal rate of $18.25 per hour. To be hired on the pipeline project, welders had to go through an intensive certification process that involved a series of test <b>welds.</b> If a welder failed any of the test <b>welds,</b> he was not hired and was not allowed to try again for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass <b>welds</b> for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting <b>welds</b> have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW <b>welds</b> are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E
