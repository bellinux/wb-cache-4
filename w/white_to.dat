5|$|Zugzwang, disadvantageous {{since it}} forces {{a player to}} move, is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game. In the example diagram, either side having the move is in zugzwang: Black to move must play 1...Kb7 {{allowing}} <b>White</b> <b>to</b> promote the pawn after 2.Kd7; <b>White</b> <b>to</b> move must permit a draw, either by 1.Kc6 stalemate or by losing the pawn after any other legal move.|$|E
5|$|Akodon caenosus is the {{smallest}} of the Argentine members of the A.boliviensis group–indeed, among {{the smallest}} of all species of Akodon. The upperparts are uniformly colored, but their tone is variable: generally ochraceous brown, but approaching yellow, red, or olivaceous in some individuals. Reddish tones occur mostly in lactating females. High-altitude animals are generally lighter, but there is also conspicuous variation within populations. The ears are similar to the upperparts, but some individuals have the sides more rich and clear in color. The underparts are clearly different in color, varying from light gray to yellowish or reddish. There are yellowish rings around the eyes, which are more highly developed in high-altitude populations. There are <b>white</b> <b>to</b> yellowish hairs on the fore- and hindfeet. The tail is variably covered with hair and is dark brown above and <b>white</b> <b>to</b> buffy below.|$|E
5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata {{produces}} a <b>white</b> <b>to</b> cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly so, and typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5µm. They are inamyloid, {{meaning that they}} will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14µm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial tips that attach to the spores) are 3–4µm long, and clamps are not found on the bases of basidia.|$|E

5|$|An early {{effort at}} malaria {{prevention}} occurred in 1896 in Massachusetts. An Uxbridge outbreak prompted health officer Dr. Leonard <b>White</b> <b>to</b> write {{a report to}} the State Board of Health, which led to a study of mosquito-malaria links and the first efforts for malaria prevention. Massachusetts state pathologist, Theobald Smith, asked that White's son collect mosquito specimens for further analysis, and that citizens add screens to windows, and drain collections of water.|$|E
5|$|As Kishimoto {{originally}} planned Akatsuki to be {{a group of}} individuals with close to no human characteristics, he decided to make Zetsu half black and half <b>white</b> <b>to</b> emphasize his split personality. In the Japanese anime, Zetsu is voiced by Nobuo Tobita, who also voices the Tobi and the White Zetsu Army. In episode 134 of the English adaptation, Black Zetsu is voiced by Michael Sorich and White Zetsu by Brian Beacock, though in the English Shippuden anime both halves are voiced by Travis Willingham.|$|E
5|$|Bompart's {{squadron}} departed Brest {{late in the}} evening, {{hoping to}} slip past the inshore British blockade in the dark. However, they took too long to navigate the Raz passage, and were spotted at dawn on 17 September by a frigate squadron under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, in HMS Boadicea. Keats immediately divided his forces, ordering HMS Ethalion under Captain George Countess and the brig HMS Sylph under Commander John Chambers <b>White</b> <b>to</b> follow the French force, while Keats brought news of the French movements to Admiral Lord Bridport, admiral of the Channel Fleet.|$|E
50|$|Missouri ex rel. Gaines v.

5|$|Crystalline {{zinc oxide}} is thermochromic, {{changing}} from <b>white</b> <b>to</b> yellow when heated in air and reverting to white on cooling. This color change {{is caused by}} a small loss of oxygen to the environment at high temperatures to form the non-stoichiometric Zn1+xO, where at 800°C, x = 0.00007.|$|E
5|$|For example, Erik Pogosyants {{composed}} the study at right, with <b>White</b> <b>to</b> play and win. His intended main line was 1. Ne3 Rxh2 2. 0-0-0#! A tablebase discovered that 1. h4 also wins for White in 33 moves, even though Black can capture the pawn (which {{is not the}} best move – in case of capturing the pawn black loses in 21 moves, while Kh1-g2 loses in 32 moves). Incidentally, the tablebase does not recognize the composer's solution because it includes castling.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the molds Sepedonium ampullosporum, S.laevigatum, and S.chalcipori. In Sepedonium infections, a <b>white</b> <b>to</b> powdery yellow mold {{covers the}} surface of the fruit body. The {{mushrooms}} are a food source and rearing habitat for several insect species, including the fungus gnats Mycetophila fisherae and M.signatoides, and flies such as Pegomya winthemi and species of the genera Sciophila and Mydaea. The cottontail rabbit species Sylvilagus brasiliensis has been recorded feeding on the mushrooms in Costa Rica.|$|E

5|$|Gasteroid {{fruit body}} types are either roughly spherical or tuberous, {{occasionally}} with stipes, and {{usually have a}} peridium that is either simple or multi-layered. Mature gasteroid fruit bodies generally open irregularly at maturity to expose a powdery gleba with a color ranging from <b>white</b> <b>to</b> yellow or black-brown to black. Capillitia are generally absent from the gleba. Spores are spherical or nearly so, and have a surface texture that ranges from smooth to wart-like and spiny, or sometimes with reticulations. Hyphae have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an {{atmospheric}} feature {{formed in}} the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller. This was created when several smaller, white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single feature—these three smaller white ovals were first observed in 1938. The merged feature was named Oval BA, and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior. It has since increased in intensity and changed color from <b>white</b> <b>to</b> red.|$|E

After evading pursuers, Bond delivers <b>White</b> <b>to</b> M, who interrogates him regarding his organisation, Quantum. M's bodyguard, Craig Mitchell (Glenn Foster), {{is a double}} agent; he attacks M, enabling <b>White</b> <b>to</b> escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering Mitchell had a contact in Haiti, Edmund Slate (Neil Jackson). Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill Camille Montes (Olga Kurylenko) {{at the behest of}} her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric). Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano (Joaquín Cosío), who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow his government and become the new president, in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.|$|E
5|$|Later in the 20th century, as disruptively {{patterned}} uniforms became widespread, winter {{variants of}} patterns such as Flecktarn were developed, the background colour (such as green) being replaced with <b>white</b> <b>to</b> form a Schneetarn (snow camouflage pattern). Aircraft deployed in winter have sometimes been snow camouflaged, as with Sepecat Jaguars on exercise in Norway.|$|E
