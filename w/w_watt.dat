Crestwood sits on 22 acre of open land with a backdrop of dense woods of spruce and pine that are characteristic of the Kawartha district. It neighbors James Strath Public School, which is the largest feeder school for Crestwood. It contains a track just short of 400 metres, two baseball fields, a football field that doubles as soccer fields, a tennis court, a shotput area, and a triple jump area.|$|E
5000|$|The high {{potential}} strength of carbon fiber was realized in 1963 {{in a process}} developed by <b>W.</b> <b>Watt,</b> L. N. Phillips, and W. Johnson at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, Hampshire. The process was patented by the UK Ministry of Defence, then licensed by the NRDC to three British companies: Rolls-Royce already making carbon fiber, Morganite, and Courtaulds. Within a few years, after successful use in 1968 of a Hyfil carbon-fiber fan assembly in the Conways of the Vickers VC10s operated by BOAC, Rolls-Royce {{took advantage of the}} new material's properties to break into the American market with its RB-211 aero-engine with carbon-fiber compressor blades. Unfortunately, the blades proved vulnerable to damage from bird impact. This problem and others caused Rolls-Royce such setbacks that the company was nationalized in 1971. The carbon-fiber production plant was sold off to form [...] "Bristol Composites".|$|E

40|$|In this lecture {{instrumentation}} will {{be interpreted}} as {{the ways and means}} to transport and modify signals SO as to make them suitable for the input channels of human beings and automatic controllers. A difference may be made between measuring and control systems; the first present the value of the measured quantity in an appropriate way, the second also formulate and execute command signals. Modern control theory and techniqucs have an increasing influence on the arts of instrumentation. An important part of all instrumentation systems is the transducers, which convert the value of the signal to be measured to another physical dimension, more suited for transport or evaluation. Typical are the conver-sions to electric voltages, pneumatic or hydraulic pressures. The main requirements for the design of a transducer are a low energy consumption from the measuring source, fast response and low susceptibility to disturbing signals and noise. At the input there exist besides the value of the signal to be measured xm an associate signal ym, such that xmym has the dimension of energy <b>W</b> (<b>watt).</b> The generalized impedance Z is defined as Z = xm/ym, so that W = xm 2 /Z. In general W should be small, requiring Z being large, sometimes approaching infinity. On the other hand, examples will be given wherezmust have a certain specified value. A low value of W can be obtained either by using a very sensitive primary sensor and applying sufficient signal amplification afterwards or by usin...|$|E
