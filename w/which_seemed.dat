5|$|Cattle raising was {{the major}} {{industry}} in the 1840s with sheep becoming predominant in the 1860s. At this time many Victorians settled in the Riverina to breed sheep and cattle to feed the miners {{taking part in the}} Victorian Gold Rush. The herds were considered inferior at first, but these pastures were good for stock, and the land <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> a desert was actually good fattening country.|$|E

5|$|In April 1940, Winston Churchill {{took control}} of the Military Co-ordination Committee, charged with {{overseeing}} all of the military services. He selected Ismay as his chief staff officer, which also gave Ismay the additional responsibility of serving on the Chiefs of Staff Committee. While serving under Churchill had been a life-long dream for Ismay, he was initially sceptical about the duties of his new position, <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> unclear and poorly defined.|$|E

5|$|Baker, de Francisci, and Moore met in Washington on December 15. At that time, Baker, who {{hoped to}} start Peace dollar {{production}} in 1921, outlined the tight schedule {{for this to}} be accomplished, and requested certain design changes. Among these was the inclusion of the broken sword from the sculptor's alternate reverse design, to be placed under the eagle, on the mountaintop on which it stands, in addition to the olive branch. Baker approved the designs, subject to these changes. The revised designs were presented to President Harding on December 19. Harding insisted on the removal of a small feature of Liberty's face, <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> to him to suggest a dimple, something he did not consider suggestive of peace, and the sculptor then did so.|$|E

5|$|Born in Swetes, Antigua, Ambrose came to cricket at a {{relatively}} late age, having preferred basketball in his youth, but quickly made an impression as a fast bowler. Progressing through regional and national teams, he was first chosen for the West Indies in 1988. He was almost immediately successful and remained in the team {{until his retirement in}} 2000. On many occasions, his bowling was responsible for the West Indies winning matches <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> lost, particularly in association with Courtney Walsh. Against Australia in 1993, he took seven wickets while conceding a single run; in 1994 he was largely responsible for bowling England out for 46 runs, taking six for 24 (six wickets for 24 runs).|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price of reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E

5|$|Hugo de Vries {{tried to}} link the new {{genetics}} with evolution; building on his work with heredity and hybridization, he proposed a theory of mutationism, which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. Lamarckism also had many adherents. Darwinism was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by biometricians, <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following {{the acceptance of the}} Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of population genetics, with the work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, unified the idea of evolution by natural selection with Mendelian genetics, producing the modern synthesis. The inheritance of acquired characters was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.|$|E
5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Exclusion Bill would be passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the {{continuing}} Plot trials, <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> to him to indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, {{for a second time}} that year, in mid-1679. Charles's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled; within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days. During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Keeping up {{the longstanding}} {{tradition}} of Massachusetts Bay, Phips {{fought against the}} office of custom inspectors, arguing that the port of Massachusetts did not see enough enumerated goods to warrant their presence. Instead Phips attempted to re-establish a naval office, with himself acting {{as head of the}} admiralty, thereby doling out favors to gain the support of the powerful merchant class. This was part of an old turf battle between the Admiralty and Customs but it led to an altercation with Randolph's custom inspector, Jahleel Brenton, <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> to follow the similar embarrassing and unseemly pattern as his altercation with Captain Short. The two altercations weighed together against Phips. Phips was accused of violating the Navigation Acts, as his predecessor had been. Blathwayt was slowly and steadily working to standardize the flow of tributes from the colonies to the Crown, and if Phips was clogging these pipes he would need to answer for it.|$|E
5|$|Not one of {{the marchers}} even raised an arm {{to fend off the}} blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E
5|$|The humid weather {{meant that}} the game was played at a {{relatively}} slow pace, <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> to favour Porto. This caused a number of rash challenges from Celtic, one of which led to Joos Valgaeren getting a yellow card on 8 minutes. After this {{it was very much}} a stoic affair, until 32 minutes into the first half when Capucho played in Deco, but he could do no more than fire his shot straight at Celtic's goalkeeper Robert Douglas. Straight after this attack Celtic broke on the counter with Henrik Larsson, putting Didier Agathe through on the right, but his cross was too high for Chris Sutton. Larsson had a chance to make it 1–0 on 35 minutes, but from Sutton's assist he was unable to make enough contact with the ball. Porto came close on 41 minutes when Deco moved past Bobo Baldé to go one on one against Robert Douglas, who saved Deco's shot with his legs. Porto finally found a way through on 45 minutes when, after an offensive play from Deco, Derlei followed up Dmitri Alenichev's shot on target, which had been saved by Robert Douglas. This gave Porto a 1–0 lead on the stroke of half time and Derlei's 11th goal of the competition.|$|E
