5|$|Bond novelist Raymond Benson {{wrote his}} {{adaptation}} of The <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> Enough from the film's screenplay. It was Benson's fourth Bond novel {{and followed the}} story closely, but with some details changed. For instance, Elektra sings quietly before her death and Bond still carries his Walther PPK instead of the newer P99. The novel also gave the cigar girl/assassin the name Giulietta da Vinci and retained a scene between her and Renard that was cut from the film.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{locations}} included Spain, France, Azerbaijan, Turkey and the UK, with interiors shot at Pinewood Studios. Despite mixed critical reception, The <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> Enough earned $361,832,400 worldwide. It {{was also}} the first Eon-produced Bond film to be officially released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer instead of United Artists, the original distributor.|$|E
5|$|From Thunderball {{through to}} Die Another Day, the gun barrel {{sequence}} segues into the pre-title sequence {{by having the}} opening shot be sighted through the barrel. Beginning with The Spy Who Loved Me, the teasers emphasised not only action sequences but stunts, a practice that prevailed until Casino Royale. The sequence for The <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> Enough is unusually long: at over fourteen minutes it is {{two to three times}} the length of most others.|$|E

5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} that, {{although}} {{the world may}} be causally independent of the human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> ontologically independent. The general idea is influenced by Kant's idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on the categories of thought.|$|E
5|$|The <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> Enough {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics and was frequently compared to Rare's Nintendo 64 first-person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. It was also considered {{superior to its}} PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Critics generally praised the game's graphics and smooth frame rate, but criticized its weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence. In the United States, the game sold {{more than one million}} copies.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11 attacks, Madonna {{was in an}} introspective {{mood and}} started writing songs for her next studio album, American Life, with {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Recording started in late 2001 but was put on hold as Madonna shot for her film Swept Away in Malta, and also starred in the West End play, Up For Grabs. In the meantime, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was filming the twentieth James Bond film, Die Another Day, directed by Lee Tamahori. The previous film in the franchise, The <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> Enough (1999) was a box office success earning US$362 million worldwide. However, the eponymous soundtrack single by alternative rock group Garbage failed to gain commercial success in the United States. The music management at MGM went {{to look for a}} high-profile artist to write and perform the title song for Die Another Day.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player missions, The <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> Enough features a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete {{against each other in}} different game types, ranging from the traditional deathmatch to objective-based games such as capture the flag or king of the hill. Other game types include Last Agent Standing, where players begin the game with a finite number of lives and must survive until the opposing players exhaust their lives, and Uplink, in which players must find and touch uplink units scattered in key locations of the map to score points. Multiplayer games can be played on 14 different maps and can also include bots. Bots' appearance and amount of health can be changed to match player preference.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the film}} was to be {{released}} in 2000, rumoured to be titled Bond 2000. Other rumoured titles included Death Waits for No Man, Fire and Ice, Pressure Point and Dangerously Yours. The title The <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> Enough is an English translation of the Latin phrase Orbis non sufficit, which in real life was the motto of Sir Thomas Bond. In the novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service and its film adaptation, this is revealed to be the Bond family motto. The phrase originates from the epitaph of Alexander the Great.|$|E
5|$|Joe Dante {{and then}} Peter Jackson were {{considered}} as directors for The <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> Enough. Barbara Broccoli enjoyed Jackson's Heavenly Creatures, and {{a screening of}} The Frighteners was arranged for her. She disliked the latter film, however, and showed no further interest in Jackson. Michael Apted was then selected to lead the film. Writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were hired after their work in Plunkett & Macleane, before Michael Apted and his wife, screenwriter Dana Stevens, undertook an uncredited rewrite. Pierce Brosnan was unhappy with some of Stevens' changes to his character, so Michael G. Wilson—who was also uncredited as screenwriter—and Bruce Feirstein undertook further revisions.|$|E

5|$|Lee died {{of cancer}} in January 1981, four months into the filming of For Your Eyes Only and before any of his scenes could be filmed. Out of respect, no new actor was hired to assume the role and, instead, the script was re-written so that the {{character}} is said to be on leave, with his lines given to either his Chief of Staff Bill Tanner or the Minister of Defence, Sir Frederick Gray. Later films referred to Lee's tenure as head of the service, with a painting of him as M in MI6's Scottish headquarters during the 1999 instalment The <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> Enough.|$|E
5|$|The <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> Enough (1999) is {{the nineteenth}} spy {{film in the}} James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions, and the third to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The film was directed by Michael Apted, with the original story and screenplay written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein. It was produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. The title is taken from {{a line in the}} 1963 novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service.|$|E
5|$|The <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> Enough is a first-person shooter {{based on}} MGM's 1999 James Bond {{film of the}} same name, where the player assumes the role of James Bond through 14 {{missions}} with three difficulty settings. The player {{has the ability to}} run, jump, crouch, swim and dive underwater {{for a short period of}} time. One mission is played as a rail shooter in which the player skis down a mountain. In each mission, the player must complete a number of objectives while defeating enemies controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Objectives range from rescuing hostages to destroying vehicles and collecting items. Some objectives require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, the Keypad Decrypter can be used to decode lock systems, while the ID scanner is useful to copy fingerprints.|$|E

5|$|The {{first film}} {{screening}} in Turkey was at Yıldız Palace in 1896, {{a year after}} the technology publicly debuted in Paris. Movie theaters rapidly cropped up in Beyoğlu, with the greatest concentration of theaters being along the street now known as İstiklal Avenue. Istanbul also became the heart of Turkey's nascent film industry, although Turkish films were not consistently developed until the 1950s. Since then, Istanbul has been the most popular location to film Turkish dramas and comedies. The Turkish film industry ramped up {{in the second half of}} the century, and with Uzak (2002) and My Father and My Son (2005), both filmed in Istanbul, the nation's movies began to see substantial international success. Istanbul and its picturesque skyline have also served as a backdrop for several foreign films, including Topkapi (1964), The <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> Enough (1999), and Mission Istaanbul (2008).|$|E
5|$|The more {{commonly}} spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The {{total number of}} languages in the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus {{is that there are}} between 6,000 and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100. The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones allow {{players to}} freely explore the game world, which is {{typically}} {{on the scale}} of an entire city. Some games base their level design on real world cities, such as London, New York City, and Los Angeles. Players are usually able to navigate by vehicle or on foot. Some games put greater emphasis on leaping, climbing, and even swimming. Exploring the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> just necessary to complete objectives, but also to gain valuable items, weapons, and vehicles. Different parts of the game world may be controlled by different enemy factions, who will attempt to stop the player in a variety of ways. However, more recent games in this genre allow players to acquire their own territory. The freedom of navigating a huge game world may be overwhelming or confusing for new players. Game designers {{have come up with a}} variety of navigational aids to solve this problem. A mini-map feature is common, while Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto IV go so far as to offer a GPS service. Games without these navigation tools are sometimes criticized as confusing.|$|E
