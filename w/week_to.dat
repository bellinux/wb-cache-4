All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer in their classrooms, while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology. An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five hours per <b>week</b> <b>to</b> each of Maltese, English and mathematics, one hour per <b>week</b> <b>to</b> science, two hours per weeks to arts and crafts, two hours per <b>week</b> <b>to</b> social studies, one hour and 15 minutes per <b>week</b> <b>to</b> social studies, and {{two and a half hours}} per <b>week</b> <b>to</b> physical education and religion.

Significant group-specific differences in physical activity diverged and become statistically significant only after week 5, (i.e. group-specific differences during <b>weeks</b> 0 <b>to</b> 4, <b>weeks</b> 5 <b>to</b> 8, and <b>weeks</b> 9 <b>to</b> 12, P[*]=[*] 0.22, P[*]=[*] 0.0004, P[*]<[*] 0.0001, respectively), suggesting that improvements in physical activity behaviours associated with RAS were sustainable.|$|R

5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a <b>week</b> <b>to</b> months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E
