5|$|Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects Moscow <b>with</b> <b>Russian</b> Pacific {{seaports}} such as Vladivostok. From the 1960s {{until the}} early 1990s the railway served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several factors caused {{the use of the}} railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle. One factor is that the railways of the former Soviet Union use a wider rail gauge than {{most of the rest of}} Europe as well as China. Recently, however, the Trans-Siberian has regained ground as a viable land route between the two continents.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with the}} clear hostility of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I, Wallachian revolutionaries sought instead a {{rapprochement}} with the Ottoman leadership. Efforts {{were made to}} clarify that the movement did not seek to reject Ottoman suzerainty: for this purpose, Ion Ghica was sent to Istanbul as early as May 29, 1848; his mission was initially successful, but later events led Sultan Abdülmecid I to reconsider his position, especially after being faced <b>with</b> <b>Russian</b> protests. Süleyman Pașa, Abdülmecid's brother-in-law, was dispatched to Bucharest with orders {{to report on the}} situation and take appropriate measures.|$|E

5|$|After {{almost a}} year of heavy fighting, a large Russian force crossed the Vistula and besieged the capital of Poland on 20 August. Although the siege was {{partially}} lifted soon afterwards and a successful sortie allowed a communication route between {{the city and the}} rest of Poland, a large Russian force remained on the left bank of the Vistula and continued to threaten the city. Russian commander Ivan Paskevich counted on Polish surrender as his Polish counterpart, Jan Krukowiecki, was known {{to be a member of}} the moderate political forces, willing to negotiate <b>with</b> <b>Russian</b> tsar Nicholas I, who had been deposed from the Polish throne in January 1831 by the Sejm (Polish parliament). When a less conciliatory faction gained power in Warsaw and the Russian offer of surrender was refused, Paskevich ordered his forces to launch an assault against Warsaw's western defences.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of World War I in August 1914, Wittelsbach was brought back to active duty in the IV Battle Squadron. The ship saw limited duty in the Baltic Sea, {{including}} during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, but she saw no combat <b>with</b> <b>Russian</b> forces. By late 1915, crew shortages and the threat from British submarines forced the Kaiserliche Marine to withdraw older battleships like Wittelsbach. The ship then saw service in auxiliary roles, first as a training ship {{and then as a}} ship's tender. After the war, she was converted into a tender for minesweepers in 1919. In July 1921, the ship was sold and broken up for scrap metal.|$|E
