40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{association}} between the amount of daily movement measured with a triaxial accelerometer (MIMAMORI-Gait) and motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The subjects were 50 consecutive patients with untreated PD free of dementia. The amount of <b>overall</b> <b>movement</b> over 24 h was measured with the portable MIMAMORI-Gait device and its association with the modified Hoehn and Yahr stage and UPDRS part II and III scores was analyzed. In patients with PD, the amount of <b>overall</b> <b>movement</b> measured with MIMAMORI-Gait was significantly associated with the UPDRS part II score (β = − 0. 506, p < 0. 001) and part III score (β = − 0. 347, p = 0. 010), but not with the modified Hoehn and Yahr stage. The amount of <b>overall</b> <b>movement</b> measured with MIMAMORI-Gait can potentially be used for evaluation of motor symptoms and ADL in PD patients...|$|R
