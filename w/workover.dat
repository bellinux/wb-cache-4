The well is operated by an electric submersible pump with low oil rates.

5000|$|A well kill is the {{operation}} of placing a column of heavy fluid into a well bore {{in order to prevent}} the flow of reservoir fluids without the need for pressure control equipment at the surface. It works on the principle that the hydrostatic head of the [...] "kill fluid" [...] or [...] "kill mud" [...] will be enough to suppress the pressure of the formation fluids.

40|$|Engineering {{estimates}} of methane emissions from natural gas production {{have led to}} varied projections of national emissions. This work reports direct measurements of methane emissions at 190 onshore natural gas sites in the United States (150 production sites, 27 well completion flowbacks, 9 well unloadings, and 4 <b>workovers).</b> For well completion flowbacks, which clear fractured wells of liquid to allow gas production, methane emissions ranged from 0. 01 Mg to 17 Mg (mean = 1. 7 Mg; 95 % confidence bounds of 0. 67 – 3. 3 Mg), compared {{with an average of}} 81 Mg per event in the 2011 EPA national emission inventory from April 2013. Emission factors for pneumatic pumps and controllers as well as equipment leaks were both comparable to and higher than estimates in the national inventory. Overall, if emission factors from this work for completion flowbacks, equipment leaks, and pneumatic pumps and controllers are assumed to be representative of national populations and are used to estimate national emissions, total annual emissions from these source categories are calculated to be 957 Gg of methane (with sampling and measurement uncertainties estimated at ± 200 Gg). The estimate for comparable source categories in the EPA national inventory is ∼ 1, 200 Gg. Additional measurements of unloadings and <b>workovers</b> are needed to produce national emission estimates for these source categories. The 957 Gg in emissions for completion flowbacks, pneumatics, and equipment leaks, coupled with EPA national inventory estimates for other categories, leads to an estimated 2, 300 Gg of methane emissions from natural gas production (0. 42 % of gross gas production) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{point of}} {{communication}} was traditionally a device called a sliding sleeve, or sliding side door, {{which is a}} hydraulically operated device, built into the production tubing. During normal operation, it would remain closed sealing off the tubing and the annulus, but for events such as this, it would be opened to allow {{the free flow of}} fluids between the two regions. These components have fallen out of favour as they were prone to leaking. Instead, it is now more common to punch a hole in the tubing for circulation kills. Although this permanently damages the tubing, given that most planned well kills are for <b>workovers,</b> this is not an issue, since the tubing is being pulled for replacement anyway.|$|R

30|$|Corrosion control {{through the}} use of inhibitors is not {{recommended}} for hostile wells because this option has high operating cost implications over the full field life owing to the operating costs of inhibitor injection and the higher frequency of <b>workovers.</b> Nevertheless, there are concerns about the efficacy of inhibitors in controlling sulfide stress cracking in carbon steels [45]. However, the new impressed current cathodic protection method presented is a better method of tackling these problems as the process has a broad potential protection and the system is adaptable for different materials constituting the oil and gas pipelines. The method also has controllable output current that is high enough to protect pipelines with low costs. Both methods of the cathodic protection presented can be designed to prevent oxygen-controlled and microbiologically controlled corrosion.|$|R

30|$|The {{footprints}} {{that remain}} on the seabed after offshore jack-up platforms completed operations and moved out provide a significant risk for any future jack-up installation at that site. Detrimental horizontal and/or rotational loads will be induced on the base cone of the jack-up platform leg (spudcan) in the preloading process where only vertical loads are normally expected. However, there are no specific guidelines on design of spudcan re-installation very close to or partially overlapping existing footprints. This paper presents a rational design approach for assessing spudcan–footprint interaction and the failure process of foundation {{in a single layer}} based on nonlinear finite element method. The relationship between the distance between the spudcan and the footprint and the horizontal sliding force has been obtained. Comparisons of simulation and experimental results show that the model in this paper can deal well with the combined problems of sliding friction contact, fluid–solid coupling, and convergence difficulty. The analytical results may be useful to jack-up installation <b>workovers</b> close to existing footprints.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} West Hackberry Tertiary Project is to {{demonstrate}} the technical and economic feasibility of combining air injection with the Double Displacement Process for tertiary oil recovery. The Double Displacement Process is the gas displacement of a water invaded oil column {{for the purpose of}} recovering oil through gravity drainage. The novel aspect of this project is the use of air as the injection fluid. The target reservoir for the project is the Camerina C- 1, 2, 3 Sand located on the West Flank of West Hackberry Field in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. If successful, this project will demonstrate that the use of air injection in the Double Displacement Process can economically recover oil in reservoirs where tertiary oil recovery is presented uneconomic. During this quarter, the West Hackberry Tertiary Project completed the first ten months of air injection operations. Plots of air injection rates and cumulative air injected are included in this report as attachments. The following events are reviewed in this quarter`s technical progress report: (1) successful <b>workovers</b> on the Gulf Land D Nos. 44, 45 and 51 and the Watkins No. 3; (2) the unsuccessful repair attempt on the Watkins No. 16; (3) gathering of additional bottom hole pressure data; (4) air compressor operations and repairs; and (5) technology transfer activities...|$|R
