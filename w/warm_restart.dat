A cold restart is triggered by typing [...] If a DFS ROM is installed, [...] {{will cause the}} computer to search for and load a file called [...] on the floppy disk in drive 0. The latter two behaviours were inherited by the successor to Acorn MOS, RISC OS. These behaviours could be changed or exchanged in software, and were often used in rudimentary anti-piracy techniques.|$|E
40|$|The Redundant Inertial Measurement Unit Attitude Determination/Calibration (RADICAL(TM)) filter {{was used}} to {{estimate}} star tracker and gyro calibration parameters using MESSENGER telemetry data from three calibration events. We present {{an overview of the}} MESSENGER attitude sensors and their configuration is given, the calibration maneuvers are described, the results are compared with previous calibrations, and variations and trends in the estimated calibration parameters are examined. The <b>warm</b> <b>restart</b> and covariance bump features of the RADICAL(TM) filter were used to estimate calibration parameters from two disjoint telemetry streams. Results show that the calibration parameters converge faster with much less transient variation during convergence than when the filter is cold-started at the start of each telemetry stream...|$|E
40|$|Restart {{techniques}} {{are common in}} gradient-free optimization to deal with multimodal functions. Partial warm restarts are also gaining popularity in gradient-based optimization to improve the rate of convergence in accelerated gradient schemes to deal with ill-conditioned functions. In this paper, we propose a simple <b>warm</b> <b>restart</b> technique for stochastic gradient descent to improve its anytime performance when training deep neural networks. We empirically study its performance on the CIFAR- 10 and CIFAR- 100 datasets, where we demonstrate new state-of-the-art results at 3. 14 % and 16. 21 %, respectively. We also demonstrate its advantages on a dataset of EEG recordings and on a downsampled version of the ImageNet dataset. Our source code is available at [URL] ICLR 2017 conference pape...|$|E
40|$|We {{note that}} common {{implementations}} of adaptive gradient algorithms, such as Adam, limit the potential benefit of weight decay regularization, because the weights do not decay multiplicatively (as {{would be expected}} for standard weight decay) but by an additive constant factor. We propose {{a simple way to}} resolve this issue by decoupling weight decay and the optimization steps taken w. r. t. the loss function. We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam, and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter). We also demonstrate that longer optimization runs require smaller weight decay values for optimal results and introduce a normalized variant of weight decay to reduce this dependence. Finally, we propose a version of Adam with <b>warm</b> <b>restarts</b> (AdamWR) that has strong anytime performance while achieving state-of-the-art results on CIFAR- 10 and ImageNet 32 x 32.

40|$|The overall {{operating}} temperature {{and efficiency of}} solar-powered Stirling engines can be improved by adding an alkali metal pool boiler heat transport system to supply heat more uniformly to the heater head tubes. One issue with liquid metal pool boilers is unstable boiling. Stable boiling is obtained with an enhanced boiling surface containing nucleation sites that promote continuous boiling. Over longer time periods, {{it is possible that}} the boiling behavior of the system will change. An 800 -h life test was conducted to verify that pool boiling with the chosen fluid/surface combination remains stable as the system ages. The apparatus uses NaK boiling on a - 100 + 140 stainless steel sintered porous layer, with the addition of a small amount of xenon. Pool boiling remained stable to the end of life test. The pool boiler life test included a total of 82 cold starts, to simulate startup each morning, and 60 <b>warm</b> <b>restarts,</b> to simulate cloud cover transients. The behavior of the cold and warm starts showed no significant changes during the life test. In the experiments, the fluid/surface combination provided stable, high-performance boiling at the {{operating temperature}} of 700 C. Based on these experiments, a pool boiler was designed for a full-scale 25 -kWe Stirling system...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present results of {{practical}} experience of cold starting a gasoline engine on low volatility fuel suitable for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) deployment. Design/methodology/approach – Experimental research and development is carried out via dynamometer testing of systems capable of achieving cold start of a spark ignition UAV engine on kerosene JET A- 1 fuel. Findings – Repeatable cold starts have been satisfactorily achieved at ambient temperatures of 5 °C. The approximate threshold for <b>warm</b> engine <b>restart</b> has also been established. Practical implications – For safety and supply logistical reasons, the elimination of the use of gasoline fuel offers major advantages not only for UAVs but also for other internal combustion engine-powered equipment to be operated in military theatres of operation. For gasoline crankcase-scavenged two-stroke cycle engines, this presents development challenges in terms of modification of the lubrication strategy, achieving acceptable performance characteristics and the ability to successfully secure repeatable engine cold start. Originality/value – The majority of UAVs still operate on gasoline-based fuels. Successful modification to allow low volatility fuel operation would address single fuel policy objectives...|$|R
40|$|Nonvolatile memory (NVM) {{system that}} could {{reliably}} function in extreme environments {{is one of the}} most critical components for many spacecrafts being developed for NASA missions to be launched in next four to seven years. NVM supports the computer system in saving and updating critical state data required for a <b>warm</b> <b>restart</b> after power cycling or in case of a power bus failure. It also provides a power independent mass storage capacity for the scientific data gathered by the instruments. In some cases the window for gathering such data is very small and occurs only once in a given mission. Commercially popular and fully developed Flash NVM technology is inappropriate for many reasons such as the limited read write cycles with slower access speeds, radiation intolerance, higher Single Event Upsets (SEU) rates, etc. It is desirable to have an NVM system based upon a robust cell technology making it immune to the SEUs and with sufficient radiation hardness. Availability of such NVM system seems to be still 5 to 10 years in the future. Meanwhile, it is possible to provide an interim hybrid solution by combining the existing rad-hard technologies. Additional information is contained in the original extended abstract...|$|E
40|$|Avionics {{networks}} {{rely on a}} set of stringent {{reliability and}} safety requirements. In existing deployments, these networks are based on a wired technology, which supports these requirements. Furthermore, this technology simplifies the security management of the network since certain assumptions can be safely made, including the inability of an attacker to access the network, {{and the fact that it}} is almost impossible for an attacker to introduce a node into the network. The proposal for Avionics Wireless Networks (AWNs), currently under development by multiple aerospace working groups, promises a reduction in the complexity of electrical wiring harness design and fabrication, a reduction in the total weight of wires, increased customization possibilities, and the capacity to monitor otherwise inaccessible moving or rotating aircraft parts such as landing gear and some sections of the aircraft engines. While providing these benefits, the AWN must ensure that it provides levels of safety that are at minimum equivalent to those offered by the wired equivalent. In this paper, we propose a secure and trusted channel protocol that satisfies the stated security and operational requirements for an AWN protocol. There are three main objectives for this protocol. First, the protocol has to provide the assurance that all communicating entities can trust each other, and can trust their internal (secure) software and hardware states. Second, the protocol has to establish a fair key exchange between all communicating entities so as to provide a secure channel. Finally, the third objective is to be efficient for both the initial start-up of the network and when resuming a session after a cold and/or <b>warm</b> <b>restart</b> of a node. The proposed protocol is implemented and performance measurements are presented based on this implementation. In addition, we formally verify our proposed protocol using CasperFDR.
