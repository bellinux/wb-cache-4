40|$|In {{the recent}} astrophysical {{experiments}} i. e. QUIET, QUIJOTE, STRIP-LSPE, arrays of polarimeters {{are used in}} order to measure the linearly polarized component of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR). Since the signal of interest is very faint, the sensitivity of the scientific instrumentation should be very high. This goal can be achieved by accommodating a large number of high-performance polarimeters in the focal plane of the antenna. In this perspective, a novel layout of Ortho-Mode-Transducer (OMT) and polarizer, which are key passive waveguide elements of dual-circular polarization polarimeters, have been designed. The polarizer is based on a Dual-Fold-Stub (DFS) design having 20 % bandwidth centered at 94. 5 GHz, whereas the broadband OMT exploits a turnstile junction with 30 % bandwidth centered at 94 GHz. The components are realized using the multi-layer technology, where each metallic plate is manufactured by <b>wire</b> spark <b>erosion</b> technique. Using this design methodology, several identical devices can be manufactured in a single machining process. The exploitation of multi-layer technology in conjunction with <b>wire</b> spark <b>erosion</b> technique provides high level of manufacturing repeatability and accuracy along with low cost, making this solution well suitable for the realization of polarimetric arrays consisting of tens/hundreds of chains. The propriety SEM (Spectral Element Method) tool of IEIIT-CNR and commercial EM (Electromagnetic) tools (CST-MWS & HFSS) have been exploited in an effective manner to achieve the required performances. In order to integrate MATLAB with EM tools, COM EM Automation Tool (COM-EM-AT) has been developed and exploited in various manner to attain the final design. The simulation acceleration through distributed computing have also been employed efficiently for tolerance analysis using the SEM too...|$|R

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{a method}} is described for sharpening Tungsten (W) tips through a two-step electrochemical etching. In the first step, under strong reaction conditions, we obtain a long hyperbolic cone, {{while in the}} second with a micropositioner we bring only {{the apex of the}} first cone in contact with a thin film of etchant. In this way, controlling the meniscus height with an optical microscope, only {{the very end of the}} tip is etched. Some processing parameters such as the rate of the electrochemical reaction of erosion of the W wire, related to the electrolyte concentration and to the applied voltage, the length of the wire immersed in the solution and the shape of the meniscus have been investigated. Both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) were tested, observing two different ways of W <b>wire</b> <b>erosion.</b> The fabrication process provides very sharp tips, tips with radius of curvature below 10 nm and cone angle aperture within 30 Â° have been obtained in some cases. Further improvements are in progress, namely to extend the tip-shape repeatability as given by the two-step process.

40|$|Abstract. In present study, {{an attempt}} was made to reduce the erosion rate of the Pulverized coal burner nozzle material. For better {{resistant}} to erosion, material was hardfaced by Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) by using solid wire electrode and flux cored wire electrode under same welding conditions. The substrate steel hardfaced with flux cored wire electrode resulted in high microhardness as compare to solid <b>wire</b> electrode. The <b>erosion</b> study was conducted, using an air jet erosion test rig at a particle velocity of 50 m/s. Ductile erosion behavior is observed in the case when the substrate steels is hardfaced with solid <b>wire</b> whereas brittle <b>erosion</b> behavior is observed when the substrate steels is hardfaced with flux cored wire. At a low angle of impingement, the abrasive type cutting is the dominating factor for material removal, and at a higher angle of impingement, impact-type as well as abrasive-type cutting actions play critical roles. Plastic deformation characterized by pitting and cutting action was also observed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique was used to analyze the eroded surface. It was concluded that damaged surfaces of Pulverized coal burner nozzle material can be successfully hardfaced and improvement in erosion resistance was observed. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} an experimental investigation {{with the aim}} to evaluate and establish <b>wire</b> spark <b>erosion</b> machining (WSEM) as a viable alternative for high quality miniature gear manufacturing. External spur type miniature brass (ASTM 858) gears with 12 teeth, 9. 8 mm outside diameter and 5 mm face width were manufactured by WSEM. The research work was accomplished in four distinct experimental stages viz., preliminary, pilot, main and confirmation. The aim, scope and findings of each stage are progressively presented and discussed. In essence, the investigation {{found that it was}} possible to manufacture miniature gears to high quality by using WSEM. Gears up to DIN 5 quality with a good surface finish (1. 2 Âµm average roughness) and satisfactory surface integrity were achieved. The results suggest that WSEM should be considered a viable alternative to conventional miniature gear manufacturing techniques and that in some instances it may even be superior. This work will prove useful to researchers and professionals in the field of miniature and micro-scale manufacturing and machining...|$|R
40|$|ACCEL {{currently}} produces accelerating {{structures for}} several scientific laboratories. Multi-cell cavities at S-band frequencies {{are required for}} the projects CLIC-driver-linac, DLS and ASP pre-injector linac and the MAMI-C microtron. Based on those projects differences and similarities in design, production technologies and requirements will be addressed. CLIC DRIVER LINAC The production of 18 CLIC Driver Linac structures [1] is under way at ACCEL Instrument GmbH [2]. Meanwhile more than 12 structures are delivered and successfully tested at CERN. The structure consists of 35 accelerating cells including the coupling cells with symmetric rf ports. Each cell contains four Silicon Carbide absorbers, which are coupled to the accelerating cells by the slotted cavity iris for HOM suppression. The operating frequency is 2998. 55 MHz in 2 Ï/ 3 mode. The structure is designed for extreme high beam loading of nearly 98 %. The nominal input power is 30 MW at a pulse length of 1. 5 Âµs resulting to an unloaded accelerating voltage of 13. 5 MV. Figure 1 : Two 1. 22 m long CLIC Drive Linac structures ready for delivery. The slotted iris geometry of the accelerating cells requires extreme care during the manufacturing process. After the turning and milling operations on the accelerating cells, {{which is similar to}} other standard S-Band structures, the cell is cut from the iris up to 10 mm away from the cell equator by <b>wire</b> spark <b>erosion.</b> This makes the cells fragile and sensitive to any mechanical deformations. To assure the correct phase and amplitude tuning of the finished structure the frequency of each cell is measured before final brazing (Figure 2). A special test setup was built up at ACCEL for the measurement of the 0 -mode and Ï- mode frequencies of each cell. This allows to calculate the 2 Ï/ 3 mode frequency of the individual cells. After the final brazing the phase advance and field distribution of each structure is checked by a bead pull measurement (Figure 3) ...|$|R
40|$|Detection and {{observation}} of gravitational waves requires extremely accurate displacement measurement {{in the frequency}} range 0. 03 mHz to 1 Hz. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission will attain this by creating a giant interferometer in space, based on free floating proof masses in three spacecrafts. Due to orbit evolution and time delay in the interferometer arms, the direction of transmitted light changes. To solve this problem, a picometer stable Point-Ahead Angle Mechanism (PAAM) was designed, realized and successfully tested. The PAAM concept {{is based on a}} rotatable mirror. The critical requirements are the contribution to the optical path length (less than 1. 4 pm / rt Hz) and the angular jitter (less than 8 nrad / rt Hz). Extreme dimensional stability is achieved by manufacturing a monolithical Haberland hinge mechanism out of Ti 6 Al 4 V, through high precision <b>wire</b> <b>erosion.</b> Extreme thermal stability is realized by placing the thermal center {{on the surface of the}} mirror. Because of piezo actuator noise and leakage, the PAAM has to be controlled in closed-loop. To meet the requirements in the low frequencies, an active target capacitance-to-digital converter is used. Interferometric measurements with a triangular resonant cavity in vacuum proved that the PAAM meets the requirements. Â© 2010 SPIE...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{examples of}} applications for metal composite materials on Al matrix reinforced with ceramic {{particles in the}} form of grains, fibre or whiskers in the automotive industry. Highlighted are the advantages and drawbacks of such composite materials and issues involved in shaping complete parts. Presence of hard and brittle ceramic particles in the Al alloy (given their sufficient concentration) significantly impacts on the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the material and its suitability for shaping complete parts and constituting a surface layer (SL) with required properties. In making metal composite materials of Al alloys, various (including the latest) methods of casting are applied, often in combination with press molding in semi-fluid state, as well as powder metallurgy (P/M) methods. The final machining of functionally significant surfaces is done by machining (by all ways and variants). With presence of more than 5 % (by volume) ceramic reinforcing particles it becomes necessary to use cutting blades of the so-called super hard materials, including composites of polycristalline diamond and diamond. This considerably increases manufacturing costs. Electrical discharge machining has proved to be an effective way for shaping metal parts, in all its variants: sinker (EDM), <b>wire</b> <b>erosion</b> (WEDM), micromachining (Î¼EDM), shaping by free electrode (REDM), discharge grinding (AEDM) and other.
