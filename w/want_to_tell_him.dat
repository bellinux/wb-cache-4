6000|$|... "My dear!" [...] whispered Marjorie unheeded. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{it mattered}} now, mattered supremely, {{but she knew}} he had no ears for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} so much to say to him," [...] she {{answered}} impatiently, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how deeply I feel for him, and how anxious I am to make his life a happier one if I can." ...|$|E

6000|$|The reproachful superiority in Charmian's {{tone was}} bitter to Cornelia, {{but she did}} not even attempt to resent it.

60|$|Joan {{dropped the}} gun and sank beside him, helpless, horror-stricken, {{wringing}} her hands.

6000|$|... "You've {{no right}} {{to say they were}} treacherous when they knew nothing of your plans," [...] said the girl sharply.

I didn't believe that there was ever a ship in the world that had done that, and bein' on a lark, I wanted to do it, and was willin' to pay for it; and if his engineers and his crew grumbled about backing the steamer for a hundred miles, he could explain to them how the matter stood, and tell them that bein' on a lark I was willin' to pay for all extra trouble I might put them to, and for any disturbances in their minds which might rise from sailin' a vessel in a way which didn't seem to be accordin' to the ordinary rules of navigation.|$|E
6000|$|This is the trouble, Sahib. My {{brother who}} holds his land and works mine, outside Amritsar City, is a fool. He {{is older than}} I.

He sends me postcards, Sahib--scores of postcards--whining about the drouth or the taxes, or the crops, or our servants' pilferings or some such trouble. He doesn't know what trouble means.

My belly is on fire now with {{knowledge}} I never had before, and I wish to impart it to him--to the village elders--to all people. Yes, that is true, too. If I keep calling him a fool, he will not gain any knowledge.... Let me think it over on all sides! Aha! Now that I have a bazar-writer of my own I will write a book--a very book of a letter to my fool of a brother.... And now we will begin. Take down my words from my lips to my foolish old farmer-brother:-- ...|$|E
