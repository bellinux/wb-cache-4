5|$|In later years, Wolff said he {{was always}} wary of Heydrich, {{who seemed to be}} <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{opportunity}} to move against him and disgrace him with Himmler. Within the Allgemeine-SS, Heydrich forged relationships with some of the more powerful SS and Police Leaders such as Friedrich Jeckeln. Heydrich maintained a dialogue with him, but cautiously, especially after Jeckeln ran afoul of Himmler in the late 1930s and early 1940s.|$|E
5|$|While <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{opportunity}} to launch this operation, the Alsos Mission learned that uranium ore {{that had been}} taken from Belgium in 1944 had been shipped to the Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Stassfurt, which was captured by the 83rd Infantry Division on 15 April. As it was in the occupation zone allocated to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference, the Alsos Mission, led by Boris Pash and accompanied by Lansdale, arrived on 17 April to remove anything of interest. Over the following ten days, 260 truckloads of uranium ore, sodium uranate and ferro-uranium weighing about 1,000 tons were taken away.|$|E
5|$|The Crusader army's pace was {{dictated}} by the infantry and baggage train; the Ayyubid army, being largely mounted, {{had the advantage of}} superior mobility. Efforts to burn crops and deny the countryside to the Frankish army were largely ineffective as it could be continuously provisioned from the fleet, which moved south parallel with it. On 25 August the Crusader rearguard was crossing a defile when it was almost cut off. However, the Crusaders closed up so speedily that the Muslim soldiery was forced to flee. From 26 to 29 August Richard's army had a respite from attack because while it hugged the coast and had gone round the shoulder of Mount Carmel, Saladin's army had struck across country. Saladin arrived in the vicinity of Caesarea before the Crusaders, who were on a longer road. From 30 August to 7 September Saladin was always within striking distance, and <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to attack if the Crusaders exposed themselves.|$|E

5|$|That same year, Brian Hodgson, who {{had spent}} many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good {{knowledge}} about Nepal's bio-diversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident. Although the British Residents were officially instructed {{to keep out of}} the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King as well as the Mukhtiyar. Hodgson was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to exploit the rift between the Mukhtiyar and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities. Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a security threat and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a mukhtiyar who needed to keep {{on the right side of}} the army. By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not be able to have his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration; thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction, and he wished to install Fateh Jung Shah, who was more favorably disposed to him, as the mukhtiyar. In August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a new commercial treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses. At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same time, he could not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory attitude toward the Resident, in order to win him as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.|$|E

25|$|The {{relative}} infrequency of SWAT call-outs means these expensively {{trained and}} equipped officers cannot {{be left to}} sit around, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> emergency. In many departments the officers are normally deployed to regular duties, but are available for SWAT calls via pagers, mobile phones, or radio transceivers.

25|$|Although {{training}} in 'air-raid precautions' started {{as early as}} 1935, recruiting only began in earnest in January 1939. Wardens were recruited and every house in the town was visited, with between 20,000 and 30,000 civilian gas respirators fitted. In March the Torbay ARP Committee purchased Upton Primary School as headquarters for the Torbay Area {{at a cost of}} £3,350. Trained volunteers totalled 2,033 and there were then on order 2,200 sandbags, 200 suits of clothing, 69,000 respirators and 140 steel helmets with 'the Home Office <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> address to send them to'.|$|E

25|$|Many Catholics and nationalists {{believed}} that the IRA {{had been unable to}} defend them during the August 1969 riots. However, it is argued that the IRA's defence of Short Strand redeemed it {{in the eyes of many}} Catholics and nationalists. Prior to the gun battle, the IRA had been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to portray themselves as defenders of the Catholic community, which was only made possible by the over-stretching of British Army forces dealing with rioting throughout Belfast and thus unable to provide protection to the Short Strand. Among republicans, the battle is seen as a key event in the growth of the Provisional IRA.|$|E
25|$|The Qin armies scored initial {{victories}} as Li Xin's force conquered Pingyu (平輿; {{north of}} present-day Pingyu County, Zhumadian, Henan) while Meng Tian's captured Qinqiu (寢丘; present-day Linquan County, Fuyang, Anhui). After conquering Yan (鄢; present-day Yanling County, Xuchang, Henan), Li Xin led his army west to rendezvous with Meng Tian at Chengfu (城父; east of present-day Baofeng County, Pingdingshan, Henan).

25|$|By {{the time}} of the death of the Xianfeng Emperor, Empress Dowager Cixi had become a shrewd {{political}} strategist. In Rehe Province, while <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> astrologically favourable time to transport the emperor's coffin back to Beijing, Cixi conspired with court officials and imperial relatives to seize power. Cixi's position as the lower-ranked empress dowager had no intrinsic political power attached to it. In addition, her son, the young emperor, was not a political force himself. As a result, it became necessary for her to ally herself with other powerful figures, including the late emperor's principal wife, Empress Dowager Ci'an. Cixi suggested that they become co-reigning empress dowagers, with powers exceeding the eight regents; the two had long been close friends since Cixi first came to the imperial household.|$|E
25|$|When Hunte {{moved to}} England, he had advised the {{selectors}} of the West Indies team {{that he was}} available to tour England in 1957 should he be chosen. While <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> invitation for the tour, Hunte considered and rejected attempting to become eligible for selection for Kent County Cricket Club in the English County Championship. When no invitation was forthcoming Hunte signed to play with Enfield. Later Hunte {{was told that the}} West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) had sent him a letter, which failed to reach him in Lancashire. After he signed with Enfield received a note from a WICB board member, urging him to state if he wished to be considered for selection. Hunte replied that he was, provided Enfield would agree to release him from his contract. When the squad for the tour was released, Hunte's name was missing. The West Indies soon regretted overlooking Hunte. The two batsman selected ahead of him—Nyron Asgarali and Andy Ganteaume—did not meet with much success in the Test matches.|$|E

He tracked the convoy for 32 hours <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> opening and at 0200 on the 30th {{was finally able to}} put three torpedoes into Toku Maru (2,747 tons). One of these blew the stern off, and she went down directly, taking over 450 troops with her. Harassed by the escorts and accompanying aircraft, Cutter nonetheless kept Seahorse in trail of the remaining Japanese for another 48 hours and attempted another attack just after midnight on 1 February. Eight torpedoes missed. Under heavy pressure from an escort, he shot two last torpedoes from his stern tubes just before going deep. Amid the ensuing depth charge attack, Cutter's men heard both torpedoes hit and the now-familiar sound of exploding gasoline drums. Indeed, it was later confirmed that they had sunk the Japanese steamer Toei Maru (4,004 tons). After this 80-hour chase - nearly a record, Seahorse returned to Pearl Harbor on 16 February with another five ships and 13,716 tons to her credit. The patrol earned Cutter a second Navy Cross.|$|E
