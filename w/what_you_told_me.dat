60|$|I didn't forget <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> I {{just kept}} my ears open and my mouth shut.|$|E
60|$|M. Never mind. Don't {{tell her}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> Go on the Peerage and Landed-Gentry tack.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want them}} mitigated; state them clearly. Include <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about {{the trouble with}} the natives, and the {{poisoned}} arrows." ...|$|E
25|$|I only done <b>what</b> <b>you</b> done <b>told</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must know}} if <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> has any bearing on your request that I should {{recommend}} Captain Sedgwick's appointment?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You forget <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{yourself}} <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> Doctor Rochecliffe," [...] said Alice, [...] "of {{the risk}} of communicating this great secret to my father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] she said, [...] "that you {{are quite}} sure of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the other evening about this young singer--Felicia Roche?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I thought,' I replied, 'there {{might be}} a doubt about it; though of course I have {{forgotten}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> two years ago.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] I said. [...] "I {{thought you}} were rather fond of {{children}} from <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> going to the cross-roads the other day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do {{you mean}} to say,' I demanded, 'that you {{have the nerve to}} come back to Sanstead after <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about yourself?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Slidder," [...] said I, as {{we turned}} {{down into the}} mean-looking alley where Mrs Willis, my little old woman, dwelt, [...] "I am greatly {{interested}} in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about my little dog, and I am interested still more in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about yourself. Now, I {{want you to do}} me a favour. I wish you to go with me to visit an old woman, and, after that, to walk home with me--part of the way, at least." ...|$|R
6000|$|For a {{few moments}} she could not speak, and then she whispered, [...] "I believe that I have seen <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I should see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I don't regret it,' said Mr. Barkis. 'Do you {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> once, about her {{making all the}} apple parsties and doing all the cooking?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I do {{not know}} {{anything}} about it,' she answered, 'except <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> yourself; and what you said was my reason for agreeing so quickly to your proposition.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{a day or}} two since?" [...] asked the doctor. [...] "You said there was a chance of Mr. Armadale's dying in my Sanitarium?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] said she, [...] "I {{will tell}} you something, in return for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and was refused." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, why shouldn't I?" [...] she cried, [...] "after <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> And could <b>you</b> think I didn't understand, {{from the}} beginning, that it meant this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Horn, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> are {{the plans}} and {{opinions}} of others. It {{seems to me}} that you are now called upon to say something for yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would tell the jury," [...] said the counsel for defense after the witness had been sworn, [...] "just <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in my office {{yesterday}} afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{last night}} in the sacred confidences of yonder holy church, and hear what you really are from the lips of the Council of Todos Santos." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It doesn't hurt. It isn't anything,' said Mrs. Boulte feebly. 'That doesn't matter. Tell him <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> Say {{you don't}} care for him. Oh, Ted, won't you believe her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{go round}} {{and let the}} boys know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> They can meet outside Ransome's shanty. The dinner-hour will do. I'll be there to meet them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you don't}} know that? I thought Billy Dill knew. If <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> is true, <b>you</b> are {{the son of}} my twin brother, David Breslow Porter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is all, Captain Bayley; but I {{think that}} this, with <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> is quite {{sufficient}} {{to bring the}} guilt home to the true party, and to completely clear Norris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "I suppose I {{wanted to}} recall the thing {{and see how it}} looked in the light of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about your {{exploits}} in Scotland." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It doesn't hurt. It isn't anything," [...] said Mrs. Boulte feebly. [...] "That doesn't matter. Tell him <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> Say {{you don't}} care for him. Oh, Ted, won't you believe her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Barrington {{thrust the}} glass upon him. [...] "I could make nothing of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> while you speak like that. Drink it, and then sit {{until you get}} used to the {{different}} temperature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{see about}} that presently," [...] Mr. Hebblethwaite declared, leaning back. [...] "Let me think over <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> It comes to this, Norgate. You've {{practically}} encouraged Germany to risk affronting us." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was also}} another curious {{point about the}} man. Once {{in the course of}} some quarrel the sailor {{threatened}} him: [...] "What's to prevent me reporting ashore <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about that silver?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it was a}} queer {{thing to}} do. Many thanks to <b>you</b> for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> If I can put the man into your hands you shall hear from me. Come along, Watson." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Speak to him!' she pleaded, {{turning to}} the woman at her side. 'Oh, speak to him! Tell him <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> just now. Tell him you hate him. Tell him you hate him!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Barrington {{thrust the}} glass upon him. [...] "I could make nothing of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> while you speak like that. Drink it, and then sit still {{until you get}} used to the {{different}} temperature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Lady Anna. You and I cannot decide it. I must again see my lawyer. I do {{not mean}} the attorney,--but Sir William Patterson, the Solicitor-General. May I tell him <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> yesterday?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course; I couldn't help it. We {{should have}} been here earlier, only a horse went lame. In any case, after <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> I cannot see why you should adopt that tone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of {{your former}} trading expeditions," [...] said Nigel, {{looking at his}} friend, [...] "you must have seen {{a good deal of}} this {{archipelago}} before you took--excuse me--to the hermit life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right," [...] he replied. [...] "I will go {{into the}} cabin and take a rest and think over <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> We have as yet plenty of time in which to act." ...|$|R
