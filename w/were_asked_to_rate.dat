25|$|A poll {{conducted}} in the Republic of Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chișinău in October 2009 presented a detailed picture. The respondents <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> {{the relationship between the}} identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll showed that 26% of the entire sample, which included all ethnic groups, claimed the two identities were the same or very similar, whereas 47% claimed they were different or entirely different.|$|E
25|$|Many {{research}} {{studies have been}} conducted concerning the effect of schemata on individuals' perceptions of others. It has been found that preschoolers are aware of gender schemata and are capable of pointing out behaviours which are inconsistent with them. In a Canadian study, participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> various diverse groups based on how well a given characteristic applied to them. The results confirmed that participants were quicker to assign a rating if the given characteristics fit the schema for that group.|$|E
25|$|The results {{indicated}} that when the decision is meaningful to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based {{on his or her}} attitudes (positive, neutral, or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> some of the objects twice and believed that, at session's end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The {{results indicated}} a great increase in the positive attitude of the participant towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. Therefore, the existing attitudes of the participant were reinforced during the rating period, and the participants suffered cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.|$|E

25|$|In the oft-cited and oft-criticized Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), by Alfred C. Kinsey et al., people <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> {{themselves}} {{on a scale from}} completely heterosexual to completely homosexual. Kinsey reported that when the individuals' behavior as well as their identity are analyzed, most people appeared to be at least somewhat bisexual — i.e., most people have some attraction to either sex, although usually one sex is preferred. According to Kinsey, only a minority (5–10%) can be considered fully heterosexual or homosexual. Conversely, only an even smaller minority can be considered fully bisexual (with an equal attraction to both sexes). Kinsey's methods have been criticized as flawed, particularly with regard to the randomness of his sample population, which included prison inmates, male prostitutes and those who willingly participated in discussion of previously taboo sexual topics. Nevertheless, Paul Gebhard, subsequent director of the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research, reexamined the data in the Kinsey Reports and concluded that removing the prison inmates and prostitutes barely affected the results.|$|E
25|$|One {{experiment}} that {{was conducted to}} test the mere-exposure effect used fertile chicken eggs for the test subjects. Tones of two different frequencies were played to different groups of chicks {{while they were still}} unhatched. Once hatched, each tone was played to both groups of chicks. Each set of chicks consistently chose the tone prenatally played to it. Zajonc tested the mere-exposure effect by exposing Chinese characters for shorts amounts of time to two groups of individuals. The individuals were then told that these symbols represented adjectives and <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> whether the symbols held positive or negative connotations. The symbols that had been previously seen by the test subjects were consistently rated more positively than those unseen. In a similar experiment, the individuals were not asked to rate the connotations of the symbols, but to describe their mood after the experiment. Members of the group with repeated exposure to certain characters reported being in better moods and felt more positive {{than those who did not}} receive repeated exposure.|$|E
25|$|A poll {{conducted}} in Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chișinău in October 2009 presented a somewhat detailed {{picture of the}} perception of identity inside the country. The participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> {{the relationship between the}} identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll shows that 26% of the entire sample, which includes all ethnic groups, claim the two identities are the same or very similar, whereas 47% claim they are different or entirely different. The results vary significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, 33% of the young respondents (ages 18–29) chose the same or very similar, and 44% different or very different. Among the senior respondents (aged over 60), the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. One of the largest deviation from the country average was among the residents of capital Chișinău, for whom the figures were 42% and 44%. The poll also shows that, compared to the national average (25%), {{people are more likely to}} perceive the two identities as the same or very similar if they are young (33%), are native speakers of Romanian (30%), have higher education (36%) or reside in urban areas (30%), especially in the capital city (42%).|$|E
50|$|The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a {{widespread}} method of measuring preoperative anxiety for research purposes. It consists of two 20-item scales on which patients <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> particular symptoms.|$|R
5000|$|Facial stimuli: This task {{involves}} <b>asking</b> {{a participant}} <b>to</b> view pictures of human faces that display different facial expressions.

500|$|Items {{involving}} {{changes in}} body image, hypochondriasis, and difficulty working were replaced. Also, sleep loss and appetite loss items were revised to assess both increases and decreases in sleep and appetite. [...] All but {{three of the}} items were reworded; only the items dealing with feelings of being punished, thoughts about suicide, and interest in sex remained the same. Finally, participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> how they have been feeling {{for the past two}} weeks, as opposed to the past week as in the original BDI.|$|E
2500|$|In another study, {{subjects}} {{were given a}} list of traits {{instead of the usual}} [...] "fake" [...] personality assessment. The subjects <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> how much they felt these traits applied to them. In line with the self-serving bias, the majority of subjects agreed with positive traits about themselves and disagreed with negative ones. The study concluded that the self-serving bias is powerful enough to cancel out the usual Forer effect.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2002 {{interview}} with the Globe and Mail, Aga Khan, the 49th Imam of the Ismaili Muslims, described Canada as [...] "the most successful pluralist society {{on the face of}} our globe", citing it as [...] "a model for the world". A 2007 poll ranked Canada as the country with the most positive influence in the world. 28,000 people in 27 countries <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> 12 countries as either having a positive or negative worldwide influence. Canada’s overall influence rating topped the list with 54 per cent of respondents rating it mostly positive and only 14 per cent mostly negative.|$|E

2500|$|During {{a survey}} {{conducted}} in December 2014 in which participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> the quality of Rogers' NHL coverage {{on a scale of}} 1 to 10, those surveyed gave the telecasts an average score of 6.1 out of 10. Reviews were more positive among younger demographics (such as teens and millennials who gave an average score of 6.5 out of 10), citing the expanded availability of games, the [...] "hipper" [...] feel of the telecasts and how they are produced, but were lower among older viewers. Criticism was directed primarily towards how the contract affected the availability of Montreal Canadiens games and other French-language broadcasts, the [...] "gimmicky" [...] feel of their production, and the presence of George Stroumboulopoulos—who received an average rating of 5.7 out of 10 on the survey and, again, received relatively better reception among younger viewers with an average score of 6.2 out of 10.|$|E
2500|$|Following each scenario, {{people were}} {{presented}} with two options about how their attachments might respond. One option was [...] "he/she accepts you." [...] The other option was [...] "he/she rejects you." [...] People <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> the likelihood of each response on a seven-point scale. Ratings of likely attachment responses corresponded to people's attachment styles. People with secure attachment styles {{were more likely to}} expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, [...] "If I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, then my partner will accept me." [...] People with other attachment styles were less likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, [...] "If I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, then my attachment will reject me." [...] Differences in attachment styles reflected differences in relational schemas. Relational schemas may therefore be used to understand the organization of working models of attachment, as has been demonstrated in subsequent studies.|$|E

500|$|A {{fundamental}} drawback {{of much of}} {{the research}} so far is that the people studied have <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> their own popularity in the eyes of others, which naturally brings those scores into question.

50|$|The study {{involved}} 178 property owners over a four-month period {{in a series}} of face-to-face interviews. Participants evaluated property brokers according to knowledge and skills, ethics and behavior, consultative ability, and empathy.

5000|$|Degree of Difference: In this method, {{informants}} <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> {{the similarity}} or difference {{of the language}} of two regions, often on a numerical scale. Preston's original methods use a scale of 1-4 (where 1=same, 2=a little different, 3=different, and 4=unintelligibly different). Such comparisons usually <b>ask</b> the informant <b>to</b> rank a neighboring region in comparison to the participant’s home region.|$|R
50|$|Participants <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> {{themselves}} on each trait using a Likert scale. One indicates never or almost never true, while a seven would indicate always or almost always true.

40|$|I {{organize}} {{my comments}} around two facts or sets of facts {{that are at}} the core of this chapter: • Fact 1 : In matching surveys in Europe and the United States, people <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> their own disability into fi ve categories.

The distribution of reports over those categories is quite different in the two places; in particular, people in the United States are “tougher ” in that they are less willing to admit that some conditions are disabling.
