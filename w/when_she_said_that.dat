It is reported that Pataki {{did not like}} McCaughey's relationship with the press or her public discussion of policy differences the two had. McCaughey also lost support from Pataki <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> D'Amato had made suggestive comments to her.|$|E
25|$|King Charles was {{executed}} by Parliament in 1649; his death left Henrietta Maria almost destitute and in shock, a situation not {{helped by the}} French civil war of the Fronde, which left Henrietta Maria's nephew King Louis XIV short of money himself. Henrietta Maria also {{was no longer the}} Queen but the Queen Mother to the young King Charles II. During the ensuing, and final, Third English Civil War the whole of the Royalist circle now based itself from St-Germain, with the Queen Mother's followers being joined by the old Royalist circle who had been with Charles II at the Hague, including Ormonde and Inchiquin and Clarendon, whom she particularly disliked. She also quarrelled with Ormonde: <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> if she had been trusted the King would be in England, Ormonde, with his usual bluntness, retorted that if she had never been trusted the King need never have left England. Co-location began to bring the factions together, but Henrietta Maria's influence was waning. In 1654, Charles II moved his court on to Cologne, eliminating the remaining influence of the Queen Mother in St-Germain.|$|E
500|$|In November 2016, Madonna, who {{actively}} supported Hillary Clinton {{during the}} 2016 U.S. presidential election, performed an impromptu acoustic concert at Washington Square Park {{in support of}} Clinton's campaign. Upset that Donald Trump won the election, Madonna spoke out against him at the Women's March on Washington, a day after his inauguration. The singer sparked controversy <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> she [...] "thought a lot about blowing up the White House". The following day, she asserted she was [...] "not a violent person" [...] and that her quote had been [...] "taken wildly out of context", adding [...] "I spoke in metaphor and I shared two {{ways of looking at}} things — one was to be hopeful, and one was to feel anger and outrage". In February 2017, Madonna adopted four-year-old twin sisters from Malawi named Esther and Stella. In late summer 2017, Madonna moved to Lisbon, Portugal with her adoptive children.|$|E

500|$|Bazna married twice; {{with his}} first wife, whom he later divorced, he had four {{children}}. He had several live-in mistresses, one of whom, Mara, was a nursemaid {{to the children of}} David Busk, a British ambassador. Mara lived with him in the Kavaklıdere hills in a small house that he called [...] "Cicero Villa". Their relationship was tumultuous and Bazna ended the affair due to their fighting and her jealousy. However, she was loyal to him and passed important information to him twice, once about the upcoming arrival of British security men at the embassy and the second time <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> she had heard rumors that the Germans had a good source of intelligence. Once he began seeing a new mistress, Esra, his relationship with Mara ended permanently. After Esra, he took a woman named Aika as his mistress and set her up in an apartment. She left after his pound notes were determined to be counterfeit. He then married for a second time to a woman named Duriet and had four more children.|$|E
500|$|Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957 {{when they}} were fellow {{students}} at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was scared of Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> she was engaged, he screamed out, [...] "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?" [...] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song Getting Better told his own story, [...] "I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace." ...|$|E

2500|$|Barbara Bush defended her husband's {{experience}} and personal qualities {{when he announced}} his candidacy for President of the United States in 1980. [...] She caused a stir <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> she supported ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and was pro-choice on abortion. [...] This placed her {{at odds with the}} conservative-wing of the Republican party, led by California Governor Ronald Reagan; Reagan would receive the presidential nomination over her husband. [...] Reagan, however, chose Bush to be his running mate and the team was elected in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2006. Israeli {{polygraph}} expert, Koby Rabin {{conducted an}} examination to Hedvig Malina. According {{to the test}} results Ms. Hedvig Malina did not make up the story regarding the assault {{in the park and}} she told the truth when she claimed that the attackers had been shouting that [...] "in Slovakia people speak Slovak". No lying indication was detected, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> neither she, nor anyone on her behalf had written on her blouse that [...] "Hungarians beyond the Danube" [...] and [...] "Slovakia without parasites".|$|E
2500|$|According to Dana Mazalova, {{who spoke}} {{about this issue}} on a press conference, the images that Chingiz Mustafayev had shown her, [...] "have {{nothing in common with}} the videos and photographs, which the Azerbaijani side {{presents}} to the world". Mazalova claims to have seen the original footage shot by the Azerbaijani cameraman Chingiz Mustafiev of the dead bodies and says that she did not see there the signs of mutilation that were in later footage. That has the grisly implication that someone interfered with the corpses afterwards. Mazalova also claimed that the free corridor existed and that Russian journalist Victoria Ivleva passed through it together with Meskhetian Turks and remained alive. However Ivleva said that she did not know who Mazalova was and that Mazalova was lying <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Ivleva walked through this corridor. In another interview Ivleva also stated that she entered the town from the opposite direction to the alleged location of the free corridor, where Meskhetian Turks lived, and they survived because they did not walk into the free corridor.|$|E

2500|$|Osbourne has {{expressed}} interest in reprising her role on the judging panel, notably in September 2012, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> she would 'love' to return for the show's tenth series. Media outlets reported in December 2012 that X Factor producers had approached Osbourne for a return in 2013, reportedly to replace Tulisa. In April 2013, the show's creative director Brian Friedman {{said that he was}} [...] "confident" [...] of Sharon Osbourne's return following her departure from America's Got Talent. It was later announced by ITV that Osbourne would indeed be returning for the tenth series of the show, replacing Tulisa. She returned to the judging panel alongside Gary Barlow, Nicole Scherzinger, and original panellist Louis Walsh. During the live shows, she mentored the Over 25s category which included Lorna Simpson, Shelley Smith and Sam Bailey. Bailey was eventually announced as the winner of the show on 15 December, marking Osbourne's first victory as a mentor in the show's ten-year history. Osbourne did not return for the eleventh series of The X Factor UK and was replaced by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini.|$|E

Laing was cleared by the Legg Inquiry; nonetheless, she voluntarily repaid £25,000 as a [...] "moral gesture". As a result of the scandal, an unsuccessful attempt was made to deselect her by her constituency party, led by the Leader of Epping Forest District Council. The Daily Telegraph subsequently published an apology for their reporting of the story.|$|R
60|$|It seemed, {{from what}} Lady Fitzgerald <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Jones's manner had been {{somewhat}} mysterious about this man, Mollett. She had endeavoured to reassure and comfort her mistress, saying {{that nothing would}} come of it as nothing had come of that other Tenby visit, and giving it as her counsel that the ladies should allow the whole matter to pass by without further notice. But {{at the same time}} Lady Fitzgerald had remarked that her manner had been very serious <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had seen the man before.|$|R
50|$|Although {{she was a}} {{well-known}} singer, Mubarak Begum {{was not able to}} capitalize on her talents. She did not have the savvy 'networking' skills which are so important in careers connected to the entertainment industry, and her career remained stilted as a result. A competent singer, she was not a savvy businessperson. She was more interested in the music and less in the money, and her day-to-day expenses and generosity did not allow her to save much money. In a 2016 interview before <b>she</b> died, <b>when</b> asked, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali was her favorite singer.|$|R

50|$|The {{marriage}} is discussed only among {{the bride and}} groom and is meant to be a surprise for the parents, particularly the woman's parents. The date of the wedding is set and the wife's family is invited to the groom's village to celebrate. The woman's family then visits to make sure the woman is marrying of her own free will. This is a polite formality. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> has <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is sure of her decision, then congratulations are welcomed. The wedding ceremony takes one week. Each day is a celebration of the bride and she is treated royally.|$|R
60|$|Except when a {{constrained}} and singular reserve crept over her; {{and then}} she seemed (but Florence hardly understood this, though she could not choose but notice it, and think about it) {{as if she were}} humbled before Florence, and ill at ease. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not her Mama yet, and when Florence had called her the mistress of everything there, this change in her was quick and startling; and now, while the eyes of Florence rested on her face, she sat as though she would have shrunk and hidden from her, rather than as one about to love and cherish her, in right of such a near connexion.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the eve of}} poll, the Labour Party {{circulated}} a leaflet {{which drew}} attention to remarks by the sitting Conservative Member in Parliament, Viscountess Davidson, on 15 December 1949 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>that</b> bread and dripping was [...] "the best possible food a child could have"; the leaflet was headlined [...] "Bread and Dripping! [...] - [...] Lady Davidson's 'Best Diet' for workers' children". The Conservative Party objected that the comments had {{been taken out of}} context. On polling day, Viscountess Davidson won by nearly 7,000 votes with Moss taking a clear second place; it was said by the local newspaper that Moss had done better than generally expected. Moss took comfort {{from the fact that the}} Labour vote had increased from the previous election.|$|R

500|$|Wise's {{main source}} of {{diversion}} during this period was funerals; she seldom missed a visit to any funeral held {{in or near the}} town, whether she had known the deceased or not. <b>When</b> questioned, <b>she</b> simply <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> liked funerals. Albert Wise died suddenly in 1923, leaving his wife a 40-year-old widow with four children.
