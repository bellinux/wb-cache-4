Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First <b>World</b> <b>more</b> skeptical of Soviet {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E
