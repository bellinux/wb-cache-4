First, there is a robust negative relationship between the cost <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and institutional ownership stability. Second, institutional ownership stability plays a bigger role in determining the cost <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> than the institutional ownership level commonly used in the literature.

We start the paper by documenting this inverse relation for those OECD Countries which have reached very high levels <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> We then provide a theory of the joint movements <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and maturity which can explain both sets of facts.

By integrating the area between benefit and cost functions we estimate that the equilibrium net benefit <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> is 3. 5 % of asset value, resulting from an estimated gross benefit <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> 10. 4 % of asset value and an estimated cost <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> 6. 9 %.

40|$|I {{examine the}} role <b>of</b> {{third-party}} <b>debt</b> collectors in consumer credit markets.

A one-percent change in the number <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> collectors per capita leads to a 0. 49 % change in the average credit card balance and a 1. 32 % change in the average balance on non-credit card unsecured loans. There is also some evidence that creditors substitute unsecured credit for secured credit when the number <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> collectors increases. Higher density <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> collectors improves recoveries, which enables lenders to extend more credit. Finally, creditors charge higher interest rates and lend to a larger pool of borrowers when the density <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> collectors increases, presumably because better collections enable them to extend credit to riskier applicants...|$|R
