5|$|Temple 22 (Structure 5D-22) is a south-facing {{building}} located centrally on {{the north}} side of the basal platform. Temple 22 underwent three principal phases of construction. The earliest version of this structure was built around AD 250; a second version of the temple was built over it around AD 350; this version was decorated <b>with</b> <b>giant</b> stucco masks. The final version of the temple dates to the 5th century AD. Temple 22 has been extensively investigated by archaeologists with portions of the 5th-century architecture being stripped away to expose the earlier versions. A tomb in the Temple 22 was looted at some point during the Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|The Undertaker's feud <b>with</b> <b>Giant</b> Gonzalez was an {{offshoot}} of The Undertaker's feud with manager Harvey Wippleman. The Undertaker defeated Kamala, who was managed by Wippleman, at SummerSlam 1992. A rematch was held at Survivor Series 1992, and The Undertaker beat Kamala in a coffin match. Wippleman vowed revenge, and he introduced Gonzalez at Royal Rumble 1993 and instructed him to attack The Undertaker. The Undertaker was eliminated from the Royal Rumble match {{as a result of}} the interference, and a match was scheduled between The Undertaker and Giant Gonzalez for WrestleMania IX.|$|E
5|$|The {{cars had}} an aluminium-alloy {{double-skinned}} construction, and were delivered unpainted to save time. A red adhesive strip {{ran through the}} length of the cars in the middle to match the operator's visual branding. The unpainted cars had a shiny appearance upon delivery, but as dirt and grime accumulated it became a recurring problem for the operator and attracted several public complaints. In response, MRT Corporation built a wash machine at Bishan Depot in an attempt to clean up the cars' exterior proper. After refurbishment, the problem was solved by covering the cars' exterior entirely <b>with</b> <b>giant</b> stickers, creating a livery that is similar to the newer C751B and C151A rolling stocks.|$|E

5|$|The {{cluster is}} slowly {{moving in the}} {{direction}} of the feet of what is currently the constellation of Orion. Like most open clusters, the Pleiades will not stay gravitationally bound forever. Some component stars will be ejected after close encounters with other stars; others will be stripped by tidal gravitational fields. Calculations suggest that the cluster will take about 250 million years to disperse, with gravitational interactions <b>with</b> <b>giant</b> molecular clouds and the spiral arms of our galaxy also hastening its demise.|$|E
5|$|At the Penitentiary, Quinn {{releases}} Poison Ivy {{from her}} cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production {{facility in the}} Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that {{it can only be}} made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island <b>with</b> <b>giant</b> mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can choose}} from a cast of 20 playable drivers divided in 10 pairs. All of the {{characters}} have their own special items which are unique to them, like Mario and Luigi with Fireballs, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong <b>with</b> <b>Giant</b> Bananas, Bowser and Bowser Jr. with Bowser Shells, Yoshi and Birdo with Eggs, Peach and Daisy with Hearts, Wario and Waluigi with Bob-ombs, Koopa Troopa (who previously appeared in Super Mario Kart) and Paratroopa with Triple Shells, Toad and Toadette with Golden Mushrooms, and Baby Mario and Baby Luigi with Chain Chomps. Petey Piranha and King Boo have the unique ability to use {{any of the other}} characters' special items excluding Luigi's Green Fireball and Birdo's Pink Egg. There are 21 karts in all and the character's weight class (light, middle, or heavy) determines the kart in which they can ride as well as their speed, acceleration, and weight attributes.|$|E

5|$|Various feeding {{behaviours}} were proposed before {{more complete}} remains of Deinocheirus were known, {{and it was}} early on envisioned as a predatory, allosaur-like animal <b>with</b> <b>giant</b> arms. In their original description, Osmólska and Roniewicz found that the hands of Deinocheirus were unsuited for grasping, but could instead {{have been used to}} tear prey apart. In 1970, the Russian paleontologist Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky compared the forelimbs of Deinocheirus to sloths, leading him to hypothesise that Deinocheirus was a specialised climbing dinosaur, that fed on plants and animals found in trees. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul instead suggested that the claws were too blunt for predatory purposes, but would have been good defensive weapons. While attempting to determine the ecological niches for Deinocheirus and Therizinosaurus in 2010, Phil Senter and James H. Robins suggested that Deinocheirus had the largest vertical feeding range due to its hip height, and specialised in eating high foliage.|$|E

5|$|With the {{ambition}} to become London's sole burial site in perpetuity, the LNC {{were aware that}} if their plans were successful, their Necropolis would become a site of major national importance. As a consequence, the cemetery was designed with attractiveness in mind, {{in contrast to the}} squalid and congested London burial grounds and the newer suburban cemeteries which were already becoming crowded. The LNC aimed to create an atmosphere of perpetual spring in the cemetery, and chose the plants for the cemetery accordingly. It had already been noted that evergreen plants from North America thrived in the local soil. Robert Donald, the owner of an arboretum near Woking, was contracted to supply the trees and shrubs for the cemetery. The railway line through the cemetery and the major roads and paths within the cemetery were lined <b>with</b> <b>giant</b> sequoia trees, the first significant planting of these trees (only introduced to Europe in 1853) in Britain. As well as the giant sequoias, the grounds were heavily planted with magnolia, rhododendron, coastal redwood, azalea, andromeda and monkeypuzzle, with the intention of creating perpetual greenery with large numbers of flowers and a strong floral scent throughout the cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Glasgow based {{animation}} studio, Axis Animation, assisted 343 Industries on {{the creation}} of CGI cinematics for the Spartan Ops game mode. Axis have produced animations for numerous video games, including the award-winning announcement trailer for Dead Island. To make each Spartan Ops episode as engaging as possible the team at Axis shot and edited episodes in live action using performance capture. The team then used the reference cameras at the live action shoot to create a performance edit, before shooting with CG cameras to provide more coverage of all scenes and a greater selection of shots for the editorial team. The shading team at Axis made use of the 3D animation package, Houdini, to procedurally generate the environment in the cinematics. Axis worked with Glasgow-based audio post production company Savalas on sound design and the final mix for the Spartan Ops cinematics. Facial motion capture was also utilized to take the movements and facial expressions from actors and apply them to the in-game cinematics for both Spartan Ops and campaign. Performance capture for both campaign and Spartan Ops cutscenes was directed and recorded at Giant Studios. Axis worked in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>Giant</b> Studios and Cubic Motion to develop a special facial motion capture solution that would retain facial expressions from the actors when creating the animation.|$|E

25|$|The track {{climbs up}} through the forest. On the {{northern}} {{side of the mountain}} there is no bamboo zone, so the forest gradually turns into moorland covered <b>with</b> <b>giant</b> heather. The track ends at Old Moses Camp and becomes a path. This continues up the hill before splitting into two routes. To the left, the least used path goes {{around the side of the}} Barrow, to Likii North Hut. The vegetation becomes more sparse, <b>with</b> <b>giant</b> lobelia and groundsels dotted around. The path climbs over a ridge, before rejoining the main path ascending the Mackinder Valley. Shipton's Cave can be found in the rock wall to the left of the steep path just before reaching Shipton's Camp.|$|E
