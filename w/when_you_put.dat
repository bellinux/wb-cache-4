25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> on the gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe {{a quarter of the}} way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E
500|$|Unlike in a {{traditional}} film soundtrack, Moore often wrote music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] Moore explained that {{a traditional}} soundtrack needs to convey {{the mood of the}} scene and advance the film's storyline, but {{that he did not have}} to do that with Graveyard Mountain Home [...] "because the director's not around". [...] "I thought, well what would it be like if I did a totally different kind of mood than this scene is trying to convey? <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> that music with that scene what happens there? Sometimes it's kind of interesting what happens," [...] Moore explained.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{decided not}} to {{replicate}} the X-Men costumes {{as seen in the}} comic book. Stan Lee and Chris Claremont supported this decision. Claremont joked, [...] "you can do that on a drawing, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it on people it's disturbing!" [...] Producer/co-writer Tom DeSanto had been supportive of using the blue and yellow color scheme of the comics, but came to conclude that they would not work onscreen. To acknowledge the fan complaints, Singer added Cyclops' line [...] "What would you prefer, yellow spandex?" [...] – when Wolverine complains about wearing their uniforms – during filming. Singer noted that durable black leather made more sense for the X-Men to wear as protective clothing, and Shuler Donner added that the costumes helped them [...] "blend into the night".|$|E

500|$|Armitage {{performs}} his own stunts. When performing fight scenes, {{they would}} be choreographed carefully so Armitage could take part rather than a stunt double. For series eight, Armitage performed a fight scene in a swimming pool, which he thought was [...] "fun," [...] but also thought it was difficult as it was [...] "like acting and punching in slow motion." [...] In another sequence, he injured a stuntman with a hospital trolley. He was only given a short lesson {{on how to handle}} firearms, since he was already accustomed to using them whilst working on Ultimate Force. While discussing the shootout at the end of series seven, Armitage noted that he is [...] "not a violent person but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> a gun in somebody's hands [...] it's like a little animal comes out of you that wants to fire the gun again." ...|$|E
500|$|On 9 December 1980, McCartney {{followed}} {{the news that}} Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was [...] surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: [...] "It's a drag". The press quickly criticised him for {{what appeared to be}} a superficial response. He later explained, [...] "When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, [...] "It's a drag".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make." [...] He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last conversation with Lennon: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{sometime}} during Summer 2008. Miller wanted to style the filming {{as if the}} cameras are following the team like in a documentary. The first day was spent in the [...] "Ottawa Bravo" [...] safe house set, where Connie reveals the threat. Throughout the shoot, Gemma Jones had hip problems. Concerned, the producers set up a body double on hand. However, Jones insisted she could do everything herself, {{and in the end}} the double was not used. During the first shootout scene in the episode, Miller wanted to make the sequence as real as possible by having the camera film as if it was under attack. Richard Armitage recalled the shootout sequence; [...] "There was a shoot-out in the final episode where I surprised myself about the amount of rounds I could pull off and how quickly. It's a weird thing. I'm not a violent person but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> a gun in somebody's hands something strange happens. It's like a little animal comes out of you that wants to fire the gun again." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{opened to}} mixed feedback, and aired {{back-to-back}} with [...] "Good Mourning", as a two-hour season premiere special. Alan Sepinwall of NJ.com {{commented on the}} two episodes being conjoined into one week: [...] "I keep {{going back and forth}} on whether {{it was a good idea}} to do that, or if we'd have been better off spacing out the tearful speeches over two weeks. That isn't to say that there shouldn't have been tears, or speeches. George's death, no matter how marginal he had become last season, is and should be a huge event in the lives of these characters. Had the show raced through Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's famous five stages of grief, it would have rang false, as if everyone making the show was in a hurry to move past the events of the wildly uneven fifth season. My problem is, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> two episodes back-to-back, those rhythms - the pace at which the acts build to emotional crescendos and then briefly recede - start to become too predictable, and it sucks some of the life and emotion away."

Mikael Wood of Billboard gave the song a {{positive}} review, stating that it [...] "has a juicy and instantly memorable vocal hook". In {{a review of}} the album, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy coined the song [...] "electro-thumping", commenting that it was [...] "as innocent as the purity ring on Gomez's finger and showcases her polished vocals perfectly." [...] Copsey also stated that the impressive hooks present in the song do not appear on the album anywhere else. In a single review, Nick Levine also of Digital Spy said was the most Disney-affiliated single with club appeal since Miley Cyrus' [...] "See You Again". When commenting on whether Gomez would be a mainstay in music, Levine said, [...] "It's too soon to tell - but most Scando-popettes would dye their locks brunette for this tune." [...] Although stating that it was very cliche, a writer for Popjustice said that the song [...] "seems like a boundary-smashing avant garde curiosity <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it alongside most other Hollywood Records output." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com ranked [...] "Naturally" [...] at number eighty-four on his list of [...] "Top 100 Pop Songs of 2010".|$|E

500|$|Mary Pols of Time {{praised the}} film's fantasy {{sequences}} {{for being able}} to show the audience a [...] "joyous Wizard of Oz energy" [...] that is able to [...] "open the door into Precious's mind in a way even [...] Sapphire couldn't." [...] Pols felt that, while not implying that the film has [...] "a lack of compelling emotional material" [...] but that the film's [...] "few weak moments" [...] are the [...] "ones that dovetail with typical inspirational stories." [...] Marshall Fine, of The Huffington Post, praised the film as being [...] "a film that doesn't shy away from the depths to which human beings can sink, but it also shows the strength and resilience of which we are capable, even at our lowest moments." [...] Scott Mendelson, also of The Huffington Post, felt that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> the [...] "glaring issues aside," [...] the film [...] "still works as a potent character study and a glimpse inside a world we'd rather pretend does not exist in America." [...] But while the film [...] "succeeds as a powerful acting treat and a potent character study, there are some major narrative issues that prevent the film from being an accidental masterpiece." [...] Mendelson described the film as being [...] "an acting powerhouse" [...] based on its many emotional themes.|$|E
500|$|Another {{possible}} lover was Bill Duckett. As a teenager, {{he lived}} on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him {{a number of years}} and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, it is obvious that Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as [...] "thick". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover. Their photograph [...] is described as [...] "modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male–male desire. Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford, with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek, and whom he first met when Stafford was 18, in 1876. Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given {{over the course of a}} stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman, [...] "You know <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it on there was but one thing to part it from me, and that was death." ...|$|E
500|$|Cuse {{served as}} show runner and head writer. Boam, {{who served as}} {{executive}} producer, also contributed scripts for the show. The writing staff included John Wirth, Brad Kern, Tom Chehak, David Simkins, and John McNamara. They followed Cuse's informal instruction that {{the tone of the}} show remain [...] "just under over-the-top": the series would be humorous but not too campy. Every member of the staff participated in breaking down and analyzing the stories they conceived. Worth commented, [...] "there was a very high percentage of ideas that worked in the room and got translated to paper that worked <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> them on film. That doesn't always happen." [...] Cuse described long hours writing the show, including several overnight sessions. Each episode of Brisco was filmed in seven days, so the turn-around time for scripts was one week. McNamara said that he became a [...] "student of TV history" [...] while writing for Brisco, reviewing old episodes of Maverick for inspiration on using humor in the Western genre. He said the writing team felt the television audience was ready for a [...] "trans-genre form", because much of the audience grew up with Lethal Weapon, , and The Wild Wild West. Researchers Lynnette Porter and Barry Porter acknowledge the writer's familiarity with Mark Twain's novel Pudd'nhead Wilson. Porter and Porter describe the novel as an [...] "ancestor text", because the characters of Brisco and Bly both refer to it, and say that this type of literary device is used again by Cuse in Lost.|$|E

[...] According to the project's lead architect, the correction of the quote was not a simple matter, as the current inscription is chiseled into the existing granite blocks.

2500|$|In 1893, the {{distance}} between the pitcher and home plate was extended by nine feet, resulting in a dramatic increase in batting averages. The rule change helped Zimmer statistically, as he compiled a [...]308 batting average, the first of four [...]300 seasons. However, Zimmer bemoaned the rule change's effect on pitchers: [...] "They are making the pitcher a mere automaton. By and by they will make him stand on a cake of ice and pitch. Say what you will, the pitcher is the central figure in the game.

So he changed the song from minor to major and sped up the tempo. [...] "Cold Dark World" [...] is a song that was written by Rivers Cuomo and Scott Shriner and features Shriner on lead vocals. Shriner commented, [...] "...I wrote this kind of creepy music, and Rivers wrote these kind of happy, positive lyrics, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it together, it made a super-creepy song which I'm really proud of."
