25|$|Children come {{equipped}} with universal grammar, from which any natural human language will develop – without instruction. All {{that is needed}} is passive input during the critical period—defined in linguistics as that period within which a child must have necessary and sufficient exposure to human language so that language acquisition occurs; without sufficient exposure to primary linguistic data, the UG {{does not have the}} necessary input for development of an individual grammar; this period is commonly recognized as spanning from birth to adolescence, generally up to the age of 12 years, though individual variations are possible. If <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> predominantly hears (or sees via sign) as it is maturing through this critical period is the English spoken in Topeka, Kansas, then that is <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> will acquire. This is why, regardless of a child's ethnic/racial background (or any other non-relevant factor, the child will know Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu if the child's primary linguistic input is Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu, respectively.|$|E
500|$|During {{and after}} {{each of the}} {{role-playing}} scenes, Harris and the children discuss the situation and <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> should do. Harris tells the children not to be afraid to tell someone {{if they have been}} improperly touched, saying, [...] "Some people don't act right with kids, and they need help. You can't protect them from trouble that they themselves have caused, and it's better to say something so that you and the family can get the help you need. You know nothing gets better by keeping quiet about it." [...] Harris says that, if it is difficult to explain where they have been touched, they can draw a picture or point to the place on a doll. The film ends with [...] "My Body" [...] sung by a group of people including Harris, two police officers, and some children.|$|E
500|$|The {{creators of}} Sesame Street {{believed}} {{that young children}} were easily distracted by peripheral details and were unable to selectively attend to the most useful aspects of what they observed, so they gave special care to, as Lesser put it, [...] "make salient <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> is expected to learn". [...] They eliminated irrelevant and distracting content without making the content uninteresting, especially in repeated viewings. The content they presented had {{to compete with the}} distractions that occurred as a result of viewing at home, so they realized that the show had to have high appeal. They found, however, that the relationship between appeal and comprehension was more complicated than they initially thought, and discovered that young children probably did not attend to material that was presented at a higher level than they were ready to understand. [...] The Workshop's researchers found that by crafting the show's segments, children's verbal participation and interaction could be increased, which addressed their critics' concerns about children's passivity while watching television.|$|E

500|$|Vocabulary {{development}} {{during the}} school years builds upon <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> already knows, and the child uses this knowledge to broaden his or her vocabulary. Once children have gained a level of vocabulary knowledge, new words are learned through explanations using familiar, or [...] "old" [...] words. This is done either explicitly, when a new word is defined using old words, or implicitly, when the word {{is set in the}} context of old words so that the meaning of the new word is constrained. When children reach school-age, context and implicit learning are the most common ways in which their vocabularies continue to develop. By this time, children learn new vocabulary mostly through conversation and reading. Throughout schooling and adulthood, conversation and reading are the main methods in which vocabulary develops. [...] This growth tends to slow once a person finishes schooling, as they have already acquired the vocabulary used in everyday conversation and reading material and generally are not engaging in activities that require additional vocabulary development.|$|E

Jackson said, [...] "Getting back to that child, and giving the child <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> may have missed—the reassurance of a nourishing and accepting a love, a love that says you're special—is hard work. It can be scary but, like the song says, {{we have to deal}} with the past to live completely—and freely—in the present." [...] "Can't Be Stopped" [...] speaks of youth victimization, bigotry, and racial unity, [...] "directed at young people who are discouraged or discriminated against... I want them to know that their inner-strength is stronger than the forces against them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Private gifted {{assessment}} is usually expensive and educators recommend that parents {{take advantage of}} online screening tests to give a preliminary indication of potential giftedness. Another way to screen for giftedness before requesting a psychological {{assessment is}} to do a curriculum-based assessment. [...] Curriculum-based assessment {{is a form of}} achievement testing that focuses specifically on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> has been exposed to in their academic career. It can be done through school or a private educational center. Although this can determine if a child's performance in school potentially signifies giftedness, there are complications. For example, if a child changes school districts or country of residence, the different terminology of curriculum could hold that child back. Secondly, discrepancies between school districts, along with public and private education, create a very wide range of potential knowledge bases.|$|E
