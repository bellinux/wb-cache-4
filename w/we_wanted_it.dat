5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

Kesha's shots were recorded in London because our schedules were all over the place, and then I shot the rest in LA." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his {{departure}} from Fear Factory in 2002, guitarist Dino Cazares {{was looking for}} a drummer that [...] "fit in" [...] with the band. First he tried drummers John Sankey from Devolved and Nicholas Barker from the bands Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir. But both drummers had to return to their homelands of Australia and England respectively due to visa issues. He then met former Vital Remains drummer Tim Yeung. Cazares and Yeung recorded the material they wrote and sent tapes to Cummings for his vocal audition. Cazares comments [...] "We heard passion and anger in his voice, which was something <b>we</b> <b>wanted.</b> <b>It</b> was also very aggressive." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{sale of the}} band's North American {{independent}} {{record label}} Almo Sounds to Universal Music Group in early 2000 put the B-sides album on hold; Garbage decided to simply start work on recording their third album instead. Garbage began writing and recording the album at their own Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin in April of that year. [...] "The only vision we had was that <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to sound different," [...] recalled guitarist Duke Erikson about the influence that the two new tracks had cast, adding that the band wished to evolve the chemistry that the band had developed from touring the previous two years.|$|E
500|$|A demo of {{the song}} [...] "Crawl" [...] was sent to former Halford guitarist Pat Lachman who auditioned as vocalist. Lachman was hired, and New Found Power was formed in early 2003 with former Jerry Cantrell guitarist Shawn Matthews on bass initially, who was {{replaced}} after the album recording with the brothers' tattoo artist, Bob Zilla. When writing music, Vinnie claimed; [...] "we put no boundaries on it... <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be very diverse", and Darrell said [...] "We wanted to stretch out and expand our capabilities to their fullest." [...] The band {{changed its name to}} Damageplan and decided to name the first album New Found Power.|$|E

About the decision to cast Lawless as Hartley, who was always intended to be killed off at the end of the episode, Whedon said [...] "We wanted you to invest in the character and feel like this person was a real equal to Coulson. She definitely fit the bill on that front. Lucy has such a strength to her. We didn’t want people to know what was going to happen. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to feel like a big deal." ...|$|E

500|$|Maisie Williams {{also spoke}} with Entertainment Weekly and {{described}} the process behind Arya's scenes, saying [...] "We wanted people to think {{this could be the}} end, or the start of the end. Like maybe her wound is going to fester – like The Hound. We did so many different takes of emerging out of the water the first time she's stabbed and sliced. I had been to a music festival so I hadn't slept the whole weekend. Then I was jumping in the Irish sea. It was a totally manic day. We did a million different takes. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be real frantic and panicked. Arya hasn't been emotional in a long time and we wanted to bring that emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{wanted the}} video {{to show her}} without artifice, {{in a way that}} her videos may not have done in the past. There is a {{simplicity}} in the concept. For example, we love that she holds the handheld mic within the performance. The single cover was taken on the same day. We didn't want it to be a posed still or a [...] "fashion image", <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to show movement and energy and for it to be about her and her performance. Gaga drove the Bronco herself in the video and her commitment to the performance and her authentic raw energy really came across in the way she drove! For us, as directors, it was scary and exciting at the same time—the energy and emotion were purely authentic.|$|E
500|$|An {{earlier version}} of [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] was {{recorded}} with Al Schmitt at RCA Studios in Los Angeles on December 22, 1965, but Columbia Records refused to release that recording because {{it had not been}} produced at a Columbia-owned studio. [...] McGuinn has since stated that he believes this original version of the song to be more spontaneous sounding than the better known Columbia release. That opinion was echoed by Crosby, who commented [...] "It was a stunner, it was better, it was stronger. It had more flow to it. It was the way <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be." [...] This original version of [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] initially saw release on the 1987 archival album Never Before and was also included as a bonus track on the 1996 Columbia/Legacy CD reissue of Fifth Dimension.|$|E

500|$|On December 6, 2012, Paramore made an {{announcement}} through their official website revealing {{the name of}} the album and the release date as well as {{the name of the}} first single from the album. The track list was announced on January 18, 2013 by Alternative Press. During the 2013 Soundwave Festival, Paramore held a listening party in Sydney, New South Wales on February 26, 2013, followed by Melbourne, Victoria two days later, run by Australian Music Channel, Channel V. Williams revealed a section of the lyrics for the song 'Part II' which the winners were able to hear at the listening parties on a LiveJournal post. Williams told fans that [...] "'Let The Flames Begin' has been a favorite of ours to play live, as well as being a favorite of most people who come out to our shows.... <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to have a sequel.

They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So as I thought about it, it made sense to me that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV, Beyoncé stated that the songs put altogether tell a complete story and noted that each song was a subsequent continuation to the next one. She concluded, [...] " [...] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything that <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be." [...] For {{the music of the}} album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by The Emotions, Jodeci and SWV mixing elements of their music. Destiny Fulfilled is predominantly an R concept album tracing a woman's relationship journey. Critics further found elements of soul music, dance and hip-hop. The album is mostly composed of mid and slowtempo balladry following the opening two songs; Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian felt that the ballads showcased [...] "the girliness in the trio, musically and lyrically". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine found elements of middle of the road music in the ballads.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{images were}} stored on a 1GB image card that {{was capable of}} holding {{approximately}} 100 frames of animation. Eight roving camera teams—each team including a lighting cameraman, an assistant, a lighting electrician and a set dresser to deal with any art department issues—worked with the animators to set up shots. Each camera team had a [...] "lighting station" [...] workstation—comprising an Apple G4 computer and a monitor to assist in checking lighting and framing—to view TIFF file versions of the camera's images. Once a shot was approved, the computer was removed and the animators were left to shoot the scene using their still camera and [...] "grabber" [...] computer/camera system to check their work. The film's story department head Jeffrey Lynch explained that the scenes were developed initially from storyboards created by a team, saying: [...] "We shot {{as close to a}} 1:1 film ratio [...] as we could because {{there was no time for}} reshoots. We did most of our experimentation in the storyboard process—as many ways as needed—to get the scene how <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it.</b> There was no coverage, as there would be for a live-action film." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2014, it was {{announced}} that Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films and Crystal Lake Entertainment were planning to produce an hour-long Friday the 13th television series.

On August 2015, it {{was announced}} that the series was being developed by The CW. Steve Mitchell and Craig Van Sickle were hired to write the pilot, while Sean S. Cunningham, Randall Emmett, George Furla and Mark Canton would be the executive producers. On August 2016, the network announced that decided to not move forward with the series. The CW president Mark Pedowitz explained, “We had better pilots. The bottom line is we felt we had stronger things to go with, and we didn’t go forward with it. It was well-written, it was darker than <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be, and we didn’t believe it had sustainability... We didn’t believe that it was a sustainable script, a sustainable series. It was a very good pilot, but not a sustainable series." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} episode, Lieberstein said {{he sought to}} appeal to {{newcomers}} to the series and attract them to the show, without alienating regular The Office watchers: [...] "We {{wanted to do a}} stand-alone comedy episode that could bring people in." [...] Lieberstein said the script drew less attention to long-standing story arcs, which new viewers would not understand. Lieberstein said, [...] "It almost had an air of a pilot in a way, where we had to reintroduce everything. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be extremely funny and extremely funny up front." [...] The Office creator Greg Daniels said he felt the episode had to focus on physical comedy and easily accessible set pieces. Daniels said, [...] "I looked at all the shows that followed the Super Bowl in years past and I feel that a comedy would be a good choice in the current climate. People want to laugh so we're trying our best to supply some laughs." [...] Actor Rainn Wilson said of the episode, [...] "It's a great opportunity for people to revisit the world of The Office and hopefully get into our style of comedy." ...|$|E

500|$|While Ravi K. Chandran was {{assigned}} as the cinematographer of Agneepath, he [...] opted {{out of the}} film after filming certain portions, for unknown reasons. Kiran Deohans was later contracted to replace him. Sabu Cyril was contracted as the production designer for the film, along {{with a team of}} 200 people. He explained the creation of Kancha's den by saying that he built a haveli-like structure with tantric paintings on the walls, resembling an old fort built by the Portuguese (who had historically occupied Diu). Vijay's home, on the other hand, was a [...] "small sack-like thing" [...] on the terrace of a chawl, which was built on an open ground with a hundred houses. Cyril added, [...] "We wanted a tree to be {{at the edge of a}} hillside, protruding out due to erosion, with not enough soil. We made this banyan tree with fibre as <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to have a particular look." [...] This tree forms a visual thread to represent Kancha's atrocities in the film.

500|$|Filming for the Superman Returns sequel was {{to start}} in mid-2007, before Singer halted {{development}} in favor of Valkyrie. Filming was then pushed to March 2008, but writers Dougherty and Dan Harris left in favor of other career opportunities. The 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike pushed the release date to 2010. Singer still listed the sequel as a priority in March 2008, saying that the film was in early development. Routh expected filming to begin in early 2009. Paul Levitz, president of DC Comics, expected Routh to reprise the title role from Superman Returns before his contract for a sequel expired in 2009. However, with Warner Bros. deciding to reboot the film series, Singer dropped {{out in favor of}} directing Jack the Giant Slayer. In August 2008, Warner Bros. President of Production Jeff Robinov reflected, [...] "Superman Returns didn't quite work as a film in the way that <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to. It didn't position the character the way he needed to be positioned. Had Superman worked in 2006, we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009.

The idea came up quickly, we all latched on to it, and it just felt right. We didn't want to kill a character {{for the sake of}} killing. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to have consequences for surviving characters to deal with in future episodes." [...] Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 after reaching a deal with Fox to record her lines from her home in Denver. Since returning, she has voiced Maude in flashbacks and as a ghost. When asked by The Denver Post on how she thought Ned was doing without Maude, she replied: [...] "OK. But Maude was such a vulnerable character. Maude and Lisa and Marge were the only vulnerable characters, really, everybody else has an edge. So they [...] discovered that arc was lost, and now {{there are a lot of}} flashbacks with Maude." ...|$|E
