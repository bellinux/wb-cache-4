5|$|Early enemy designs {{included}} tanks, combat planes, and battleships. Nishikado, however, was {{not satisfied}} with the enemy movements; technical limitations made it difficult to simulate flying. Humans <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to simulate, but Nishikado considered shooting them immoral. After seeing a magazine feature about Star Wars, he thought of using a space theme. Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds—he had watched the 1953 film adaptation as a child—and created initial bitmap images after the octopus-like aliens. Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs. The game was originally titled Space Monsters, inspired by a popular song in Japan at the time ("Monster"), but was changed to Space Invaders by Nishikado's superiors.|$|E
25|$|Under {{this job}} contract, which aimed to {{encourage}} {{the creation of new}} jobs, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier,</b> during a contract's first two years, for workers under twenty-six years old to be fired. It would have allowed employers the opportunity to terminate employment of workers under twenty-six without any reason, within their first two years of employment. Those opposed to the First Employment Contract were worried that it could compromise job security, encourage social pressure with a view to lowering wages, and impede employees in having legal recourse in cases of sexual harassment or other abuse, since this could lead to their subsequently being fired.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is famous}} for a New Year celebration where lighted tar barrels are carried on the heads of revellers called guisers. This {{tradition}} dates back to 1858. It appears to have originated from the lighting of a silver band that were carolling at New Year. They were unable to use candles to light their music due to the strong winds, so someone suggested a tar barrel be used. Having to move from place to place, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to carry the barrels upon the guisers' heads, rather than rolling them. There have been claims {{that it is a}} pagan festival, however, these claims are unfounded.|$|E

25|$|One of nine {{changes to}} the {{starting}} eleven, Redmond produced an outstanding performance as Birmingham outclassed Maribor in the last group stage fixture. Apart from Jovan Vidović's early header that went wide, the attacking play was all Birmingham's. After 24 minutes, Rooney scored his first European goal, a close-range header from a Redmond cross, then Žigić failed {{to take a couple}} of chances, Davies failed to make contact with a Redmond corner when it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to score, and Redmond himself hit a half-volley against the post from distance. His marker, Arghus, was perhaps fortunate to escape a red card for a high tackle born of frustration. But ten-man Braga could only draw with Brugge, so Birmingham's ten points were not enough.|$|E
25|$|According to Pascal Lamy of the World Trade Organisation, all Post-Soviet {{states that}} buy gas from Gazprom should pay market prices {{to improve the}} {{efficiency}} of their economies. Lamy stated that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to resolve the conflict if both Russia and Ukraine had been WTO members. Moreover, {{he added that the}} problem had arisen in the first place because neither Russia nor Ukraine experience true market prices, producing inefficient energy uses amongst the states. He added that the incident would not influence Russia's acceptance into the WTO. Illarionov noted in this respect {{that there is no such}} thing as a market price for gas, because Russia offers different terms for analogous countries, e.g. gas price for Ukraine is not calculated in the same way as for Germany.|$|E
25|$|An {{early and}} {{influential}} {{book about the}} subject of a moon-landing conspiracy, We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, was self-published in 1976 by Bill Kaysing. Despite having no knowledge of rockets or technical writing, Kaysing, a former US Navy officer with a Bachelor of Arts in English, was hired as a senior technical writer in 1956 by Rocketdyne, the company that built the F-1 engines used on the Saturn V rocket. He served as head of the technical publications unit at the company's Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. Kaysing's book made many allegations, and effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked. The book claims that the chance of a successful manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the USSR, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to really go there.|$|E

25|$|On {{this subject}} the king's prejudices were insurmountable, and his ministers had the {{weakness}} {{to give way}} to them. It was impossible to defend a system which confined the suffrage to 200,000 citizens and returned a chamber of whom half were placemen. Nothing <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> than to strengthen the conservative party by attaching the suffrage to the possession of land in France, but blank resistance was the sole answer of the government to the moderate demands of the opposition. Warning after warning was addressed to them in vain by friends and by foes alike, and they remained profoundly unconscious of their danger till the moment when it overwhelmed them. Strange to say, Guizot never acknowledged either at the time or to his dying day the nature of this error, and he speaks of himself in his memoirs as the much-enduring champion of liberal government and constitutional law. He utterly failed to perceive that a more enlarged view of the liberal destinies of France and a less intense confidence in his own specific theory might have preserved the constitutional monarchy and averted a vast series of calamities, which were in the end fatal to every principle he most cherished. But with the stubborn conviction of absolute truth he dauntlessly adhered to his own doctrines to the end.|$|E
500|$|The film's title {{came from}} the song [...] "Naan Paadum Mouna Ragam", from Ratnam's Idaya Kovil (1985). Although he began work on the script while making Pallavi Anu Pallavi, Mouna Ragam did not begin {{production}} until after Idaya Kovil release. Ratnam said that due to budgetary constraints it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to send the female lead to Bangalore instead of Delhi, {{but he did not}} want her to be able to easily return to her parents because she could not adjust to her husband. The line [...] "Neenga thottaa kambilipoochi oorraa madhri irukku", spoken by Divya to Chandrakumar, expressed how she would feel on her wedding night.|$|E
500|$|Edge {{wrote that}} Titanfall major issue was the Xbox One, which {{performed}} less admirably {{compared to the}} PC version. GameSpot Chris Watters acknowledged that the PC's higher resolution was expected and that the Xbox 360 version had an even lower resolution, frame rate issues, and texture pop-in, though it still handled the game well. Peter Bright of Ars Technica wrote that the game's visuals were [...] "lacking", with flat lighting and static environments. OXM Mikel Reparaz thought that the title {{should have been a}} launch release, where it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to overlook its sparse content. Minding the processing power behind the battles, the reviewers were not particularly impressed by the graphics. Eurogamer Dan Whitehead compared the game's aesthetics to Pacific Rim and District 9.|$|E

500|$|Tessa's death {{occurs in}} the fourth episode of the second season; [...] "The Darkness". The {{creative}} staff decided Tessa would die in a random carjacking incident. Tessa's death played {{no role in the}} episode's main storyline. It was not formulaic; the writers wanted to shock the audience. Abramowitz said that [...] "...it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to kill her off in the episode," [...] but the writers [...] "...wanted it to be a surprise and show how shocking [...] was to [...]" [...] Horvath said that [...] "...losing a loved one to a random act of violence isn't something that only happens to television action heroes or Immortals or people in another type of life, it happens in the real world too- totally unexpectedly, at a moment that makes no sense dramatically." [...] Tessa's death scene shows MacLeod kneeling next to Tessa and holding her corpse, then Richie reviving as an Immortal and speaking with MacLeod.|$|E

The rescue work was difficult, as there is no road connection to the area and all materials have to be transported to the area by air. In addition, the mobile telephone and radio network was out. Representatives stated that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> if they could have used the GSM-R network operated by the railway, which was functioning. The train, which consisted of a twin Class 73 electric multiple unit, burnt up and was destroyed in the fire. These cost [...] (€12.7M as of June 2011) each. The fire forced the temporary closure of the Bergen Line, which was reopened in the evening on 23 June. The cost of the accident was [...] (€31.8M as of June 2011), of which most was for the unit which was written off.|$|E
500|$|The {{workforce}} {{consisted of}} a mixture of German specialists and forcibly conscripted Frenchmen from the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO). They were supplemented by Belgian, Dutch, French, Polish, Czech and Soviet prisoners of war and civilian conscripts, who were used as slave labour. The labour force also included many French political prisoners and Spanish Republicans who had fled to France after General Franco's victory in the Spanish Civil War but had then been interned by the invading Germans. The non-German workers lived in two camps officially known as Organisation Todt Watten Zwangsarbeitslager 62 (Forced Labour Camp 62) about [...] distant from the site, {{near the village of}} Éperlecques. The camps were guarded by the French civil police with the assistance of Belgian and Dutch Nazis and Russian POWs who had volunteered for guard duty. Although escape attempts were punished by immediate execution, there were up to three escapes daily with external assistance. The commandant of the camp is said to have complained that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to [...] "guard a sack of fleas". Over 35,000 foreign workers passed through the camps during the period in which they were operational.|$|E

500|$|Wainwright {{observed}} {{while driving}} {{in his car}} that [...] "it [...] be funny to redo this as a song cycle". Soon afterwards, he took the idea to New York-based theatrical producer Jared Geller (who would later co-produce the tribute concert with David Foster), hoping to turn a dream into a reality. Geller initially thought the idea was [...] "insane", but he and Wainwright continued discussing options. Eventually, Geller agreed {{to assist with the}} production and the two found space in Wainwright's schedule to book Carnegie Hall a year in advance. Once the venue was booked, staging elements such as lighting, microphone location and amplification were discussed. Stephen Oremus signed on as the conductor of the 36-piece orchestra and Phil Ramone took charge of the recording. Rehearsals began in April 2006, and while it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to practice in rehearsal rooms, large theaters such as the Lynch at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Museum of Jewish Heritage were utilized because [...] "Rufus wanted a feel for performing this material on a stage". As a result of financial restrictions, full orchestra rehearsals took place only two days before the show and the day of each performance (practice with smaller groups of instruments began a few months before the concerts).|$|E
500|$|During {{a period}} of {{aggressive}} acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of Britain's collection, it was acquired for the National Gallery in 1860 in Milan from the Guicciardi family by Charles Lock Eastlake for just over £120, along {{with a number of}} other Netherlandish works. Eastlake's notes mention that the works were [...] "originally in the possession of the Foscari family". The Foscaris were a wealthy Venetian family which included Francesco Foscari who was Doge of Venice at the time the work was painted; the dramatic story of him and his son is told in Lord Byron's play The Two Foscari, and Verdi's opera I due Foscari. There is no documentary evidence to substantiate the claim that the painting came from the Foscari [...] collection, and some art historians believe that representatives of the Guicciardis invented this provenance to impress Eastlake. Lorne Campbell considers the provenance [...] "probable", noting that a descendant, Fergio Foscari (1732–1811), an ambassador to Saint Petersburg, squandered his fortune and may have been forced into selling pictures belonging to the family. Campbell speculates that the painting was produced on commission for export to Venice, noting that unrolled linen <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to transport than canvas, and that the row of holes just below the upper border could be explained if it had been stretched, mounted and framed by someone other than Bouts or a member of his workshop.|$|E
500|$|Multiple storylines {{spanning}} {{the first two}} seasons were brought to a close in the two-part season finale, including {{the search for the}} demon Azazel and the existence of Azazel's psychic children. As many of the show's questions are answered in one long conversation by Azazel, series creator Eric Kripke and writer Sera Gamble had to rewrite the demon's speech multiple times because they felt that [...] "the payoff [...] never as good as the anticipation". Though it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> for them to keep postponing the revelations, the writers believed they would get [...] "crushed under the anticipation" [...] because they {{would not be able to}} satisfy fans if they kept building up more expectations. As for the psychic children, the writers originally intended to continue their storyline into the third season, but ultimately killed them off after deciding that the characters were not as interesting as demons and monsters. In the first version of the script, the character of Lily was two roles: a girl named Alex who could kill with a single touch, and a telepath named Lily. Believing they had too many characters, the writers combined Alex and Lily into one. Gamble had envisioned the episode as a [...] "psychic Breakfast Club", so the new Lily's motivation was that she was Ally Sheedy. The Acheri demon responsible for two of the psychic children's deaths was based on the Acheri from Hindu mythology; writer Sera Gamble felt that it being a [...] "diseased spirit" [...] that comes down from the mountains and [...] "kills everybody in the settlements" [...] fit in with the abandoned mountain-side town that the episode takes place in. Harvelle's Roadhouse—a saloon frequented by demon hunters—was dropped from the show in these episodes as well, as Kripke disliked the concept of having a fixed home for a road-based series. With the Roadhouse's destruction came the death of recurring character Ash, whom the writers had been phasing out during the season because they felt his [...] "comical" [...] and [...] "wacky" [...] personality was too unrealistic for the show.|$|E

50|$|Almost all railway {{cars and}} {{locomotives}} have handbrakes for one, more or all axles. No {{one on the}} train applies them, although they are near the handwheel.

2500|$|Queensberry then {{publicly}} insulted Wilde by leaving, at the latter's club, {{a visiting}} card {{on which he}} had written: [...] "For Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic)". The wording is in dispute – the handwriting is unclear – although Hyde reports it as this. According to Merlin Holland, Wilde's grandson, {{it is more likely}} [...] "Posing somdomite," [...] while Queensberry himself claimed it to be [...] "Posing as somdomite". Holland suggests that this wording ("posing ...") <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to defend in court.|$|E
2500|$|Shearson {{had asked}} the court to {{overrule}} those precedents in its briefs and arguments, citing White's Byrd concurrence, but Timbers demurred. While he allowed that the Supreme Court might accept that argument, [...] "it would be improvident for us to disregard clear judicial precedent in this Circuit based on mere speculation," [...] he wrote. [...] "We think that the orderly administration of justice will be best served if we as one of the inferior courts follow Supreme Court precedent and adhere to the settled law of this Circuit, and a fortiori the district courts should do likewise." [...] At the end of his opinion he said in a footnote that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to decide the issue if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had submitted an amicus curiae brief giving its perspective on arbitration.|$|E
2500|$|A part {{engraved}} jewel {{has also}} {{been found in the}} vicinity. Such activities would have needed skilled, not slave labour. No workshops or furnaces have yet been found, but it is likely that both existed on site. Ingots of gold <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to transport than dust or nuggets, although a high-temperature refractory furnace will have been needed to melt the gold, which has a melting point of 1064°C. Pliny mentions such special furnaces in his Naturalis Historia. A workshop will have been vital for building and maintaining mining equipment such as the drainage wheels, flumes for washing tables, shuttering for aqueducts, crushing equipment and pit-props. [...] Official mints would have produced gold coins, a key component of Roman currency.
