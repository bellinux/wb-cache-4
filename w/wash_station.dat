40|$|Public {{awareness}} of aquatic invasive species and proper boat cleaning procedures {{may prove to}} be beneficial in reducing the transport and establishment of aquatic invasive species like New Zealand mud snails and zebra and quagga mussels as well as hydrilla and Eurasian watermilfoil. The primary objectives of this research project were to observe the use and determine the efficacy of a public boat <b>wash</b> <b>station</b> as well as increase the public’s {{awareness of}} proper boat cleaning procedures and aquatic invasive species. The Tenmile Lakes Basin Partnership, Oregon State Marine Board, and the United States Forest Service (USFS) have undertaken an initiative to increase public awareness of invasive species and proper cleaning procedures by building a boat <b>wash</b> <b>station</b> at the Tenmile Lake public boat launch. In the summer of 2012, 199 qualitative human subject surveys were administered at Tenmile Lake in Lakeside, Oregon to boaters on their boating habits and knowledge of invasive species prior to building the boat wash (“pre-boat wash”). An extension of the 2012 study was conducted in the summer of 2013 on 200 boaters after the completion of the Tenmile Lake boat <b>wash</b> <b>station</b> (“post-boat wash”). Comparisons were made on the observations and answers of boaters prior to and after the boat wash installation. Of the boaters surveyed in the pre-boat wash field season, 75. 9 % of boaters claimed they would use a boat <b>wash</b> <b>station</b> at Tenmile Lake. The actual use of the boat <b>wash</b> <b>station</b> based on observations made by the field researcher during the post-boat wash field season indicated only 38. 5 % of surveyed boaters used the station. Furthermore, more than 20 % of boaters could not verbally identify an invasive species in either field season when asked their awareness of aquatic invasive species. However, the majority of boaters surveyed at Tenmile Lake in the pre-boat wash field season (63. 3 %) and post-boat wash field season (66 %) were aware of the phrase “Clean, Drain, Dry”. These results identify a disconnect in what boaters say and what boaters do and the knowledge gaps boaters have on aquatic invasive species, but these results also identify a growing awareness of proper boat cleaning procedures...|$|E
40|$|The European Water Framework Directive {{requires}} the monitoring of priority pollutants entering surface waters. This includes notably the stormwater network. In this study, {{the contribution of}} discharges from wash stations to pollution of the stormwater network was investigated. Six wash stations discharging wastewater into the stormwater network were selected: (i) one trucks <b>wash</b> <b>station,</b> (ii) two self-service stations for cars and motorcycles, (iii) two bus wash stations, (iv) one subway <b>wash</b> <b>station.</b> Classical parameters (conductivity, pH, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, suspended solid) and organic micropollutants (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Total Hydrocarbons (TH) and Methylterbutylether (MTBE)) were checked and measured. Concentrations were compared with limit values from Greater Toulouse decontamination service regulations for the discharge licenses of carwashes, and under the French decree for discharges into the natural environment and with the proposed directive from the European Parliament and the Council, dealing with environmental quality standards. The result showed a decrease of pollution downstream of the pre-treatments for subway wash stations but not for bus wash stations.

40|$|Abstract—Deploying {{real-time}} {{control systems}} software on multiprocessors requires distributing tasks on multiple processing nodes and coordinating their executions using a protocol. One such protocol is the discrete-event (DE) model of computation. In this paper, we investigate distributed discrete-event (DE) with null-message protocol (NMP) on a multicore system for real-time control software. We illustrate analytically and experimentally that even with the null-message deadlock avoidance scheme in the protocol, the system can deadlock due to inter-core message dependencies. We identify two central reasons for such deadlocks: 1) {{the lack of an}} upper-bound on packet transmission rates and processing capability, and 2) an unknown upper-bound on the communication network delay. To address these, we propose using architectural features such as timing control and real-time network-on-chips to prevent such message-dependent deadlocks. We employ these architectural techniques in conjunction with a distributed DE strategy called PTIDES for an illustrative car <b>wash</b> <b>station</b> example and later follow it with a more realistic tunnelling ball device application...|$|E
40|$|Invasive {{species are}} {{second only to}} habitat loss as {{a leading cause of}} native species {{displacement}} and the management of invasive species costs hundreds of billions annually. Invasion is often conceptualized as a series of stages (Transport, Introduction, Establishment, and Spread), which encourages ecologists to isolate factors that might enable a species to pass from one stage to another and therefore guide prevention or impact management. This thesis addresses each stage of invasion and attempts to determine where management might succeed in preventing invasion or minimizing impacts. The transport and introduction of aquatic invasive species (AIS) was analyzed by conducting a three tier human subjects survey at Tenmile Lake, Oregon over a two year period in which a public boat <b>wash</b> <b>station</b> was built and installed. Assessing boater knowledge of AIS and understanding proper boat cleaning procedure is useful in determining the threat of transport and introduction as overland boater movements is a major vector of AIS. The comparison between pre- and post- boat wash surveys indicate that there is a disconnect between what boaters say they will do and how they actually behave. While 75. 9...|$|E
40|$|Relic diatoms in sediments of {{the inner}} Las Vegas Bay, near the Las Vegas Wash sewage inflow, were {{examined}} {{in order to assess}} historic trophic conditions in this area of Lake Mead. Diatom sedimentation rates and ratios of Araphidineae/Centrales (A/C) diatom groups were determined from sediment cores collected in the old wash channel 1. 5 km from the sewage inflow (station 2), in a small cove 1. 5 km further downstream (station 3) and in an adjacent embayment off Gypsum <b>Wash</b> (<b>station</b> 4). Diatom sedimentation rates generally increased from the bottom to the top of each core, but pronounced minima existed at various sediment intervals. Siltation from floods that occurred during 1975 appeared to cause these minima and may also have masked true rates of diatom sedimentation and A/C ratios at stations 2 and 4 which were located in areas most affected by flooding. A/C ratios in sediments at station 3 revealed that the inner bay has been primarily mesotrophiceutrophic since 1971, but a sharp decrease in annual diatom sedimentation rates after 1975 indicates there has been a decline in diatom production. This could, in part, account for the recent decrease in chlorophyll-a concentrations observed in past monitoring {{of the inner}} bay...|$|E
