25|$|A {{number of}} {{incidents}} occurred during 1894. On July 29, while returning from Rockaway with about 4,700 passengers, General Slocum struck a sandbar with enough force that her electrical generator <b>went</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> next month, General Slocum ran aground off Coney Island during a storm.

25|$|On 12 January 1815 General Wellesley {{grounded}} on the South Breakers, apparently {{while being}} chased by a larger ship. During the night the prize master and some 12 men landed from the ship. They reported that some 60 men remained aboard, principally lascars and sepoys. Next morning when boats <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> rescuers found that the wreck was mostly under water. They were able to retrieve two white seamen and five lascars. Some 50 men, however had died, including the boatswain and another white man.|$|E
25|$|Captain Thomas Wakefield {{received}} a letter of marque on 9 November 1798. On 4 December he sailed from the Downs, bound for Bombay and China. Only five days later, on 9 December, Henry Addison struck the Bembridge Ledge on the Isle of Wight, during a heavy fog. When the tide <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> next day she bilged. Five crew member drowned while trying to reach shore on a raft. Also, a block falling from the mizzen mast hit a boy on the head, killing him.

25|$|Around 01:30 on October 25, a Nationalist patrol accidentally set {{off one of}} {{the land}} mines. The blast alerted other units all along the {{northern}} shore and the PLA's quiet approach to Kinmen was compromised. Immediately, flares were fired into the air by ROC troops, which brightly illuminated the PLA's fleet and gave the Nationalists clear shots at the former. Later, at about 02:00 when the tide had begun to recede, PLA troops from regiments 244, 251, and 253 landed {{on the north side of}} Greater Kinmen Island at Guningtou (古寧頭), Huwei (湖尾) and Longkou (壟口). Regiment 244 was the first ashore landing near Lungkou where Nationalist defenders raked them with machine-gun fire, artillery, and mortars. They suffered heavy casualties. Regiments 251 and 253 fared better, landing near Guningtou and Huwei respectively where they broke through ROC defenses and continued to head inland. Arriving at high tide, many of the PLA landing vessels became caught on submerged anti-amphibious landing beach obstacles and immobilized. When the tide <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> PLA landing vessels became beached and were unable to return to the mainland to transport the second wave of reinforcements. Although these Communists were initially supported by artillery fire from the mainland, it had to cease firing once the infantry disembarked. Some of the troops, stranded in their vulnerable landing craft still far from shore, had to swim or wade some 650 yards (594.4 meters) in order to reach the shore, rendering them also sitting ducks for the defenders. The beached PLA vessels were destroyed shortly afterwards by gunfire from two ROC Navy vessels patrolling off the northwest coast of Guningtou, as well as by ROC troops who burned the mostly wooden boats using flamethrowers, grenades, gasoline and oil.|$|E

500|$|Titanic was {{subjected}} to extreme opposing forces– the flooded bow pulling her down while {{the air in the}} stern kept her to the surface– which were concentrated at one of the weakest points in the structure, the area of the engine room hatch. Shortly after the lights <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> ship split apart. The submerged bow may have remained attached to the stern by the keel for a short time, pulling the stern to a high angle before separating and leaving the stern to float for a few minutes longer. The forward part of the stern would have flooded very rapidly, causing it to tilt and then settle briefly until sinking. The ship disappeared from view at 02:20, 2 hours and 40 minutes after striking the iceberg. Thayer reported that it rotated on the surface, [...] "gradually [...] her deck away from us, as though to hide from our sight the awful spectacle... Then, with the deadened noise of the bursting of her last few gallant bulkheads, she slid quietly away from us into the sea." ...|$|E

It was headed toward the school, which panicked me, because all three of my kids were there. Then you heard the explosion and felt the blast and saw the fire and smoke." [...] Another witness, Eric Peterson, looked up when he heard the plane, [...] "It was low enough, I thought you could probably count the rivets. You could see more of the roof of the plane than you could the belly. It was on its side. There was a great explosion and you could see the flames. It was a massive, massive explosion. Flames and then smoke and then a massive, massive mushroom cloud." [...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane. She saw it briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion. Ten years after 9/11, a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave Berkebile (deceased by 2011) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube.|$|E

2500|$|The {{spectacle}} of a landed gentleman living in semi-feudal splendor among his 3,000 tenants was an anachronism to a postwar generation {{that had become}} acclimated to Jacksonian democracy. Stephen III's leniency toward his tenants had created a serious problem for his heirs. His will directed them to collect and apply the back rents (approximately $400,000) toward the payment of the patroon's debts. As soon as the rent notices <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> farmers organized committees and held public meetings in protest. Stephen IV, who had inherited the [...] "West Manor" [...] (Albany County), refused {{to meet with a}} committee of anti-renters and turned down their written request for a reduction of rents.
