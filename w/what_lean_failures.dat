First, let’s figure out <b>what</b> <b>Lean</b> is. Lean is a set of ideas, concepts, tools, and principles that were developed over a number of years, mostly by Toyota Motor Corp. as the Toyota Production System (TPS). The company developed this system as a means to be competitive in a difficult marketplace against large competitors with greater resources. The values that underpin Lean include: respect for people, continuous improvement, minimizing waste, just-in-time (JIT) production, custom and small-lot production, problem solving, teamwork, focusing on customer value, and employee development. With that background, you may ask <b>what</b> value <b>Lean</b> has for printers. Nearly all Lean principles focus on ways to better run a business and particularly ways to better run a manufacturing business in a competitive landscape. So Lean has numerous applications for printers. Lean is simple in concept but complex to implement and sustain. It took Toyota several decades to refine their ideas...|$|R

Lean is a {{management}} philosophy focused on identifying and eliminating waste throughout a product’s entire value stream, extending not only within the organization but also along the company’s supply chain network. Lean promises significant benefits in terms of waste reduction, and increased organizational and supply chain communication and integration. Implementing lean, however, and achieving the levels of organizational commitment, employee autonomy, and information transparency needed to ensure its success is a daunting task.

50|$|Modern spark-ignited {{combustion}} engines use oxygen sensors and catalytic converters {{in order to}} reduce exhaust emissions. Information on oxygen concentration is sent to the engine management computer or engine control unit (ECU), which adjusts the amount of fuel injected into the engine to compensate for excess air or excess fuel. The ECU attempts to maintain, on average, a certain air-fuel ratio by interpreting the information it gains from the oxygen sensor. The primary goal is a compromise between power, fuel economy, and emissions, and in most cases is achieved by an air-fuel ratio close to stoichiometric. For spark-ignition engines (such as those that burn gasoline or LPG, as opposed to diesel), the three types of emissions modern systems are concerned with are: hydrocarbons (which are released when the fuel is not burnt completely, such as when misfiring or running rich), carbon monoxide (which is the result of running slightly rich) and NOx (which dominate when the mixture is <b>lean).</b> <b>Failure</b> of these sensors, either through normal aging, the use of leaded fuels, or fuel contaminated with silicones or silicates, for example, can lead to damage of an automobile's catalytic converter and expensive repairs.|$|R

However, regardless of the popularity, it has been criticized in academia for its inconsistency. Researchers have questioned the validity for Lean as a concept.

Lean production has during the last decades had a great impact within the manufacturing industry, creating a whole new competitive advantage if mastered. Since Lean is derived from the Toyota production system (TPS), there are some implications when implementing Lean in the western world due to the cultural differences. Over the past decade Lean has due to success factor in manufacturing made its way into the service industry, hospitals, governmental agencies among many others, this puts even greater demands on the company implementing Lean. Service processes are not as visible processes and are there are more complex steps in producing a service. The end product is often delivered in a face–to–face interaction between customer and employee, there are certain limitations to how far one can be Lean without being mean in a service context. This thesis exclusively concerns the financial service sector in Sweden, financial services has a culture of individualism which contradicts <b>what</b> <b>Lean</b> advocates. In this sense Nordea is an interesting case due to their positive results since the introduction of Lean. The purpose has been to examine how Nordea in Halland has adapted their organization to the Lean philosophy. Have there been any problem areas or difficulties? How has these problems been solved? More in detail how did Nordea introduce the Lean philosophy, how was the changes implemented, how does Nordea work with <b>Lean</b> today and <b>what</b> results does the employees feels that Nordea has achieved through to their work with Lean. A case study as chosen as the research method for this thesis, the case is based on Nordea’s offices in Halland. The result of this thesis will describe <b>what</b> <b>Lean</b> is at Nordea, how it was introduced, implemented, the level on knowledge, motivation and satisfaction with Lean. To examine these aspects the researchers conducted a questionnaire that was handed out to employees at Nordea and several semi-structured interviews with managers, these responses created the empirical foundation for the research. Throughout the survey the researchers could determine that managers and employees do not perceive Lean in Nordea in the same way. One strong factor throughout the interviews was that Lean in most aspects revolves around a Lean board present at every department of the offices. There are no continuous educations or training within Lean at Nordea today, initially during the introduction there were consultants educating each office.

Findings: Based on the methods that is used has different factors to reduce waste been acquired. Better communication, awareness among employees, management commitment and keep the work to the time schedules is important factors for improvement.

There is however a widespread confusion of <b>what</b> <b>lean</b> really is and the absence of a clear definition has been highlighted by many researchers within the field. Since the birth of lean, a lot of focus has been on the internal perspective of the concept. Although today with an increased globalization, higher customer demands and a severe competition, the work with lean between companies becomes highly appropriate. Within companies, the processes often work effectively, but it is in the interfaces between companies where a lot of waste and possibilities to improvement exist. Aim: The purpose is to analyse the companies’ consciousness of <b>lean</b> and to <b>what</b> extent their understanding of lean can influence the effectiveness of the entire value stream. Furthermore, the purpose is to analyse how this consciousness affects the collaboration between a customer and a supplier. Method: The study has a deductive approach where the starting point has been in the theories within lean, supplier partnership and effectiveness. A multiple case study has been conducted where five different interfaces have been studied. The study has a qualitative approach where the empirical findings come from ten semi-structured interviews. Result: Our study shows that working with lean interorganisationally helps to create a higher performing value chain. For companies working with lean internally, it is also natural working with lean with the partners. From a lean perspective, effectiveness is defined as a reduction of cost through elimination of waste. By performing VSM, having regular evaluating meetings, sharing forecasts and giving each other insight in inventories, a lot of waste in the interfaces can be reduced. However, to have a well working collaboration, the study shows that a high level of trust and a common view and attitude towards collaboration are necessary...|$|R
