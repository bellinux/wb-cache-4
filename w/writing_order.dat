5000|$|According to Snyder, ‘clearly {{everyone}} in pre-Restoration England {{who had received}} a literary education read the Weekes and almost all ... admired it.’ [...] Du Bartas was John Milton's ‘earliest English literary model’, and traces of direct influence are arguably most apparent in Poems 1645. Nonetheless the Semaines were a major precursor for Paradise Lost , and can productively be compared with it. Du Bartas was also an early influence on Anne Bradstreet; one of her earliest dated works is her elegy ‘In Honour of Du Bartas. 1641’. The prefatory materials to The Tenth Muse (1650) make numerous references to Bradstreet's enthusiasm for Du Bartas, including Nathaniel Ward's condescending remark that Bradstreet is a 'right Du Bartas girle'. Though Bradstreet's poetry owes much to Du Bartas' methods, her work is not derivative, and she denied that her poetry imitates Du Bartas in her dedicatory poem to her father Thomas Dudley: 'I honour him, but dare not wear his wealth’ (ll. 38-9).

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that an on-line recognition system is always reliable than an off-line one. It {{is due to the}} availability of the dynamic information, especially the writing sequence of the strokes. This paper presents a new statistical method to reconstruct the <b>writing</b> <b>order</b> of a handwritten script from a two-dimensional static image. The reconstruction process consists of two phases, named the training phase and the testing phase. In the training phase, the <b>writing</b> <b>order</b> with other attributes, such as length and direction, are extracted from a set of training on-line handwritten scripts statistically to form a universal writing model (UWM). In the testing phase, UWM is applied to reconstruct the drawing order of offline handwritten scripts by finding the highest total probability. 300 off-line signatures with ground truth are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the reconstructed writing sequence using UWM is close to the actual writing sequence. 1...|$|E
40|$|Restoration of <b>writing</b> <b>order</b> from a single-stroked {{handwriting}} image {{can be seen}} as {{the problem}} of finding the smoothest path in its graph representation. In this paper, a 3 -phase approach to restore a <b>writing</b> <b>order</b> is proposed within the framework of the Edge Continuity Relation (ECR). In the initial, local phase, in order to obtain possible ECRs at an even-degree node, a neural network is used for the node of degree 4, and a theoretical approach is presented for the node of degree higher than 4 by introducing certain reasonable assumptions. In the second phase, we identify double-traced lines by employing maximum weighted matching. This makes it possible to transform the problem of obtaining possible ECRs at odd-degree node to that at even-degree node. In the final, global phase, we find all the candidates of single-stroked paths by depth first search and select the best one by evaluating SLALOM smoothness. Experiments on static images converted from online data in the Unipen database show that our method achieves a restoration rate of 96. 0 %...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{desire to}} speed up {{secondary}} storage systems has {{lead to the development}} of redundant arrays of independent disks (RAID) which incorpo-rate redundancy utilizing erasure codes. A ‘cluttered ordering ’ is utilized for designing an effective <b>writing</b> <b>order</b> to a RAID system. Cohen, Colboum and Froncek (2001) gave a cyclic construction of cluttered orderings for the com-plete graph by utilizing the notion of a ‘wrapped p-labeling. ’ M"uller, Adachi and Jimbo (2005) adapted the concept of wrapped Δ-labelings to the bipar-tite case instead of wrapped p. labelings. In this paper, we investigate more generalized cases of wrapped Δ-labelings leading to cluttered orderings for the corresponding bipartite graphs...|$|E

In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to solve the recovery problem within the framework of Edge Contiguous Relation (ECR). Firstly, we make local analyses to obtain the possible ECRs at each of the nodes; secondly a global trace is executed to find all of the candidate Euler paths and the smoothest one is selected as a final result. The two main contributions are: 1) Based on two simple assumptions, we prove a series of theorems to obtain possible ECRs at even node. 2) We introduce a method to identify double-traced lines by using weighted matching of general graph. Experiments on the scanned images and offline images converted from the online data of Unipen database have shown that our method achieved 95. 2 % correct recovery rate...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} study examining {{the processing of}} Hindi, which is written in Devanagari. Unlike other writing systems that are readily classifiable as alphabetic or syllabic in their structure, the Indic Devanagari script (of which Hindi is an example) has properties of both syllabic and alphabetic writing systems. Whereas Devanagari consonants are written in a linear left-to-right order, vowel signs are positioned nonlinearly above, below, or {{to either side of}} the consonants. This fact results in certain words in Hindi for which, in a given syllable, the vowel precedes the consonant in writing but follows it in speech. The current research exploited this property of the script to examine when the disparity between spatial and temporal sequencing would incur a processing cost and the implications of the findings from naming speed, accuracy, and <b>writing</b> <b>order</b> for the level at which words in Devanagari are segmented.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{powerful}} shape representation to recognize sketches drawn on a pen-based input device. The proposed method is robust to the sketching order {{by using the}} combination of distance map and direction histogram. A distance map created after normalizing a free-hand sketch represents a spatial feature of shape regardless of the <b>writing</b> <b>order.</b> Moreover, a distance map which acts a spatial feature is more ro-bust to shape variation than chamfer distance. Direction histogram is also able to extract a directional feature unrelated to the drawing order by using the alignment of the spatial location between two neighboring points of the stroke. The combination of these two features represents rich information to recognize an input sketch. The experiment result demonstrates {{the superiority of the}} proposed method more than previ-ous works. It shows 96 % recognition performance for the experimental database, which consists of 28 freehand sketches and 10 on-line hand-written digits...|$|E
40|$|In {{high-voltage}} {{electron beam}} lithography, {{most of the}} beam energy is released as heat and accumulates in the local area of writing. Excessive heat causes changes in resist sensitivity, which in turn causes significant critical dimension (CD) variation. Previous methods for reducing CD distortion caused by resist heating include usage of lower beam currents, increased delays between electron flashes, and multi-pass writing. However, all these methods lower mask writing throughput. This leads to increased mask writing cost, which is increasingly becoming a major limiting factor to semiconductor industry productivity. In this paper, we propose a new method for minimizing CD distortion caused by resist heating. Our method performs simultaneous optimization of beam current density and subfield <b>writing</b> <b>order.</b> Simulation experiments show that, compared to previous methods, the new subfield scheduling method leads to significant reductions in resist temperature with unchanged mask writing throughput. Alternatively, subfield scheduling can be coupled {{with the use of}} higher beam current densities, leading to increased writing throughput without increasing CD distortion. 1...|$|E

Optical examination, lifting technique, ESDA technique, and electron microscopy are the most widely used methods for the {{determination of}} the <b>writing</b> <b>order</b> of crossing texts. However, at present many examinations of intersecting lines result in an inconclusive opinion, particularly if the same type and colour of ink is involved. This paper presents the potentiality of the 3 D laser profilometry, which has been to determine the chronological sequence of homogenous ‘‘crossing lines’’. The laser profilometry, illustrated in this paper, has been developed on a conoscopic holography based system. It is a non-contact three-dimensional measuring system that allows producing holograms, even with incoherent light, with fringe periods that can be measured precisely to determine the exact distance to the point measured. This technique is suitable to obtain a 3 D micro-topography with high resolution also on surfaces with unevenness reflectivity (usual for the paper surface). The proposed technique is able to obtained 3 D profile in non-invading way. Therefore, the original draft are not physically or chemically modified, allowing a multi-analysis in different times. The experiments performed with line crossings database show that the proposed method is able of ‘‘positive identification’’ of writing sequence in the majority of the tests. In absence of a positive identification, the result has been "inconclusive" (no false determination did occur in this work) ...|$|E
