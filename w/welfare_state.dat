5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's <b>welfare</b> <b>state,</b> which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish <b>welfare</b> <b>state,</b> stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the <b>welfare</b> <b>state,</b> by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of individual freedom in society was already {{one of the}} central points in the FPÖ (and VdU's) programme during the 1950s. The party did not regard its liberalism and its pan-German, nationalist positions as contradictory. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the party developed economically, supporting tax reduction, less state intervention and more privatisation. Starting in the late 2000s, the party has taken a more populist tack, combining this position with support for the <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> It criticised unemployment and alleged welfare-state abuse by immigrants which, it said, threatened the <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> and pensioners' benefits.|$|E

40|$|Has the {{financial}} crisis fundamentally weakened Europe’s <b>welfare</b> <b>states?</b> Luis Moreno assesses the development of <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> in Europe in the post-war period. He writes that three distinct ‘ages’ of welfare can be identified: a ‘Golden Age’ which ended in the mid- 1970 s, a ‘Silver Age’ which ran from the 1970 s until {{the financial}} crisis, and a ‘Bronze Age’ in the period after the crisis. He argues that in each ‘age’ the stability of <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> has been challenged and action is now required to ensure the <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> of the future continue to meet their obligations to citizens...|$|R
50|$|<b>Welfare</b> <b>states</b> have {{an effect}} on poverty reduction. Currently modern, {{expansive}} <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> that ensure economic opportunity, independence and security in a near universal manner are still the exclusive domain of the developed nations. commonly constituting at least 20% of GDP, with the largest Scandinavian <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> constituting over 40% of GDP. These modern <b>welfare</b> <b>states,</b> which largely arose in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, seeing their greatest expansion in the mid 20th century, and have proven themselves highly effective in reducing relative as well as absolute poverty in all analyzed high-income OECD countries.|$|R
5|$|The party also notably want {{to invest}} more of Norway's oil wealth in {{infrastructure}} (particularly roads, broadband capacity, hospitals, schools and nursing homes) and the <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> This position, that has used {{a sense of a}} welfare crisis to support demands to spend more of the oil fund now rather than later, is part of its electoral success.|$|E
5|$|The {{party had}} no strong {{economic}} preferences, and generally supported a mixed economy. While it supported privatisation and tax reductions for small and medium businesses, it also sometimes supported protectionism and defended the <b>welfare</b> <b>state,</b> especially if {{allocated to the}} native Flemish population.|$|E
5|$|The party's {{economic}} policies did not deviate substantially from the generally supported mixed {{economy of the}} Netherlands. Its other demands {{did not have a}} strong ideological coherency. Supporting a generous <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> for the Dutch people, it was otherwise sceptical of state interventionism in the economy; notably by high taxes which would hinder private initiative, or overspending on subsidies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This article uses {{hierarchical}} {{cluster analysis}} to empirically assess if the postcommunist <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> of Central and Eastern Europe {{can be classified}} according to any of Esping-Andersen’s well-known welfare types, or if they form a distinct group of their own. It shows that {{at the start of}} the twenty-first century, there are clear differences in the governmental programmes and the social situation between traditional Western <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> and post-communist <b>welfare</b> <b>states.</b> The article argues that the <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> in post-communist countries might be subdivided into three groups: (1) a group of former-USSR countries, including Russia and Belarus; (2) a group of rather successful Central and Eastern European countries including Poland and the Czech Republic, and (3) a group of developing <b>welfare</b> <b>states,</b> consisting of Romania, Moldova and Georgia...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{economic}} freedom index {{and the newly}} developed KOF-index of globalization, it is shown that the Scandinavian <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> have experienced faster, bigger and more consistent increases in these areas, compared to the smaller European and the so called liberal <b>welfare</b> <b>states.</b> The market economy and globalization hence do not pose threats to these <b>welfare</b> <b>states,</b> but are instead neglected factors in explaining their survival and good economic performance. Big government decreases {{the economic}} freedom index by definition, but the <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> compensate in other areas, such as legal structure and secure property rights.

5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Brown was an {{important}} figure in Blair's Labour government and {{played a key role}} in developing the party's philosophy. Brown served as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1992 to 1997 and was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer following Labour's election victory in 1997. He attempted to control public spending and sought to increase the funding for education and healthcare. His economic strategy was market-based, attempting to reform the <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> through a tax credit scheme for poorer working families, and he assigned the Bank of England to set interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{consistently}} {{called for}} a more equitable redistribution of wealth, so that poorer provinces such as Nova Scotia, could share fully in Canada's prosperity. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald deserves credit for the introduction, in 1957, of an equalization scheme designed to enable poorer provinces to provide comparable levels of services to their citizens. Macdonald's advocacy of provincial autonomy however, fell victim to the centralizing tendencies of a post-war <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> in which the federal government increasingly assumed greater control over national social programs.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolving}} {{nature of}} <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> often {{makes it difficult}} to categorize. Arguably, many <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> have components from some or all typologies, making them more akin to points on a continuum rather than rigid typologies, a fact Esping-Andersen acknowledges in his writings.|$|R

5|$|The Great Depression in Canada {{during the}} early 1930s saw an {{economic}} downturn, leading to hardship across the country. In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s. On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{a new age}} period {{cohort model}} to show that among cohorts born between 1935 and 1975, cohorts born around 1950 are {{significantly}} above the income trend in most countries. However, such inequalities between generations are much stronger in conservative, continental European <b>welfare</b> <b>states,</b> compared to social democratic and liberal <b>welfare</b> <b>states.</b> As we show, this is because conservative <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> expose some cohorts to high youth unemployment and make lifetime earnings dependent on a favorable entry into the labor market. We thus demonstrate that conservative <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> have put the burden of adjustment to the post- 1975 economic slowdown on birth cohorts that could not get stable jobs before 1975, while similar cohort inequalities are much weaker in liberal and social democratic <b>welfare</b> <b>states.</b> In these latter two welfare regimes, the burden of adjustment to the post- 1975 economic slowdown was not put {{on the shoulders of}} some cohorts relative to others. Our analysis is the first to show which welfare regimes are more conducive to such inequalities between cohorts and what mechanisms lead to these material cohort inequalities...|$|R

50|$|The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism {{is a book}} on {{political}} theory written by Danish sociologist Gøsta Esping-Andersen, published in 1990. The work is Esping-Andersen's most influential and highly cited work, outlining three main types of <b>welfare</b> <b>states,</b> in which modern developed capitalist nations cluster. The work occupies seminal status in the comparative analysis of the <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> of Western Europe and other advanced capitalist economies. The work called into question well-established {{ways of thinking about}} differences among <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> in advanced capitalist democracies. At the time of writing this book, Gøsta Esping-Andersen was Professor at the European University Institute, Florence.|$|R
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Heinz-Christian Strache, the FPÖ has focused on describing itself as a Heimat and social party.

5|$|Until the mid-1970s, the Conservative Party {{was mostly}} {{controlled}} by one-nation conservatives. The {{rise of the}} New Right in conservative politics led to a critique of one-nation conservatism which contended that Keynesian economics and welfarism had damaged the economy and society. The Winter of Discontent of 1978–79 was portrayed by the New Right as illustrative of the overextension of the state. Figures such as Margaret Thatcher believed that to reverse the national decline, {{it was necessary to}} revive old values of individualism and challenge the dependency culture created by the <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of his first marriage, Waugh {{converted}} to Catholicism in 1930.

That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> culture of the postwar world and the decline of his health, darkened his final years, but he continued to write. To the public, Waugh displayed a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered to be his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial Brideshead Revisited (1981).|$|E

The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} of the <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> was by 1957 accepted by both major parties. Diefenbaker promised to expand the national health insurance scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough {{to keep up with}} the cost of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the global economic crisis, the challenges facing <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> are unprecedented. While government leaders have been in broad agreement that the severity of the recession called for decisive actions to limit the costs of the crisis, national responses have differed significantly. This article seeks to explain these divergent patterns and answer the critical question: how has the crisis affected the politics of social spending across liberal <b>welfare</b> <b>states?</b> While political conflict over social spending may increase across all countries in the wake of an economic crises, partisanship is expected to have a stronger effect in liberal <b>welfare</b> <b>states,</b> due to weak automatic stabilizer effects and a reliance on discretionary spending. This research tests the effects of political parties on social spending across nine liberal <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> (Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea,Switzerland, the UK, and the USA) during the pre-crisis (1990 – 2007) and post-crisis (2008 – 2013) periods. It also provides in-depth analysis of the USA and the UK, two representative liberal <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> who adopted highly dissimilar post-crisis social spending. The findings demonstrate that while political parties were not correlated with social spending during the pre-crisis period, after the global economic crisis they were significant in influencing social spending levels. This indicates an important shift in political dynamics across liberal <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> over time that has not been fully accounted for by the existing literature...|$|R
