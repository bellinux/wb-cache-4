5|$|Haakon also {{attempted}} to strengthen his {{ties with the}} papacy by issuing a vow of crusade. In 1241 he however converted this into a vow of engaging in warfare against pagan peoples in the north {{in light of the}} Mongol invasion of Europe. When a group of Karelians ("Bjarmians") had been forced westwards by the Mongols, Haakon allowed them to stay in Malangen and had them Christianized—something that <b>would</b> <b>please</b> the papacy. Later, in 1248, Louis IX of France proposed (by Matthew Paris as messenger) to Haakon to join him for a crusade, with Haakon as commander of the fleet, but Haakon turned the offer down. While Haakon had been unsuccessful in gaining the recognition of Pope Gregory IX, he quickly gained the support from Pope Innocent IV who sought alliances in his struggle with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Haakon finally achieved royal recognition by Pope Innocent in 1246, and Cardinal William of Sabina was sent to Bergen and crowned Haakon in 1247.|$|E
5|$|In the Matsya Purana, Ila was disinherited after {{becoming}} a female or kimpurusha. Ila's father passed his inheritance directly to Pururavas, ignoring the three sons Ila-Sudyumma bore as a male. Pururavas ruled from Pratishtanapura (present-day Allahabad), where Ila stayed with him. The Ramayana says that having returned to manhood, Ila ruled Pratishtana while his son Shashabindu ruled over Bahlika. The Devi-Bhagavata Purana tells {{that as a}} man Sudyumma governed the kingdom and as a woman remained indoors. His subjects were disturbed by his sex changes and did not respect him as they once had. When Pururavas attained adulthood, Sudyumma left his kingdom to Pururavas {{and went to the}} forest for penance. The sage Narada told Sudyumma a nine-syllable mantra, Navakshara, which <b>would</b> <b>please</b> the Supreme Goddess. Pleased with his austerities, the Goddess emerged before Sudyumma, who was in his female form Ilā. Sudyumma praised the Goddess, who merged the king's soul with herself and thus, Ilā gained salvation.|$|E

When the family patriarch, Pancho Duque, is offered a lucrative but questionable deal by his bitter adversaries, the Samuels, he is faced with a difficult choice: Should he cash out of the sugar business and focus solely on rum, which <b>would</b> <b>please</b> his biological son, Frank Duque? Or should he protect the family legacy that he built {{from the ground up}} by refusing to sell? This would involve siding with his son-in-law, Alex Vega, who despises the Samuels and foresees multibillion-dollar profits from future ethanol contracts.|$|E

Kimberly Bennion in Deseret News cited it as an [...] "emotional roller coaster" [...] and <b>would</b> <b>please</b> both old and new fans. However, she thought the characters had flaws. The Hutchinson Leader Kay Johnson wrote that the plot was confusing and the first half was not engaging, but thought Riordan should be given credit for introducing Greek and Roman mythology to a new generation.

500|$|AllGame's Brett Alan Weiss {{believed}} that Metroid II <b>would</b> <b>please</b> {{fans of the}} original Metroid. Marcel Van Duyn of Nintendo Life writes that Metroid II [...] "expands on the original title quite nicely", and noted that the difficulty was improved over the original Metroid because of the inclusion of [...] "hot spots" [...] that restores health and missiles. On the other hand, Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com was particularly critical of Metroid II, finding the game painful to play and describing it as [...] "something of a dark spot on a brilliant series' reputation." [...] However, Parish found the game's premise [...] "ambitious", adding that it provided the series a vital crux, as Samus' actions in Metroid II set the plot for Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion. GameTrailers similarly commented that it told {{one of the most}} pivotal chapters in the series' overall plot.|$|E
500|$|Pokémon Channel has {{scores of}} 51% and 55% on the review {{aggregators}} GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively, both indicating a mixed or average reception.

Justin Leeper of Game Informer claimed that fans would enjoy it but [...] "everyone else will be turned off, pun intended". Author Tokyo Drifter of GamePro guessed that the game had been [...] "tailored for die-hard fans" [...] and <b>would</b> <b>please</b> no one else.

500|$|He later explained, [...] "In a nutshell, Brian wrote {{most of the}} music, and I {{composed}} most of {{the vocal}} melodies and lyrics, and then sang them." [...] If Byrne's vocal harmonies were radical enough, Eno would revise the instrumentation to accompany it, but Byrne avoided writing instrumentation and chose {{to adapt to the}} instrumentals as written. Using a style similar to the Talking Heads album SpeakinginTongues, Byrne scatted and murmured some lyrics before they were completed, due to Byrne's preference for the sonic quality of lyrics rather than their literal meaning and his method of writing lyrics using free association. In composing lyrics for the album, Byrne attempted to write keeping in mind what <b>would</b> <b>please</b> Eno as his collaborator. He also attempted to write harmonies for Eno, who decided against singing any lead vocals on the album. Eno does perform backing vocals throughout the album, which he credits on one track as [...] "inhumanpiano" ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "terrifically entertaining, an ambitious big-budget epic, directed with great visuals and sound" [...] and compared it favorably to other action films in its subtle use of CGI effects; he gave it three-and-a-half stars out of four. Ebert also praised the way the film [...] "focuses on story {{in the midst of}} violence", incorporating characters and drama with a skill that most blockbuster action films lack. Ebert later included it in his Best Films of 2011 list as an addendum to his top 20. Writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis chose 13 Assassins as her Critic's Pick and described it as [...] "A stirring, unexpectedly moving story of love and blood..." [...] V.A. Musetto of the New York Post opined that the film was a nod to Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954) and Ran (1985), having referred to its climax as [...] "a pulse-quickening masterpiece that <b>would</b> <b>please</b> the mighty Kurosawa".|$|E
500|$|Media {{response}} to Intimacy was generally favourable; aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 69% based on 27critical reviews. Steven Robertshaw of Alternative Press described the album as arguably Bloc Party's finest career moment {{and noted that}} it offers [...] "sweat and circuitry, savagery and submission, and a captivating energy that's severely lacking in many music scenes on the planet". Kyle Anderson of Rolling Stone claimed that by [...] "replacing Bloc Party's distant cool with vivid honesty, Okereke makes Intimacy a confident new peak for his band", while PopMatters' Ross Langager explained that the record [...] "might not actually be all that intimate, {{but it is a}} thing of rough, recycled beauty". Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times commented that the album's final mix showed that producers Epworth and Lee preserved the essence of Bloc Party's signature sound—"minor key rock thrumming with rhythmic intensity"—while taking the band in new musical directions. Dave Simpson of The Guardian concluded that it <b>would</b> <b>please</b> old and new fans alike by being [...] "brave, individual and heartfelt".|$|E

Nelson was impressed by the [...] "vibe" [...] of the song and felt it <b>would</b> <b>please</b> the [...] "danceheads." [...] Although Davis was initially under the impression that the recording deal would be called off later, Minogue became enthusiastic to record the song after hearing 20 seconds of the demo. The whole song, including Minogue's vocals, were recorded at Davis's home studio in Surrey. The music, excluding the guitar part, was programmed using Korg Triton workstation via a MIDI. Dennis later remarked: [...] "Even though Kylie wasn't the first artist to be offered the song, I don't believe it was meant to go to anyone other than Kylie, and I don't believe anyone else would have done the incredible job she did with it, with the video, looking super-hot!" ...|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 1, 1910. An article in the The Moving Picture World gave a positive review, but recognized that the tensions amongst the Union and Confederate states of the Civil War could pose a concern for viewers and stated that no offense {{will come from the}} showing of this patriotic picture. The reviewer said that it <b>would</b> <b>please</b> American audiences and foreign ones as well. This possibility of an audience taking offense over the content of the picture was a reasonable one because the film was within living memory. The movement and influence of members in the Grand Army of the Republic was strong and memberships still exceeded 200,000 persons in 1910. A review by The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "This is a sure enough 'classy' picture, full of human feeling and good acting. It is one of the kind that is giving the Thanhouser people the fine reputation they are gaining. ... The picture is strongly effective." [...] One advertisement billed the film as a patriotic masterpiece and would have musical accompaniment by the vaudeville musician Etta Hyland.|$|E
500|$|There {{has also}} been {{the fact that the}} {{composer}} did not follow sonata form strictly, relying instead on juxtaposing blocks of tonalities and thematic groups. Maes states this point has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality. Even with what Schonberg termed [...] "a professional reevaluaton" [...] of Tchaikovsky's work, the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely, while his intent of writing music that <b>would</b> <b>please</b> his audiences is also sometimes taken to task. In a 1992 article, New York Times critic Allan Kozinn writes, [...] "It is Tchaikovsky's flexibility, after all, that has given us a sense of his variability.... Tchaikovsky was capable of turning out music—entertaining and widely beloved though it is—that seems superficial, manipulative and trivial when regarded {{in the context of the}} whole literature. The First Piano Concerto is a case in point. It makes a joyful noise, it swims in pretty tunes and its dramatic rhetoric allows (or even requires) a soloist to make a grand, swashbuckling impression. But it is entirely hollow." ...|$|E
