25|$|In early aircraft, a {{tailskid}} made {{of metal}} or wood {{was used to}} support the tail on the ground. In most modern aircraft with conventional landing gear, a small articulated <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is attached to the}} rearmost part of the airframe in place of the skid. This wheel may be steered by the pilot through a connection to the rudder pedals, allowing the rudder and tailwheel to move together.|$|E
25|$|Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) {{will also}} perform {{spectroscopy}} {{over the same}} wavelength range. It was built by the European Space Agency at ESTEC in Noordwijk, Netherlands. The leading development team is composed of people from Airbus Defence and Space, Ottobrunn and Friedrichshafen, Germany, and the Goddard Space Flight Center; with Pierre Ferruit (École normale supérieure de Lyon) as NIRSpec project scientist. The NIRSpec design provides three observing modes: a low-resolution mode using a prism, an R~1000 multi-object mode and an R~2700 integral field unit or long-slit spectroscopy mode. Switching of the modes is done by operating a wavelength preselection mechanism called the Filter <b>Wheel</b> <b>Assembly,</b> and selecting a corresponding dispersive element (prism or grating) using the Grating <b>Wheel</b> <b>Assembly</b> mechanism. Both mechanisms {{are based on the}} successful ISOPHOT wheel mechanisms of the Infrared Space Observatory. The multi-object mode relies on a complex micro-shutter mechanism to allow for simultaneous observations of hundreds of individual objects anywhere in NIRSpec's field of view. The mechanisms and their optical elements were designed, integrated and tested by Carl Zeiss Optronics GmbH of Oberkochen, Germany, under contract from Astrium.|$|E
25|$|The Trabant 1100 (also {{known as}} the P1100) was a 601 with a better-performing 1.05-liter, 45HP VW Polo engine. With a more-modern look (including a {{floor-mounted}} gearshift), it was quieter and cleaner than its predecessor. The 1100 had front disc brakes, and its <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> was borrowed from Volkswagen. It was produced between from 1989 to 1991, in parallel with the two-stroke P601. Except for the engine and transmission, many parts from older P50s, P60s and 601s were compatible with the 1100.|$|E
40|$|A {{measurement}} system {{for measuring the}} departures from a straight line of discrete track sections of a track along a coal face in a mine employing a vehicle having a pair of spaced <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies</b> which align with the track is presented. A reference arm pivotally connects between the <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies,</b> and there is indicating means for measuring the angle of pivot between the arm {{and each of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The length of the device is less than the length of a track section, and thus when one of the <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies</b> is on one track section and one is on an adjoining track section, the sum of the indicated angles will be indicative of the angle between track sections. Thus, from the length of a track section and angle, the departure of each track section from the line may be calculated...|$|R

25|$|On June 18, 1998, Propair Flight 420, a Metro II {{flying from}} Dorval International Airport (now Montreal-Trudeau International Airport) to Peterborough Airport in Peterborough, Ontario, {{experienced}} a left wheel well fire when the overheated brake and <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> was retracted into the enclosed wheel well. The heat dissipated to the tire {{and the surrounding}} structures, eventually causing a fire. During the attempted emergency landing at Mirabel Airport, the landing gear was extended on short final and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards, the fuselage pivoted {{to the left and}} struck the ground. All 11 occupants were fatally injured.|$|E
25|$|An air bag is {{a safety}} feature {{designed}} to protect automobile passengers in a head-on collision. Most cars today have driver's side airbags and many have one {{on the passenger side}} as well. Located in the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> on the driver's side and in the dashboard on the passenger side, the air bag device responds within milliseconds of a crash. The original safety cushion was first created by John W. Hetrick in 1952. After a car accident that his family was involved in, Hetrick drew sketches of compressed air stored in a container. When a spring-loaded weight senses the car decelerating at a rapid enough rate, it opens a valve that allows the pressure in the container to fill a bag. With this knowledge, he developed his design until he was able to obtain a patent on the device on August 5, 1952. Later in 1967, Dr. Allen S. Breed invented and developed a key component for automotive use in 1967, the ball-in-tube inertial sensor for crash detection. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation to Chrysler.|$|E

500|$|As cars {{continued}} {{to drive through}} the accident scene, the No. 77 car driven by Wheldon and the No. 12 driven by Power left the racing surface. Wheldon was racing at [...] when he came upon the scene, frantically {{trying to avoid the}} collision. Although he was able to considerably slow it down, Wheldon's car went airborne about [...] after running into the back of Kimball's and went barrel-rolling into the catch fence cockpit-first, causing his head to hit one of the poles. The No. 77 landed back on the racing surface having been sliced apart by the fence and slid to a stop next to the S.A.F.E.R. barrier. Power, meanwhile, went airborne when he ran over the back of Lloyd's car and struck the S.A.F.E.R. barrier. The car landed sideways on the track and rolled over, which caused the front <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> to break; one of the front tires flew over Power's head and barely missed hitting him.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of the way}} Concorde's delta-wing {{generated}} lift, the undercarriage had to be unusually {{strong and}} tall {{to allow for the}} angle of attack at low speed. At rotation, Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation (199 knots indicated airspeed), this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage {{in a way that was}} initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign. Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels were added aft to prevent tailstrikes. The main undercarriage units swing towards each other to be stowed but due to their great height also need to contract in length telescopically before swinging to clear each other when stowed.

2500|$|In 1959, when 85ft flat cars {{capable of}} {{carrying}} two 40-foot highway trailers in trailer-on-flat-car (TOFC), or [...] "piggyback" [...] service were introduced, new automobiles began to be shipped by rail loaded on highway auto-carrier trailers. Eight to ten autos could be carried per flat car in this manner. By 1960 several U.S. railroads were handling new automobiles in this way, including the CB, C, CRIP, D, D, ERIE/EL, GN, KCS, L, MILW, MKT, MP/TP, NP, SL-SF, SP, SSW, WAB and UP. The New York Central, which used the Flexi-Van system of transporting only the highway trailer body without the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly,</b> developed a Flexi-Van automobile carrier rack.|$|E
2500|$|However, the Smithsonian has {{subsequently}} reversed this stance, {{deciding that}} the golden hue on its engine cowling will remain, {{as it is}} part of the aircraft's natural state after acquisition and during its years on display. The effort to preserve artifacts is not to alter them but to maintain them as much as possible in the state in which the Smithsonian acquired them. Also, when the aircraft was recently lowered to the floor of the museum's Milestone's gallery, the tires were removed and replaced with 'forklift' style tires. This was done to preserve the Spirit's original tires which, due to age and lessening of vulcanization, are unable to sustain the aircraft's weight without disintegration. Also, conservation was likely undertaken on the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> itself.) ...|$|E

50|$|Throughout the 1970s-1990s, Indycar constructors, for instance, had {{attempted}} {{to address the issue}} of impact dissipation through car design. Pieces of the car (<b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies,</b> wings, bodywork, etc.) were designed to breakaway after impact, absorbing kinetic energy. Crumple zones were also created. While it typically yielded positive results, it also had drawbacks. The debris field created new hazards for cars approaching the crash scene, and if cars hit pieces of the debris, it could be propelled into the spectator areas. In two high-profile incidents multiple spectators were fatally injured when sheared off <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies</b> were punted into the grandstands.|$|R
