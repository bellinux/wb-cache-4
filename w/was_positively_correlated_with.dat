25|$|In addition, {{males in}} {{competitive}} sports are often advised by their coaches {{not to be}} in intimate relationships based on the premises that they become more docile and less aggressive during an athletic event. The circumstances in which males and females experience aggression are also different. A study showed that social anxiety and stress <b>was</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> aggression in males, meaning as stress and social anxiety increases so does aggression. Furthermore, a male with higher social skills has a lower rate of aggressive behavior than a male with lower social skills. In females, higher rates of aggression were only correlated with higher rates of stress. Other than biological factors that contribute to aggression there are physical factors are well.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} of the long term {{population}} fluctuations of Tarebia granifera and findings seem to be contradictory. Studies in Cuba (Yong et al. (1987), Ferrer López et al. (1989), Fernández et al. (1992)) indicate that the snail lives {{for more than a}} year though maximum densities were recorded at different times of the year in different habitats. Using a catch per unit effort netting technique, Yong et al. (1987) and Ferrer López et al. (1989) found highest densities in summer when temperatures reached their maximum whereas Fernández et al. (1992) found highest densities in November (late autumn) when temperatures reached their minimum. Fernández et al.

25|$|A small 2004 {{study by}} Ellen Paek empirically {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which religiosity, operationalized as religious orientation and religious behavior, is related to the controversial idea of emotional intelligence (EI). The study examined {{the extent to which}} religious orientation and behavior were related to self-reported EI in 148 church attending adult Christians. Non-religious individuals were not part of the study. The study found that the individuals' self-reported religious orientation <b>was</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> their perceiving themselves to have greater EI. While the number of religious group activities was positively associated with perceived EI, number of years of church attendance was unrelated. Significant positive correlations were also found between level of religious commitment and perceived EI. Thus, the Christian volunteers were more likely to consider themselves emotionally intelligent if they spent more time in group activities and had more commitment to their beliefs.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{concentrations}} of vitamins in bovine milk samples can differ significantly {{as a result}} of a number of factors, including cow breed, season, country, vitamin concentrations in feed, and frequency of milkings. However, changes resulting from pasteurization are likely dependent on the time and temperature of pasteurization conditions. Meta-regression was used to assess the roles of time and temperature in between-study heterogeneity. The duration of pasteurization <b>was</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> folate concentrations, and a direct inverse relationship was found between pasteurization temperature and vitamin C concentrations. Multivariate analysis of time and temperature revealed a significant negative correlation between these variables and vitamin B2 concentrations. These results indicate a likely relationship between time, temperature, and vitamin concentrations in milk; however, further research is needed to tease apart these effects because they appear to differ by vitamin.|$|E

25|$|Within the Big Five {{model of}} personality, need for {{cognition}} {{has been found}} to relate positively to openness to experience most strongly and to a more moderate extent to conscientiousness, particularly the competence and achievement striving facets, and to relate inversely to an extent to neuroticism. Regarding Cloninger's temperament traits, need for cognition has been related negatively to harm avoidance and positively to persistence and was unrelated to reward dependence or novelty seeking. Need for cognition has only a weak positive relationship with sensation seeking, specifically a weak correlation with the boredom susceptibility subscale but no relationship to the other subscales. Need for cognition has a modest inverse correlation with negative affect. NFC had no significant correlation with a broad measure of overall positive affect, although it <b>was</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> feelings of activity, interest, and alertness. Need for cognition has been positively related to other, theoretically unrelated, personality characteristics such as self-esteem, masculine sex-role attitudes, and absorption. It is also negatively related to social anxiety (more strongly in females than males). It has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of mastery, and hence greater self-esteem, although {{it is also possible that}} higher self-esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking. Need for cognition may be related to masculine sex-role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality. Regarding absorption, people high in need for cognition may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks. Regarding social anxiety, it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation.|$|E

2500|$|Typical meadow vole litters {{consist of}} four to six young, with {{extremes}} of one and 11 young. On average, 2.6 young are successfully weaned per litter. [...] Litter size is not significantly correlated with latitude, elevation, or population density. [...] Fall, winter, and spring litters tend to be smaller than summer litters. Litter size <b>was</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> body size, and is not significantly different in primaparous and multiparous females. Primaparous females had fewer young per litter than multiparous females. Litter size was constant in summer breeding periods at different population densities. [...] Female meadow voles reach reproductive maturity earlier than males; some ovulate and become pregnant as early as three weeks old. [...] Males are usually {{six to eight weeks}} old before mature sperm are produced. One captive female produced 17 litters in one year for a total of 83 young. [...] One of her young produced 13 litters (totalling 78 young) before she was a year old.|$|E
