5|$|Author Alexander C. Irvine {{adapted the}} script into a novel, also titled Iron Man 2, that was {{released}} in April 2010. Prior to the film release, Marvel Comics released a four issue miniseries comic book titled Iron Man vs <b>Whiplash,</b> which introduced the film's version of <b>Whiplash</b> into the Marvel Universe. A three issue prequel miniseries titled Iron Man 2: Public Identity {{was released in}} April.|$|E
5|$|On March 21 he {{suffered}} a concussion and <b>whiplash</b> after his Hummer {{was involved in a}} head-on collision with a vehicle driven by an inebriated United States Army Sergeant in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He quickly recovered from his injuries, but was released by WWE on July 5.|$|E
5|$|Born in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, Rankine {{started his}} career in the youth system of {{hometown}} club Doncaster Rovers. He played for Armthorpe Welfare on work experience in 2002 and was released by Doncaster {{at the end of the}} 2002–03 season after failing to progress into their first team. He signed for Northern Premier League Premier Division club Barrow in the summer of 2003. He was unable to play for them in the opening match of 2003–04 after suffering <b>whiplash</b> following a car crash. He made 47 appearances and scored nine goals in 2003–04.|$|E

5|$|In the event, Murray played, winning {{his first}} singles. However {{he lost the}} doubles with Jamie Delgado, during which Murray damaged his {{shoulder}} and neck. He was diagnosed with <b>whiplash,</b> causing him to sit out the final day's singles, and eventually Great Britain were beaten 3–2 to proceed to the relegation 2nd round play-off against Ukraine. With Murray and Greg Rusedski playing, Great Britain beat Ukraine 3–2, to stay in Group I.|$|E
5|$|<b>Whiplash</b> is a 2014 American drama film {{directed}} by Damien Chazelle. The screenplay, also written by Chazelle, was partly {{based on his}} experiences in the Princeton High School Studio Band. The film stars Miles Teller as an ambitious jazz drummer selected to join a school studio band taught by a cruel music instructor played by J. K. Simmons. Paul Reiser, Melissa Benoist, and Austin Stowell feature in supporting roles.|$|E
5|$|BMNH R.3078 {{was found}} at Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, in strata of the Upper Oxford Clay and {{consists}} {{of a series of}} vertebrae from the rear half of the skeleton. Other remains, including a front leg with fossilized cartilage in its joint, a hind leg, and a partial sacrum have been referred to and accepted as C. stewarti. A <b>whiplash</b> tail from the same locality was thought by Charig as possibly belonging to Cetiosauriscus, but the assignment is not fully accepted by paleontologists. With that much material, Cetiosauriscus {{is one of the most}} complete sauropods from the United Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|She {{became a}} stuntwoman, getting her first job in Xena: Warrior Princess, {{and said in}} an {{interview}} [...] "I <b>whiplashed</b> my spine falling out of a tree, but it was brilliant fun jumping through explosions and coming out of the sea in leather loincloths".|$|R
5000|$|The song {{features}} a drum {{break from the}} song [...] "Johnny the Fox Meets Jimmy the Weed" [...] of the group Thin Lizzy. The <b>whiplashing</b> sword sound effect is {{a sample of the}} song [...] "Da Mystery of Chessboxin", by Wu-Tang Clan. As in Firestarter, Jim Davies played the guitar in the song.|$|R
50|$|The album's cover artwork was {{designed}} and painted by Sean Taggart, a local New York artist who had provided gig flyers for NYHC bands, {{as well as providing}} album covers such as Agnostic Front's Cause for Alarm, Carnivore's Carnivore and Retaliation, Prong's Primitive Origins and <b>Whiplash's</b> Power and Pain. He later went on to provide album covers (and eventually, defining cartoon characters) for the Jerky Boys.|$|R
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is less effective than CT at directly imaging sites of CSF leak. MRI studies may show pachymeningeal enhancement (when the dura mater looks thick and inflamed), sagging of the brain, pituitary enlargement, subdural hygromas, engorgement of cerebral venous sinuses, and other abnormalities. For 20% of patients, MRIs present as completely normal. There is disagreement over whether MRI {{should be the}} study of choice. MRIs performed with the patient seated upright (vs. laying supine) are not better for diagnosing CSF leaks, but are {{more than twice as}} effective at diagnosing cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, also known as Chiari malformation. Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia shares many of the same symptoms as CSF leak, but originates either congenitally or from trauma, including <b>whiplash</b> strain to the dura.|$|E
5|$|Reimer {{began the}} 2011–12 {{season as the}} starter going 4–0–1. He {{suffered}} an injury on October 22 {{in a game against}} the Montreal Canadiens. During the game Reimer was run into by Brian Gionta, he finished the first period, but did not return after the intermission. The team called the injury <b>whiplash</b> despite rumors that he was suffering from a concussion. Reimer missed 19 games with the injury, and struggled upon his return, yielding some starts to Gustavsson. After recording two back-to-back shutouts on February 1 and February 4, Reimer seemed to have solidified the starting position once again.|$|E
5|$|Huene {{felt the}} {{vertebrae}} of BMNH R3078 had proportions different enough from Cetiosaurus to warrant its own genus. Also, {{the fusion of}} centra with minimal osseous proliferation is manifest in the caudal vertebrae of Cetiosauriscus. The Cetiosaurus specimen OUMNH J13695 has a low horizontal ridge on each of its lateral surfaces, creating a slightly subhexagonal transverse cross-section, and is also seen on Cetiosauriscus, {{as well as the}} anterior caudals of Haplocanthosaurus, and caudals 15 to 30 of Omeisaurus. Also, the area around the periphery of each articular face is flattened, creating a 'bevelled' appearance, and also occurs in Cetiosaurus and Haplocanthosaurus. A <b>whiplash</b> tail was apparently found in the same deposits but it is not certain it belongs to the same individual. Since there is no overlapping material, this assignment to Cetiosauriscus should be treated with caution.|$|E
50|$|At this victory, Starlight Plaza {{becomes a}} major {{attraction}} {{with all the}} businesses becoming spectacular successes including extremely elaborate snail races with <b>Whiplash's</b> crew getting special propulsion aids for their shells, while Chet is content with his new job as the track referee and paramedic. As for Turbo, he becomes happier discovering that his shell has healed, and with that, his superspeed has returned.|$|R
5000|$|Safety Aaron Rouse was penalized twice against Duke for {{roughing}} the passer. His second hit on Duke quarterback Thaddeus Lewis was a helmet-to-sternum {{hit that}} <b>whiplashed</b> {{his head with}} such force that it gave him a concussion. Duke's backup quarterback said of Tech, [...] "They are a fast team. I'm lucky to come out in one piece. ... The roughing of the passer, the late hits, they were coming for us." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} weather events have <b>whiplashed</b> between the {{extremes}} of heat and cold, flooding and drought. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases [...] largely from the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas [...] have loaded up in the atmosphere, heating the planet and pushing humanity onto a climatic seesaw of weather irregularities. High-temperature records in many places are already being broken with startling frequency, and hotter temperatures are in store...|$|R
5|$|In general, {{crocodilians}} are stalk-and-ambush predators, though hunting strategies {{vary depending}} on the individual species and the prey being hunted. Terrestrial prey is stalked from the water's edge and then grabbed and drowned. Gharials and other fish-eating species sweep their jaws sideways to snap up prey, and these animals can leap out of the water to catch birds, bats, and leaping fish. Small animals can be killed by <b>whiplash</b> as the predator shakes its head. Caimans use their tails and bodies to herd fish into shallow water. They may also dig for bottom-dwelling invertebrates, and the smooth-fronted caiman will even hunt on land. Some crocodilian species have been observed to use sticks and branches to lure nest-building birds. Nile crocodiles are known to hunt cooperatively, and several individuals may feed on the same carcass. Most species will eat anything suitable that comes within reach and are also opportunistic scavengers.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision <b>whiplash</b> protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E
5|$|With NHL play set {{to resume}} in 2005–06, Cloutier re-signed with the Canucks to a two-year, $5 million {{contract}} on August 18, 2005. Returning to the Canucks, {{he was injured}} {{early in the season}} during a game against the Avalanche on October 29, 2005. Attempting to check Avalanche forward Andrew Brunette, Canucks defenceman Nolan Baumgartner collided with Cloutier, causing a goal and forcing Cloutier out of the game with both a concussion and <b>whiplash.</b> The injury caused him to miss five games. Soon after returning, Cloutier was re-injured in a game against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on November 20, when forward Rob Niedermayer skated into the crease and collided with Cloutier. He stayed in net to complete the game, a 3–2 win, and was on the bench the following game to backup Auld. However, after aggravating the knee in a practice on November 23, an MRI revealed a partially torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Electing for reconstructive knee surgery, occurring on December 15, Cloutier missed the remainder of the season.|$|E
50|$|The attraction's queue area passes through: Snidely <b>Whiplash's</b> hideout; {{a theater}} that spoofs movies such as Jaws, The Silence of the Lambs, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Three Men and a Baby and Star Wars; and {{a room with}} a talking bear head and a talking beaver head on a wall. While passing through the theater room of the queue, guests watch as Nell Fenwick is kidnapped from her {{dressing}} room, setting up the ride's main story.|$|R
5000|$|Lai {{worked for}} fifteen years on an adult novel. In her own words it was [...] "third-person omniscient, {{spanning}} 4000 years of Vietnamese history, and <b>whiplashed</b> by hundreds of overly dramatic, showy sentences." [...] The transformation worked when she got [...] "inside {{the mind of a}} 10-year-old girl who feels as much as any adult but can’t express the emotions yet, it seemed right to employ a few precise, pregnant words and have them explode into real, raw emotions." ...|$|R
5000|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave Probot a B− rating. He notes, [...] "For a lark, it {{aims for}} (and hits) a few bull's-eyes, {{including}} the <b>whiplashing</b> 'The Emerald Law' and the post-apocalyptic death march 'Ice Cold Man'." [...] However, Browne comments how the mystery and thrill of vintage metal bands is [...] "largely gone" [...] with many lyrics on Probot sounding [...] "more amusing than menacing" [...] and even [...] "unintentionally funny." [...] He {{sums it up}} as [...] "lying somewhere between homage and howler." ...|$|R
5|$|Henri Christophe's {{widow and}} {{children}} are taken to Europe by English merchants, who used to supply the royal family. Solimán accompanies them and enjoys the summers in Rome, where he is treated well and tells embellished tales of his past. He encounters a statue of Pauline whose form brings back memories, and sends him into a howl, causing the room to be rushed. He is reminded of the night of Henri Christophe's demise and flees before succumbing to malaria. Ti Noel recalls things told by Macandal, and the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy has become a happy place, with Ti Noel presiding over celebrations and festivities. Surveyors disrupt the peace at the plantation, and mulattoes have risen to power; they force hundreds of black prisoners to work by <b>whiplash,</b> and many have lost hope as the cycle of slavery continues. Ti Noel, thinking of Macandal, decides to transform into various animals to observe the ongoing events; he metamorphoses into a bird, a stallion, a wasp, and then an ant. He eventually becomes a goose, but is rejected by the clan of geese. He understands that being a goose {{does not imply that}} all geese are equal, so he returns to human form. The book concludes with the end of Ti Noel's life, and his own self-reflection upon greatness and The Kingdom of This World.|$|E
25|$|The exact injury {{mechanism}} that causes <b>whiplash</b> injuries is unknown. A <b>whiplash</b> injury {{may be the}} result of impulsive retracting of the spine, mainly the ligament: anterior longitudinal ligament which is stretched or tears, as the head snaps forward and then back again causing a <b>whiplash</b> injury.|$|E
25|$|Alterations in resting state {{cerebral}} {{blood flow}} have been demonstrated in patients with chronic pain after <b>whiplash</b> injury. There is evidence for persistent inflammation in the neck in patients with chronic pain after <b>whiplash</b> injury.|$|E
50|$|During {{the time}} Xerxes and his huge army were marching from Sardes to Abydos, then an {{important}} harbour on the Hellespont, two bridges were built {{from there to}} the opposite side near Sestos over a distance of seven stadia (some 1,300 m), but were destroyed by a storm before the army arrived. Xerxes was enraged and had those responsible for building the bridges beheaded. He is then said to have thrown fetters into the strait, given it three hundred <b>whiplashes</b> and branded it with red-hot irons as the soldiers shouted at the water.|$|R
40|$|The global {{economic}} crisis of 2007 – 09 left Sub-Saharan countries relatively unscathed. There {{are a number}} of reasons for this, but one crucial factor has been the relative lack of integration of the economies of most Sub-Saharan countries with the world economy. This insulated much of the region from the severities of the asset ‘boom’ and ‘bust’ that <b>whiplashed</b> global financial markets in the developed world between 2007 and 2009. There are some positive, rather than neutral, aspects of Africa’s growth potential and the unfolding investment story. ...|$|R
5000|$|Critics of this {{television}} series have spanned a long spectrum of opinions. Some regard {{it to be}} a spectacular production with classic value while others have <b>whiplashed</b> the series for its [...] "unrealistic" [...] characters. The lasting selflessness of the hero Ivan, as well as the incidental innocence displayed by some usually clever characters, does justify such criticism. However, the story as a whole was written in the spirit of romanticism, and true artists {{have not been able to}} dismiss its complex but excellently written plot, considering its genre.|$|R

25|$|There {{has long}} been a {{proposed}} link between <b>whiplash</b> injuries and the development of temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD). A recent review concluded that although there are contradictions in the literature, overall there is moderate evidence that TMD can occasionally follow <b>whiplash</b> injury, and that the incidence of this occurrence is low to moderate.|$|E

6000|$|A stone's-cast {{from the}} beach there was a fantastic rock, moss-grown and deep in a dell. It was {{insulated}} by a shallow brook, which, dividing its waters, flowed on both sides until united below. Twisting its roots round the rock, a gnarled [...] "Aoa" [...] spread itself overhead in a wilderness of foliage; the elastic branch-roots depending from the larger boughs insinuating themselves into every cleft, thus forming supports to the parent stem. In some places these pendulous branches, half-grown, had not yet reached the rock; swinging their loose fibrous ends {{in the air like}} <b>whiplashes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Having {{divested}} {{himself of}} this encumbrance, Mr. Weller gave his body a sudden wrench to one side, {{and by a}} dexterous twist, contrived to get his right hand into a most capacious pocket, from whence, after {{a great deal of}} panting and exertion, he extricated a pocket-book of the large octavo size, fastened by a huge leathern strap. From this ledger he drew forth a couple of <b>whiplashes,</b> three or four buckles, a little sample-bag of corn, and, finally, a small roll of very dirty bank-notes, from which he selected the required amount, which he handed over to Sam.|$|R
50|$|Bonaparte Allen {{learned the}} trade of tanning from his father, Washington Allen. Bonaparte opened the Bona Allen Company {{at the age of}} 27 and {{operated}} it as a tannery and leather goods shop. It started off making <b>whiplashes,</b> then followed with the production of horse collars. In 1903, a fire swept through the building and destroyed the business and the entire building. Allen lost everything. But, thanks to his established business track record, a local bank loaned him the money he needed to re-establish and rebuild his business. It didn't take Bonaparte long to restore his thriving business and pay off all of his debt.|$|R
