On August 1, 2008, Say Anything announced the Max Bemis Song Shop, through which users could pay for Max Bemis to write a song based on a short writing by the customer. However, {{by the end of}} the night, the item was no longer available with the following text displayed on the item listing: [...] "We're sorry but Max can't write songs as fast as you are requesting them. As soon as he catches up <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>start</b> again. Thank you so much for believing in our crazy idea." [...] The Song Shop has reopened semi-annually since its initial launch, and taken down after about a week each time. This aforementioned message has been displayed each time the Song Shop was discontinued.|$|E
500|$|Following Chelsea's victory, player-manager Vialli was {{satisfied}} with his club's performance, commending the substitution of Zola by assistant manager Graham Rix: [...] "He decided he had a feeling and he was right". Vialli also praised Zola, but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself, {{who took part in}} the match: [...] "It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and we won the cup. But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon." [...] The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship: [...] "The next step will be the Premier League, fingers crossed. I am still the player-manager and I have to be one next season. We are very happy to win, but we do not want to stop here. We want to keep improving and next season <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>start</b> trying to win the Premier League, which is our aim now." ...|$|E

500|$|The local {{controlling}} council, Tendring District Council, {{are working}} with the residents of Brooklands on improving the area and trying to buy up land to build new housing. Council leader Mick Page stated [...] "The only way <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>start</b> anything in Jaywick is for us to lead it. We will be the catalyst." [...] The council are proposing to stop the allocation of housing benefit to rented properties in Jaywick by 2017, to discourage rental in poor quality buildings. Former council leader Neil Stock has called Jaywick [...] "an embarrassment to the whole country", blaming planning regulations he believes are draconian. Stock reported around 30 to 40 absentee landlords were renting poor quality accommodation to tenants on benefits without requiring any deposit, adding that [...] "the state is subsidising squalor." [...] Carswell has been critical of the government's response to Jaywick, noting that although the area contained large numbers of unemployed, these were often people who were unable to find work both due to disabilities or a lack of available jobs. He believes the [...] "downward spiral will continue" [...] unless existing planning laws are relaxed and the area has economic investment.|$|E

The following day insurgents kidnapped and murdered Fazal Ahad, an elder from the village of Badmuk who was attempting to end the Kom/Kata tribal disagreements by arranging a meeting in Kamdesh. In response to this, the local Afghan officials sent more government troops into the area to increase security. These troops were ambushed on the Naray/Kamdesh road and shot up badly enough to prevent their arrival in Kamdesh.|$|E
