5|$|This {{species is}} oviparous, meaning these turtles produce {{offspring}} by laying eggs only {{and do not}} provide parental care outside of nest-building. Thus, the location and quality of nesting sites determine the offspring survival and fitness, so females invest significant time and energy into nest site selection and construction. Females select nest sites based on soil temperature (preferring warmer temperature nest sites), but not soil composition. Average nest size is four inches wide and three inches deep. Also, females build nests in elevated areas {{in order to avoid}} flooding and predation. After laying eggs, female wood turtles <b>will</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> nest with leaves or dirt in order to hide the unhatched eggs from predators, and then the female leaves the nest location until the next mating season. Nesting sites can be used by the same female for multiple years. Because nest building occurs along rivers, females tend to spend more time along river areas, compared to male turtles.|$|E

25|$|Where a dam serves {{multiple}} purposes, a hydroelectric station may {{be added}} with relatively low construction cost, providing a useful revenue stream {{to offset the}} costs of dam operation. It has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the Three Gorges Dam <b>will</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation. Additionally, some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return, unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place.|$|E

25|$|In {{an early}} {{chapter of the}} Agricola, Tacitus asserts that he wishes {{to speak about the}} years of Domitian, Nerva, and Trajan.

500|$|Taibbi writes {{critically}} of {{the impact}} press coverage had on the 2016 election. He recounts {{the process by which}} Trump, previously known for his reality television appearances, learned how to strategically manipulate coverage of his campaign through boorish behavior. Taibbi describes a campaign placed with post-truth politics where facts are subsumed by reactions garnered from television audiences. The author recounts that such strategic campaigning was not beholden simply to Donald Trump, but extended to other candidates including Carly Fiorina. The author is critical of the nature by which press coverage of politics has moved to the extremes, writing, [...] "The model going forward will likely involve Republican media covering Democratic corruption and Democratic media covering Republican corruption." [...] He notes it is rare that press companies {{from one side of the}} political divide <b>will</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> same subject matter as the other.|$|E
