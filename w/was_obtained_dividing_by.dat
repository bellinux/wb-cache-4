50|$|The most {{straightforward}} way {{to quantify}} fairly uniform fouling is by stating the average deposit surface loading, i.e., kg of deposit per m² of surface area. The fouling rate {{will then be}} expressed in kg/m²s, and it <b>is</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> <b>dividing</b> the deposit surface loading by the effective operating time. The normalized fouling rate (also in kg/m²s) will additionally account for the concentration of the foulant in the process fluid (kg/kg) during preceding operations, and is useful for comparison of fouling rates between different systems. It <b>is</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> <b>dividing</b> the fouling rate by the foulant concentration. The fouling rate constant (m/s) can <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> <b>dividing</b> the normalized fouling rate by the mass density of the process fluid (kg/m³).|$|R

The case of milling operations is completely different, firstly because of the tool rotation, and secoundly because the cutting section continually varies. Therefore, the cutting pressure has to be measured indirectly, using {{a model of the}} cutting force variation with the cutting section. In this paper, two such models are presented, the first one assuming that the cutting pressure is independent of the cutting section, the second one using Kienzle's model...|$|R

Thus, noninvasive quantitation of rat CBF could enhance the repeatable CBF assessment without the physiological damage due to arterial cannulation and blood sampling.|$|R
