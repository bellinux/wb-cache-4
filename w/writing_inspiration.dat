This play is an allegory for racism and sexism against black women. This play was never performed in Bonner's lifetime.|$|E

5000|$|Inspiration {{came because}} the poet tuned {{himself to the}} (divine or mystical) [...] "winds" [...] {{and because he was}} made {{in such a way as}} to receive such visions. Samuel Taylor Coleridge's {{accounts}} of inspiration were the most dramatic, and his The Eolian Harp was only the best of the many poems Romantics would write comparing poetry to a passive reception and natural channelling of the divine winds. The story he told about the composition of Kubla Khan has the poet reduced to the level of scribe. William Butler Yeats would later experiment and value automatic <b>writing.</b> <b>Inspiration</b> was evidence of genius, and genius was a thing that the poet could take pride in, even though he could not claim to have created it himself.|$|E

50|$|The oral {{tradition}} {{has been part}} of the culture of the various indigenous groups in Sarawak for generations. It is used for passing on life lessons, traditions, and values to the younger generation. The stories are told repeatedly by the elders to the younger ones, such as in storytelling sessions on special occasions and through traditional performances. Some of these traditional practices are the Iban's Ngajat dances, Renong (Iban vocal repertory), Ensera (Iban oral narratives), and epic storytelling by the Kayan and Kenyah. The Borneo Literature Bureau existed from 1958 until 1977; it encouraged the documentation of local cultures, local authors, and publications in English, Chinese, Malay, Iban and other native languages. The Bureau was replaced by the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP) in 1977, which advocated publication only in the Malay language. Documentation of {{oral tradition}}s has also been done by the Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) and the Sarawak Customs Council. The Sarawak Gazette was first published by the Brooke government in 1870. It recorded a variety of news in Sarawak related to economics, agriculture, anthropology, and archaeology. The Gazette is still being published today. Hikayat Panglima Nikosa (Story of Nikosa the Warrior), printed in 1876 at Kuching, is one of the earliest text publications in Borneo. It is also the first novel from Malaysia. Indigenous traditions have become a source of <b>writing</b> <b>inspiration</b> for Sarawak Chinese authors.|$|E
5000|$|Mailer {{described}} {{that his}} <b>writing</b> <b>inspiration</b> {{came from the}} great Russian novelists like Tolstoy. While writing, Mailer often read “from Anna Karenina most mornings before he commenced his own work.” Mailer believed that Tolstoy enabled him to bring compassion to his pages. Tolstoy taught him that “compassion is valueless without severity.” Mailer was convinced that he brought this compassion to The Naked and the Dead, and it is what enabled a twenty-five-year-old to write an incredible war novel. Throughout his writing process, Mailer explained that he “used to write twenty-five pages of first draft a week,” which allowed his novel to flow from page to page. Mailer felt that this novel was the easiest for him to write, as he finished it quickly and passionately. Mailer later stated that “Part of me thought it was possibly the greatest book written since War and Peace.” Yet, even with the author’s own praises, he acknowledged his own writing immaturity within the novel. Mailer insisted that “it was sloppily written in many parts (the words came too quickly and too easily) and there was hardly a noun in any sentence that was not holding hands with the nearest and most commonly available adjective.” However, despite this criticism, Mailer believed that it deserved to be a best seller. It was written with vigor and contained acute descriptiveness which enabled readers to imagine what World War II was really like. Mailer admitted that he still returned to The Naked and the Dead occasionally and reread passages because they gave him hope “for all of us.” ...|$|E

He obtained a degree in interior design from the Faculty of Decorative Arts, Silpakorn University. After graduating, he kept working as a cartoonist in Thailand but, {{due to a lack}} of inspiration, he decided to go to Japan. He left Thailand in 2004 and headed to Japan where he studied Japanese language and lived in a new environment to find ideas and <b>writing</b> <b>inspiration.</b> Earning a place in the 2005 Yokohama Triennale, he caught the attention of Japanese manga publishers and signed contracts with Shinchosha and Shogakukan. Most of his works have been first published in Japan then translated in Thai for the Thai market. His manga Everybodyeverything, serialized in the Japanese Magazine 5 in 2005, was the first comic book of a Thai cartoonist published initially in Japan (in Magazine 5) and introduced the famous character Mamuang whose marchandise is substantial. He has also been named by Elle magazine Japan as one of the worlds’ 250 most interesting people to watch and was awarded the Encouragement Prize/New Face Award, Manga Division, at the 13th Japan Media Arts Festival in 2009 for his manga hesheit aqua (ヒーシーイット―アクア). His manga series Blanco (ブランコ) was published in the Japanese magazine Ikki Comics (Shogakukan) between 2007 and 2010.
