5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars were {{converted}} {{for use as}} ballast motor cars. The task was more complicated than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars. The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with compressors, and the couplings were changed from <b>Wedgelock</b> to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six were converted, two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 were converted in 1978, and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the ballast motor cars were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a ballast motor car {{at one end and}} a battery locomotive at the other. One advantage of the ballast motor cars over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing small tools, although they were less powerful, and could only work when the traction current was switched on.

"May 2013 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The University of Missouri, Columbia, has participated in the DARPA/ONR sponsored RevCon Challenge to demonstrate an innovative field reversible thermal connector to replace the current industry standard <b>wedgelock</b> for edge cooled electronics. Wedgelocks mechanically secure edge cooled electronics cards to a cooling block, but having a dry interface and little contact surface area leads to poor heat transfer from the card to the cooling block. Seeking marked improvement in thermal performance, a novel thermal connector has been developed utilizing a magnetorheological (MR) fluid. The MR fluid provides a liquid interface for vastly improved heat transfer. Also, utilizing an applied magnetic field the fluid shear stress can be increased causing complete mechanical restraint of the electronics card while providing vibration damping. The initial University of Missouri RevCon design is discussed, and its evolution into the current MR fluid thermal connector is presented. The unique heat transfer characteristics of the selected MR fluid are presented, including the controllable variation of fluid thermal conductivity with an applied magnetic field. Thermal performance has been simulated, evaluated experimentally, and compared directly to the industry standard <b>wedgelock.</b> Also, the MR fluid interface has been investigated as a means to provide vibration damping for the electronics card, and damping characteristics are discussed...|$|E
