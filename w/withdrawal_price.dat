40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal International Journal of Industrial Organization and the definitive published version is available at [URL] paper proposes a Northâ€“South model to study the interaction between price regulation policies and parallel trade, with a particular focus on the pharmaceutical sector. We show that, under parallel trade, R&D investment can rise only when the South government takes into full account its impact both on investment and on the firm's decision to supply the regulated country. This arises because of a complete <b>withdrawal</b> from <b>price</b> regulation. When policy choices are endogenized, indeed the South wants to achieve this level of full commitment when it is large in size. When instead it is smaller in size, the South chooses an intermediate form of commitment whereby it anticipates its effect only on local distribution and delivery, but not on global R&D investment. As a response to these credible levels of price control commitments, the North reacts by allowing parallel imports from the South...|$|R

40|$|A theory-based {{graphical}} {{analysis of}} WTO's trade liberalization policies (opening of close-economy to {{international trade and}} cuts in price-supports, import-tariffs and export-subsidies) suggests that most of such policies would yield net social gains to the society, as a whole. The adverse effects and losses in producer surpluses {{of some of the}} policies would be balanced out by greater gains in consumer surpluses and vice versa. Losses in producer surpluses due to cuts in price supports and import tariffs are also expected to be partially subsided by reductions in export subsidies mainly granted by the USA and EU; hence, policies need to be enforced, not in isolation, but in a simultaneous fashion. Trade liberalization would help minimize control of individuals on trade, leave less room for individual policy makers, tax collectors and interest groups to exploit situations in their own interest and lead the economy to be run in accordance with the supply and demand forces based on the last lasting general tendency of human nature. This would help to achieve a sustainable and stable agricultural growth; however, more durable sustained growth would depend as how effectively trade liberalization is pursued and enforced the world over. Opening of closed economy for exportables, and withdrawal of export subsidies by foreign exporters would be proproducers and would directly contribute to poverty alleviation. Opening of economy for importables, <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>price</b> supports and tariff-cuts on imports would yield savings to consumers and would positively contribute towards poverty reduction.

40|$|Payers {{are a major}} {{stakeholder}} in any {{considerations and}} initiatives concerning adaptive licensing of new medicinal products, {{also referred to as}} Medicines Adaptive Pathways to patients (MAPPs). Firstly, the scope and necessity of MAPPs need further scrutiny, especially with regard to the definition of unmet need. Conditional approval pathways already exist for new medicines for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases and {{only a limited number of}} new medicines are innovative. MAPPs will result in new medicines initially with limited evidence about their effectiveness and safety. Additional data are to be collected after approval. Consequently, adaptive pathways may increase the risk of exposing patients to ineffective or unsafe medicines. We have already seen medicines approved conventionally that subsequently proved ineffective or unsafe amongst a wider, more co-morbid population as well as medicines considered for approval under MAPPs but subsequently proved ineffective or unsafe in Phase III trials and were never licensed. MAPPs also put high demands on payers. Routine collection of patient level data is difficult with high transaction costs. It is not clear who will fund these. Other challenges for payers include shifts in the risk governance framework, implications for evaluation and HTA, increased complexity of setting prices, difficulty with ensuring equity in allocation of resources, liability and implementation of stratified use, Exit strategies also need to be agreed in advance, including price reductions, rebates or reimbursement <b>withdrawals</b> when <b>price</b> premiums are not justified.

40|$|For {{more than}} a century, the sugar {{industry}} has been perceived as {{the backbone of the}} Fijian economy, given its contributions to gross domestic product (GDP) and employment generation. However, because of the non-renewal of land leases and the gradual <b>withdrawal</b> of preferential <b>prices</b> by the European Union, the industry {{is on the verge of}} collapse. We use the Fiji computable general equilibrium model to simulate the economy-wide impact of a 30 % reduction in sugar production. Among our key results, we find that in the long run a 30 % reduction in sugar production leads to a 2. 1 % fall in exports, and government expenditure and real consumption fall by 1. 9 % and 1. 6 %, respectively. These declines in the aggregate demand components are reflected in a fall of approximately 1. 8 % in Fiji's GDP. The negative repercussion of declining economic growth is reflected in a 1. 5 % decline in real national welfare. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Several of {{the more}} complex {{optimization}} problems in finance {{can be characterized as}} impulse control problems. Impulse control problems can be written as quasi-variational inequalities, which are then solved to determine the optimal control strategy. Since most quasi-variational inequalities do not have analytical solutions, numerical methods are generally used in the solution process. In this thesis, the impulse control problem framework is applied to value two complex long-term option-type contracts. Both pricing problems considered are cast as impulse control problems and solved using an implicit approach based on either the penalty method or the operator splitting scheme. The first contract chosen is an exotic employee stock option referred to as an infinite reload option. This contract provides the owner with an infinite number of reload opportunities. Each time a reload occurs, the owner pays the strike price using pre-owned company shares and, in return, receives one share for each option exercised and a portion of a new reload option. Numerical methods based on the classic Black-Scholes equation are developed while taking into account contract features such as vesting periods. In addition, the value of an infinite reload option to it's owner is obtained by using a utility maximization approach. The second long-term contract considered is a variable annuity with a guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB) clause. Numerical methods are developed to determine the cost of the GMDB clause while including features such as partial <b>withdrawals.</b> The <b>pricing</b> model is then used to determine the fair insurance charge which minimizes the cost of the contract to the issuer. Due to the long maturity of variable annuities, non-constant market parameters expressed through the use of regime-switching are included in the GMDB pricing model...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDo extreme price {{changes of}} {{pharmaceutical}} stocks reflect unexpected scientific information produced during the drug R&D process, especially {{the approval of}} new drugs, but also pre- and clinical trial results, recalls and <b>withdrawals?</b> Do stock <b>prices</b> initially overreact to such information? We modelled market-adjusted daily changes in stock prices of the seventeen biggest pharmaceutical firms worldwide from 1989 to 2008 to detect large price changes (outliers), using an ARMA-GARCH dynamic econometric model. Then, we matched those outliers with news produced during the drug R&D process, and tested the hypothesis of no overreaction by examining cumulative abnormal returns. Our results show that there were 261 abnormal market adjusted daily returns. In 60 % of the cases, {{we were able to}} assign a plausible cause; i. e., FDA approvals in 6 % of these cases, news of a scientific nature in another 25 %. Only 10 of 1721 FDA approvals of new drugs during the study period were related to abnormally large returns. The impact of negative news items on stock prices is larger than of positive news items. The overreaction hypothesis is rejected; there is no price backlash, therefore the efficient market hypothesis is not violated...|$|R
40|$|Poland has {{recently}} begun reforming its tax program. In December 1999 it announced a gradual {{reduction in the}} corporate income tax rate, from 34 percent in 1999 to 22 percent in 2004. Value added and excise taxes are being harmonized with European Union directives, which means higher value added tax rates on unprocessed foodstuffs, municipal services, and construction material, and higher excise rates on tobacco and alcohol. The reform of personal income tax law has been delayed, because of concern about the fairness of a rate reduction for higher-income taxpayers and hesitation about the government's proposal to remove or scale down existing tax expenditure programs. Poland's personal income tax expenditure programs, introduced in 1992, have received growing attention {{as the cost of}} the programs has increased. Originally they were intended to compensate lower-income taxpayers for the <b>withdrawal</b> of <b>price</b> subsidies. But most of them are extremely regressive, benefiting higher-income taxpayers. Tax expenditures are reductions in tax liabilities that result from preferential provisions, such as deductions, exemptions, credits, deferrals, preferential tax rates, and exclusions from taxation. They are effective government spending channeled through the tax system, usually as substitutes for direct government spending to achieve fiscal and political objectives. The authors contend that strengthening the administration of Poland's tax expenditure programs {{is the first step toward}} making them effective and equitable, limiting their costs, and preventing the tax base from shrinking. They discuss options for increasing the scrutiny of the tax expenditure programs, defining their opportunity costs and effect on the tax system. Currently these programs enjoy a funding advantage over direct spending programs because they are not subject to systematic review. To limit the expansion of these programs and reduce their less desirable effects on the system, the authors suggest defining a benchmark tax structure, establishing sunset dates for the programs, forecasting their costs, and reviewing their economic effectiveness, efficiency, and equity by comparing them with direct expenditures and subsidies.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} answers {{three questions}} in urban and labor economics. Chapter 1 investigates {{under what conditions}} wealthy, high-skilled landowners wind up worse off when they use housing regulations to make their communities harder for poorer, low-skill workers to move into. If there is labor complementarity in production between high-skill and low-skill workers, low-skill workers will have lower productivity when they cannot advantage themselves of neighborhood effects, which in turn will hurt high-skill workers. Chapter 2 asks whether rent control, a strong form of housing regulations, incentivizes landlords to evict their tenants when the unregulated rents rise. Exploiting a known price shock to different residential buildings throughout San Francisco over an 11 year period, I find that a 2 % increase in prices leads to a 1 % increase in the monthly probability of an eviction from a controlled unit. The analysis also highlights the perverse incentives created by rent control, that medium-term (3 - 5 year) market <b>withdrawals</b> increase when <b>prices</b> increase. Chapter 3 studies whether grandchildren change their grandparents' labor force participation, and then researches whether the fall and rise in labor force participation between 1970 and 2009 can be ascribed to {{the rise and fall}} in grandparenthood due largely to the Baby Boom. I find that being a grandparent lowers labor force attachment for both grandfathers and grandmothers on both the intensive and extensive margin, but that grandchildren play only a limited role in the trends in older men's labor force participation...|$|R
40|$|The nature, {{status and}} role of bid cutting in {{construction}} bidding are examined from economic, legal, ethical and management perspectives. Some possible means of countering its negative effects are considered including its prohibition by legislation, the use of bid depositories, earlier formalisation of subcontracts, <b>withdrawal</b> of subcontract <b>prices</b> and through alternative procurement methods. An empirical survey of bid cutting practice is described involving a sample of main contractors (MCs) and subcontractors (SCs) in SouthEast Queensland. The practice of bid cutting {{was found to be}} widespread. All the MCs considered the practice to be ethical and all the SCs considered it to be unethical. In some cases, MCs awarded contracts elsewhere, even after telling SCs they had the job. Most of the SCs had tried individually to counteract bid cutting but were unable to continue this while others were complying with MC bid cutting attempts. SC bid withdrawals are very rare and litigation is never applied by either MCs or SCs. Mainly as a result of incomplete project documentation, MCs disliked the idea of making the subcontract binding at the time of main contract bid subject to its success, although it was generally recognised that it would reduce bid-cutting by the MC â€“ view that was also shared by half the SCs. Most respondents thought the construction management procurement option might reduce bid cutting but none had sufficient direct experience to be sure...|$|R
40|$| {{currency}} crisis outbreaks, {{and risk of}} withdrawal from the EMU. The first paper (Chapter II) contributes to a vast literature on the determinants of exchange rates. An incomplete list of exchange rate determinants analyzed in the literature includes: labor productivity (Chinn, 2000; Cheung et al., 2007); inflation rates (Lothian and Taylor, 1996; Taylor et al., 2001); interest rates (Froot and Thaler, 1990; Chinn, 2006); overvaluation of the domestic currency (Glick and Rose, 1999; Corsetti et al., 2000); or export growth (Williamson, 1994; Isard, 2007). I study {{the impact of these}} macroeconomic fundamentals on ADR investorsâ€™ exchange rate expectations for China. China makes a good case to study standard exchange rate theories since the Chinese central bank manages the official yuan/U. S. dollar exchange rate, which therefore reacts much less to changes in macroeconomic fundamentals than is suggested by theory. Using ADR market data, I can test exchange rate theories for the Chinese peg/managed float regime under free market conditions. The second paper (Chapter III) contributes to a literature, which analyzes the determinants of {{currency crisis}} outbreaks (Eichengreen et al., 1995; Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999; Karmann et al., 2002). Existing papers employ low-frequent and backward-looking macroeconomic data to forecast currency crises. This dissertation uses ADR market data to derive more accurate and up-to-date currency crisis signals on a daily basis. Moreover, the determinants of currency crisis expectations, such as banking or sovereign debt crisis risk, can be studied using daily market-based risk proxies. The third paper (Chapter IV) contributes to a literature on the sustainability of the EMU. Several papers discuss the possibility of withdrawal from the EMU (Cohen, 1993; Scott, 1998; Buiter, 1999; Eichengreen, 2007). I present empirical evidence that daily ADR market data reflects the risk that vulnerable member countries may leave the EMU and analyzes which determinants drive this withdrawal risk perceived by ADR investors. Second, this dissertation contributes to the literature on the pricing of ADRs. A common finding in the literature is that the outbreak of a currency crisis negatively affects the returns of U. S. dollar-denominated ADRs as the devaluation of the local currency depresses the dollar value of the underlying stock (see, for example, Bailey et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2000; Bin et al., 2004). Several papers find that the introduction of capital controls (typically meant to prevent a currency crisis outbreak) can lead to a permanent violation of the law of one price between ADRs and their underlying stocks since cross-border arbitrage cannot take place (Melvin, 2003; Levy Yeyati et al., 2004, 2009; Auguste et al., 2006). Arquette et al. (2008) and Burdekin and Redfern (2009) find that the price spreads of Chinese cross-listed stocks are significantly driven by market-traded forward exchange rates. This dissertation builds on these findings and uses the relative prices (or returns) of ADRs and their underlying stocks to derive exchange rate expectations. I present empirical evidence that ADR investorsâ€™ exchange rate expectations are driven by theory-based determinants of exchange rates, currency crisis outbreaks, or the risk of withdrawal from the EMU. This analysis therefore provides new insights into the price (return) determinants of ADRs. I. 4 Main findings and policy implications The findings of this dissertation may broaden the understanding of exchanger rate expectations. The results of the first paper (Chapter II) suggest that stock market investors form their exchange rate expectations in accordance with standard exchange rate theories. Based on a monthly panel data set comprised of 22 ADR/underlying stock pairs and 52 H-share/underlying stock pairs from December 1998 to February 2009 I find that stock market investors expect more yuan appreciation against the U. S. dollar: if the yuanâ€™s overvaluation decreases (the incentive of competitive devaluation); if the inflation differential vis-Ã -vis the United States falls (relative purchasing power parity); if the productivity growth in China accelerates relative to the United States (the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson effect); if the Chinese interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the United States decreases (uncovered interest rate parity); when Chinese domestic credit relative to GDP decreases (lower risk of a twin banking and currency crisis); or, if Chinese sovereign bond yields fall (lower risk of a twin sovereign debt and currency crisis), ceteris paribus. These findings suggest that the theoretical links between macroeconomic variables and exchange rates in most cases also apply to exchange rate expectations. In this way, the results support the validity of many exchange rate theories and substantiate the rationality of stock market investorsâ€™ expectations. This approach (based on stock prices formed under free market conditions) provides an opportunity to test exchange rate theories in managed floating regimes, where the official exchange rate is manipulated by the central bank and does therefore not necessarily respond to changes in macroeconomic fundamentals. Moreover, I use a rolling regressions forecasting framework in order to evaluate the quality of exchange rate expectations. I find that exchange rate expectations drawn from the ADR and H-share market have a better ability to predict changes in the yuan/U. S. dollar exchange rate than the random walk or forward exchange rates, at least at forecast horizons longer than one year. The Peopleâ€™s Bank of China may take advantage of ADR and H-share based exchange rate expectations in order to determine possible misalignments of the yuan/U. S. dollar exchange rate. In this way, the Chinese central bank may improve the timing and intensity of foreign exchange market interventions meant to manipulate the yuan/U. S. dollar exchange rate. The second paper (Chapter III) focuses on the derivation and determination of currency crisis signals formed by ADR market investors. Using daily data on 17 ADR/underlying stock pairs for the capital control episodes in Argentina (2001 - 2002), Malaysia (1998 - 1999), and Venezuela (1994 - 1996 and 2003 - 2007) we find that ADR investors anticipate currency crises or realignments well before they actually occur. Policymakers could use ADR investorsâ€™ up-to-date assessment of the pegâ€™s sustainability in order to identify currency crisis risk earlier and to take the necessary steps to realign an (unsustainable) peg rate before a crisis breaks out. In this way, they could prevent the outbreaks of damaging currency crises without holding excess amounts of costly foreign exchange reserves. Using panel regressions we find that ADR investors anticipate a higher currency crisis risk when export commodity prices fall, the currencies of trading partners depreciate, sovereign bonds yield spreads rise, and interest rate spreads increase. These findings suggest that ADR investorsâ€™ currency crisis expectations are based on currency crisis theories even on a daily basis underlining the validity of these theories. The third paper (Chapter IV) studies a particular form of currency crisis risk: the risk that vulnerable member countries could leave the EMU. I use a multifactor pricing model to test whether the financial vulnerability measures assumed to reflect the incentives of national governments to withdraw from the EMU (banking crisis risk, sovereign debt crisis risk, and overvaluation of the euro) are priced in ADR returns. Using daily data on 22 ADR/underlying stock pairs of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain in the period January 2007 to March 2009 I find that ADR investors perceive a higher risk of <b>withdrawal</b> (<b>priced</b> in ADR returns) when the risk of banking and sovereign debt crisis and the overvaluation of the euro increase. Policymakers could use ADR market data in order to assess the stability of the EMU. Higher correlations between ADR returns and currency crisis risk factors would suggest a higher risk of withdrawals from the EMU. In such a case, financial vulnerabilities may be addressed within the EMU in order to preserve the integrity of the eurozone. However, time will show how long the policymakers in the EMU will continue with the implementation of even more anti-crisis measures. Growing controversies on the ECBâ€™s sovereign bond purchases and the bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal cast doubt on the sustainability of the EMU in its current form...|$|R
