Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them.

The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum, but damage control.|$|E

500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1865, Whitman's friend, John Burroughs (1837–1921), an {{aspiring}} nature writer, had returned to Washington to his position at the Treasury department after a long vacation in the woods. Burroughs recalled that Whitman had been [...] "deeply interested in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> him of the hermit thrush, {{and he says he}} largely used the information I have given him in one of his principal poems". Burroughs described the song as [...] "the finest sound in nature...perhaps more of an evening than a morning hymn...a voice of that calm, sweet solemnity one attains to in his best moments." [...] Whitman took copious notes of his conversations with Burroughs on the subject, writing of the hermit thrush that it [...] "sings oftener after sundown...is very secluded...likes shaded, dark places...His song is a hymn...in swamps—is very shy...never sings near the farm houses—never in the settlement—is the bird of the solemn primal woods & of Nature pure & holy." [...] Burroughs published an essay in May 1865 in which he described the hermit thrush as [...] "quite a rare bird, of very shy and secluded habits" [...] found [...] "only in the deepest and most remote forests, usually in damp and swampy localities". Loving notes that the hermit thrush was [...] "a common bird on Whitman's native Long Island" [...] Biographer Justin Kaplan draws a connection between Whitman's notes and the lines in the poem: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{remodeling}} bills came to $8 million, {{which the}} Helmsleys were loath to pay. A group of contractors sued the Helmsleys for non-payment; the Helmsleys eventually paid {{off most of}} the debt owed to the contractors. In 1985, during those proceedings, the contractors revealed that most of their work was being illegally billed to the Helmsleys' hotels as business expenses. The contractors sent a stack of the falsified invoices to the New York Post {{to prove that the}} Helmsleys were trying to avoid tax liabilities. The resulting Post story led to a federal criminal investigation. Also, Jeremiah McCarthy, the Helmsleys' executive engineer, alleged that Leona repeatedly demanded that he sign invoices to bill personal expenses to the Helmsley company and, when McCarthy declined to do so, Helmsley exploded with tyrannical outbursts, shouting, [...] "You're not my fucking partner! You'll sign <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you to sign." [...] In 1988, then United States Attorney Rudy Giuliani indicted the Helmsleys and two of their associates on several tax-related charges, as well as extortion.|$|E

2500|$|... "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?" [...] {{was written}} by Al Jean and {{directed}} by Nancy Kruse {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). American actor Ed Asner guest starred in the episode as the newspaper editor that hires Homer. The character is based on Lou Grant, the character Asner played in the series The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Lou Grant. The episode features several other references to popular culture. For example, the song Homer sings upon being given the food critic job is set to the tune of [...] "I Feel Pretty" [...] from the musical West Side Story. The restaurant Planet Springfield is a parody of Planet Hollywood, containing items such as the film script for The Cable Guy (1996), Herbie from The Love Bug (1968), a model of the RMS Titanic from Titanic (1997), an alien similar to those from Mars Attacks! (1996), models of a TIE fighter, an X-wing fighter and C-3PO from the Star Wars saga, as well as [...] "the coffee mug" [...] from the film Heartbeeps (1981) and [...] "the cane" [...] from Citizen Kane (1941), which is not a real prop. [...] "Citizen Kane" [...] is also referenced in the script with the line [...] "People will think <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> them to think when you tell me what to tell them to think!" [...] Also there's a reference to Glengarry Glen Ross, with a desperate salesman (like Jack Lemmon in the film) as Lisa is touring the local paper earlier in the episode.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), in the morning, Balaam saddled his donkey and {{departed}} with the dignitaries, but God was incensed at his going and placed an angel in Balaam's way. When the donkey saw the angel {{standing in the}} way holding his drawn sword, the donkey swerved from the road into the fields, and Balaam beat the ass to turn her back onto the road. The angel then stationed himself in a lane with a fence on either side. Seeing the angel, the donkey pressed herself and Balaam's foot against the wall, so he beat her again. The angel then stationed himself on a narrow spot that allowed no room to swerve right or left, and the donkey lay down under Balaam, and Balaam became furious and beat the ass with his stick. Then God allowed the donkey to speak, and she complained to Balaam. And then God allowed Balaam to see the angel, and Balaam bowed down to the ground. The angel questioned Balaam for beating his donkey, noting that she had saved Balaam's life. Balaam admitted his error and offered to turn back if the angel still disapproved. But the angel told Balaam: [...] "Go with the men. [...] But you must say nothing except <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you." [...] So Balaam went on. Balak went out to meet Balaam on the Arnon border, and asked him why he didn't come earlier. But Balaam told Balak that he could utter only the words that God put into his mouth.|$|E
