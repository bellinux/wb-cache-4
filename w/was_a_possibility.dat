5|$|According to the producer, Tom Welling, {{he states}} that the reason of {{cancellation}} {{was due to the}} change of CW president of entertainment from Dawn Ostroff to Mark Pedowitz. He also said that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of a reboot of the series with a new cast and cameos from the previous cast if enough fans continue to watch the original series on CW Seed.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, {{and got the}} University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E
5|$|By November 1944, Strong was {{reporting}} that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of a German counteroffensive in the Ardennes or the Vosges. Smith sent Strong to personally warn Bradley, who was preparing an offensive of his own. The magnitude and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive {{came as a}} shock, and Smith had to defend Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm. He felt Bradley had been given ample warning.|$|E

5|$|Due to the club's {{financial}} situation, {{the reserve}} team had their wages halved {{early on in}} the season, and by January 1886 the payments made to reserve players were withdrawn altogether, although there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of them receiving a bonus {{at the end of the}} season if funds permitted. This resulted in Albion's second team refusing to play against Small Heath Alliance and the game was cancelled. Some of the players were suspended as a result of their actions, but were later re-instated.|$|E
5|$|They {{announced}} their forthcoming {{project in the}} Spanish media, stating that they were choosing ten songs for the album {{and that it would}} be released in the fall of 2011 or early in 2012. In the end they created several more songs than they had planned. When asked if the album might be released in March 2012, marking the 17th anniversary of Selena's death, Abraham said that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility.</b> Many media outlets called it a remix album. Abraham told the press that it would be released in five volumes, with ten tracks on each.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{began to}} form again just before midday, as the {{hot and humid}} {{conditions}} became more acute in the middle part of the day. The Bureau of Meteorology radar picked {{up a series of}} cells to the north-west of Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, and the data suggested that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of large hail. The Bureau immediately issued a Severe Thunderstorm Warning for the coastal region between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, 100km to the north.|$|E

5|$|Two {{incidents}} {{occurred during}} filming. On the first, seven bullet holes were shot {{into one of}} the trucks used during production. On the second, the cast and crew were driving from the set, and a pedestrian was shot in the neck outside a supermarket. The ambulance took 35–45 minutes to arrive, and waited a further 35–45 minutes for the police to arrive. The paramedics refused to take the victim to the hospital without a police escort. According to Stevenson, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> that rival gangmembers would shoot at the paramedics for trying to resuscitate the victim.|$|E
5|$|After being {{stripped}} of the victory in previous year's race {{because of an}} underweight car, Audi Sport ABT team principal Hans-Jurgen Abt said his team's objective was to get onto the podium. He acknowledged that getting the victory would not be easy because of the competitiveness of the field. After retiring from the preceding Buenos Aires ePrix, Bird stated that he would enter the Mexico City race with a positive attitude and affirmed his belief in his team and he felt there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of getting onto the podium in the event they perform well in qualifying. Mitch Evans reiterated that despite his team Jaguar not scoring points in the season's opening three races, the Buenos Aires race showed that he was becoming more confident and wanted to carry over his momentum from the four-month break. He also said he was excited {{to compete in the}} Mexico City event.|$|E
5|$|After the {{produced}} pilot {{lived up}} to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name Friends on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30p.m. timeslot. The pilot aired between Mad About You and Seinfeld, and was watched by almost 22million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run, and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV. When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility,</b> critics believed that he was posturing, and {{that at least two}} of the cast members would not sign on for another season. When it was confirmed that Friends would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.|$|E

5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E
5|$|Following Temple's marriage, {{his father}} had {{invested}} in a farming venture by Edward Whalley who was the brother-in-law of Temple's stepsister - Mary Penistone. Sir Alexander apparently intended this to provide an inheritance for his grandchildren (the children of James Temple). As a younger son himself, Sir Alexander wanted to ensure suitable provision for his own younger son. This investment made by Temple's father {{for the benefit of}} his children had apparently become valueless when Edward Whalley fled to Scotland in the late 1630s. However, in the 1650s, Whalley had become a prominent and successful member of the Puritan establishment and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of recovering some money. In the late 1650s, Temple and Whalley went to the Court of Chancery to determine what was due to Temple and his children. However, with the death of Oliver Cromwell and the subsequent restoration of Charles II, both regicides were faced with the possibility of execution and the case appears to have been unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Fredrik Malmberg told Deadline.com in an {{interview}} that the sequel could lead to a cinematic universe of Howard's creations for film and TV. On January 28, 2016, Schwarzenegger confirmed that the third film would be Conan the Conqueror. He revealed the details about the film at a Q event in Scotland. According to Sandy Schaefer writing for Screenrant.com in August 2016 the script is collaboratively honed by Chris Morgan and Will Beall. In April 2017, producer Chris Morgan stated that Universal had dropped the project, although there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> of a TV show. The story of the film was supposed to be set 30 years after the first, with some inspiration from Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.|$|E

5|$|In March 2016, {{executive}} producer Maurissa Tancharoen had stated that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> the season could continue {{the story of}} the MCU series Agent Carter in some way, given it was not renewed for the 2016–17 season. This episode reveals that the Momentum Energy Labs group introduced in the season and tied to Eli Morrow is actually a successor to the Isodyne Energy company from the second season of Agent Carter. Additionally, with the appearance of Johnny Blaze, the episode introduces that character to the MCU. The character had previously been adapted into the Sony films Ghost Rider and , starring Nicolas Cage as Blaze, which the series had otherwise been trying to distance itself from.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem with}} {{enforcing}} a close blockade with ships was that warships loitering {{off the coast}} of Japan would be vulnerable to attack by aircraft and submarines. Blockading Japanese ports with small ships <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility,</b> but this would first require the destruction or neutralisation of the Japanese fleet, and it was far from certain that the Japanese fleet would place itself in a position where it could be destroyed. A plan was adopted for a more distant blockade, whereby ships bound for Japan would be intercepted as they passed through the East Indies or the Panama Canal. This would not cut off Japan's trade with China or Korea, and probably not with the United States either. The effectiveness of such a blockade was therefore questionable.|$|E
5|$|While the Japanese raid {{into the}} Indian Ocean was not successful, {{associated}} Japanese shipping movements provoked a major Allied response. In early March 1944, Allied intelligence reported that two battleships escorted by destroyers had left Singapore {{in the direction}} of Surabaya and a U.S. submarine made radar contact with two large Japanese ships in the Lombok Strait. The Australian Chiefs of Staff Committee reported to the Government on 8 March that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> that these ships could have entered the Indian Ocean to attack Fremantle. In response to this report, all ground and naval defences at Fremantle were fully manned, all shipping was ordered to leave Fremantle and several RAAF squadrons were redeployed to bases in Western Australia.|$|E

5|$|With {{the overall}} success of Soviet forces in Bagration, his Front was {{expanded}} by three armies (although he ceded the 4th Shock Army to Second Baltic), the 39th Army (previously {{under the command}} of Third Belorussian), the 51st and the 2nd Guards Armies. The First Baltic Front was ordered by STAVKA to move westward in order to stop Army Group North's remaining forces from escaping to Germany. Despite this, Bagramyan understood that many of the general orders being given to the German Army were directed by Adolf Hitler, rather than the General Staff, and knew that while there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> that they would confront them in the Lithuanian city of Kaunas, he felt the more likely location would be in Latvia's capital, Riga. He spoke with Vasilevsky who agreed to change the plans if his theory and intuition proved correct.|$|E
5|$|Following Emery Reves's {{death in}} 1981, the Dallas Museum of Art in the United States {{approached}} Wendy Reves {{knowing that there}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> that her art collection at La Pausa might be given to a museum. In exchange for the 1985 donation Reves insisted that the museum recreate six of the principal rooms at La Pausa, and display the collection there as she had arranged it. The collection of 1,400 objet d'art is displayed at the museum as the Wendy and Emery Reves Collection in a reconstruction of five rooms from La Pausa. The villa's central courtyard and patio were reconstructed at the museum along with the villa's dining room, library, salon, bedroom, and hall, situated in a purpose built 16,500-square-foot wing designed by architect Edward Larrabee Barnes. Wendy Reves also donated $3 million to the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, to establish the Reves Center for International Studies, and directed that the Reves Foundation benefit that college with 40 percent of annual endowment funding. She also chose {{for herself and her}} late husband Emery Reves to be buried at William and Mary.|$|E
5|$|From September 9 to September 11, Ophelia fluctuated in strength, being {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm only to regain hurricane intensity three more times; during this time it moved very slowly and erratically in a northeasterly direction. The NHC continued to struggle to predict Ophelia, with the forecasts generally calling for a landfall {{on the east coast}} of the United States. The forecasters indicated there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> that Ophelia could strengthen further to Category 3 strength, though they felt this was unlikely. On September 12, the storm completed a clockwise loop, then adopted a more north-westerly motion towards North Carolina, while still moving only slowly and fitfully. It dropped below hurricane strength again when the inner core of convection collapsed, possibly due to passing over cooler water that it upwelled earlier in its track. Ophelia then regained hurricane strength over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. After the collapse of the inner core of convection, the hurricane acquired an unusually large eye over 115miles (185km) across and soon reached its peak strength with 85mph (140km/h) winds. The northern and western eyewall passed over the coastal areas of North Carolina throughout September 14–15, but the strongest winds remained offshore.|$|E
