5|$|As the {{relations}} between the West and the Soviet Union deteriorated with the US and the UK backing Turkey, Soviet claims <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of the agenda by 1947. However, it was not until 1953, after Stalin's death, that they officially abandoned their claims, thus ending the dispute.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were left}} {{a target of}} 225 for victory. Davidson fell for eight {{as part of a}} Jasu Patel-inspired collapse. Patel took 14/124 and Australia <b>were</b> <b>out</b> for 105. This {{resulted}} in Australia's first loss in the fifteen Tests since Davidson began leading the attack, and their first at the hands of their hosts.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} game of the tournament, Canada and the Soviet Union became engaged in a violent bench-clearing brawl while Canada was leading 4–2. Consequently, the game was {{declared}} null and void, and both teams were ejected from the tournament; while the Soviets <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of medal contention, Canada was playing for the gold medal and were guaranteed at least a bronze.|$|E
5000|$|Suppose that Carr <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> If Carr <b>is</b> <b>out,</b> then if Allen <b>is</b> also <b>out</b> Brown {{would have}} to be in, since someone must be in the shop for it to be open. However, we know that {{whenever}} Allen goes out he takes Brown with him, and thus we know as a general rule that if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out,</b> Brown <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> So if Carr <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then the statements [...] "if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then Brown <b>is</b> in" [...] and [...] "if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then Brown <b>is</b> out" [...] would both be true at the same time.|$|R

5|$|König was interned, {{along with}} the {{majority}} of the High Seas Fleet, in Scapa Flow in November 1918 following the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter gave the order to scuttle the fleet, including König, while the British guard ships <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of the harbor on exercises. Unlike most of the scuttled ships, König was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still {{on the bottom of the}} bay.|$|E

5|$|The AVG {{continued}} some of {{its operations}} from Magwe, which was heavily bombed by the Japanese. Chennault ordered retaliatory raids against Chiang Mai and Lampang on 23 March 1942. Because these bases <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of range of the P-40s, from their main base at Kunming, {{it was decided to}} go via Loi Wing (Leiyun), in China, then launch the raid from the RAF airstrip at Nam Sang, Burma.|$|E
5|$|The {{build-up}} to {{the final}} had focused upon many Manchester United fans' discontent at their takeover by American businessman and sports tycoon Malcolm Glazer, and large demonstrations were planned {{inside and outside the}} Millennium Stadium.

5|$|The {{engagement}} at Montbrehain was the Australian Corps' last {{contribution to}} the war and they <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of the line training when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. Total Australian casualties on the Western Front numbered 181,000, including 46,000 of whom died. Another 114,000 men were wounded, 16,000 gassed, and approximately 3,850 were taken prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|A statewide {{review by}} {{emergency}} management officials recorded 249 fatalities in Alabama, 23 {{of which were}} not tornado-related.

The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged main power lines coming from Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant further to the northeast. These towers were the main supply of electrical power to much of North Alabama and some were without power for two weeks. The tornado just missed the Limestone Correctional Facility, which {{less than a year later}} would be struck by another tornado.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Hutton rocked {{onto the}} front foot, played outside a Johnson off break and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 2/32. The English opener had been {{uncertain}} against Johnson's spin and played forward too early at a slower ball, which went between a gap between his bat and pad. Later in the afternoon, Denis Compton and captain Norman Yardley played Johnson cautiously but safely; in particular, Yardley repeatedly driving a series of overpitched balls from Johnson for runs. Johnson took the last two wickets to fall on the second day, having Alec Coxon caught and bowled for 19 and Laker caught behind for 28 after the pair had put on 41. England <b>were</b> <b>out</b> early on the third morning for 215. Johnson ended with 3/72, having sent down 35 overs, the most by any Australian.|$|E

5|$|After {{many years}} of ambitious and {{successful}} free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s. The Great Depression brought her economic hardship, and, even though she looked younger than her age, most important women's roles <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of her age range. Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, {{in comparison with the}} more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of her long history there. A humble employee at a humble salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.|$|E
5|$|Alexander and {{his paper}} vocally {{supported}} the old governing {{class of the}} former Confederate States of America and were rabid in {{their opposition to the}} policies of Reconstruction imposed upon the South by the Northern-based Republican Party. Such views <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of step with the majority of Oregonians, however, with the Republicans coming to dominate Oregon politics during {{the last quarter of the}} 19thcentury. Alexander was forced to liquidate his stake in his money-losing newspaper in 1868.|$|E
5|$|As he withdrew, Frederick {{established}} a fighting line {{north of the}} village, and it eventually served as a rallying point for stragglers and survivors. By mid-morning, around 10:00, the Prussians retreated to the north-west. Any pursuing troops were met with a wall of musket fire. Frederick and his surviving army <b>were</b> <b>out</b> of range of the Austrian army {{by the time they}} had reorganized. Hans Joachim von Zieten and Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who also had remained alert all night, organized a rear guard action that prevented the Austrians from falling upon the retreating Prussians. This discouraged even the most determined Austrians; the Croats and irregulars contented themselves with pillaging the village and the Prussian bodies.|$|E

5|$|Australia batted {{and passed}} England's total {{on the first}} afternoon. Tallon came in to bat {{on the second day}} with the score at 7/332, joining opener Morris, who had already passed 150. It took a run out to remove Morris; he {{attempted}} a quick run to third man after being called through by Tallon but was not quick enough for the substitute fielder's arm, leaving Australia at 8/359. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Doug Ring, before both <b>were</b> <b>out</b> on 389, ending Australia's innings. In the second innings, Tallon caught Hutton from Miller and conceded nine byes as England were dismissed for 188 and lost by an innings, sealing a 40 series victory for Australia.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{elected to}} bat first and Brown made 106, while Bradman (65) and Harvey (60) both scored half-centuries. Kent {{collapsed}} {{to the lowest}} score of the tour in the first innings, succumbing in only 23 overs. Johnston and Loxton both took 3/10, and six local batsmen made ducks. Forced to follow on, half the Kent side <b>were</b> <b>out</b> for 45 in the second innings. Tony Pawson and Godfrey Evans added 71, but the match, held in front of record crowds for the ground, ended inside two days, soon after Evans was run out. It took the Australians less than 56 overs to get 20 wickets. Lindwall took 4/37 in the second innings; all his wickets were top-order batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Bangladesh's second innings {{started in}} similar fashion to their first; they lost the early wicket of Imrul Kayes, and Tamim scored a quick half-century. The latter was dropped three times before being caught by Broad for 52 runs. Junaid and Jahurul both made good starts for Bangladesh, but <b>were</b> <b>out</b> for 34 and 43 respectively, which along with low scores for Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur left Bangladesh on 172 for six {{at the end of}} the fourth day. On the final morning, Shakib batted {{resiliently}} with the lower-order batsmen and narrowly missed out on a century; he was the last man out, stumped attempting to score a boundary to reach the landmark. His batting had helped establish a 208 run lead for Bangladesh, which resulted in England requiring just under four runs per over to reach the total.|$|E
