5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used by men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{protozoa}} can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly Giardia lamblia – but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., {{and other species}} have also been implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, and following disasters.|$|E

5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate {{a higher risk of}} acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E
5|$|Those at {{high risk}} of {{infection}} should be tested as there is effective treatment for those who have the disease. Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, intravenous drug users, men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, and those who live with someone with hepatitis B.|$|E
5|$|Antiretroviral {{treatment}} {{among people}} with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP {{is associated with a}} 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in women <b>who</b> {{reported}} <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> {{both men and women}} and women <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a man in the 3 months before and having at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these women, 38 % <b>who</b> reported ever <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a woman were compared with those <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only. RESULTS: Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both men and women were more likely than women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a <b>sex</b> partner <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both men and women had a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both men and women were more likely than women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors. Health workers should be aware of bisexual experience among women, since this may be a marker for multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STDs...|$|R

5|$|In {{terms of}} medical issues, lesbians are {{referred}} to as women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women (WSW) because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women's sexuality and some women's hesitancy to disclose their accurate sexual histories even to a physician. Many self-identified lesbians neglect to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and require no birth control, which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a gynecologist when they become sexually active. As a result, many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears. The U.S. government reports that some lesbians neglect seeking medical screening in the U.S.; they lack health insurance because many employers do not offer health benefits to domestic partners.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, {{with the possible exception}} of syphilis.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{prostitution}} and drug use, homosexuality {{has never been}} banned in China, but it was listed as a psychiatric disorder until 2001, and public acts of homosexual sex are punishable as hooliganism. Although increasingly tolerated in the cities, in general, homosexuality is highly stigmatised and men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men are under considerable pressure to conceal their sexual orientation. As a result, most homosexuals are married, or {{will be in the}} future, and form a bridge between the high-risk men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men group to their low-risk wives and other partners. The government has initiated few interventions for men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men, leaving such programmes to advocacy groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and researchers. However, the government recently estimated that there were 5–10 million men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men living in China, of whom 1.35% are thought to be HIV positive. This information, in addition to studies indicating low levels of HIV knowledge, perceived risk, and testing, and high rates of sexually transmitted diseases, has prompted the Ministry of Health to now include men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men in the high-risk groups and to call for the development of novel interventions to target them.|$|E

25|$|Sexual attraction, {{behavior}} and identity {{may also be}} incongruent, as sexual attraction or behavior {{may not necessarily be}} consistent with identity.
