500|$|Unlike the band's {{previous}} two albums, Wasting Light {{was recorded in}} Dave Grohl's garage in Encino, California, {{as opposed to the}} band's home-built studio, Studio 606. Regarding this decision, Grohl states: [...] "There's poetry in being the band that can sell out Wembley but also makes a record in a garage. <b>Why</b> <b>go</b> into the most expensive studio with the biggest producer and use the best state-of-the-art equipment? Where's the rock'n'roll in that?" [...] Grohl added {{it was a way to}} [...] "do something really primal sounding", innovate, break people's expectations and [...] "make records the way we used to fucking make records".|$|E

The same poll found that 58% of respondents felt [...] "the issue of the monarchy and the form of Canada's government isn't important to them and if the system is working OK <b>why</b> <b>go</b> through all the fuss to change it?" [...] A poll by Léger Marketing found that 50% of those polled believed the monarchy should be preserved, while 43% disagreed.|$|E
