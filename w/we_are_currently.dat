We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E

We currently anticipate converting approximately six to eight company-owned Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to the Marlin & Ray’s, Truffles, or Wok Hay concepts in fiscal 2012. Additionally, we anticipate opening one to two new restaurants and approximately seven to nine smaller, inline Lime restaurants in fiscal year 2012.|$|E
25|$|All {{physical}} boxing {{proposals are}} naturally dependent on {{our understanding of}} the laws of physics; if a superintelligence could infer and somehow exploit additional physical laws that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> unaware of, {{there is no way to}} conceive of a foolproof plan to contain it. More broadly, unlike with conventional computer security, attempting to box a superintelligent AI would be intrinsically risky as there could be no sure knowledge that the boxing plan will work. Scientific progress on boxing would be fundamentally difficult because there would be no way to test boxing hypotheses against a dangerous superintelligence until such an entity exists, by which point the consequences of a test failure would be catastrophic.|$|E

25|$|Glacials are {{characterized}} by cooler and drier climates {{over most of the}} earth and large land and sea ice masses extending outward from the poles. Mountain glaciers in otherwise unglaciated areas extend to lower elevations due to a lower snow line. Sea levels drop due to the removal of large volumes of water above sea level in the icecaps. There is evidence that ocean circulation patterns are disrupted by glaciations. Since the earth has significant continental glaciation in the Arctic and Antarctic, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> in a glacial minimum of a glaciation. Such a period between glacial maxima is known as an interglacial. The glacials and interglacials also coincided with changes in Earth's orbit called Milankovitch cycles.|$|E
500|$|Over the Garden Wall was {{critically}} acclaimed. Preceding its premiere, Patrick Kevin Day of the Los Angeles Times {{called it}} [...] "funny, creepy" [...] and, from the premise, [...] "not {{as simple as}} it sounds". In TV Guide and also before the premiere, Megan Walsh-Boyle felt that the show's fictional universe [...] "sounds like a world worth getting lost in". Meredith Woerner of io9 called a preview of the show [...] "amazing", [...] "weird, and cute and great", reflecting [...] "all the things we love about this oddball animation renaissance <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> living in". Conversely, Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew judged from the same preview that the animation was lacking. While not discounting its storytelling, music, and production design, he felt that production skimped on animation; he was still looking forward to the series.|$|E

2500|$|On June 23, 2009, Deftones {{announced}} on their official website that Eros would be delayed indefinitely, saying, [...] "As we neared completion on Eros, {{we realized that}} this record doesn't best encompass and represent who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> as people and as musicians. And although those songs will {{see the light of}} day at some point, we collectively made the decision that we needed to take a new approach, and with Chi's condition heavy on our minds while doing so. We needed to return to the studio to do what we felt was right artistically". They also said, [...] "The decision to hold off on releasing Eros has no connection with Chi's condition or anything associated. This was, and is, purely a creative decision by the band to write, record, and deliver an amazing product".|$|E

25|$|Davidson {{argues that}} as a culture, our {{attention}} blindness represents a significant challenge that we must examine and meet head on; particularly since the Internet has revolutionized virtually every aspect of how our lives function now. The Internet, Davidson suggests, has catapulted us into an immediate, collaborative, and interconnected existence that {{is characterized by the}} sudden breakdown of barriers between private and public, work and play, domestic and foreign, office and home, etc. Davidson notes that although our lives have been irrevocably altered in these fundamental ways, our most important educational, corporate, and social institutions have not substantially changed in correlation with these upheavals. She claims that those in educational and corporate spheres continue to operate in 20th century modes (founded {{to meet the challenges of}} industrialization) as though <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>currently</b> not living through momentous, epochal changes.|$|R
2500|$|Until {{the early}} 2010s, Barcelona had {{mounting}} debts, {{built up over}} the past few seasons, a situation that forced the club to push through an emergency bailout loan of €150 million. The Qatar Foundation, run by Sheikha Mozah, becomes the first shirt sponsor in Barcelona’s 111-year history. The club had previously used UNICEF's logo on the front of its shirts. In 2011, incoming Barcelona president Sandro Rosell agreed the deal for a period of five seasons, with the club receiving €30 million each year, starting on 1 July 2011 and running until 30 June 2016, plus bonuses for trophies won that could total €5m. Writing in his El Periodico column, Cruyff slammed the deal, “We are a unique club in the world, no one has kept their jersey intact throughout their history, yet have remained as competitive as they come... We have sold this uniqueness for about six percent of our budget. I understand that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> losing more than we are earning. However, by selling the shirt it shows me that we are not being creative, and that we have become vulgar.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{situation}} of the Jewish people today is radically different than {{it was only a}} century ago. We have achieved the impossible. And we did so through a very necessary yet narrow Jewish nationalism called 'Zionism' that currently appears to have outlived its usefulness. If we define Zionism (as most Israelis do) not as the Jewish struggle for liberation over millennia but as a 20th century national movement that succeeded in returning the Jewish people to nationhood, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>currently</b> living in a post-Zionist reality... Few still approach Zionism as an ideology with any intellectual depth, because the Jewish people are by and large ready and thirsty for something new. In order to advance to the next stage, however, we need to shift away from our narrow Jewish nationalism in favor of a uniquely Hebrew universalism that reflects and expresses authentic Jewish values while being more inclusive to non-Jewish groups in our society. We need to dig deeper into the wealth of our ancient sources in order to arrive at policies and structures that will at the same time make our country more Jewish, democratic and inclusive of the 'other.' Hebrew universalism {{should not be confused with}} Western universalism but should actually be seen as an alternative to it... Advancing to the next stage of Jewish liberation doesn’t require that we shrink our nationalism or negate its achievements... Our nationalism needs to deepen and expand to the point that it explodes and spills over into universalism, transcending the either/or 'Arab versus Jew' paradigm and making the State of Israel, from river to sea, both the fulfillment of historic Jewish aspirations and a genuine light unto nations that will benefit and inspire all humankind." ...|$|E
