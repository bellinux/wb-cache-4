500|$|In Solow and Justman's book, {{there was}} also a {{reference}} to a [...] "rift" [...] between Whitney and Roddenberry that occurred just prior to her departure and was expected to ensure that she never returned to the series.

Whitney's departure was around the time when she was an alcoholic. In an interview in 1988, Whitney blamed her alcoholism and anorexia at the time for being released by the series.

500|$|Swift {{began writing}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] with the lyric [...] "And Abigail gave {{everything}} she had to a boy/ Who changed his mind/ We both cried", which eventually became the song's bridge, and continued writing everything else in a backwards manner. The song was written about Swift's freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, where she met her best friend Abigail Anderson. [...] "I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school because I felt in my freshman year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far", Swift stated. The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered of heartbreaks. Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished someone would have told her in a song <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>younger.</b> [...] "The thing about high school, you don't know anything.

In 2003, Victor and Sharon shared a kiss, causing issues in her marriage to Nicholas; she left town to [...] "find herself". Victor supported Sharon throughout her legal problems, and paid her bail at first when she was wrongly convicted of murder in 2011. Case stated that she thinks Sharon thinks of Victor [...] "in a way like a father figure, but not quite. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> she saw him as that, and then when she grew up she saw him less as a father {{and more like a}} hero", also stating that Victor is Sharon's [...] "security blanket". The dynamic of their relationship changed when Victor proposed a platonic marriage to Sharon in December 2011, and while they end up marrying, but it is annulled shortly after. However, months after the annulment, they begin a genuine romance. Joshua Morrow, who portrays Nicholas, told Soaps In Depth that he was [...] "always kind of surprised that Nick just accepted this from his dad", and that [...] "there were never any scenes showing legitimate anger". Braeden didn't agree with the pairing either, stating that, [...] "We all have gone through periods of playing something we didn't really like to play so much, but you do it." ...|$|E
