25|$|Tobares left Puerto Vallarta at 3 a.m., and at 8 a.m. {{he met a}} {{man named}} Rogelio ("Rocky"), an Argentine, in Guadalajara. After that he met with a Colombian {{national}} at a tobacco shop. Tobares was there until 12 p.m. and was seen exiting the store through the security cameras. He then phone called Verónica to explain <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to before disappearing. The family thinks that Gerardo set a trap for him. On June 10, a co-worker and friend of Tobares went to the Mexican police to report his disappearance. The report was made in both Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta. Tobares became the first Argentine to disappear in Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Hsu never {{appeared}} to want or expect anything {{in return for}} his many contributions, other than to appear in high-profile circles; indeed a West Coast Democratic fundraiser said, [...] "He seemed so desperate {{to be included in}} every big-ticket event in California … It was a little sad." [...] One Clinton campaign aide attempted to penetrate more deeply into Hsu's motives, remarking that Hsu's business activity [...] "was reinforced by his efforts in politics and philanthropy; he seemed like a generous guy, but only later did you realize <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to." ...|$|E
500|$|When Campbell's advance {{companies}} spotted Howe's {{line around}} 2:00 pm, {{the main body}} stopped short {{of the field and}} Campbell went to see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> against. [...] He viewed Howe's defenses as essentially sound, but a local slave told him that there was a path through the swamp on Howe's right. [...] Campbell ordered Sir James Baird to take 350 light infantry and 250 New York Loyalists and follow the slave through the swamp, while he arrayed his troops just out of view {{in a way that would}} give the impression he would attempt a flanking maneuver on Howe's left. [...] One of his officers climbed a tree to observe Baird's progress. [...] True to the slave's word, the trail came out near the Continental barracks, which had been left unguarded; the Continentals were unaware they had been flanked. [...] When they reached position, the man in the tree signaled by waving his hat, and Campbell ordered the regulars to charge.|$|E
6000|$|He {{lowered the}} glass and looked at her. [...] "Waving his hands about almost as if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> praying. I wonder <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to. Worshipping the sun? There weren't Parses {{in this country in}} his time, were there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No wonder Shadow feels sleepy, if {{he spends}} his nights on the river," [...] said Phil. [...] "But I can't make out <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to, I must confess. If it <b>was</b> some fun, <b>he</b> would surely take {{somebody}} with him." ...|$|R
50|$|As the Bennet ladies {{return to}} Longbourn, their {{carriage}} breaks down, but an army officer, Wickham, plays gallant rescuer. Amanda warns Wickham (who, in the novel, {{is set to}} run away with Lydia,) that she knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to, and <b>is</b> watching him.|$|R
500|$|Critic Bill Wyman {{acknowledges}} that Lydon's [...] "fierce intelligence and astonishing onstage charisma" [...] were important catalysts, but ultimately finds the band's real meaning lies in McLaren's provocative media manipulations. While {{some of the}} Sex Pistols' public affronts were plotted by McLaren, Westwood, and company, others were evidently not—including what McLaren himself cites as the [...] "pivotal moment that changed everything", the clash on the Bill Grundy Today show. [...] "Malcolm milked situations", says Cook, [...] "he didn't instigate them; that was always our own doing." [...] It is also hard to ascribe {{the effect of the}} Sex Pistols' early Manchester shows on that city's nascent punk scene to anyone other than the musicians themselves. Matlock later wrote that at the point when he left the band, it was beginning to occur to him that McLaren [...] "was in fact quite deliberately perpetrating that idea of us as his puppets.... However, on the other hand, I've since found out that even Malcolm wasn't as aware of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to as he has since made out." [...] By his absence, Matlock demonstrated how crucial he was to the band's creativity: in the eleven months between his departure and the Pistols' demise, they composed only two songs.|$|E
2500|$|Reznor {{collaborated with}} Ross to compose the score for David Fincher's The Social Network, a 2010 drama {{film about the}} {{founding}} of Facebook. Says Reznor, [...] "When I actually read the script and realized <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to, I said goodbye to that free time I had planned." [...] The score was noted for portraying [...] "Mark Zuckerberg the genius, developing a brilliant idea over ominous undertones," [...] and received nearly unanimous praise. The film's score was released in October 2010 in multiple formats, including digital download, compact disc, 5.1 surround on Blu-ray disc, and vinyl record. A 5-song sampler EP was released for free via digital download.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, Custer {{was more}} {{concerned}} with preventing the escape of the Lakota and Cheyenne than with fighting them. From his own observation, as reported by his bugler John Martin (Martini), Custer assumed the warriors had been sleeping in {{on the morning of}} the battle, to which virtually every native account attested later, giving Custer a false estimate of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> against. When he and his scouts first looked down on the village from the Crow's Nest across the Little Bighorn River, they could only see the herd of ponies. Looking from a hill [...] away after parting with Reno's command, Custer could observe only women preparing for the day, and young boys taking thousands of horses out to graze south of the village. Custer's Crow scouts told him it was the largest native village they had ever seen. When the scouts began changing back into their native dress right before the battle, Custer released them from his command. While the village was enormous in size, Custer thought there were far fewer warriors to defend the village. He assumed most of the warriors were still asleep in their tipis.|$|E
50|$|As he strolls aimlessly {{through the}} streets of Paris, he catches sight of Christian in a café with another woman. As they leave and jump on a bus François decides to follow them. A 15-year-old girl he has never met, Lucie (Anne-Laure Meury) figures out <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to and playfully joins in with his amateur espionage.|$|R
5000|$|PopMatters {{wrote that}} [...] "The album sounds great, and Mraz knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to. Less clear, I think, {{is whether the}} razzle-dazzle wordsmith who loves his Eminem records is ready to truly enter the {{marketplace}} as a serious vocalist and a sober songwriter", giving the album a positive rating of seven out of ten overall.|$|R
50|$|Mr. HaddenNigel Danvers' boss, {{and owner}} of The Hadden Corporation. Hadden is seen only briefly, but appears to {{influence}} Nigel’s movements throughout the adventure. He has an uncanny talent of knowing where Nigel <b>is,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to. Hadden <b>is</b> able to coerce Nigel into investigating ghostly phenomena and to make amends for Nigel’s theft of important Hadden Corporation documents.|$|R
2500|$|Layne {{had read}} of similar {{hypnotic}} cures by the Marquis de Puységur, {{a follower of}} Franz Mesmer, and was keen to explore {{the limits of the}} healing knowledge involved with the trance voice. He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as {{he had no idea what}} he was prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, [...] "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance." [...] Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the newspapers, which inspired many postal inquiries. Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room. Given only the person's name and [...] location, Cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed [...] "the entity," [...] and then provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, as [...] "one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer". His fiancée, Gertrude Evans, agreed with him. [...] Few people knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to. [...] There was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane, or at least that their health suffered. Cayce soon became famous, and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence.|$|E
60|$|I note {{without comment}} that it didn't even {{occur to me}} then to wake him up and ask him <b>what</b> <b>HE</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to with mankind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither do I, an' that's {{just why}} we're {{bound to be}} pretty careful. You see, if we could know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to, it would be different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But High Jack is {{too full}} of exaltation and cane-juice to reply.

50|$|In {{a reality}} where Xavier acquires the Crimson Gem rather than Cain, Cain joins forces with Magneto and Xavier's disillusioned students, the X-Men. Believing that Xavier's more {{ruthless}} methods contradict his alleged dream of peaceful co-existence {{and using a}} telepathy-blocking headband to prevent Xavier from realizing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to, they expel the Juggernaut into space. Cain leaves with Magneto after Xavier's Juggernaut is dispatched.|$|R
6000|$|Deering nodded. [...] "Stannard {{sent them}} back and pushed ahead with Gillane {{to look for a}} line down the other side. When we get across we'll see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> against." ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{he stepped}} to the windows and pulled down the shades. Then {{he took out his}} watch and looked at the time. I {{wondered}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to now. I was not long in finding out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind now," [...] cried Sammy, {{his voice}} rising above the confusion. [...] "I will {{tell you all about}} it. I see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to. He wanted to take {{possession}} of the pole in his own beastly name, most likely." ...|$|E
50|$|Having {{tried to}} contact her husband's hotel in Rome and being told that he has left, Mrs Evans goes to the police. At police HQ, she {{identifies}} Sartet {{as one of the}} men she saw on the plane while it was grounded in Paris. Told that his enemy has left the country, and guessing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to, Le Goff requests a cigarette, having given up smoking some time ago.|$|R
50|$|The game {{begins with}} Kirby napping on a cloud, when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> awakened as a Waddle Dee walks by, {{carrying}} a round pinball-like bumper. He then sees King Dedede, carrying a long bumper. Suspicious of the King's intentions, Kirby hops on a warp star and follows him, {{determined to find}} out <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to. Soon, Kirby discovers that Dream Land has lost its stars and sets off to get them back.|$|R
5000|$|Brody {{attempts}} {{to apologize to}} Jessica (Morena Baccarin) for his actions but Jessica demands an explanation. Brody {{says he wants to}} tell her, but he can't. Jessica gives him an ultimatum: tell her [...] "something true" [...] about <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> <b>up</b> to, or sleep somewhere else. Brody just walks away. Quinn's team is able to get a feed to the security cameras at the Ashford Hotel where Brody ends up staying.|$|R
6000|$|The {{intruder}} smiled tolerantly. He {{glanced around}} the room as though expecting to be asked to seat himself. No invitation of the sort, however, was accorded him. [...] "All's fair in love and politics, Lady Jane," [...] he declared. [...] "We Democrats have our programme, and our motto is that those who are not with us are against us. Mr. Tallente here knew pretty well <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> against." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few seconds}} {{brought me to}} Sergeant Drooce's hut. He was fast asleep, and being a heavy sleeper, I had to lay my hand upon him to rouse him. The instant I touched him he came rolling out of his hammock, and upon me like a tiger. And a tiger he was, except that he knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to, in his utmost heat, {{as well as any}} man.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was hopping along mighty fast when whom should I {{see just}} ahead of me on the path but Mr. Fox, {{standing}} with his head cocked over on one side as he always holds it when he's up to some mischief. I was in a terrible hurry, but it seemed safer to stop a bit till I'd found out <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to, and lucky it was that I did.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can {{honestly}} say {{that no one can}} bring anything up against me,' he answered. 'But I do blame myself for getting mixed up with that man Saunders. I'm afraid there's no doubt that he's a wrong 'un--and heaven only knows <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> <b>up</b> to--but for my own part I give you my solemn word of honour that I've done nothing, absolutely nothing, that I have the least reason to be ashamed of.' ...|$|R

50|$|When police {{discover}} that a mob hitman has moved in {{next door to}} the Robbersons, they want to find out <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to.

Hard-nosed, tough-as-nails Jake Stone (Jack Palance) and his young partner Tony Moore (David Barry Gray) are assigned to the stakeout, but now it's a question of whether Jake can last long enough to capture the bad guys. The Robbersons want to help and by doing so, they drive Jake crazy.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she went}} back and read a {{newspaper}} to Festing, who was carried down to the supply train next day and made comfortable in the caboose. Charnock talked to him carelessly until the couplings tightened and the locomotive began to snort, but his mouth was firm and his face set as {{he went back to}} his work. He knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> against, and there were difficulties he had not told Festing about.|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned to}} Amanda. [...] "Get {{back into the}} thing," [...] he said. [...] "We won't have these stinking beasts think we are afraid of the job. I've just made sure he won't have a profit by it if we smash up. That's all. I might have known <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to when he wanted the money beforehand." [...] He came to the doorway and with a {{magnificent}} gesture commanded the perplexed driver to turn the carriage.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I beg {{to observe}} that you are mistaken. Old Moss is as cunning a fox as ever lived; but I saw his game, and without my own good-will he might have whistled for me.

He enjoyed killing Rashawn because he felt that Rashawn had humiliated him because of the colour of Rashawn's skin.|$|R
60|$|In youth {{you tend}} to look rather {{frequently}} into a mirror, not at all necessarily from vanity. You say to yourself, 'What an interesting face; I wonder <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to?' Your elders do not look into the mirror so often. We know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has <b>been</b> <b>up</b> to. As yet there is unfortunately no science of reading other people's faces; I think a chair for this should be founded in St. Andrews.|$|R
