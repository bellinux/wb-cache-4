25|$|If an {{employer}} {{is said to}} have a high turnover rate relative to its competitors, it means that employees of that company have a shorter average tenure than those of other companies in the same industry. High turnover may be harmful to a company's productivity if skilled workers are often leaving and the <b>worker</b> <b>population</b> contains a high percentage of novices. Companies will often track turnover internally across departments, divisions, or other demographic groups, such as turnover of women versus men. Most companies allow managers to terminate employees at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all, even if the employee is in good standing. Additionally, companies track voluntary turnover more accurately by presenting parting employees with surveys, thus identifying specific reasons as to why they may be choosing to resign.|$|E

25|$|Scientific {{management}} {{may have}} exacerbated grievances among workers about oppressive or greedy management. It certainly strengthened developments that put workers at a disadvantage: {{the erosion of}} employment in developed economies via both offshoring and automation. Both were {{made possible by the}} deskilling of jobs, which was made possible by the knowledge transfer that scientific management achieved. Knowledge was transferred both to cheaper workers and from workers into tools. Jobs that once would have required craft work first transformed to semiskilled work, then unskilled. At this point the labor had been commoditized, and thus the competition between workers (and worker populations) moved closer to pure than it had been, depressing wages and job security. Jobs could be offshored (giving one human's tasks to others—which could be good for the new <b>worker</b> <b>population</b> but was bad for the old) or they could be rendered nonexistent through automation (giving a human's tasks to machines). Either way, the net result from the perspective of developed-economy workers was that jobs started to pay less, then disappear. The power of labor unions in the mid-twentieth century only led to a push on the part of management to accelerate the process of automation, hastening the onset of the later stages just described.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, the German yellowjacket (V. germanica) first {{appeared}} in Ohio, and has now become the dominant species over the eastern yellowjacket. It is bold and [...] aggressive, and can sting repeatedly and painfully. It will mark aggressors, and will pursue them. It is often confused with Polistes dominula, an invasive species in the United States, due to their very similar pattern. The German yellowjacket builds its nests in cavities—not necessarily underground—with the peak <b>worker</b> <b>population</b> in temperate areas between 1000 and 3000 individuals between May and August. Each colony produces several thousand new reproductives after this point through November. The eastern yellowjacket builds its nests underground, also with the peak <b>worker</b> <b>population</b> between 1000 and 3000 individuals, similar to the German yellowjacket. Nests are built entirely of wood fiber and are completely enclosed except for a small entrance at the bottom. The color of the paper is highly dependent on {{the source of the}} wood fibers used. The nests contain multiple, horizontal tiers of combs within. Larvae hang within the combs.|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} {{identified a}} novel insect picorna-like virus, termed Kakugo virus (KV), from {{the brains of}} aggressive worker honeybees that had counterattacked a giant hornet. To survey the prevalence of KV in <b>worker</b> <b>populations</b> engaged in various labors, we quantified KV genomic RNA. KV was detected specifically from aggressive workers in some colonies, while it was also detected from other <b>worker</b> <b>populations</b> in other colonies where the amount of KV detected in the workers was relatively high, suggesting that KV can infect various <b>worker</b> <b>populations</b> in the honeybee colonies. To investigate whether the KV strains detected were identical, phylogenetic analysis was performed. There {{was less than a}} 2 % difference in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences between KV strains from aggressive workers and those from other <b>worker</b> <b>populations,</b> suggesting that all of the viruses detected were virtually the same KV. We also found that some of the KV-infected colonies were parasitized by Varroa mites, and the sequences of the KV strains detected from the mites were the same as those detected from the workers of the same colonies, suggesting that the mites mediate KV prevalence in the honeybee colonies. KV strains had approximately 6 % and 15 % sequence differences in the RdRp region from deformed wing virus and Varroa destructor virus 1, respectively, suggesting that KV represents a viral strain closely related to, but distinct from, these two viruses...|$|R

In the Netherlands, when sex work is legalized, the legal benefits are largely accrued only by sex workers who have legal status or Dutch citizenship.
