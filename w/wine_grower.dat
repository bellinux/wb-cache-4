He says they are honest and industrious, and they are leaving him only because they are anxious for a change and, deeming that troubles were again approaching, wanted to enter the service of some Huguenot lord who would be likely to take the field. He was lamenting the fact to me, when I said that it seemed to me they were just the men I was in search of; and I accordingly saw them, and engaged them on the understanding that, {{at the end of a}} month, you should be free to discharge them if you were not satisfied with them; and that equally they could leave your service, if they did not find it suit.|$|E
