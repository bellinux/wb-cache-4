In early March 2007, she received a tube of wasabi in a Progress spacecraft resupply mission in response to her request for more spicy food. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> tube, which was packaged at one atmospheric pressure, the gel-like paste was forced out in the lower pressure of the ISS.

25|$|In the post-SummerSlam wedding reception, Roberts {{and his new}} ally, The Undertaker, {{made their}} {{presence}} known by hiding a live snake {{in one of the}} newly married couple's wedding presents; Elizabeth was frightened <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> gift box, and the Undertaker blindsided Savage by knocking him out with the urn. Sid Justice ran off both Roberts and The Undertaker. Savage, still unable to compete due to his WrestleMania VII loss to the Ultimate Warrior, immediately began a public campaign to have himself reinstated as an active wrestler to gain revenge on Roberts; however, WWF President Jack Tunney refused. Meanwhile, Roberts cut a series of promos berating Savage. The feud began to boil over during a television taping for WWF Superstars of Wrestling October 21 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, when Roberts cut an in-ring promo to goad Savage – who was providing TV commentary – into the ring. After he was lured into the ring, Roberts attacked Savage, eventually tying Savage into the ropes before getting a live king cobra to bite his arm, according to Hulk Hogan and Jake Roberts on the Pick Your Poison DVD that the snake was holding on with the fangs and that Jake had a hard time getting the snake off Randy. Sid Justice was originally supposed to be the victim of the snake bite, but due to a biceps injury, Savage accepted to be snake bitten.|$|E

500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 7 October 1965, shortly after Smith's call, Superintendent Bob Talbot of the Cheshire Police arrived at the back door of 16Wardle Brook Avenue, wearing a {{borrowed}} baker's overall to cover his uniform. Talbot identified himself to Hindley as a police officer <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door, and told her that he wanted to speak to her boyfriend. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was sitting up in a divan writing a note to his employer explaining {{that he would not be}} able to get into work because of his ankle injury. Talbot explained that he was investigating [...] "an act of violence involving guns" [...] that was reported to have taken place the previous evening. Hindley denied that there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house. When they came to the upstairs room in which Evans's body was stored the police found the door locked, and asked Brady for the key. Hindley claimed that the key was at work, but after the police offered to drive her to her employer's premises to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand the key over. When they returned to the living room, the police told Brady that they had discovered a trussed up body, and that he was being arrested on suspicion of murder.

500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud {{in front of the whole}} class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E
2500|$|Although Battle gave several {{critically}} praised {{performances at}} the Metropolitan Opera {{during the early}} 1990s, her relationship with the company's management showed increasing signs of strain during those years. As Battle's status grew, so did her reputation for being difficult and demanding. In October 1992 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> Boston Symphony Orchestra season, she reportedly banned an assistant conductor and other musicians from her rehearsals, changed hotels several times, and left behind what a report in The Boston Globe called [...] "a froth of ill will". In February 1994, during rehearsals for an upcoming production of La fille du régiment at the Metropolitan Opera, Battle {{was said to have}} subjected her fellow performers to [...] "withering criticism" [...] and made [...] "almost paranoid demands that they not look at her." [...] General Manager Joseph Volpe responded by dismissing Battle from the production for [...] "unprofessional actions" [...] during rehearsals. Volpe called Battle's conduct [...] "profoundly detrimental to the artistic collaboration among all the cast members" [...] and indicated that he had [...] "canceled all offers that have been made for the future." [...] Battle was replaced in La fille du régiment by Harolyn Blackwell. At the time of her termination from the Met, Michael Walsh of Time magazine reported that [...] "the cast of The Daughter of the Regiment applauded when it was told during rehearsal that Battle had been fired." [...] After she sang with the San Francisco Opera at this time, several backstage workers wore T-shirts that read: [...] "I survived the Battle".|$|E

2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{believed it}} had a strong case {{despite the lack of}} known witnesses to the crime and the failure to recover the murder weapon. Clark's case was supported by DNA evidence, and she expected a conviction. From the physical evidence that was collected, the prosecution claimed that Simpson drove to Nicole Brown's house on the evening of June 12 with the intention of killing her. They maintained that Brown had put their two children to bed and was {{getting ready to go to}} bed herself <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> front door of her house after either responding to a knock on the front door or hearing a noise outside. Simpson allegedly grabbed her before she could scream and attacked her with a knife. Forensic evidence from the Los Angeles County coroner alleged that Ron Goldman arrived at the front gate to the townhouse sometime during the assault, and the assailant apparently attacked him and stabbed him repeatedly in the neck and chest with one hand while restraining him with an arm choke-hold. Brown was found lying face down when authorities arrived at the crime scene. According to the prosecution's account, after Simpson had finished with Goldman, he pulled Brown's head back using her hair, put his foot on her back, and slit her throat with the knife, severing her carotid artery. They argued further that Simpson left a [...] "trail of blood" [...] from the condo to the alley behind it; there was also testimony that three drops of Simpson's blood were found on the driveway near the gate to his house on Rockingham Drive.|$|E
