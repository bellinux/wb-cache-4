40|$|Chocolate {{contains}} {{a wide range}} of antioxidants that includes soluble phenolic compounds (phenolic acids, catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidins), insoluble polymeric phenolics and methylxanthines. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine phenolic and theobromine contents in dark (DC), milk (MC), and <b>white</b> (WC) <b>chocolates</b> commonly found in the Malaysian marketplace. Total phenolic and flavonoids were determined by means of a spectrometric assay, while catechin, epicatechin and theobromine were quantified using a reverse-phase HPLC method. Dark chocolates exhibited the highest phenolics and flavonoids contents, followed by milk and <b>white</b> <b>chocolates.</b> Catechin and epicatechin were major flavonoids detected in dark chocolates. Theobromine was detected in dark and milk chocolates, but not in <b>white</b> <b>chocolates.</b> A high correlation (r= 0. 93) between total phenolic and flavonoid contents, indicating that the major phenolic compounds in dark chocolates belong to the flavonoid class. When nutrition and health promotion are of concern, dark chocolates would be recommended over milk and <b>white</b> <b>chocolates</b> owing to their higher contents of antioxidant phenolic compounds...|$|R
40|$|The present {{overview}} {{was intended}} to evaluate the degree of total aflatoxins and ochratoxin A contamination in different samples of bitter, dark, milk, and <b>white</b> <b>chocolates</b> marketed in Pakistan. For that exploration, two hundred (n= 200) samples of chocolates, 100 branded and 100 local, were analyzed for mycotoxins profile by HPLC-FLD. The outcomes firmly sustained {{that the majority of}} the samples were contaminated with aflatoxins and ochratoxin A. The incidence of total aflatoxins and ochratoxin A in branded samples was 83 % and 90 %, whereas the local samples showed 91 % and 97 % contamination, respectively. The highest amount of total aflatoxins was found in branded dark chocolates, that is, 2. 27 [*]μg/kg, and maximum ochratoxin A level was detected <b>white</b> <b>chocolates</b> (2. 06 [*]μg/kg). On average, the local <b>white</b> <b>chocolates</b> and dark chocolates faced the highest level of total aflatoxins (3. 35 [*]μg/kg) and ochratoxin A (3. 48 [*]μg/kg), respectively. The local samples of chocolates were more contaminated with mycotoxins as compared to branded ones accredited to the lack of quality control and quality assurance during the manufacturing as well as packing processes. In recent years, consumption of chocolate is rapidly increasing especially by young generation, so monitoring of mycotoxin occurrence in them is a matter of great concern and more studies are required to comprehend the production of mycotoxins in these products...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{microanalysis}} {{was used}} to compare the elemental composition of isolated cocoa solids with milk powder. Whereas mllk powder contained similar high levels of calcium and potassium, cocoa sol ids were rich in potassium but contained very small amounts of calcium. This difference in elemental composition allowed the two populations of particles to be distinguished in digital X-ray maps of frozen and fractured samples of plain, milk and <b>white</b> <b>chocolates</b> examined by cryo-scanning electron microscopy. The size distributions of particles imaged in this way were determined using standard software and were used to distinguish between two <b>white</b> <b>chocolates</b> whose particle reduction (refining) parameters during processing were different. This technique offers the possibility of studying P_article interactions during processing and the influence. of shape, size and spatial distribution of milk and cocoa solids on the rheology and mechanical properties of chocolate without destroying its normal structure...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a unique perspective}} to the milk market relative to previous studies. While there is rich literature on the various sectors of the milk market, a contribution to this literature was made by providing a specific econometric analysis of the Promised Land brand. Previous work conducted by Capps and Salin (2010) provided the foundation for this thesis. The purpose of this thesis was threefold: 1. Estimate household demand functions for Promised Land <b>white</b> and <b>chocolate</b> milk using Nielsen homescan data. The demand functions were estimated using a tobit model to estimate the conditional and unconditional own-price and cross-price effects of Promised Land <b>white</b> and <b>chocolate</b> milk. 2. Assess the impacts of household demographic drivers of demand for Promised Land <b>white</b> and <b>chocolate</b> milk. 3. Use the empirical results derived from the tobit model to identify substitutes and complements of Promised Land <b>white</b> and <b>chocolate</b> milk and provide a profile of households that purchase Promised Land <b>white</b> and <b>chocolate</b> milk. The study concluded that households who purchased Promised Land white were insensitive {{to changes in the}} price of Promised Land white milk. The price of private label milk was the only cross-price that was significant in the quantity of Promised Land white milk purchased. The estimated elasticities showed that Promised Land white milk and private label white milk were substitutes. From the estimated elasticities, it was found that households that purchased Promised Land chocolate milk were largely insensitive to changes in the price of Promised Land chocolate milk. It was also found that the prices of Nesquick, Oak Farms, and private label chocolate milk had a significant effect on the quantity of Promised Land chocolate milk purchased. Of these significant prices, private label and Oak Farms chocolate milk were substitutes for Promised Land chocolate milk. The price of Nesquick chocolate milk demonstrated a complementary relationship with Promised Land chocolate milk...|$|R

25|$|After fermentation, {{the beans}} are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, {{which are then}} ground to cocoa mass, {{unadulterated}} chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor also may be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugars. Much of the chocolate consumed today {{is in the form}} of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. <b>White</b> <b>chocolate</b> contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate {{is sold in}} {{chocolate}} bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and <b>white</b> <b>chocolate</b> varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins or crisped rice. Chocolate {{is used as a}}n ingredient in a huge variety of candy bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated {{in chocolate}}. Chocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M's) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts). Some non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate and chocolate milkshakes. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. Chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes.|$|E

[...] The blue-and-white palette was, according to Donwood, the result of [...] "trying to make something the color of bleached bone." [...] The image of two stick figures shaking hands appears in the booklet and on the compact disc itself. Yorke explained the image as emblematic of exploitation: [...] "Someone's being sold something they don't really want, and someone's being friendly because they're trying to sell something. That's what it means to me." [...] Explaining the artwork's themes, Yorke said, [...] "It's quite sad, and quite funny as well. All the artwork and so on...
