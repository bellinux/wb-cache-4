5|$|The Wii console {{connects to}} the Internet through its {{built-in}} 802.11b/g Wi-Fi or through a USB-to-Ethernet adapter; either method allows players to access the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. The service has several features for the console, including the Virtual Console, WiiConnect24, Internet Channel, Forecast Channel, Everybody Votes Channel, News Channel and the Check Mii Out Channel. The Wii can also communicate (and connect) with other Wii systems through a self-generated <b>wireless</b> <b>LAN,</b> enabling local wireless multi-playing on different television sets.

30|$|One major {{difference}} between 3 G cellular networks and <b>Wireless</b> <b>LANs</b> is in how packet losses are dealt with. 3 G cellular networks employ selective repeat ARQ (SR-ARQ) which may result in packet-reordering due to local retransmissions. <b>Wireless</b> <b>LANs</b> employ stop-and-wait ARQ which may drop some packets in case the buffer overflows. While much work has been performed for TCP throughput enhancement with vertical handover between wired networks and wireless networks, little {{attention is paid to}} the vertical handover between two different wireless networks. It is expected for majority of new mobile devices to be able to connect to both 3 G cellular networks and <b>wireless</b> <b>LANs</b> by being equipped with multiple wireless interfaces. If this is the case, on-going TCP transmission may move between 3 G cellular networks and <b>wireless</b> <b>LANs.</b> In this paper, we propose a scheme to improve TCP throughput with vertical handoff between 3 G cellular networks and <b>wireless</b> <b>LANs.</b> For this we develop an algorithm which differentiates packet-reordering from packet losses and congestion losses from wireless losses. Simulation of our algorithm using ns- 2 shows significant increase in throughput as large as 80 % compared to TCP-SACK. The proposed scheme is able to respond to the change of loss pattern and then improve the TCP throughput during handover.|$|R

25|$|The ISS is {{equipped}} with approximately 100 IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad model A31 and T61P laptop computers. Each computer is a commercial off-the-shelf purchase which is then modified for safety and operation including updates to connectors, cooling and power to accommodate the station's 28V DC power system and weightless environment. Heat generated by the laptops does not rise but stagnates around the laptop, so additional forced ventilation is required. Laptops aboard the ISS {{are connected to the}} station's <b>wireless</b> <b>LAN</b> via Wi-Fi and to the ground via Ku band. This provides speeds of 10Mbit/s to and 3Mbit/s from the station, comparable to home DSL connection speeds.|$|E
25|$|All DT3 {{units are}} {{equipped}} with passenger intercom panels near every door {{in addition to the}} standard emergency brakes and emergency door release handles. Controllers can access CCTV cameras in every unit from the control centre through a <b>Wireless</b> <b>LAN</b> link installed in all tunnels that are used by DT3 trains. Flame-retardant materials are used wherever possible. Temperature sensors and smoke detectors are spread throughout every unit in the passenger space and in every underfloor machinery compartment to detect possible fires as early as possible. Circuit integrity retaining electrical cables (cables that can keep their insulation for a certain time in the presence of fire) are used to allow a unit to proceed to the next station in case of a fire. German regulations mandate that all subway trains must not stop inside a tunnel after the emergency brake has been pulled or if any other hazard like a fire is detected, but instead should proceed to the next station if possible to ease rescue operations. Since the longest travel time between two stations on the Nuremberg U-Bahn is about 3 Minutes (between Ziegelstein and Flughafen) and most stations are less than 60 seconds apart, this is deemed a superior option to stopping inside a tunnel, where evacuation, rescue and firefighting attempts would be much more difficult than on a station platform.|$|E
