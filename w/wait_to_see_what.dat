5|$|The ICJ's {{decision}} is final and {{not subject to}} appeal. Nevertheless, in June 2008 Rais Yatim stated that Malaysia had renewed its search for the letter written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking permission to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca. He noted that {{the rules of the}} ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced. In response, Singapore's Law Minister K. Shanmugam said that the city-state would <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> new evidence the Malaysian government could come up with.|$|E
25|$|Bridges {{continued}} {{opposing the}} Roosevelt Administration, belittling the New Deal and urging union voters to withhold their support from Roosevelt. He said they should <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> Lewis, who had now also split with the Roosevelt administration, recommended. That position proved highly unpopular with the membership; many locals had already endorsed FDR {{for a third}} term and several locals passed motions calling for Bridges to resign. He refused, noting that the union's constitution allowed for a recall election if fifteen percent of the membership petitioned for one. The ILWU executive board gave him a vote of confidence.|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole, {{who plays}} junior FBI agent Astrid Farnsworth, {{described}} the episode in a May 2009 interview, [...] "It's about spontaneously combusting. This is the episode I get {{to get out}} of the lab. I remember thinking I can't <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the set's going to look like and how they will make it look when the spontaneous combusting takes place. And we get there and it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. I thought that was so funny because I thought there were going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads you into the coolest parts of the finale episode." ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{critics have}} judged Mega Man 3 to be {{excessively}} difficult. GamePro contributor McKinley Noble comically stated that actions such as [...] "pulling teeth, lifting a car {{over your head}} or performing open-heart surgery" [...] are all significantly easier than beating Mega Man 3. Whitehead noted, [...] "Leaps must be precise, enemies must be dispatched rapidly and accurately, and there's {{a constant state of}} delicious near-panic as you <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> vicious demands the next room will place on your platforming skills." [...] The Lessers additionally saw considerable flicker when too many sprites appear onscreen at once. The writers mentioned that it detracted from the normally crisp graphics the few times it was noticed.|$|E
500|$|In March 1948 Horne {{appeared}} with Murdoch in six episodes of the BBC Television comedy series Kaleidoscope. In June that year he and Murdoch again appeared {{on television in}} a one-off sitcom, At Home, which they wrote. The following year Horne began his connection with Twenty Questions, an association that lasted, on-and-off, for 20 years. By the fourth series of Much-Binding in 1950, the listener figures had declined to a level that concerned the BBC and they decided against a fifth series. Rather than <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> other offers of work would {{come in from the}} Corporation, Horne and Murdoch signed the comedy to a 35-programme series on Radio Luxembourg between October 1950 and June 1951. The programme was poorly received on the commercial channel: Murdoch observed that [...] "it wasn't really a great success—even my mother said it was rotten, and she was my greatest fan". After one series, the show returned to the BBC in 1951–52, although renamed as Over to You. Murdoch and Horne again appeared together, in April 1952, on Desert Island Discs.|$|E
500|$|Overall, [...] "House's Head" [...] {{was very}} well {{received}} by critics. [...] Sara Morrison, from Television Without Pity, called the moment that House gets back his memory [...] "the best ten minutes of television you might ever see". She was also pleased with the hypnotism scene, because it gave Chase [...] "something to do". Morrison graded the episode with an A+. Michelle Romero, of Entertainment Weekly, said that she can watch [...] "House's Head" [...] twice and get as much out of the second viewing as the first. TV Guides Gina Dinunno stated: [...] "It's everything I imagined: brilliant, snarky, confusing; even dirty! They did an amazing job at leaving us with the cliffhanger of all cliffhangers as we <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> will happen to Amber". Alan Sepinwall, from The Star-Ledger, compared the episode to the House season two finale [...] "No Reason". He, however, {{also said that the}} episode had [...] "several issues", mainly the hints towards [...] "the answer" [...] being Amber. On this, Sepinwall commented [...] "House is, at heart, a mystery, and when the show telegraphs the solution, it isn't half as entertaining".|$|E

500|$|... "Vitamin D" [...] was {{nominated}} for the best [...] "Comedy Series Episode" [...] award at the 2010 PRISM Awards. It received generally positive reviews from critics. Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times noted that she preferred the boys' performance to the girls', commenting: [...] "Their number had the same heart-soaring power as [...] "Don't Stop Believin'" [...]" [...] Malcom enjoyed Sue's character development in the episode, claiming that, [...] "In less skilled hands, there’s no doubt Sue would be an over-the-top disaster. But thanks to the incomparable Jane Lynch, I can’t <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> trouble the character stirs up next." [...] Aly Semigran of MTV also enjoyed the boys' performance more than the girls', and gave the episode a mostly positive review, writing that it moved the series' storylines to [...] "a whole new level". She felt, however, that the episode [...] "didn't have nearly enough singing". Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly similarly noted that: [...] "So much happened in this hour that the musical numbers, though enjoyable, were almost an afterthought." [...] Bierly favoured the girls' performance, and praised Morrison's acting, commenting: [...] "Matthew Morrison communicates so much with his eyes. There’s a softness and a longing in them that I’m always surprised Emma (Jayma Mays) matches." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with multiple}} critics lauding {{the performances of}} actors Anna Torv and John Noble. In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker wrote this his [...] "mind was blown not once, but twice" [...] due to the many revelations about two universes; Fringe [...] "has vaulted to {{the upper reaches of}} current television". In a second review, Tucker praised the [...] "beautifully, startlingly executed" [...] special effects when the [...] "hole" [...] in the universe closed. Writing for The A.V. Club, critic Zach Handlen gave the episode an A, and felt the episode made him {{want to go back and}} rewatch season one because the finale had [...] "so many references and back story nods that I wanted to have everything in my head together". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought the finale [...] "leads to a wealth of possibilities... The déjà universe was a bold move. I can’t <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> our friends at Fringe do with it". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, critic Maureen Ryan heaped praise on the [...] "excellent" [...] episode, and complimented [...] "the quietly creepy atmosphere, the slowly building tension in the dual Walter/Olivia stories, the way those stories were skillfully woven together, the suitably tense lakeside encounter between Olivia, Peter and Mr. Jones".|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today {{said that}} [...] "a great season of Lost {{ended with a}} {{suitably}} great finale, which … ended with the … whoa-inducing discovery that Locke was {{the man in the}} casket. [...] Didn't see that coming—and I can't <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> this terrific TV series has coming next." [...] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "the episode was dynamic and busy enough as it relied heavily on action-adventure… but the finale wasn't as mind-bending as [...] season's farewell, during which we received the show's first flash-forward." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the triple-length [...] "There's No Place Like Home", but ranked {{it in the middle of}} his list of the season's episodes from best to worst and decided that [...] "'There's No Place Like Home" [...] (both parts) played fair with the audience 100 percent, answered [...] questions … and yet … I feel ever so slightly disappointed by all of this." [...] He also found the special effects [...] "looked much shoddier than usual" [...] and praised the score. [...] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press thought that [...] "it might be the most rewarding, deliciously challenging episode in the history of this mystical ABC serial." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal wrote that [...] "Part 2" [...] "was perhaps the most action-packed, meaningful episode of television I've watched all year. [...] The pace was excellent, and the revelations were plentiful." [...] Compora also wrote that [...] "though the pace was considerably slower, the finale delivered in a big way … it was [...] well written and well directed in its own right." ...|$|E

Between 2009 and 2010 she was reporter of Angela Griffin's show Angela and Friends. In January 2013 {{it was announced}} Melanie Blatt would join Daniel Bedingfield, Stan Walker and Ruby Frost as a judge/mentor on the New Zealand version of The X Factor: [...] "I can't <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> kind of artists and voices {{we are going to}} find in New Zealand." [...] Blatt will be mentoring the Groups category. It was reported that she and her daughter Lilyella will live in the country {{for the duration of the}} series.

2500|$|In February 2011, Lynsey became {{attracted}} to widower Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) {{and they began}} a short relationship. After Gilly became a personal trainer at Look Sharpe, a local day spa, he invited Lynsey to come along for a free session. Quinlan told Inside Soap journalist, Steven Murphy, that Lynsey is [...] "looking pretty good when she turns up" [...] and she would eventually end up [...] "hopping into the tub and dragging Gilly in there fully clothed!" [...] Hassan said that she found the scene in which Lynsey pulled Gilly into the hot tub [...] "embarrassing", despite knowing Quinlan well. She added that the scenes were not romantic to film due to the water being cold. Lynsey and Gilly later arranged a date together, which prompted Gilly to remove his wedding ring. Quinlan thought that Gilly's decision was a [...] "bit harsh" [...] {{because it was too}} soon for him to consider moving on from his wife, Steph (Carley Stenson). The actor stated that viewers would have to <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> would happen between Lynsey and Gilly, but believed that there was no comparison when it came to her and Steph.|$|E
2500|$|Law {{professor}} and blogger Ann Althouse rejected the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day idea because [...] "depictions of Muhammad offend millions of Muslims who are {{no part of}} the violent threats." [...] James Taranto, writing in the [...] "Best of the Web Today" [...] column at The Wall Street Journal, also objected to the idea, not only because depicting Mohammed [...] "is inconsiderate of the sensibilities of others", but also because [...] "it defines those others—Muslims—as being outside of our culture, unworthy of the courtesy we readily accord to insiders." [...] Bill Walsh of Bedford Minuteman wrote critically of the initiative, which seemed [...] "petulant and childish" [...] to him: [...] "It attempts to battle religious zealotry with rudeness and sacrilege, and we can only <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens, but I fear it won’t be good." [...] Janet Albrechtsen wrote in The Australian, [...] "As a cartoon, it was mildly amusing. As a campaign, it's crass and gratuitously offensive." [...] Writing for New York University's Center for Religion and Media publication, The Revealer, Jeremy F. Walton called the event a [...] "blasphemous faux holiday", which would [...] "only serve to reinforce broader American misunderstandings of Islam and Muslims".|$|E

2500|$|Eggleston {{taught at}} Harvard in 1973 and 1974, {{and it was}} during these years that he {{discovered}} dye-transfer printing; he was examining the price list of a photographic lab in Chicago when he read about the process. As Eggleston later recalled: [...] "It advertised 'from the cheapest to the ultimate print.' The ultimate print was a dye-transfer. I went straight up there to look and everything I saw was commercial work like pictures of cigarette packs or perfume bottles but the colour saturation {{and the quality of}} the ink was overwhelming. I couldn't <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> a plain Eggleston picture would look like with the same process. Every photograph I subsequently printed with the process seemed fantastic and each one seemed better than the previous one." [...] The dye-transfer process resulted in some of Eggleston's most striking and famous work, such as his 1973 photograph entitled The Red Ceiling, of which Eggleston said, [...] "The Red Ceiling is so powerful, that in fact I've never seen it reproduced on the page to my satisfaction. When you look at the dye it is like red blood that's wet on the wall.... A little red is usually enough, but to work with an entire red surface was a challenge." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{reporter}} from the Sunday Mercury said [...] "What {{do we think}} might happen to a car overloaded with teenagers? It crashes, of course, and Sophie is badly injured." [...] Carena Crawford from All About Soap commented [...] "Wow, Neighbours {{was more than a}} little bit dramatic today with the big car crash putting Sophie's life in danger – will she survive?" [...] The writer went on to say that the accident would have [...] "far-reaching consequences for everybody" [...] and tried to work out who was to blame, before adding [...] "Whoever's fault it is, we can't <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens next!" [...] A reporter for the TVTimes stated [...] "With more road accidents in this patch of Oz than anywhere else in the world, Sophie is asking for trouble when she piles into Chris's car, which is already overloaded with teenagers thanks to Andrew egging him on." [...] Dianne Butler, writing for news.com.au, thought the police did [...] "a half-baked investigation into the car crash", enabling Paul to sue Chris. The storyline was included in the Inside Soap Yearbook 2013 as one of [...] "The best bits of September". It was also named [...] "Crash of the month". The crash was nominated for Best Storyline in Digital Spy's end of year reader poll for 2012, it received 5.5% of the vote.|$|E
