50|$|Object 703 was {{developed}} in late 1944 by ChTZ (in Chelyabinsk) and left the factory shop in May 1945. This tank had an improved armour layout, and a semi-hemispherical cast turret (resembling an upturned soup bowl) which became the hallmark of post-war Soviet tanks. While this low, hemispherical turret improved protection, it also significantly diminished the headroom, especially for the loader. The low turret also limited the maximum depression of the main gun, since the gun breech had little room inside the turret to elevate, and this limited {{the extent to which}} the IS-3 could take advantage of hull-down positions compared to higher Western tanks. The IS-3's pointed prow earned it the nickname Shchuka (Pike) by its crews. It weighed slightly less and stood 30 cm lower than previous versions. Wartime production resulted in many mechanical problems and a hull <b>weldline</b> that had a tendency to crack open.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{injection}} molding of thermoplastic composite materials {{has become an}} important process in industry, due {{to the possibility of}} producing near shape article having exceptional physical and mechanical properties. However there are still some problems that confound the overall success of this technology. The forming of weldlines wherever polymer flow fronts meet is one of them. In this report, an L’ 18 experimental matrix design based on the Taguchi method was conducted to study the effect of different processing parameters on the <b>weldline</b> strength of injection-molded thermoplastic composites. Experiments were carried out on a 4. 1 oz reciprocating {{injection molding}} machine. The materials used were acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene, and 20 and 30 % glass-fiber-filled ABS composites. A plate cavity with an obstacle in the center was used to create a <b>weldline.</b> After molding, the <b>weldline</b> strength of the composites was determined by a tensile tester. Various processing variables were studied in terms of their influence on the <b>weldline</b> strength of injection-molded composites: melt temperature, mold temperature, melt filling speed, melt filling pressure, packing pressure, and size of the obstacle. For the factors selected in the experiments, size of obstacle and melt temperature were found to be the important parameters affecting the <b>weldline</b> strengths of injection-molded composites. The <b>weldline</b> strength of virgin material increased with the distance from the obstacle, while the <b>weldline</b> strength of composites decreased with the distance.

A typical Reynolds number past the obstacle is about 10 − 5. The flow of the anisotropic solution perturbed by the obstacle shows specific phenomena: distorted downstream streamlines, a very long wake behind the obstacle during shear which persists {{a long time after}} the ceasing shear, a change in the behaviour at very high shear rates and in particular, the appearance of a wake in front of the obstacle. To date there has not been any theoretical bases with which to explain these new findings.

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades {{explicit}} finite element crashworthiness codes have become an indispensable tool for the design of crash and passenger safety systems. These codes have proven remarkably reliable for the prediction of ductile metal structures that deform plastically; however, they are not reliable for joining systems and materials such as high strength steels, plastics and low ductility lightweight materials all of which are liable to fracture during the crash event. In order to improve crash failure prediction of materials and joining systems the CEC has recently funded a 3 year European research project dedicated to this topic. Specifically the project concerned aluminium, magnesium, high strength steels, plastics and two primary joining techniques; namely spotwelds and <b>weldlines.</b> Numerous new developments were undertaken including improved failure laws, adaptive meshing and element splitting to treat crack propagation. In the case of sheet stamping, investigations have also tried to account for process history effects and the metallurgical changes that occur during manufacture.

40|$|Vibration welding of {{wood that}} has been {{preheated}} according to an industrial two-step process indicates that such wood can be welded and can yield welded joints of good strength. The joint strength is, however, markedly lower than obtained when welding non-heat-treated timber. In general, weld strength of the timber is poor if welding is done on hydrothermolyzed wood. The strength results are instead much better if welding is done {{at the end of}} the complete heat treatment process, i. e., after the dry heat step. The weld lines of heat-treated wood show entangled cells where there is none or very little of the molten matrix intercellular material usually observed in welded timber. Furthermore, in <b>weldlines</b> obtained after hydrothermolysis an increase in rigidity and brittleness of the wood cells is observed. Hence, the wood cells are not entangled at all or very little. Both observations indicate that heat treatment has affected the main melting region of the wood, namely the intercellular material.

40|$|A {{change in}} linear welding conditions, namely higher {{vibration}} frequency (150 Hz) and lower displacement (2 mm) during welding, produced a quicker rise in {{temperature of the}} <b>weldline.</b> This allowed a much shorter welding time (1. 5 s). X-ray microdensitometry mapping showed a progressive increase in broadening and average density of the <b>weldline</b> as the welding time lengthens. As the welding time lengthens the maximum temperature reached {{at the end of}} welding is progressively higher. This causes increasingly greater degradation. This effect was confirmed also by CP-MAS 13 C NMR and {{it was found that the}} lower is the degree of deterioration of the <b>weldline</b> of the wood joint the shorter is the welding time. Monitoring of the temperature of the <b>weldline</b> showed that the temperature reached in wood joints during welding was inversely correlated to its water resistance. Furthermore, the increase in <b>weldline</b> temperature is markedly quicker at a vibration frequency of 150 Hz than at 100 Hz. Thus, the shorter is the welding time the lower is the degree of deterioration of the <b>weldline</b> of the wood joint. This appears to be due to welding occuring when water vapour is still present in the joint, hence providing a less damaging welding environment...|$|E
40|$|A Masters Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The NEWTON project intends to replace the existing ceramic hermetic packaging by a novel non-hermetic polymer packaging for high power semiconductors (thyristors). Polymer electrical packaging material candidates have been identified by reverse engineering, by literature review and by using Cambridge Engineering Selector (CES) software. The potential materials identified are polyimide (PI), polyetherimide (PEl), liquid crystal polymers (LCP), poly (phenylene sulphide) (PPS), and epoxy (EP). In addition, two design options (ceramic replacement and over moulded) were selected, out of four, based on all the known issues and the requirements. PEl, PI, LCP, PPS and EP were the selected materials for the ceramic replacement design option and PEl, PI and EP for the over-mould design option. Ceramic replacement option was ranked as the best choice {{on the basis of}} the device stability during injection moulding. After a data survey of different producers, a few specific grades for candidate materials were selected. Polymer packaging has to overcome certain identified issues such as non-hermeticity (moisture absorption and transmission), high thermal expansion, voids and micro-voids, <b>weldlines,</b> stress, aging etc., which could be the potential reasons for the device failure. Coatings could also be a good solution to avoid failure due to nonhermeticity. Electrical degradation and breakdown in polymers was facilitated by moisture absorption and transmission, ionic impurities, ionizing radiations, oxidation, poorly dispersed antioxidants, micro-structure defects, aging and low tensile strength etc. A computer generated component model, designed on the ceramic replacement option, was analysed through Moldflow software. The wall shear stress values were compared with the recommended values. The thickness of the model was increased until the wall shear stress values reached just near the recommended values for all the analysed materials. Hence, two models A and 8 were selected for further in depth analysis using pin point tunnel gates. Moldflow results were compared for both models (A and B) and for all the materials. This showed that the PI material and the model A were the best choices. Finally, the candidate materials were quantitatively compared based by reverse engineering, CES materials selection, literature review, electrical degradation, nonhermeticity and Moldflow results. The PI material was the final choice, followed by PEl, PPS, and LCP. Injection moulding was identified as the best processing method. The package quality had to be improved by combined approach of part design, MoldFiow simulation, mould design and controlled processing (plasticising, filling, cooling etc.). Therefore, after 1 the selection of the model 'A', it was further optimised by reducing the fin sizes. This new model was named as 'C' and was further analysed using a disc gate. The parameters and the dimensions of the sprue and the disc gate were selected and optimised based on the Moldflow results. A cooling process phase was designed based on the documented cooling principles. The Moldflow results showed that the designed cooling system was efficient and sufficient. Finally, based on the Moldflow results using a disc gate, a mould has been designed for the polyimide material and the model 'C'...|$|R

The presence of weldlines in rubber products is regarded as a one of the most undesirable phenomena, since it may result in poor mechanical properties as well as unsightly appearances.

The difference in maximum tensile strength between <b>weldline</b> and non-weldline specimens becomes more pronounced with the high loading of SiO 2 and CB.

This paper deals with <b>weldline</b> strength of injection molded polypropylene containing spherical and irregularly shaped fillers (glass spheres, calcium carbonate), or reinforcements such as glass flakes and fibers, talc, and mica. Two types of <b>weldline</b> will be considered: weldlines formed when two melt streams meet head-on and those formed {{as a result of}} flow around an insert.

The problem is generally solved using numerical techniques and realistic rheological models for quantitative analysis. Usually a good process simulation will predict the final shape of the product and the location of different defects. One of the major defects in the injection molding process is the formation of weldlines that lead to surface imperfections and weak spots in the part.

Microfriction stir welding does show potential for welding continuously wooden plates without any limitation on length of wood pieces. The strength of the weld obtained was low due to the limited depth of the <b>weldline.</b> Optimisation of parameters is necessary. A drawback at present appears to be the limited thickness of the wooden pieces that can be welded. X-ray microdensitometry, scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy showed that the main difference compared to the other techniques is that in the microfriction stir weld, there is a veritable welded line of molten material.

40|$|AbstractFor a {{friction}} stir welded aluminum plate {{the resistance}} to ductile failure is studied by analyzing tensile test specimens cut out across the <b>weldline.</b> As the stress triaxiality is rather low in these tests, the Gurson material model {{is not expected to}} give a very accurate description of the void growth to coalescence. A recently proposed modified version of the Gurson model is used, in which an extra term in the damage evolution law allows for the prediction of failure even at zero or negative values of the mean stress. This modification of the Gurson model is purely phenomenological, such that the damage parameter does not really represent the void volume fraction. Various amounts of the additional damage evolution are compared with predictions of the original Gurson model. The analyses are carried out for different yield stress profiles transverse to the weld and for different specimen widths. It is found that the modification does provide additional damage development in the friction stir weld, which may help to fit experimental data. But the suggested modification depends strongly on the overall stress state, and may have a too strong effect in some cases where the stress triaxiality is rather high...|$|E

40|$|The thermal field {{induced by}} arc welding {{has been the}} subject of {{numerous}} experimental, analytical and numerical studies in the past. However, few studies have focused on the effects of the local geometry and pipeline welding procedure on the transient thermal field at or near the vicinity of the <b>weldline.</b> The local geometry and welding procedures are often simplified in computational or analytical studies and normally disregarded in quantitative assessments. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the significance of these effects in order to understand their possible influence on the weld quality, pipeline integrity and weldability. In this thesis, simplified analytical models are developed, compared against outcomes from previous investigations, and validated with data obtained from a full-scale experimental study completed by the candidate. The conducted research indicates that the effects of the weld preparatory geometry (which is within the industry acceptable variations) and pipeline welding procedures might have a significant impact on the thermal history, specifically at low heat inputs and no preheats, which are characteristic for pipeline girth welding. Therefore, the account of these effects is very important for the adequate evaluation of the weld quality and, potentially, the pipe integrity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a calculation methodology for failure analyses of jointing {{systems such as}} weldlines submitted to dynamic crash loading. The numerical analysis of automotive welded component integrity requires {{to take account of}} the complex multi-physical phenomena involved during the manufacturing process in order to provide a better understanding of its in-service behaviour. Indeed, weldlines are one of the main jointing element within aluminium structures due to the robust process technology and to good durability and crashworthiness results. The assessment of <b>weldline</b> properties is still a problem, especially in complex crash loading, where weldlines are one of the main items of full car crash behaviour prediction. This is the motivation for an investigation on a methodology combining both welding process and crash simulations. We first present the calculation methodology, based on local/global approach, taking account of the physical phenomena involved during welding, computed locally, to predict the global crack initiation of automotive components and the way it propagates. The theoretical models used for the simulation of the interactions between heat transfer, metallurgy and mechanics as well as the micro-mechanical damage model used for failure are then briefly recalled before describing the way {{to take into account the}} metallurgical transformations and the induced plasticity due to welding process during crash calculation.

40|$|URL] {{advances}} in computer vision and arc-welding technology motivate rethinking of some postulates and conventions {{incorporated in the}} existing robot off-line programming methods. This reserch addresses relaxing of the downhand-position assumption, which became a de-facto standard in robotic welding and requires the weld joint to be oriented in such way that the <b>weldline</b> is horizontal and the weld normal vector is directed strictly opposite to gravity. In contrast to the standard techniques, the developed method explicitly assumes that a weld may be processed in the out-of-position location, which differs from the downhand one within given tolerances. But, to ensure the prescribed quality, the corresponding downhand deviation is charged by reduction of the welding speed {{in order to satisfy}} the quality specifications. For such settings, it is proposed a novel method for the cluster-level welding operations planning for a robotic cell with a positioning table. The objective is to minimise the overall manufacturing time, by finding a reasonable trade-off between the positioner motion times and the cluster processing times, since ensuring the downhand orientation for each cluster reduces the cluster processing time but requires more time for the re-configuration of the positioner. It is shown, that associated optimisation problem may be presented as a specific case of the generalised traveling salesman problem, for which has been developed an efficient heuristic algorithm that produces both the optimal welding cluster sequence and corresponding optimal motions of the positioner. The algorithm effectiveness was verified for a number of randomly generated problems, which results are reported and analysed in detail.

40|$|Solid state Friction stir welding (FSW) is {{of major}} {{interest}} in the welding of aluminium since it improves the joint properties. Many applications where Al-alloys are used are subject to varying load conditions, making fatigue failure a critical issue. In {{the scope of this}} thesis, the fatigue performance of friction stir welded AlMgSi-alloy 6082 has been investigated. Static and dynamic properties of different joint configurations and welds produced with varying process parameters have been determined. Microstructures of fractured surfaces have been studied to evaluate the effect of weld discontinuities on fatigue. The mechanical strength of the friction stir welds was set in relation to that of conventional fusion welds, and that of other FS welded Al-alloys. The friction stir process produced aluminium butt welds with high and consistent fatigue strengths, which exceeded the strengths of similar fusion welded samples. A smooth weld geometry showed to be of great importance for the fatigue performance, favouring the friction stir welds. Welding speed in a tested range of 0. 35 - 1. 4 m/min had only a modest influence on the properties of the friction stir welds; properties were not deteriorating at the highest speed. The softening of the alloy around the <b>weldline</b> was modelled. A fair description of the hardness profiles across the weld was obtained. At a low and high welding speed a full and partial softening respectively was predicted, indicating that full softening is not required to obtain a flawless weld. In case of friction stir overlap welds, tool design is even more important than in butt welding to secure weld quality. A broad tool shoulder with a concave pin end gave the best performance. In particular, the minimal influence on the sheet interface when welding with such a tool was beneficial for the fatigue strength. The stress distribution in overlap and T-type test specimens has been modelled. The stress intensity factors were determined. The corresponding crack propagation rates were in fair accordance with the experimental results. It was found that a simplified approach, developed to estimate ∆K for overlap spot welds, could be used also for friction stir overlap joints. QC 2010100...|$|E
40|$|Compared to {{thermoset}} composites, thermoplastic composites {{are drawing}} {{more and more}} attention by aircraft industries not only due to their excellent material properties but also due to their potentials to reduce cycle time and structure cost by using low-cost manufacturing technologies such as welding. Resistance welding has been {{regarded as one of}} the most promising welding techniques owing to the low energy consumption, simplicity of welding operation and capability for scaling up. Previous researches on resistance welding of thermoplastic composites are mainly focused on understanding the welding mechanisms and characterizing the welding qualities. The research work was aimed to gain deeper knowledge of resistance welding, in both micro-level and macro-level. In micro-level study, the specific properties that influence the welding quality were discussed, such as the surface properties of adherends, the weld line properties and the welding induced voids. In macro-level study, the emphasis was put on improving the current welding process, for both static resistance welding and continuous resistance welding. Micro-level study: 1. Resistance welding of woven fabric reinforced thermoplastic composites was investigated. Both the type of the majority fibres (warp yarns or weft yarns) and the apparent orientation of the majority fibres on the adherend surface were found to influence the failure mode and lap shear strength. Fibre sizing was found to be crucial for a good fibre-matrix adhesion, and therefore it was crucial for a good weld. 2. Other than fibre de-compaction, the residual volatiles inside the adherends was found to be a main cause of the voids in the joints for a welding process performed under a moderate welding pressure. Non-uniform void distribution was observed inside the joints, with void concentrations near the middle of weld overlap. The voids could be reduced by using pre-dried adherends or using a higher welding pressure. 3. A thinner <b>weldline,</b> usually obtained by using a thinner heating element, was found to be preferable to a thicker one. The relatively weaker welding quality near the edges of the joints was found to be a limitation of weld performance, but this could be improved by tailoring heat generation at the weld overlap or creating resin fillets near the edges. Micro-level study: 1. The possibility of using displacement measurement data for process monitoring and processing window definition was investigated, and it showed ability to detect voids generation and resin squeeze flow during welding and to construct processing windows. 2. The process of continuous resistance welding was analysed, and a model was developed to simulate the heat generation and heat transfer during welding.
