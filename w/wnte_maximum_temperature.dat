40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} {{was to investigate the}} thermal properties of a new indirect ceramic moxibustion (ICM) in comparison with conventional indirect stick moxibustion (ISM) and to interpret the clinical implications of the data. A thermocouple was installed underneath each moxibustion unit to record temperature, and 10 units were burned for each moxibustion trial. The procedure began when the unit temperature reached 27  ±  1 °C and finished when the temperature had returned to 27 °C. The <b>maximum</b> unit <b>temperature,</b> time to reach <b>maximum</b> <b>temperature,</b> and duration of combustion were measured for each moxibustion modality. The <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures</b> for ISM and ICM were 62. 5  ±  2. 59 °C and 50. 2  ±  2. 53 °C, respectively. The times to reach <b>maximum</b> <b>temperature</b> for ISM and ICM were 5. 6 and 16. 8 minutes, respectively. The two modalities exhibit different thermal properties as ISM showed a higher <b>maximum</b> <b>temperature</b> (p <  0. 0001), which can immediately cause third-degree burns, and a steeper slope of temperature change. ICM, however, showed a lower <b>maximum</b> <b>temperature,</b> more slowly reached the <b>maximum</b> <b>temperature</b> (p <  0. 0001), and had a longer and stable duration of combustion. This study suggests that ISM and ICM have statistically different thermal properties, and ICM showed safer thermal properties and a more stable heating pattern.

40|$|Organisms {{in natural}} environments {{experience}} diel temperature fluctuations, including sporadic extreme conditions, rather than constant temperatures. Studies based mainly on model organisms {{have tended to}} focus on responses to average temperatures or short-term heat stress, which overlooks the potential impact of daily fluctuations, including stressful daytime periods and milder night-time periods. Here, we focus on daily <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures,</b> while holding night-time temperatures constant, to specifically investigate the effects of high temperature on demographic parameters and fitness in the English grain aphid Sitobion avenae. We then compared the observed effects of different daily <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures</b> with predictions from constant temperature-performance expectations. Moderate daily <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures</b> depressed aphid performance while extreme conditions had dramatic effects, even when mean temperatures were below the critical maximum. Predictions based on daily average temperature underestimated negative effects of temperature on performance by ignoring daily <b>maximum</b> <b>temperature,</b> while predictions based on daytime <b>maximum</b> <b>temperatures</b> overestimated detrimental impacts by ignoring recovery under mild night-time temperatures. Our findings suggest that daily <b>maximum</b> <b>temperature</b> will {{play an important role in}} regulating natural population dynamics and should be considered in predictions.
