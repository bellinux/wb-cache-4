25|$|It {{has been}} argued (by great early {{scholars}} such as Henry Roseman Lang and Carolina Michaëlis de Vasconcellos) that an indigenous popular poetry existed {{before the beginning of}} the written record, although the first datable poems (a handful between around 1200 and 1225) show influences from Provence. These poems were composed in Galician-Portuguese, also known as Old Portuguese. The first known venues of poetic activity were aristocratic courts in Galicia and the North of Portugal (<b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> thanks to the recent work of the Portuguese historian António Resende de Oliveira). After that the center shifted to the court of Alfonso X (The Wise King), King of Castile and León (etc.). Some of the same poets (and others) practiced their craft in the court of Afonso III of Portugal, who had been educated in France. The main manuscript sources for Galician-Portuguese verse are the Cancioneiro da Ajuda probably a late 13th-century manuscript, the Cancioneiro da Vaticana and the Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional (also called Cancioneiro Colocci-Brancuti). Both these latter codices were copied in Rome {{at the behest of the}} Italian humanist Angelo Colocci, probably around 1525.|$|E

The name Dagomir is used to this day and its construction is similar to other Polish names like for example: Władimir/Włodzimierz or Casimir/Kazimierz. The evolution of the [...] "-mir" [...] element to [...] "-mierz" [...] is due to two separate developments: first, the regular change of the vowel [...] "i" [...] to [...] "(i)e" [...] before [...] "r", and second, the modification of the nominative case by the vocative for certain names (hence, Kazimierz replaced Kazimier based on the vocative Kazimierze).

2500|$|Another common injury faced {{was those}} caused by blades. [...] If the wound was too advance for simple stitch and bandage, it would often result in {{amputation}} of the limb. [...] Surgeons of the Medieval battlefield had {{the practice of}} amputation down to an art. [...] Typically {{it would have taken}} less than a minute for a surgeon to remove the damaged limb, and another three to four minutes to stop the bleeding. [...] The surgeon would first place the limb on a block of wood and tie ligatures above and below the site of surgery. [...] Then the soft tissue would be cut through, thus exposing the bone, which was then sawed through. [...] The stump was then bandaged and left to heal. [...] The rates of mortality among amputation patients was around 39%, that number grew to roughly 62% for those patients with a high leg amputation. [...] Ideas of medieval surgery are often construed in our modern mind as barbaric, as our view is diluted with our own medical knowledge. [...] Surgery and medical practice in general was at its height of advancement for its time. [...] All procedures were done with the intent to save lives, not to cause extra pain and suffering. [...] The speed of the procedure by the surgeon was an important factor, as the limit of pain and blood loss lead to higher survival rates among these procedures. [...] Injuries to major arteries that caused mass blood loss were not usually treatable as shown in the evidence of archeological remains. [...] <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> as wounds severe enough to sever major arteries left incisions on the bone which is excavated by archaeologists. [...] Wounds were also taught to be covered to improve healing. [...] Forms of antiseptics were also used in order to stave off infection. [...] To dress wounds all sorts of dressing were used such as grease, absorbent dressings, spider webs, honey, ground shellfish, clay and turpentine. [...] Some of these methods date back to Roman battlefield medicine.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} a {{disability}} {{that did not}} disqualify priests disqualified Levites, and a disability that did not disqualify Levites disqualified priests.. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1995[...] The Gemara explained that our Rabbis taught that [...] disqualified priests by reason of a bodily blemish, and not by reason of age; and Levites were disqualified by age, for they were qualified for service only {{from the age of}} 30 to 50, and not by bodily blemish. It follows, therefore, that the disability that does not disqualify priests disqualifies Levites, and the disability that does not disqualify Levites disqualifies priests. The Gemara taught that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>this</b> from a Baraita in which our Rabbis noted that [...] says: [...] "This is that which pertains to the Levites." [...] From [...] "And from the age of 50 years they shall return from the service of the work," [...] we know that Levites were disqualified by age. One might have argued that they were disqualified by bodily blemish too; thus, if priests who were not disqualified by age were nevertheless disqualified by bodily blemish, Levites who were disqualified by age should surely have been disqualified by bodily blemish. [...] therefore says: [...] "This is that which pertains to the Levites," [...] to instruct that [...] "this," [...] that is, age, only disqualifies Levites, but nothing else disqualifies them. One might also have argued that priests were disqualified by age too; thus, if Levites who were not disqualified by bodily blemish were nevertheless disqualified by age, priests who were disqualified by bodily blemish should surely have been disqualified by age. [...] therefore says: [...] "Which pertains to the Levites," [...] and not [...] "to the priests." [...] One might further have supposed that the rule that Levites were disqualified by age obtained even at Shiloh and at the Temple at Jerusalem, where the Levites sang in the choir and guarded the doors of the Temple. [...] therefore says: [...] "To do the work of service and the work of bearing burdens," [...] to instruct that God ordained this rule disqualifying Levites by age only when the work was that of bearing burdens upon the shoulder, the service of the Tabernacle in the wilderness, and not at the Temple at Jerusalem.. See also Sifre to Numbers 62–63. Reprinted in, e.g., Sifré to Numbers: An American Translation and Explanation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, pages 13–15. Similarly, the Sifre taught that years invalidated in the case of Levites but not {{in the case of the}} priesthood. For prior to the entry into the Land of Israel, the Levites were valid from the age of 30 to the age of 50, while the priests were valid from puberty until the end of their lives. But once they came into the Land, the Levites were invalidated only by losing their voice. Elsewhere, the Sifre read [...] "and shall serve no more; but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, but they shall do no manner of service," [...] to teach that the Levite went back to the work of closing the doors and carrying out the tasks assigned to the sons of Gershom.|$|E
