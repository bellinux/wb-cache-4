Nelson Piquet, Jr. recovered from his [...] "dismal" [...] qualifying performance to finish an eventual fourth, taking the championship lead. While e.dams Renault retained their lead in the teams' championship, the strong result for the Dragon Racing squad meant they moved up into second.

While there were certainly moments when things did not go as planned, {{for the most part}} it looked easy. Walking and driving on the lunar surface, laying out experiment packages, and collecting samples all seemed as natural as the many science fiction stories we had been reading for years. Of course, it wasn't that easy. Years of planning, training, rethinking, and improvement had gone into those operations. Carrying out useful work from inside a pressure suit required a great deal of compromise on the part of experiment designers and mission planners. Even then, many tasks which were accomplished turned out to be extremely difficult. The lunar environment, especially its dust, low gravity, and vacuum, made it difficult to perform many operations. The need for a pressure suit lowered the productivity of an individual, making it a constant struggle to even merely grip something.

It moves gracefully and lightly; it is endlessly haunting in its pictorial qualities; and reveals a Miss Cornell who equals the beauty of the lyric lines she speaks with a new-found lyric beauty of her own voice.... To add that it is by all odds the most lovely and enchanting Juliet our present-day theatre has seen is only to toss it the kind of superlative it honestly deserves."

40|$|It is a {{critical}} time for India to prioritize nutrition in its health and development agendas. While dismal nutrition indicators persist, and the country‘s levels of hunger are considered ―alarming‖ on an international index, India is expected to miss the Millennium Development Goals targeting hunger and undernutrition. Without a targeted, multi-sectoral approach to nutrition, India is still struggling to deliver evidence-based interventions during the most important windows of opportunity. At the same time, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and its Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) are gaining ground in delivering critical, community-based health services for women, children, and families. The current period of service delivery innovation and quality improvement presents an important opportunity to better integrate nutrition into health, and to push nutrition programming reform in the country. Recognizing this critical opportunity for nutrition programming innovation and integration in India, this report will examine the following research question: How can a nutrition strategy be better integrated into health programming? In pursuing this question, the paper intends to explore mechanisms for better integration in health planning at national, state, and district levels, and strengthened operational integration between frontline health workers and their supervisory structures. It will also examine how current nutrition efforts, namely Integrated Childhood Development Services (ICDS), can be more functional and thereby be better integrated into {{maternal and child health}} services. This report draws largely upon field visits throughout the country, and a field survey conducted in Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan with anganwadi workers (AWW), Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA), and young mothers. Our findings from the field highlight strong needs for nutrition-focused outreach to families, and more structured collaboration between health and nutrition initiatives at community, block, district, state, and national levels. With these findings, we recommend actions to be taken within policy, human resources, and operations: We argue that India requires nutrition leadership at national, state, district, and community levels. A concrete, proactive national nutrition policy is needed to unite fragmented nutrition initiatives, hold relevant departments to nutrition outcomes, and drive nutrition programming in high-focus districts. A similar push has already been initiated by the Department of Women and Child Development. We recommend that states reinforce this commitment to nutrition by creating inter-ministerial councils to emphasize political will towards state nutrition policy and planning. We strongly recommend the creation of a community advocate for nutrition, termed an Accredited Nutrition Activist in this paper, to assume outreach operations from the anganwadi centre. This role would serve as {{a critical}} point person for community-based nutrition and an intermediary between the anganwadi worker and ASHA. This role would also seek to close critical gaps in nutrition, particularly infant feeding. We advocate mechanisms for improved targeting of nutrition interventions, particularly infant feeding. Targeting the most critical beneficiaries includes focusing on the age group under 24 months (e. g. the 1000 -day window of opportunity between pre-pregnancy and two years), and high-risk families through improved outreach operations. Targeting also involves innovative approaches to delivering interventions most effectively (e. g. demonstration-education for families, home-based action), and capturing beneficiaries at critical moments for nutrition counselling and support (e. g. when a child is sick, newborn feeding and care post-delivery). We reiterate calls for an overhaul of ICDS operations, particularly in anganwadi worker supervision, training and support, food supply and distribution, infrastructure, centre timings, oversight, and data management and use for action. The recommendations presented in this paper <b>will</b> also <b>be</b> piloted within the Earth Institute/MOHFW Model District project in Assam, and in due course <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> reporting <b>back</b> on our findings...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{with regret}} that we {{announce}} {{the closure of}} Newzbin2. A combination of several factors has made this the only option. For a long time we have struggled with poor indexing of Usenet, poor numbers of reports caused {{by the majority of}} our editors dropping out & no-one replacing them. Our servers have been unstable and crashing on a regular basis meaning the NZBs & NFOs are unavailable for long periods and we don't have the money to replace them. [...] Newzbin2 was always hoped to be a viable underground commercial venture. The figures just don't stack up. Newzbin1 was said to have had 700,000 registered users. In fact that was the total number of people who ever signed up in the history of Newzbin from 2000 onwards & only a fraction were active, loads of people dropped out & went to other sites. We reckon they had about 100,000 users and of those only a few 10's of thousands paid premium topups.That still made good money for the Newzbin1 guys. We never quite got the trust and lots of people said [...] "Newzbin2 is an MPA trap", that stung us bad and we never got the userbase back. We don't have much more than about 40000 active users and the number of premium users is in the small thousands. It costs much more to run than we bring in, It just doesn't stack up. [...] To make things worse all our payment providers dropped out or started running scared. The MPA sued PayPal and are going at our innocent payment provider Kthxbai Ltd in the UK. Our other payment provider has understandably lost their nerve. Result? We have no more payment providers to offer & no realistic means of taking money (no, Bitcoin isn't credible as it's just too hard for 90% of people). [...] The tragedy is this: unlike Newzbin1 we are 100% DMCA compliant. We have acted on every DMCA notice we received without stalling or playing games: if there was a DMCA complaint the report was gone. Period.

"June 4, 2007 To: WWJL Volunteer Staff From: Jack DeMotte, Chairman, WWJL Board of Directors [...] To all {{who have}} given of their time and {{resources}} to the effort at the radio station, I {{have to be the}} bearer of bad news. As of Thursday, May 31, 2007, we had to shut down broadcasting at WWJL. This <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a permanent shut down, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> going <b>back</b> on the air. This action is a result of a combination of licensing and administrative issues with the FCC. This is NOT the result of any action or non-action of any of the station volunteers. After much searching of our records, we discovered that the electronic filing of our station license renewal last year was either not accepted or not received by the FCC. This has resulted in our operation since August 1, 2006 without a valid, renewed license. This is in violation of the rules and regulations of the FCC. While there are severe fines and penalties associated with such action, we are hopeful and taking steps to minimize this risk. We have engaged the services of an LPFM Christian radio station consultant to help us wade through the process. Please pray for our successful completion of this process. While {{this is the end of}} this phase of the outreach ministry that was created at the First Baptist Church with the help of many wonderful Christian volunteers, I sincerely hope and pray this <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> the end of your personal ministry and outreach to our communities. This has been a wonderful ministry, and I know that you have touched many lives with your many shows and moments on the radio. I pray that your lives have been enriched and blessed by your unselfish service to the work of our Lord through the radio ministry over the past three years. I am sure you have met many people, touched many lives that you may not have had the opportunity to do so without such a project. There are to many volunteers for me to name without chancing missing someone, but I do want to acknowledge the outstanding efforts of Brian Winters as Program director, Ron Galbraith as Technical Director, and Diane Mohney as interim Station Manager. In addition to all of the time and effort each of you put into your respective shows, these people had given hours of their time and energy to the technical and administrative side of the station. I would also be remiss in not acknowledging the efforts of Carol Oakes in the solicitation of underwriting support over the past years. I want you all to thank the underwriters of the station for their unwavering financial support of our efforts. And last, but certainly not least is the Rev. Rohn Peterson who had the vision and personally brought the station to life.
