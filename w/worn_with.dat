5|$|Although Hindu {{women have}} {{traditionally}} worn saris, the shalwar kameez and Western attire is gaining acceptance among younger women. Western dress is worn more by men, although the dhoti and kurta are seen during festivals. The formal male sherwani is often <b>worn</b> <b>with</b> chooridar on festive occasions.

5|$|However, in 2000, the Patriots {{also became}} one of the only teams to drop the rounded numbers and {{switched}} back to block numbers. Also that year, the shade of blue was darkened from royal to nautical blue. The Patriots, unsatisfied with the white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be <b>worn</b> <b>with</b> the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from red to blue.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Corps {{wore the}} uniform of the Russian Imperial Army from 12 September 1941 to 30 November 1942 {{as well as the}} Czechoslovakian helmet. The uniform was {{sometimes}} <b>worn</b> <b>with</b> pips of the Royal Yugoslav Army, alongside special rank insignia on the collar. Wehrmacht uniforms and insignia were adopted on 1 December 1942, but the old uniforms continued to be worn for some time.|$|E
5|$|Newton Heath's {{uniform in}} 1879, {{four years before}} the club played its first {{competitive}} match, has been documented as 'white with blue cord'. A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers. Between 1894–96, the players wore distinctive green and gold jerseys which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were <b>worn</b> <b>with</b> navy blue shorts.|$|E

5|$|The collar is worn on {{designated}} collar days over {{military uniform}} or morning dress by members attending formal events. The collar is {{fastened to the}} shoulders with silk ribbons (or gold safety pins when <b>worn</b> <b>with</b> morning dress). Since the collar signifies the Order of the Garter, members can then wear the riband of any other order to which they belong. The collar is only worn at specific occasions that warrant it.|$|E
5|$|When the College {{first opened}} in 1888 {{there was no}} uniform, instead the girls wore long cotton dresses, gloves and hat. A straw boater was {{introduced}} in the early 20th century, <b>worn</b> <b>with</b> a red and white hat band featuring the college crest with its burning bush woven into it in red. During this time Prefects wore red silk arm-bands embroidered with a gold crest.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{have always}} worn blue shirts, {{although}} they originally used the paler eton blue, which {{was taken from}} the racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, and was <b>worn</b> <b>with</b> white shorts and dark blue or black socks. The light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912. In the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season. Since then Chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were reintroduced.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of the}} club's history, Hull {{have worn}} black and amber shirts with black shorts. These black and amber colours are where Hull's nickname, The Tigers, {{originated}} from. However, in the club's first match against Notts County in 1904, white shirts were <b>worn,</b> <b>with</b> black shorts and black socks. During their first season in the League, Hull wore black and amber striped shirts and black shorts, which they continued to wear until the Second World War {{with the exception of}} the 1935–36 season, in which they wore sky blue shirts. Following the end of the Second World War, Hull spent another season wearing sky blue, but changed to plain amber shirts, which they wore until the early 1960s, when they swapped back to stripes.|$|E
5|$|For much of Arsenal's history, {{their home}} colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though {{this has not}} always been the case. The choice of red is in {{recognition}} of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was <b>worn</b> <b>with</b> white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.|$|E
5|$|President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama {{attended}} 10 official inaugural balls {{during the}} evening of January 20, 2009. Barack Obama wore a new tuxedo made by Hart Schaffner Marx, a Chicago-based menswear company. He also wore a white bow tie, instead of the conventional black. Traditionalists considered this a fashion faux pas, as a white tie is conventionally only <b>worn</b> <b>with</b> a white waistcoat and tails. Michelle Obama wore a white, one-shouldered, sleeveless gown designed by 26-year-old NewYork-based designer JasonWu, breaking with the recent practice set by former first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, who showcased designers from their hometowns.|$|E

5|$|The divisional {{insignia}} was a {{sun with}} 16 rays, the ancient {{symbol of the}} Macedonian king Alexander the Great. A divisional collar patch bearing the insignia was intended, but it is unlikely it was ever issued. During their formation and training in the Bácska region {{during the summer of}} 1944, the soldiers often dressed in khaki tropical uniforms with shorts. The official headgear of the division was the SS M43 fez: a field gray model to be <b>worn</b> <b>with</b> service uniform and a red model for dress uniform. Members of the division that had previously served in the 13th SS Division often continued to wear the divisional collar patch of that division, which showed an arm holding a scimitar over a swastika. These non-standard uniform items continued to be worn by members of the division after they became part of the 31st SS Division in October 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} form of opposition, however, was passive resistance. Small patriotic badges, {{depicting the}} royal family or national colours, were extremely popular. When these symbols were banned, new ones, such as ivy leaves, were <b>worn</b> <b>with</b> similar meaning. Workers in strategic industries deliberately underperformed in their jobs {{as a form of}} resistance. The celebration of nationalist public holidays, like 21 July (National Day), which were officially banned by the Germans, were also often accompanied by protests and demonstrations. One of the most notable acts of passive resistance was the Judges' Strike of 1918, which managed to gain concessions from the German occupiers under considerable public pressure.|$|E
5|$|Traditional attire in Faisalabad is Punjabi {{clothing}} {{such as the}} dhoti, kurta and pagri. Faisalabadi men wear white shalwar kameez as {{do women}} but also with a dupatta (scarf). The more conservative women wear burqas {{that may or may}} not cover the face. Combinations of Pakistani and Western attire are worn by women, such as an embroidered kurta <b>worn</b> <b>with</b> jeans or trousers, and half sleeve or sleeveless shirts with Capri pants. Men have adopted some of the modern Western styles for both casual and formal business dress such as dress pants, trousers, T-shirts and jeans.|$|E
