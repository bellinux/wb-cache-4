According to Nermark, the budget for creating this game was less than those of other triple-A video games; {{he also said that}} despite the poor commercial performance, the team was still proud of the final product.|$|E

He said things that needed to be said, but once they were said, we needed to destroy that person. I'll admit, <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> certain sadistic glee in his downfall.

500|$|Black Sabbath {{began work}} on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at Morgan Studios in Willesden, {{this time with a}} decisive vision to differ the sound from Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath. [...] "We could've {{continued}} and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn't particularly want to. <b>We</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> look at ourselves, and we wanted to do a rock album – Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath wasn't a rock album, really." [...] Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher, Sabotage was released in July 1975. As with its precursor, the album initially saw favourable reviews, with Rolling Stone stating [...] "Sabotage is not only Black Sabbath's best record since Paranoid, it might be their best ever", although later reviewers such as AllMusic noted that [...] "the magical chemistry that made such albums as Paranoid and Volume 4 so special was beginning to disintegrate".|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, it was {{announced}} that actress Betty White would guest star on the show playing herself. After winning his second Emmy Award as Jack Donaghy at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in that same month, Alec Baldwin revealed that White was the cast's first choice to make a guest appearance. [...] "We all put names in a hat, and <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> vote– if you could have one guest star for the whole season, who would it be? And Betty White was the winner." [...] Television host Jimmy Fallon played himself in [...] "Stone Mountain". The character Rick Wayne, a ventriloquist, was played by real-life ventriloquist Jeff Dunham.

500|$|Creator Matthew Weiner {{conceived}} {{the script for}} [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] in 2000, while he {{was working as a}} writer for the sitcom Becker. The first draft of the episode was written as a spec script and was titled [...] "The Division". Two years later, Weiner sent the script to David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, although Weiner's agents insisted that he not proceed with his plans. Chase later recruited him upon first glance. [...] "It was what you’re always hoping to see," [...] he recalled. [...] "It was lively and it had something new to say. Here was someone who had written a story about advertising in the 1960s, and was looking at recent American history through that prism." [...] Weiner set the pilot script aside for the next seven years to focus on The Sopranos. Neither HBO nor Showtime expressed interest in the project until the commencement of The Sopranos final season. During that time, AMC began looking into the television market for new programming. [...] "The network was looking for distinction in launching its first original series," [...] according to AMC Networks president Ed Carroll, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> bet that quality would win out over formulaic mass appeal." ...|$|E

500|$|Among {{the most}} popular of Henson's {{commercials}} was a series for the local Wilkins Coffee company in Washington, D.C., in which his Muppets were able to get away with a greater level of slapstick violence than might have been acceptable with human actors and would later find its way into many acts on The Muppet Show. In the first Wilkins ad, a Muppet named Wilkins is poised behind a cannon seen in profile. Another Muppet named Wontkins is in front of its barrel. Wilkins asks, [...] "What do you think of Wilkins Coffee?" [...] and Wontkins responds gruffly, [...] "Never tasted it!" [...] Wilkins fires the cannon and blows Wontkins away, then turns the cannon directly toward the viewer and ends the ad with, [...] "Now, {{what do you think of}} Wilkins?" [...] Henson later explained, [...] "Till then, advertising agencies believed that the hard sell was the only way to get their message over on television. <b>We</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> very different approach. We tried to sell things by making people laugh." [...] The first seven-second commercial for Wilkins was an immediate hit and was syndicated and re-shot by Henson for local coffee companies across the United States; he ultimately produced more than 300 coffee ads. The same setup was used to pitch Kraml Milk in the Chicago area, Red Diamond coffee, several bread products, and even Faygo.|$|E
500|$|Another VFX {{supervisor}} from Zoic Studios, Andrew Orloff, {{believed the}} episode's special effects were {{possibly the most}} difficult of the season. He wrote, [...] "Originally, {{it was supposed to be}} a practical effect but they couldn't get it to fall in a natural way, so what we had to do was shoot the practical elements in pieces and we put them all together and timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG. So <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> cyberscan of the guy's body, and on top of all the practical elements we used as a base, we had a matte painting, a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body, 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out, 3D particles of small ash bits floating down, residual dust flying off of it and, at one point, his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash. So we had to do a full-CG head and tumble it down the body. That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R there was 2D work in After Effects, tracking, retiming, we did a lot of CG lighting for the body parts in Maya/mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software, and rendered in Maya/mental ray." ...|$|E
500|$|During the U.S. third leg, it was {{reported}} that Born to Run would be featured in its entirety during several shows, possibly in a scheme to boost ticket sales. [...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows. [...] Springsteen later said of the full album idea, [...] "We had done so many shows and were going to come back around one more time, so we were like, 'OK, what can we do that we haven't done? Let's try to play some of the albums.' There were some people who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on a cut in the middle. And we made albums – <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> long time, and we built them to last. ... Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years. It simply was a way to revitalize the show and do something appealing and fun for the fans, but it ended up being a much bigger emotional experience than I thought it would be." ...|$|E

500|$|BUF Compagnie {{served as}} the lead visual effects vender working on the film, with Digital Domain also {{providing}} work on the film. Branagh stated that BUF, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by Hubble photography and other images of deep space. Branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by J. M. W. Turner to Digital Domain when creating Jotunheim. Peter Butterworth, VFX supervisor and co-founder of Fuel VFX, said the most challenging task was interpreting what the Bifröst would look like, [...] "You can't Google what these things look like—they are totally imagined and within {{the heads of the}} stakeholders. So to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. Technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the Bifröst and Odin's chamber shots. Part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo. In the film, Odin enters {{what is known as the}} [...] "Odinsleep" [...] in his chamber to regenerate. Butterworth stated, [...] "For Odin's Chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that hover over Odin's bed. This dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. <b>We</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space".|$|E
