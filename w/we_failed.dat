In addition to Karluk, Stefansson had purchased sight unseen a small gasoline-driven schooner, Alaska, {{to act as a}} supply ship for the Southern Party. He later added a second schooner, Mary Sachs, when the hold space in Alaska proved inadequate. In the confusion surrounding the expedition's departure, McKinlay notes, no attempt was made to align men or equipment to their appropriate ships. Thus anthropologists Henri Beuchat and Diamond Jenness, both designated for the Southern Party, found themselves sailing with Karluk, while their equipment was on board Alaska. McKinlay himself, aboard Karluk as magnetic observer, discovered that most of his equipment was with Alaska. Stefansson insisted that all would be sorted out when the ships reached their Herschel Island rendezvous. [...] "Heaven help us all if <b>we</b> <b>failed</b> to reach Herschel Island", McKinlay wrote.|$|E

500|$|In May, Benfica had {{two games}} in which to {{overcome}} a four-point deficit. On the fourth, they played Estrela da Amadora away. Benfica never beat Estrela's goalkeeper, Pedro Alves, drawing 0–0 and losing crucial points. Chalana said, [...] "We started the first half somewhat nervous. Not playing our best. However, the second half was different, we did everything to win, created opportunities but the ball just would not go in." [...] The draw left Benfica dependent on others to reach second place; even if they won, Sporting had to lose and Guimarães had to lose or draw. On 11 May, the club hosted Vitória de Setúbal. The match, attracting over 54,000 fans for Rui Costa's last game, was a 3–0 Benfica win. Sporting and Guimarães also won and Benfica finished fourth, missing a Champions League berth. It was their fifth finish outside the top three after fourth-place finishes in 1939–40, 1940–41 and 2001–02 and a sixth-place finish in 2000–01. Chalana said, [...] "Benfica is very big. <b>We</b> <b>failed</b> to reach our objectives, but nearly sold out the stadium today." [...] The club's season ended with an African tour in which they defeated a team with players from Sal and São Vicente on 17 May and the Angolan national team two days later.|$|E

500|$|In May, Benfica {{had four}} matches to gain four points on Sporting. The first {{was at the}} Estádio da Madeira with Nacional. Knowing that Sporting had lost points to Académica, Benfica hoped to narrow the gsp between them to two points. After an uneventful first half, in the 56th minute Nenê scored the opening goal for Nacional. Eight minutes later, Rúben Micael {{extended}} the lead, with Reyes reducing it in the 67th minute. Benfica pressed unsuccessfully for the equaliser before Nacional scored again with Miguel Fidalgo. Sánchez Flores realised that winning the league title was now impossible. On 9 May, Benfica met Trofense at home. Valdomiro scored first for the visitors in the 31st minute before Benfica scored twice in two minutes, reaching half-time with a 2–1 lead. In the second half, Paulinho tied the score for Trofense. Sporting won that day, so Benfica trailed by seven points with two match days left and could not qualify for the Champions League. Sánchez Flores said, [...] "I know when to arrive and when to leave. I {{do not want to}} be a problem for the club." [...] Playing out the schedule, Benfica first visited the Municipal de Braga. They won 3–1, ending a five-year winless streak there. The victory was against Jorge Jesus, widely reported as Sánchez Flores' successor. A week later, Benfica ended their campaign with a 3–1 win against Belenenses. Sánchez Flores analysed the club's season: [...] "They asked me to improve the team and I did. But we all know what happened last year; we should set realistic goals. Second place was possible, but <b>we</b> <b>failed</b> in the final third. I won a title and fought for another."

He used these reinforcements in a vicious two-day battle, September 19 and 20, gaining {{one of the few}} confederate victories in the southwest. But, the 18th Georgia Regiment did not participate since they only arrived on the field the day after the battle. The Union forces, under the command of General Rosencrans, fell back into Chattanooga, Tennessee.

[...] Title IX prohibited sex discrimination in federally assisted educational programs and amended parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. While social fraternities and sororities were exempt from the provisions of Title IX, professional fraternities were included in Title IX. Around this time, the brothers of the Delta Chi Chapter at Clarkson University introduced legislation to amend Alpha Kappa Psi's Constitution to include women as brothers. While this move did gain the support of a few other chapters, the proposed amendments were easily defeated. [...] In the fall of 1973, the Delta Chi chapter admitted four women into their Chapter and soon granted females full rights and privileges, including participation in ritual. [...] Delta Chi went on to elect a female president and attempted to send her to the 1974 national convention as their voting delegate. [...] As a result, Alpha Kappa Psi revoked the charter of the Delta Chi Chapter. The chapter proceeded by changing its name to Delta Chi Delta aiming to be completely independent from its former counterpart. During the same year, the Alpha Kappa Chapter at the University of Idaho also admitted women to membership. As a result, Alpha Kappa Psi also moved forward with disciplinary action against the Alpha Kappa Chapter. Upon having their charter revoked, the former Alpha Kappa Chapter continued on as an independent organization known as Pi Beta Sigma, and the organization's advisor remarked [...] "My sentiments are that if we are being excommunicated from the national because <b>we</b> <b>failed</b> to discriminate against women, then it's a pleasure to get kicked out of that organization.|$|E

Carmona's Minister of Defense also called on the media to stop reporting the violence so it would not provoke more violent actions. The head of Globovision reportedly called to CNN in Atlanta [...] "to request the U.S. network join the blackout."

Two of the three major newspapers El Universal and El Nacional cancelled their Sunday editions, for safety reasons. The third major newspaper, Últimas Noticias, printed a limited Sunday edition accurately reflecting events; some tabloids and regional television stations also covered the news.

The following two questions guided our study. First, do conferencing activities generate opportunities for the identification and discussion of taken-for-granted assumptions and, if so, what types of assumptions?
