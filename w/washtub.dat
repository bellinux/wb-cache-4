5|$|With {{the closure}} of the rail terminus, Vauxhall Bridge's main source of revenue was {{visitors}} to the Vauxhall Gardens pleasure park. In addition to people visiting the Gardens themselves, Vauxhall Gardens were used as a launch point for hot air balloon flights, and large crowds would gather on the bridge and surrounding streets to watch the flights. A large crowd also assembled on the bridge in September 1844 to watch Mister Barry, a clown from Astley's Amphitheatre, sail from Vauxhall Bridge to Westminster Bridge in a <b>washtub</b> towed by geese.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{involvement}} of the Kersten committee and of Kersten and Hillings caused concern for the CIA. Dulles constantly worried that their investigation would damage CIA operations, particularly when Hillings visited Guatemala shortly before PBSUCCESS was to begin. Additionally, Congresspeople had not officially been informed of the CIA's role in the coup, and Dulles wished to keep them uninformed. By supplying them with PBHistory documents, Dulles hoped to forestall them from inadvertently exposing the CIA's other projects. Following the hearings, a subcommittee headed by Hillings produced a final report. In addition to stating without evidence that the Guatemalan government had been acting under orders from the Soviet Union, this report also falsely claimed that Soviet weapons had been brought covertly to Guatemala by submarine. This unintentionally drew attention to Operation <b>WASHTUB,</b> a CIA effort to foist incriminating weapons on the Guatemalan government.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 70's several of Tagawa's {{students}} formed a band {{to extend their}} skills with the banjo. The members {{ranged in age from}} six to sixteen and included banjo, guitar, piano, and <b>washtub</b> basses. Tagawa led the band through the mid-1980s. The band was eventually asked to perform in public, at which time they chose to go by the name Charlie Tagawa's Junior Banjo Band.|$|E

She then left the room and returned hours later when the children were dead. The next step in her procedure was to burn their bodies. On occasions when she did not burn them, she dug graves and buried them.|$|E

He recalls that a 10th grade teacher who didn't tolerate nicknames {{was the last person}} to call him by his proper name, Orlando.|$|E
25|$|Membership has {{varied from}} the {{original}} nine banjo players to well over a hundred. It includes both banjo and gut bucket (<b>washtub</b> bass) players plus a Band Auxiliary. From its humble beginnings {{in the basement of}} the Cupertino Music Store, the PBB did not have an official public venue until 1966. Having outgrown the music store, a gentleman by the name of Ward Pinther offered to host the band at his Straw Hat Pizza Palace in Campbell, California. This hospitality lasted for the next 24 years until Pinther's retirement and the closing of the restaurant. Not to be deterred, the band moved to yet another Straw Hat Pizza restaurant in the nearby San Jose neighborhood of Willow Glen. So from 1966 until Tuesday, June 16, 2009, the band entertained crowds every Tuesday evening at a Straw Hat Pizza restaurant. During the band's heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, it was not unusual to have four rows of twenty to twenty five banjo players performing plus as many as eight gutbucket players and a tuba. The sound produced by a hundred or more banjos is unique and unlike anything else in the world of acoustic performances.|$|E
500|$|The song {{became a}} hit and {{established}} Williams' recording career. On December 12, 1941, he recorded a second version titled [...] "Please Don't Go" [...] in Chicago for Bluebird, {{with a more}} modern arrangement and lyrics. Blues historian Gerard Herzhaft calls it [...] "the most exciting version", which Williams recorded using his trademark nine-string guitar. Accompanying him are Sonny Boy Williamson I on harmonica and Alfred Elkins on imitation bass (possibly a <b>washtub</b> bass). Since both songs appeared before recording industry publications began tracking such releases, it is unknown which version was more popular. In 1947, he recorded it for Columbia Records with Williamson and Ransom Knowling on bass and Judge Riley on drums. This version did not reach the Billboard Race Records chart, but represents a move toward a more urban blues treatment of the song.|$|E

50|$|The first hammer forge was {{probably}} built in 1482 on the River Ohra. In 1592 the mill {{was bought by}} Tobias Albrecht, since when it has been named after him. The works originally had three huge iron hammers which were raised by the motion of a water wheel. The mill made iron products such as scythes, sickles, ploughshares, lances and swords. Later, it also carried out copper processing; washbowls, <b>washtubs,</b> kettle drums, brewing implements, pots, cans and pans were made. The kettle drums, which were produced into the late 20th century, were made from {{a single piece of}} copper, forged under the tilt hammer and still set a standard today in terms of their sound.|$|R

Green became a near-constant member of McDaniel's backing band, the two often trading joking insults with each other during live shows. During the summers of 1943 and 1944, he played at the Maxwell Street market in a band with Earl Hooker. By 1951 he was playing {{on the street with}} backing from Roosevelt Jackson on <b>washtub</b> bass and Jody Williams, whom he had taught to play the guitar.

2500|$|During the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, other {{stringed}} instruments {{began to be}} added to the fiddle-banjo duo; these included the guitar, mandolin, and double bass (or <b>washtub</b> bass), which provided chordal, bass line, and pitched rhythmic accompaniment and occasionally took over the melodic line, usually during a [...] "break" [...] lasting the duration of a verse, refrain, or verse and refrain. [...] This, along with a Dobro (resonator guitar), is also considered to be 'standard' bluegrass instrumentation, but old-time music tends to focus on sparser instrumentation and arrangements as compared to bluegrass.

25|$|Like the English and Irish country houses it {{was modeled}} on, the White House was, from the start, {{open to the}} public until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his {{swearing-in}} ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with <b>washtubs</b> filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected Grover Cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President Bill Clinton would briefly revive the New Year's Day open house in his first term.|$|R
2500|$|Arnott was a {{founding}} member of the band Goodtime Washboard Three, characterized as a regional one-hit jug band and as a vaudeville band. Arnott played banjo, Bruce Bratton played <b>washtub</b> bass, and Wayne Pope played washboard and musical saw. In 1959, the band played Friday nights at the Monkey Inn in Berkeley, California. In 1963, when Arnott was absent from the group for two years working in Japan, the band wrote a humorous song about Oakland, appropriately entitled [...] "Oakland", which gained regional popularity. With Dick Fagarstrom covering banjo, the single 45rpm record [...] "Oakland" [...] was played on many of the San Francisco Bay Area radio stations for a brief period, and has since settled into cult status, with occasional plays on eclectic radio shows such as that of Dr. Demento. Of its 1960s popularity, Bratton said [...] "It got enormous airplay." [...] The Goodtime Washboard Three was asked to perform the song for the Oakland City Council, and the group (with Arnott on banjo) played it from atop the marquee of the Tribune Tower, a performance seen by thousands. The band's quirky style and fame resulted in invitations to the Bohemian Grove where they met powerful people such as Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger. Bratton later joked that he organized a meeting of all the Bohemian Democrats, held in a telephone booth. The band's first full album was entitled Don't Blame PG, Pal, recorded in 1964 at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley and released in 1965 by Fantasy Records. On April 1, 1967, the band appeared on the television show The Hollywood Palace, with Bing Crosby as guest host. Crosby introduced them by saying that he first heard the group play at the Bohemian Grove. Crosby joined the band for the last chorus of Oh By Jingo!.|$|E

Like the Italian and Portuguese women, she gathered driftwood and carried it home, though always she did it with shamed pride, timing her arrival {{so that it would}} be after dark. One day, on the mud-flat side of the Rock Wall, an Italian fishing boat hauled up on the sand dredged from the channel. From the top of the wall Saxon watched the men grouped about the charcoal brazier, eating crusty Italian bread and a stew of meat and vegetables, washed down with long draughts of thin red wine. She envied them their freedom that advertised itself in the heartiness of their meal, in the tones of their chatter and laughter, in the very boat itself that was not tied always to one place and that carried them wherever they willed. Afterward, they dragged a seine across the mud-flats and up on the sand, selecting for themselves only the larger kinds of fish. Many thousands of small fish, like sardines, they left dying on the sand when they sailed away. Saxon got a sackful of the fish, and was compelled to make two trips in order to carry them home, where she salted them down in a wooden <b>washtubs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "cooper" [...] {{is derived}} from Middle Dutch or Middle Low German kūper 'cooper' from kūpe 'cask', in turn from Latin cupa 'tun, barrel'. Everything a cooper {{produces}} is referred to collectively as cooperage. A cask is any piece of cooperage containing a bouge, bilge, or bulge {{in the middle of}} the container. A barrel is a type of cask, so the terms [...] "barrel-maker" [...] and [...] "barrel-making" [...] refer to just one aspect of a cooper's work. The facility in which casks are made is also referred to as a cooperage. [...] There were four divisions in the cooper's craft. The [...] "dry" [...] or [...] "slack" [...] cooper made containers that would be used to ship dry goods such as cereals, nails, tobacco, fruits, and vegetables. The [...] "dry-tight" [...] cooper made casks designed to keep dry goods in and moisture out. Gunpowder and flour casks are examples of a dry-tight cooper's work. The [...] "white" [...] cooper made straight-staved containers like <b>washtubs,</b> buckets, and butter churns, which would hold water and other liquids but did not allow shipping of the liquids. Usually there was no bending of wood involved in white cooperage. The [...] "wet" [...] or [...] "tight" [...] cooper made casks for long-term storage and transportation of liquids that could even be under pressure, as with beer. The [...] "general" [...] cooper worked on ships, on the docks, and in warehouses, and was responsible for cargo while in storage or transit. With a specialized skill, the general cooper could repair a broken stave without losing the contents of a cask.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{technical}} and economic feasibility of the installation of an innovative thermal concentrating solar system (TCSS) for high pressure steam production in a dairy is discussed. The production of soft cheese takes place thanks to the injection of saturated steam into <b>washtubs</b> that are filled with semi-finished materials. The steam is produced in natural gas fired tube boilers and is evidently lost and make-up fresh treated water at atmospheric conditions is required. In this context, the installation of a TCSS based on the technology of the linear Fresnel concentrating systems is proposed to provide part of the required steam and, consequently, to reduce the consumption of the fossil fuel improving the process environmental performances. To this purpose, the piping integration {{of the new system}} in the original one has been analyzed in detail respecting the essential safety requirements in accordance with the guidelines of the Pressurized Equipment Directive (PED) and maintaining the required service level to the thermal end-user. In order to assure a satisfying exploitation of the solar power source, the adoption of a storage system based on a pressurized vessel containing a mixture of water and steam has been considered and optimized from a technical and economic point of view. Indeed, the dairy production is scheduled only during six hours in the morning per day. This particular thermal load profile makes difficult the integration with the not programmable solar power source with peaks during the median hours of the day. Particular attention has been dedicated to the operative behavior of the integrated system defining suitable control rules thanks to the installation of valves and sensors. Beside the technical analysis, an economic assessment has demonstrated the profitability of the thermal plant modification, that assures a substantial improvement of the overall energy efficiency of the production process...|$|R
