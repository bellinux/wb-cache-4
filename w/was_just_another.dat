25|$|Reasons for the Douglas Branch service {{reduction}} {{were due}} to its low ridership, badly deteriorated infrastructure and funding problems, while many residents in the communities it runs through had claimed that it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> attempt by the CTA to eliminate transit service on the West Side.|$|E

The criminalists had used MiniFiler, a new product to type Lazarus' DNA, and he argued it was sufficiently different from previous technology that she was entitled to a Frye hearing, to determine whether its results were of sufficient scientific validity to be admissible. Perry ruled that it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> form of the PCR method commonly used to test DNA samples.|$|E
25|$|The {{police were}} {{convinced}} that Chang was running a large operation and several staff from his restaurant were found selling drugs and convicted. He sold {{his interest in the}} Regent Street restaurant and opened the Palm Court Club in nearby Gerrard Street, in what is now London's Chinatown, but which then <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> London street. Police interest continued, however, and after a number of raids Chang was forced to move to Limehouse in October 1923, a poor area near the London docks that contained the original small Chinese community of London and which had been connected in the public mind with opium smoking since Victorian times.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the city}} of Chicago was established, the area that is now Englewood was largely swampland {{inhabited}} by Mascouten Indians. In 1839, the US Government Land Office of Chicago stated that the land was habitable. In the 1850s and 1860s, as Chicago was becoming a city of railroad tracks and economic prosperity, Englewood <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> supporting neighborhood. But in 1871, when the Great Chicago Fire destroyed {{a large portion of}} Chicago, residents moved to the outskirts such as Englewood. Englewood's railroad connections to downtown Chicago made it a convenient location, and the neighborhood's population grew rapidly. Englewood Station once served many railroad passengers; in 1889, over 1,000 trains would pass through Englewood every day.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{was furious}} over the {{official}} decision and argued with the officials {{claiming that he}} should be declared the winner and not Austin. On the following night's Raw, Hart came to the ring unannounced {{at the beginning of the}} show and began venting his frustrations toward Vince McMahon over how he believed that the finish to the Royal Rumble <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> in a long string of screwings and broken promises that had been dogging Hart since he returned to the company. He demanded that he receive the title shot that the winner of the Royal Rumble is entitled to, saying that as far as he was concerned he won the match. McMahon simply ignored him and walked to his broadcast position, and an incensed Hart finally decided he had had enough and declared he was quitting the WWF.|$|E
25|$|Heinkel, {{having had}} the He 112 {{rejected}} {{in the design}} competition of 1936, designed and built the He 100. On 6 June 1938, the He 100 V3, flown by Ernst Udet, captured the record with a speed of 634.7km/h (394.4mph). On 30 March 1939, test pilot Hans Dieterle surpassed that record, reaching 746.61km/h (463.92mph) with the He 100 V8. Messerschmitt, however, soon regained the lead when, on 26 April 1939, Flugkapitän Fritz Wendel, flying the Me 209 V1, set a new record of 755.14km/h (469.22mph). For propaganda purposes, the machine was called the Me 109R, suggesting it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> variant of the standard fighter, {{but in fact it}} was a racing aircraft having little in common with the Bf 109. It was powered by the DB 601ARJ, producing 1,156kW (1,550hp), but capable of reaching 1,715kW (2,300hp). This world record for a piston-engined aircraft was to stand until 1969, when Darryl Greenamyer's modified Grumman F8F Bearcat, Conquest I, broke it with a 777km/h (483mph) record speed.|$|E

25|$|In early 2007 Peru accused Chile of {{unilaterally}} redefining {{their shared}} sea boundary in a law, passed by Congress, which detailed {{the borders of}} the new administrative region of Arica and Parinacota. The impasse was resolved by the Chilean Constitutional Tribunal, which declared the particular section of the law unconstitutional. In March 2007, the Chilean state-owned — but editorially independent — television channel TVN cancelled the broadcast of a documentary about the War of the Pacific after a cautionary call was made to the stations’ board of directors by Chilean Foreign Relations Minister Alejandro Foxley, apparently acting on demands made by the Peruvian ambassador to Chile; the show was finally broadcast in late May of that year. In August 2007 the Chilean government filed a formal diplomatic protest with Peru and summoned home its ambassador, after Peru published an official map claiming a part of the Pacific Ocean that Chile considers its sovereign territory. Peru said this <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> step in its plans to bring the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. In January 2008 Peru asked the court to consider the dispute, prompting Bachelet to summon home the Chilean ambassador in Lima for consultations.|$|E

He did not remember the character's name, only recalling it when he first attended a Star Trek convention at a hotel near Los Angeles Airport, as the fans called it out when he entered the lobby.

That evening, when the announcer at Canton announced Williams' death to the gathered crowd, they started laughing, thinking that it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> excuse. After Hawkshaw Hawkins and other performers started singing [...] "I Saw the Light" [...] as a tribute to Williams, the crowd, now realizing that he was indeed dead, sang along. Dr. Malinin also wrote that Williams had been severely beaten and kicked in the groin recently. Also local magistrate Virgil F. Lyons ordered an inquest into Williams' death concerning the welt that was visible on his head.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary {{popular music}} was used {{throughout}} the production to evoke {{the feel of the}} year in which each episode was set. The BBC's existing agreements with various music publishers and record labels meant that the production team was easily able to obtain the rights to use most of the desired songs. A particular piece of synchronicity occurred in the final episode, 1995, which Cellan Jones had decided to close with the song [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger" [...] by Oasis. While the serial was in production, it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> track from their (What's the Story) Morning Glory? album. However, during transmission of Our Friends in the North, it was released as a single, and to Cellan Jones's delight, it {{was at the top of}} the UK Singles Chart in the week of the final episode's transmission.|$|E

500|$|Turner interviewed flautist John Payne for the book, who had {{sat in on}} {{sessions}} with Van Morrison and later collaborated with him. Payne comments on their work together on the album Astral Weeks, which also included musicians Connie Kay, Warren Smith, Jay Berliner, and Richard Davis: [...] "Ironically, the image you have {{when you listen to}} the album now is of these guys who are all together, and they realise they are creating a monumental work of art. The fact is that it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> session for them." [...] Payne states of his observations of Van Morrison's performance style: [...] "When (Van) was on stage, he would look like a space cadet, but then he'd open his mouth and you would realize that he had channeled everything into the sound of his voice. The rest of it was just a shell that was there for the purpose of producing this noise." ...|$|E
