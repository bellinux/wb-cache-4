The preliminary experiment consisted of determining the concentration of riboflavin added to T. suecica cultures to achieve a maximum quantity of this vitamin in the microalgal cells. Seven concentrations were tested in triplicate: 0 (control), 2. 5, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 ng ml− 1; {{the results showed that}} the 10 ng ml− 1 was the optimum concentration that the microalgae accumulated 4. 29 ± 0. 19 pg cell− 1, 21. 2 ± 0. 35 ng ml− 1 and 19. 4 ± 0. 56 μg g− 1 (dry weight) of riboflavin. Control and enriched microalgal cultures were used for feeding the rotifer B. plicatilis. Control and enriched rotifers were used for feeding <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and gilthead sea bream larvae. Rotifers fed on enriched microalgal cultures accumulated significantly (P < 0. 05) more riboflavin than those fed the control culture after 24 h of enrichment (17. 7 ± 1. 3 and 13. 7 ± 1. 2 μg g− 1 (dw), respectively) and after 24 h of starvation (10. 2 ± 44 1. 1 and 5. 6 ± 0. 4 μg g− 1 (dw), respectively). In both species of sparids, those larvae fed enriched rotifers contained significantly more riboflavin than those fed control rotifers, the vitamin B 2 content in control and enriched <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> larvae was 21. 7 ± 2. 7 and 29. 2 ± 1. 3 μg g− 1 (dw), respectively, and in control and enriched gilthead sea bream larvae it was 5. 5 ± 1. 0 and 7. 3 ± 0. 05 μg g− 1 (dw), respectively.

Then due to trophic interrelationships the toxins are transferred to theirs predators. In the last instance, top predators (marine mammals and sea birds) can be intoxicated after fed on primary and secondary consumers. The wild horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) was collected in NW and S Portuguese coast between September of 2009 and March of 2010. The results show {{for the first time}} that horse mackerel can accumulate high concentrations of PSTs in theirs gastrointestinal tract. Which increased the requirement of evaluated the dynamics of accumulation and elimination of PSTs in secondary consumer fish. Thus aquaculture fishes, <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>breams,</b> were fed with toxin-contaminated cockles. After 5 days of toxin exposure, the fishes were fed with non toxic cockles during 10 days. In this feeding experiment, an increasing of toxin concentration over the exposure period was noticed in the fish gastrointestinal tract. B 1 and dcSTX were the only toxins continuously detected during the exposure/elimination period, which reveal a slower elimination than the others PSTs. These two PSTs were also the main toxins in the mackerel toxin profile, which may suggest a specific PSTs elimination by fish species. Although AST were not detected in any mackerel specimen, in octopus (Octopus vulgaris) specimens captured in the same fishing area, domoic acid (DA) was detected in the digestive glands. This accumulation of DA in the octopus was previously identified. However this is the first time that DA was detected during periods of absence of ASP events. Plus DA was predominantly found in the cytosol which increased the evidence of a retention mechanism. Since DA as a hydrophilic compound should be easily release. This thesis supplies relevant data to the growing knowledge on the dynamics of accumulation and elimination of PSTs and AST in secondary consumers and on the toxin transfer in the marine food web...|$|R

40|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, the {{biological}} invasion by the green algae Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea is {{maybe the most}} striking marine sea-bottom landscape change of the last decades. In this paper, we have synthesized the results of 5 years of studies about the C. cylindracea effects on fish of ecological and economic importance, such as the <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> Diplodus sargus. We found that secondary metabolite of C. cylindracea {{has the potential to}} enter in trophic chains and accumulate in fish tissues. Ecotoxicological analyses made on tissues of the D. sargus specimens showed alterations of some of main antioxidant systems, such as catalase, glutathione peroxidases and total glutathione, and a significant induction of P 450 biotransformation system. We found also that the C. cylindracea based-diet can alter muscle fatty acids composition in the <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> by reducing the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of the n- 3 and n- 6 series, such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA, C 20 : 5), docosahexaenoic (DHA, C 22 : 6) and arachidonic acids (AA, C 20 : 4).

40|$|Biological invasions {{are deemed}} {{as one of}} the most severe threats to {{biodiversity}} and can result in huge economic impacts on natural resources. Many studies have assessed structural changes caused by the introduction of nonindigenous species, but urgent questions remain to be answered about the complex indirect effects of invasive pests on marine biodiversity at the species and ecosystem level. Previous investigations focusing on the biological invasion by Caulerpa racemosa in the Mediterranean indicated that the lipophilic algal metabolite caulerpin accumulates in the tissues of the native edible <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> Diplodus sargus feeding on the exotic alga. The level of caulerpin in D. sargus has been thus used as an indicator of the trophic exposure of the fish to the seaweed and related with adverse effects on the fish health. In the present study, we show that the C. racemosa-based diet can also alter muscle fatty acids composition in the <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> by reducing the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n- 3 and n- 6 series, such as eicosapentaenoic (C 20 : 5), docosahexaenoic (C 22 : 6) and arachidonic acids (C 20 : 4). This represents both a real threat to the health of fish unable to biosynthesize these essential fatty acids and an impoverishment of an important source of essential fatty acids for human nutrition, which helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatic steatosis, cancer and neurological disorders.

Examination of the spatial structure was performed using Nei’s distances and F-statistics, and indicated genetic differences between groups. One group, which clustered Tabarca and Guardamar, could be explained by the small geographical distance between them.

40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} {{patterns}} of connectivity between marine protected areas (MPAs) and neighbouring non-protected areas and the scale at which the benefits of MPAs are expected using the <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> as model species. Location: Marine protected area of Torre Guaceto (TGMPA, Italy) in the south Adriatic Sea. Methods: A multidisciplinary approach was used combining (1) a genetic survey using 12 highly informative microsatellite loci of samples collected within the MPA and in several locations up to 100 km from the MPA; and (2) larval trajectories using Lagrangian simulations based on an oceanographical model of the region that includes specific data on early life-history traits. Both genetic and simulation studies were temporarily replicated during two consecutive years. Results: The overall genetic homogeneity observed indicates that the TGMPA is not isolated {{and that there is}} genetic connectivity among locations across a scale of at least ~ 200 km. A high degree of connectivity between the TGMPA and neighbouring areas is in agreement with Lagrangian simulations, which indicate that <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> larvae can be transported over large distances up to about 300 km. Trajectories released from the TGMPA showed that on average, 12. 75 % of the larvae remains within the TGMPA, while the rest travel south towards non-protected areas. Main conclusions: Our findings highlight the potential benefits of effectively enforced MPAs for neighbouring or relatively distant non-protected fishing areas and the potential connection with other MPAs at regional scale.

However, the stability of observed allele frequencies over time remains poorly tested. The {{aim of this study}} was to show that the genetic structure of D. sargus could significantly change over time by analysing temporal variations in allozymes. In order to determine temporal variation in the genetic structure of 5 natural D. sargus populations in the SW Mediterranean, we screened 14 allozyme loci. Our main finding was the significant genotypic differentiation among cohorts (year-classes) in the Guardamar (FST = 0. 012; p < 0. 001) and Cape of Palos (FST = 0. 008; p < 0. 001) populations. The differentiation observed in the present study when considering pair-wise comparisons between cohorts is similar to that of all populations throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Our results suggest that microgeographical variations, also known as ‘chaotic genetic patchiness’, could occur in D. sargus populations from the SW Mediterranean. The recruitment of genetically variable cohorts at 1 site each year may account for these variations. We also discussed alternative explanations for this genetic pattern.

At concentrations of 0. 1, 0. 117 and 0. 133 mL/L, 2 -phenoxyethanol failed to induce anaesthesia, whereas at concentrations of 0. 167, 0. 2, 0. 3 and 0. 4 mL/L all the fish were anaesthetised within 3 min of exposure. However, mortality was observed with the two higher concentrations. Induction time decreased and recovery time increased with increasing concentrations, being significantly concentration-dependent in both species (P ≤ 0. 01). Following exposure of D. sargus to concentrations of 0. 2 or 0. 3 mL/L, both induction and recovery time were significantly weight-dependent (P ≤ 0. 01). However, erratic weight dependencies of both induction and recovery time were observed in D. puntazzo. 2 -Phenoxyethanol proved to be an effective and safe anaesthetic in both species permitting rapid and uneventful induction and recovery after a 60 -min exposure period.

At a large spatial scale (, 200 km) we investigated natal origin of fish and at a smaller scale (, 30 km) we assessed ‘‘site fidelity’ ’ (i. e. post-settlement dispersal until recruitment). Larvae dispersed from three spawning areas, and a single spawning area supplied post-settlers (proxy of larval supply) to sites spread from 100 to 200 km of coastline. Post-settlement dispersal occurred within the scale examined of, 30 km, although about a third of post-settlers were recruits in the same sites where they settled. Connectivity was recorded both from a MPA to unprotected areas and vice versa. The approach adopted in the present study provides some of the first quantitative evidence of dispersal at both larval and post-settlement stages of a key species in Mediterranean rocky reefs. Similar data taken from a number of species are needed to effectively design both single marine protected areas and networks of marin...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{peptide hormone}} {{cholecystokinin}} (CCK), secreted by the midgut, {{plays a key}} role in digestive physiology of vertebrates including teleosts, by stimulating pancreatic secretion, gut motility, and gallbladder contraction, as well as by delaying gastric emptying. Moreover, CCK is involved in the regulation of food intake and satiation. Secretion of CCK by the hindgut is controversial, and its biological activity remains to be elucidated. The present paper addresses the regional distribution of intestinal CCK in the <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> Diplodus sargus, as well as the possible involvement of hindgut CCK in digestive processes. Methodology/Principal Findings: Full-lengths mRNAs encoding two CCK isoforms (CCK- 1 and CCK- 2) were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. CCK gene and protein expression levels in the different gut segments were measured 3 h and 72 h after feeding, by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Moreover, endocrine CCK cells were immunoistochemically detected. Fasting induced a significant decrease in CCK- 2 in all intestinal segments, including the hindgut. On the other hand, no significant difference was induced by fasting on hindgut CCK- 1. Conclusions/Significance: The results demonstrated two CCK isoforms in the hindgut of D. sargus, one of which (CCK- 2) may be involved in the feedback control of uncompleted digestive processes. On the other hand, a functional role alternative to regulation of digestive processes may be inferred for D. sargus CCK- 1, since its expression was unaffected by feeding o...|$|E

Increasing the {{knowledge}} about littoral fish communities {{is important for}} ecological sciences, fisheries and the sustainability of human communities. The scarcity of baseline data at large spatial scales in a fast-changing world makes it necessary to implement special programs to monitor natural ecosystems. In the present study, we evaluate littoral fish communities using data from spearfishing contests. The Catalan Federation of Underwater Activities (FECDAS) regularly organizes fishing contests across ca. 600 km of coast. Catch records made over the last sixteen years were used to study the fish communities along the coastline. We found two different communities that {{are closely related to}} the habitat configuration at a regional level. Interestingly, contests held on the northern coast were mainly grouped together and were characterized by species that inhabit complex rocky habitats, and contests held on the southern coast were grouped together and were mainly determined by soft bottoms species (i. e. mugilids and Sarpa salpa). In the south group the <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> was also very abundant compared to the north group. No significant changes in the community composition were found in the studied period and we successfully set descriptive baselines. Finally, based on these results we propose that studying the data from fishing contest records can be used to complement the available tools for monitoring fish communities.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the contents of body fat and amino acid contents in flesh of red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Pagrus major) cultured in Yosu, Korea, and Nagasaki, Japan. In view of this purpose, body length and weight, Rohrer and T. M. indexes, body fat and its fatty acid contents, and amino acid contents were investigated. Body length and weight of red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> cultured in Japan were significantly higher than those cultured in Korea. Obese degree estimated by Rohrer and T.

The reactions for specific functional groups were also performed. In the integuments of the <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> the existence of α-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, α-doradexanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene and astaxanthin was confirmed. In the internal organs β-carotene, echinenone, lutein, zeaxanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene and astaxanthin were found. In the integuments of the red <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> the existence of α-cryptoxanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene, lutein (trace), zeaxanthin, 3 -hydroxycanthaxanthin and astaxanthin were clarified. In the internal organs, canthaxnthin, lutein, astaxanthin and P_E- 518 were found. The carotenoids in the <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and the red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were compared, and the most conspicuous differences among them, the <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> contains lutein besides astaxanthin in the integuments, on the contrary, the red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> contains the traces. It is very interesting that the bright red color of the <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> comes from the mixture of astaxanthin (red color), lutein (yellow) and α-doradexanthin (trace). It was confirmed that the <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and the red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> could not convert β-carotene to astaxanthin by feeding β-carotene- 15, 15 '-^ 3 H_ 2, but they could transfer astaxanthin in the diet to their body astaxanthin. The carotenoids in Kinmedai, Beryx splendes Lowe, Amadai, Branchiostegus japonicus, and Akahana, Cephalopholis aurantius, were also extracted, isolated and the metabolic pathway from plant carotenoids to astaxanthin was proposed. When the results and those of previous studies are taken together, consistent patterns are seen. Thus aquatic animals are divided into three classes {{on the basis of}} where astaxanthin is biosynthesized as follows : 1. Prawn-Form, 2. Sea bream-Form, 3. Red carp-Form. Prawn-Form ― The aquatic animals, which belong to this group, can convert β-carotene to their body astaxanthin. Almost all crustacea which contain astaxanthin in their body belong to this group. Prawn, lobster and crab belong to this group. Sea bream-Form ― Can not convert β-carotene, lutein or zeaxanthin to astaxanthin, and can transfer astaxanthin in the diet to body astaxanthin. These animals are carnivorous, and half digested crustacea were found in their stomach. <b>Sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Madai), red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Chidai), Amadai, Kinmedai and Akahana belong to this group. Red carp-Form ― Can convert lutein or zeaxanthin to astaxanthin, but β-carotene is not the major precursor of astaxanthin. They can transfer astaxanthin in the diet to body astaxanthin. These animals contain α-doradexanthin. Gold fish, red carp, fancy red carp, yellow-golden carp, and Benibuna belong to this group...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{antioxidant}} systems in juvenile marine fish of commercial importance in European aquaculture, namely turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) and gilthead <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Sparus aurata). The present dietary trial was specifically designed to investigate the antioxidant effects of vitamin E under moderate oxidising conditions, including high dietary levels of highly unsaturated fatty acids and the feeding of oxidised oils. The objective was to induce a stressful pro-oxidant status to enable characterisation of the biochemical responses to peroxidative stress without causing unnecessary suffering to the experimental animals or high mortalities during the trials. Both <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and turbot showed excellent growth, whereas growth was poorer in halibut. Dietary oxidised oil significantly reduced growth in turbot and especially in halibut, but not in <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Vitamin E improved growth in <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> fed oxidised oil but not in turbot or halibut. However, vitamin E supplementation appeared to improve survival in all three species. In <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and turbot, liver antioxidant defence enzyme activities were generally increased by feeding peroxidised oil and reduced by vitamin E. Conversely, in halibut, the liver antioxidant defence enzyme activities were not increased by feeding peroxidised oil and only superoxide dismutase was reduced by feeding vitamin E. Consistent with these data, feeding oxidised oil increased lipid peroxidation products in halibut, but generally not in <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> or turbot. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation products were generally reduced by dietary vitamin E in both <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and turbot, but not in halibut. Therefore, halibut liver antioxidant defence enzymes did not respond to dietary oxidised oil or vitamin E as occurred in turbot and, especially <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> This resulted in increased levels of lipid peroxides in halibut compared to turbot and <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> in fish given dietary oxidised oil. In addition, supplemental vitamin E did not reduce lipid peroxides in halibut as it did in turbot and <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> The increased peroxidation stress in halibut may account for their poorer growth and survival in comparison to turbot and especially <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Halibut were reared at a lower temperature, although relatively high for halibut, than either turbot or <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> but they were also slightly younger/smaller fish and possibly, therefore, more developmentally immature, and either or all of these factors may be important in the lack of response of the liver enzymes in halibut...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the potential value of hepatic lipids of the <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> Diplodus sargus, as a source of important biomedical components. Fatty acid compositions of hepatic neutral (triacylglycerols) and polar (phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, or phosphatidylethanolamine) lipid fractions were determined. In order to verify the influence of a season on the fatty acid compositions of liver lipid fractions, fish were captured and analyzed in winter, spring, summer and autumn. Eighteen different fatty acids were identified in the analyzed lipid fractions. The major constituents of total fatty acids were saturates: palmitic (16 : 0) and stearic acid (18 : 0), monounsaturated fatty acids: oleic (18 : 1 n- 9) and palmitoleic acid (16 : 1 n- 7), while arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n- 6), eicosapentaenoic (20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6 n- 3) were the major constituents among polyunsaturated fatty acids. Their amounts and ratios differed significantly among seasons in different lipid fractions. Total unsaturated fatty acids in all analyzed lipid fractions were the highest in the winter period. Saturated fatty acids were the highest in the spring period in all lipid fractions. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid achieved the highest values in triacylglycerols in the winter period. Unsaturation indices and n- 3 /n- 6 values were also influenced by the season. This study revealed a seasonality pattern of D. sargus hepatic fatty acid composition...|$|E
40|$|Sequential hermaphroditism, {{commonly}} referred to as sex change or sex reversal, is a striking phenomenon in mating-system evolution and the most remarkable example of sexual plasticity. Among vertebrates, it is specific to teleosts. Some fish species reproduce initially as females and then change into males (protogynous hermaphrodites) or vice versa (protandrous hermaphrodites). The <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> Diplodus sargus, exhibits a high degree of sexual plasticity: populations have been reported to be gonochoristic, protandrous or digynic (with primary females, derived from intersexual juveniles, and secondary females, derived from males). We analysed populations collected from eight different locations across the species distribution range (between the Mediterranean and the North-Eastern Atlantic). These populations are characterized by different degrees of connectivity, spatial demographics and life histories. Using individual-based analyses, we linked the genetic structure of each specimen with environmental heterogeneity, life-history traits and reproductive modes. Our aim is to gather {{a better understanding of the}} variation in reproductive life-history strategies in this sexually plastic species. Diplodus sargus is a valuable candidate organism to investigate sequential hermaphroditism and it also has a commercial value. The application of population genetics tools against the background of life-history theory can bring valuable insights for the management of marine resources. The geographical patterns of sex change (and of age- and size-at-sex change) linked with population genetics can be pivotal for both theoretical investigations and conservation and management plans in marine areas...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the Mediterranean <b>white</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> Diplodus sargus {{includes}} the invasive green alga Caulerpa cylindracea in its diet, with consequent metabolic and enzymatic alterations. As a result of this novel alimentary habit, the bioactive algal red pigment caulerpin has been detected in its tissues. However, this may not be an isolated case: other fish species have also been reported to feed on C. cylindracea, although the possible accumulation of caulerpin in their tissues has not yet been investigated. In this report, we analysed stomach contents and caulerpin levels in the native sparid species Spondyliosoma cantharus, Sarpa salpa, and Diplodus vulgaris, and in the scarid Sparisoma cretense, along with the Lessepsian siganid Siganus luridus. C. cylindracea was found in the stomachs of all but one fish species, the exception being S. cretense, in which prey items could not be determined due to the high degree of digestion. Chemical analysis of fish tissues revealed that only S. cantharus and S. salpa accumulated caulerpin, while no traces of the compound were detected in the other species. Despite intense research efforts on natural products obtained from C. cylindracea, a complete picture of the impacts caused by fish including this alga in their diet has not been elucidated. The identification of caulerpin in other Mediterranean native fish suggests a need for further research in order to assess the possible transfer of such molecules to humans through seafood consumption...|$|E
