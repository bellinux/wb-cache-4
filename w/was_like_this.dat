500|$|Following the management's {{rejection}} of the track, Stewart and Nash dealt it out to other record labels. It was also given to English singer-songwriter Taio Cruz, who failed to convince his record company to release it. It was then opted by Island Def Jam chairman Antonio [...] "L.A." [...] Reid, a friend of Stewart who established his first studio. By early February 2007, the demo was sent to Reid's right-hand woman, A executive Karen Kwak, who passed it along to Reid with a message confirming that they had found a song suited for Rihanna, who was working on her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad, at the time. Reid immediately sent the demo to Rihanna, who was also positive of it: [...] "When the demo first started playing, I <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>This</b> is interesting, this is weird.... But the song kept getting better. I listened to it over and over. I said, 'I need this record. I want to record it tomorrow." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Unbroken" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by OneRepublic leader Ryan Tedder, {{who was behind}} singles such as Beyoncé Knowles' [...] "Halo" [...] (2009) and Leona Lewis' [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] (2007). [...] "Unbroken" [...] was recorded at Artisan Studios in Birmingham, England, and Phil Tan mixed the record at Soapbox Studios, Atlanta, Georgia. Walker was honoured by the opportunity to record a piece of Tedder's work. Walker told the Daily Telegraph, [...] "It is a privilege for me to record a song by the guy who wrote 'Halo' for Beyoncé and 'Bleeding Love' for Leona. He's the man, {{one of the best}} songwriters and producers in the world. I am so blessed." [...] In an interview with MTV Australia he said, [...] "The song is so amazing. When I first heard the song I <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> is a beat song and then I read the lyrics and that's what won me over because it talks about my life, being nothing and being in pieces, but then becoming unbroken." [...] "Unbroken" [...] is a piano-driven pop music ballad, and features a repetitive chorus.|$|E
500|$|Following [...] "The Puppy Episode", Ellen was renewed {{for another}} season. ABC prefaced each episode of season five with a parental {{advisory}} warning. DeGeneres strongly criticized ABC for including the warnings, saying {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> voice like you're entering some kind of radiation center. It was very offensive, and you don't think that's going to affect ratings?" [...] DeGeneres further noted demonstrable hypocrisy on the part of ABC, citing episodes of ABC series The Drew Carey Show and Spin City which included two men kissing (the Carey episode was even promoted using the kiss). [...] "There's no disclaimer on [...] at all, because it's two heterosexual men, and they're making fun of heterosexuality... because neither (Michael J. Fox nor Michael Boatman) is really gay in real life." [...] Episodes after [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] dealt with Ellen's coming out to her parents and boss, quitting her job at the bookstore and finding a series of new jobs. Other episodes dealt with her search for a romantic partner and learning more about the LGBT community. Even some gay people began criticizing the amount of gay content in the series, including Chaz Bono, formerly known as Chastity Bono, who was at the time working for GLAAD. Bono was quoted as saying, [...] " [...] is so gay it's excluding a large part of our society. A lot of the stuff on it is somewhat of an inside joke. It's one thing to have a gay lead character, but it's another when every episode deals with specific gay issues." [...] Bono would later say that the comments were taken out of context. Ellen was canceled after its fifth season.|$|E

2500|$|Searching for the Young Soul Rebels {{has been}} reissued with bonus tracks three times. [...] First, in 1996, the eleven tracks plus seven tracks from [...] singles that Dexys had {{released}} on EMI were issued {{as part of}} an 18-song collection entitled It Was Like This; however, the two sides of Dexys' first single ("Dance Stance" [...] b/w [...] "I'm Just Looking") were included in the original, Bernie Rhodes-produced versions (with Bobby Ward on drums), not the re-recorded Wingfield-produced versions on the album. Then, a remastered edition of the album was released in 2000 for its 20th Anniversary, including two additional tracks: the music videos for [...] "Geno" [...] and [...] "There, There, My Dear". [...] Most recently, a deluxe 30th Anniversary Special Edition was released in 2010 including a bonus disc of outtakes and demos, which includes all of the bonus tracks issued with It <b>Was</b> <b>Like</b> <b>This</b> (tracks 3–8 and 19 on the bonus disk) as well as additional BBC live and demo recordings.|$|E
