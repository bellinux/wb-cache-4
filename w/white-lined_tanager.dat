50|$|The <b>white-lined</b> <b>tanager</b> (Tachyphonus rufus) is a {{medium-sized}} passerine bird. This tanager is a resident breeder from Costa Rica south to northern Argentina, and on Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
50|$|White-shouldered tanagers are 14 cm {{long and}} weigh 14 g. They are long-tailed {{and with a}} mostly black stout pointed bill. The adult male is glossy black, apart from white underwing coverts and a {{conspicuous}} white shoulder patch. The shoulder patch is the most obvious difference from the similar but larger <b>white-lined</b> <b>tanager,</b> in which the smaller white area is rarely visible except in flight.|$|E
5000|$|Pollination {{is mainly}} by bats, and {{as usual in}} such cases the flowers {{do not have a}} {{pleasant}} smell but produce copious thin nectar. Flowers open in the evening and produce nectar throughout the night, ceasing in the early morning. As it seems, each night's last nectar, produced around dawn, is richer in sugars than that produced in the night, though it is much less in quantity already. Moths, nocturnal wasps and ants also visit the flowers at night; the former two might also do some pollinating but they are not known to be of major importance. During the day, the flowers are visited by bees and wasps which feed on remaining pollen. From dusk to the cessation of nectar production, hummingbirds may visit the flowers. While most of them only do this opportunistically, some species [...] - [...] e.g. the fork-tailed woodnymph (Thalurania furcata) and in particular the glittering-throated emerald (Amazilia fimbriata) [...] - [...] appear to visit pequi tree flowers on a regular base. More significantly, visits by small [...] "tanagers" [...] of the Thraupidae and Cardinalidae families around dusk are noted. In particular species like the guira tanager (Hemithraupis guira), <b>white-lined</b> <b>tanager</b> (Tachyphonus rufus) and the palm (Thraupis palmarum) and sayaca tanagers (T. sayaca) seem to be quite fond of pequi flower nectar and spend considerable time feeding on it when available. But even curl-crested jays (Cyanocorax cristatellus) have been observed to hang about flowering pequi trees at daybreak, though perhaps not just for the nectar, considering many insects attracted by it earlier would still be around on the tree. As the stigmata dry out at daybreak, {{it is not clear whether}} birds, particularly tanagers, play a role in pollination also or are merely making use of an easy early-morning snack, particularly considering that during the flowering season of C. brasiliense, little such food is available.|$|E

50|$|Adult <b>white-lined</b> <b>tanagers</b> are 18.5 cm {{long and}} weigh 33 g. They are long-tailed {{and with a}} mostly black stout pointed bill. The adult male is glossy black, apart from white underwing coverts and a small white patch on the upperwing. These white areas are {{conspicuous}} in flight but otherwise rarely visible. Females and immatures are entirely rufous in plumage, somewhat paler below.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{latitudinal}} {{variation in}} avian life-history traits {{has been a}} focus of many demographic studies around the world. However, we still know little about annual or intra-annual demographic variation within tropical regions or about how factors such as breeding season and precipitation influence demographic rates. In this study, we estimated intra-annual apparent survival of the <b>White-lined</b> <b>Tanager</b> (Tachyphonus rufus) using capture-mark-recapture data from northeastern Brazil. We tested whether survival varied seasonally (breeding vs. non-breeding), with rainfall, by age and residence status in our study area. Intra-annual apparent survival was correlated with the reproductive cycle, being lower during the breeding (0. 65 ± 0. 16 SE) vs. the non-breeding season (0. 97 ± 0. 05 SE). The annual apparent survival (~ 0. 6) was relatively low for a tropical species. In both years, we observed highest abundance in spring (November, 3. 1 - 3. 7 birds/ha) and lowest abundance in autumn-winter periods (May-August, 1. 1 - 1. 4 bird/ha). The low survival during the breeding season probably reflects the trade-off between survival and reproduction {{and the cost of}} reproduction. Our findings represent an advance in the understanding of the demography of tropical birds because we did not find a predicted high annual apparent survival, and we elucidated some aspects of intra-annual variation in survival. Further exploration of latitudinal variation in demographic traits, especially in diverse, but poorly known habitats is needed to fully vet and develop life history theories...|$|E
