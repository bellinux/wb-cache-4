5|$|Another {{educational}} work is De schematibus et tropis sacrae scripturae, which {{discusses the}} Bible's use of rhetoric. Bede <b>was</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> pagan authors such as Virgil, {{but it was}} not considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar from such texts, and in De schematibus... Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature. Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples.|$|E

5|$|The pose of Musidora {{is based}} on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is {{possible}} that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements.

Having designed landscape along Chinatown's Cermak Avenue, Wong <b>was</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> {{the community and}} invited the public to voice their opinions and ideas for the future park. The park's original design called for walled plazas inspired by traditional Chinese gardens in Suzhou, China. This design was scrapped, however, because of security and vandalism concerns. Instead, a system of pathways was created to link defined spaces and mimic courtyards.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann <b>was</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> differential and integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E

Francis William Aston had used it to partially separate isotopes of neon in 1931, and Gustav Ludwig Hertz had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running it through a series of stages.

5|$|The {{emotional}} {{story is}} inspired by Maxim Gorky's sentimental novel Mother, which is considered the first socialist realist novel, and a story that Han <b>was</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with.</b> Myers traces the story's foundation back to anti-Christian stories in rural colonial Korea {{as well as in}} fascist Japan. The metaphor of the villain as a beast, too, is more readily associated with wartime Japanese propaganda than socialist realism. It had, however, featured in the works of early Soviet writers as whose work Han knew, as well as in textual genres not bound by the official socialist realist dogma, such as journalism.|$|E

More {{experienced}} actors, including Atiqah Hasiholan and Reza Rahadian (who had received two Citra Awards), were also cast. Hasiholan later stated that it had been her most challenging role yet, citing the cultural differences between the Bajau and what she <b>was</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> as well as her unprecedented need to act as a mother. In preparing for their roles, Hasiholan exercised slicing and dicing fish, while Rahadian went to Ancol in North Jakarta to learn about dolphins.|$|E
