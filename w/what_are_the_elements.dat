60|$|Let us {{illustrate}} these somewhat general maxims {{by examining}} their {{application to the}} philosophy of space, for {{it is only in}} application that the meaning or importance of a method can be understood. Suppose we are confronted with the problem of space as presented in Kant's Transcendental Æsthetic, and suppose we wish to discover <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> of the problem and what hope there is of obtaining a solution of them. It will soon appear that three entirely distinct problems, belonging to different studies, and requiring different methods for their solution, have been confusedly combined in the supposed single problem with which Kant is concerned. There is a problem of logic, a problem of physics, and a problem of theory of knowledge. Of these three, the problem of logic can be solved exactly and perfectly; the problem of physics can probably be solved with as great a degree of certainty and as great an approach to exactness as can be hoped in an empirical region; the problem of theory of knowledge, however, remains very obscure and very difficult to deal with. Let us see how these three problems arise.|$|E

Given a drama expressed in some medium (text, video, audio, etc.), the process of metadata annotation identifies <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> that characterize the drama and annotates such elements in some metadata format.
