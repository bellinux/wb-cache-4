5|$|Joined by Howe and re-designated Task Force 57, the British Pacific Fleet {{was again}} {{involved}} in operations in late March 1945, when it launched {{attacks on the}} Sakishimo-Gunto airfields, a task it repeated in early May. On 4 May 1945 King George V led battleships and cruisers in a forty-five-minute bombardment of Japanese air facilities in the Ryukyu Islands. As the Allies approached the Japanese homeland, King George V was dispatched in mid-July to join the US battleships in a bombardment of industrial installations at Hitachi. King George V fired 267 rounds from her 14-inch guns during this operation. The task force {{then moved on to}} Hamamatsu in southern Honshu, where it carried out a further bombardment of aviation factories. During the Okinawa campaign, the battleship supported four fast carriers of the British Pacific Fleet. Her last offensive action <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> bombardment of Hamamatsu on 29 and 30 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held; {{there were two}} 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Since Singapore <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> race, the practice sessions started at a later local time; 18:00 {{for the first and}} 21:30 for the second session on Friday. This meant that the gap between the first two practice sessions was half an hour shorter than in other races. The two Mercedes cars were fastest in the first session on Friday, with Nico Rosberg topping the time sheets at 1:47.995. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton was second, 0.319 seconds behind, while Daniel Ricciardo was 0.017 seconds slower in third, ahead of the two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen, even though Vettel briefly left the track in turn five {{towards the end of the}} session. While Ricciardo felt he could go even faster, his teammate Daniil Kvyat was able to put in only eight laps due to a fuel system problem, and he finished the session eighteenth, just ahead of the two Manor Marussia drivers. Manor's Alexander Rossi placed last, albeit close to teammate Will Stevens, before crashing out at turn 18, ending the last timed runs of all other drivers left on track.|$|E

King George V and Duke of York were present at the official Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay. After the end of World War II, King George V became the flagship of the Home Fleet until December 1946, when it became a training vessel, before being scrapped in 1957. Duke of York became the flagship of the Home Fleet after King George V, until April 1949, before being scrapped in 1957. Howe returned to Portsmouth in January 1946 and spent the remainder of her career there before being scrapped in 1957. Anson briefly served as the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet and helped to re-occupy Hong Kong, however, in 1949 she was placed into reserve before being scrapped in 1957.|$|E

500|$|On November 19, 2012, Aguilera and Shelton {{performed}} [...] "Just a Fool" [...] for {{the first}} time on the third season of The Voice, an American television singing competition on which she is serviced as a coach. Wearing [...] "sharp in dark", [...] "semi-casual" [...] outfits, the couple sang the first verse at opposite sides of the stage, and then came together onstage and shared the second one. During the performance, Aguilera kept belting to a minimum. The duo ended their singing with a hug. Caila Ball from Idolator wrote, [...] "Clumsy cross-promotions and hyperbole aside, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> of stellar performances, kicked off by Coaches Christina and Blake making the world debut of 'Just a Fool'". She continued to praise the performance, commenting, [...] "It was a refreshingly stripped down performance from Legendtina – who uncharacteristically took the stage in jeans. Blake, on the other hand, looked a little awkward up there without a guitar and a stool".|$|E
500|$|On Salta Moss, an area {{of common}} land next to the hamlet, a Bronze Age rapier (a kind of sword) was {{discovered}} in the 1980s, proving that the area was settled by ancient Britons millennia ago. The rapier currently resides in the Tullie House Museum in Carlisle, and archaeologists date it as being crafted as early as 1100 BC. Two perforated axe-hammers and a polished axe dated to the Neolithic period were unearthed at nearby Mawbray. After the arrival of Romans in Britain, the area around Salta was fortified {{as part of the}} coastal defences which extended beyond the western end of Hadrian's Wall. By the 1550s, Salta participated in a system called [...] "seawake", which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> watch to guard the coast against incursions across the Solway by the Scots. These incursions were frequent, and on one occasion in 1592 at Dubmill, near Salta, a Mr Barwise the local miller was taken prisoner by Scottish raiders.|$|E
500|$|The sexually suggestive {{performances}} of [...] "Skin" [...] {{have been met}} with mixed reactions from critics. The Daily Mail was critical of the routine; they branded it [...] "lewd", compared the routine with Rihanna's previous sexual performances and voiced {{the belief that the}} singer had [...] "outdone herself" [...] with the [...] "raunchy and overtly sexualised" [...] routine. A few months later, the paper claimed that Rihanna had [...] "pushed the boundaries" [...] by lap dancing an older man at her show in Barbados and a review for the Evening Herald voiced similar sentiments, arguing that Rihanna's [...] "good girl gone bad image is getting tired". The Daily Record praised Rihanna's Glasgow performance but argued that the lap dance {{at the end of the}} [...] "Skin" [...] routine was [...] "a move that had parents covering their children's eyes". Catriona Stewart Lotte Jeffs, editor of ES Magazine, was one of the audience members who received a lap dance from Rihanna and reacted positively, saying [...] "t <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> I will never forget".|$|E

500|$|Jumpers was {{scheduled}} to appear at the National Theatre {{at the start of}} 1972, but encountered problems when the theatre's director, Laurence Olivier, called the play [...] "unintelligible" [...] before walking out during the first read-through in disgust. Despite this, rehearsals went ahead, which the cast found difficult; the play featured many scenes, a complicated script, and relied heavily on the opening scene, a sceptical speech about the existence of God which lasted 13 minutes. In his autobiography, Hordern commented: [...] "Each day my fists would sink into my cardigan pockets as I tried {{to make sense of it}} all." [...] In a meeting shortly before the opening night, Olivier complained to Stoppard that the play was overlong and, in some parts, laborious. Stoppard agreed to reduce the epilogue by half. The decision angered Hordern as it meant the extra stress of learning a new script at short notice. [...] He vented his frustrations on Wood who agreed to leave his character alone and instead to cut many of the other scenes. The final dress rehearsal also experienced disruption when the revolving stage broke down and had to be fixed half-way through. The problems had ceased by the opening performance the following evening; it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> which Hordern called [...] "unbelievable, one of the highlights of my career". [...] The actress Maureen Lipman, who was in the audience on the opening night, said that her husband, the playwright Jack Rosenthal, had [...] "laughed so hard he thought he was going to be seriously ill".|$|E
500|$|It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> of {{contrasting}} emotions at Home Park. A 2–0 win for {{the visitors}} confirmed Argyle's relegation to League One and Newcastle's promotion back to the Premier League as champions at the first attempt. Hours after the match, the club's board declared that it remained determined to steer {{it to the top}} flight of English football. Paul Mariner reaffirmed his commitment to the club, vowing to put things right. [...] "I feel the pain of the supporters because this is the club that gave me my first start," [...] he said. [...] "The reason I came here was because of the vision that the club can get into the Premiership. Now we've got another couple of hurdles before we do that but I firmly believe that we can do it." [...] Argyle's penultimate game of the season took place at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest, who had already qualified for the play-off's, and they secured a comfortable 3–0 victory against the relegated side. The club signed off their campaign with another home defeat against Peterborough United on 2 May. Argyle took the lead in the first-half from a fine individual goal from Wright-Phillips but conceded two goals after the break to Craig Mackail-Smith. Four days later, the club announced that they would be searching for a new manager, with Paul Mariner reverting to his original role as head coach. He said: [...] "I am disappointed that we could not produce the results we wanted last season. I am a realist and understand why and how the board came to the conclusion they have done. I am committed to this club and want only to help it regain Championship status as soon as possible and build on that." [...] Work on a new state-of-the-art Fibrelastic pitch at Home Park began the following week.|$|E
