50|$|In 1956-57, the Pipe Band was {{authorized}} for the College and was under process of formation and training being {{guided by the}} Padre, Major Jack Armstrong. Sgt. Mackenzie and Sgt. Blackely of the R.C.A.F. pipe band at Rockcliffe provided the pipers and drummers with professional instruction. A position of Cadet <b>Wing</b> <b>Band</b> Officer was created; C.F.L. Cooke, the pipe-major, trained new members and {{was responsible for the}} general direction of the band. Major-General J.B.D. Smith, CBE, DSO, CD, Commandant of the National Defence College remarked to the Cadet Wing that the 1956 parade was a special one because it marked the return of the famous pill-boxes and the first appearance of the RMC pipe-band on a ceremonial parade. Much more extensive use has been made of the pipe band this year than ever before. The pipe band performed on parades, sporting events, and special occasions; the band performed at three ceremonial parades in the first term and at many of the football games, several hockey games and the West Point hockey game. The band acquired new pipe bag covers, new side drums, and the mace and sash carried by Cadet Doyle, the drum-major.|$|E
5000|$|In 1954, {{the band}} was devoted mainly to reorganization, {{rebuilding}} and practice in the drafting room and Kingston Armouries {{under the direction of}} C.F.L. Hewitt. Through the Staff Advisor, Captain Botting, {{the band was}} permitted sufficient time for practices. Since the experience and talent of the founding cadets was lost to the band through graduation, one-half of this year's band were playing for the first time. The first cadet to hold the position of Cadet <b>Wing</b> <b>Band</b> Officer at RMC was 3527 Bruce Cooke.Bruce Cooke, {{the only member of the}} band who had ever played in a pipe band before coming to R.M.C., provided advice and patient instruction of the pipers. Many new members were trained; a long process when teaching pipes. Royal Roads Military College provided RMC with four pipers and a drummer while Royal Military College Saint-Jean provided a piper. Following C.F.L. Hewitt’s policy of [...] "a good band, or no band at all", the band's first public performance was not made until a high degree of proficiency had been reached when they provided half-time entertainment at a sports night in January 1955. The band played relatively simple tunes such as 'Scotland the Brave', 'The Brown Haired Maiden.' [...] for College church parades, and marched the Wing into Kingston on the second Sunday in March 1955.|$|E
