[...] "The insert {{shots of the}} Ferrari were of the real 250 GT California", Hughes {{explains}} in the DVD commentary. [...] "The cars we used in the wide shots were obviously reproductions. There were only 100 of these cars, so it <b>was</b> <b>way</b> <b>too</b> expensive to destroy. We {{had a number of}} replicas made. They were pretty good, but for the tight shots I needed a real one, so we brought one in to the stage and shot the inserts with it." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} television sources and critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode 7.5/10 and said: [...] "While it featured more than [...] {{a couple of}} genuinely unfunny ideas, this episode succeeds for the most part. [...] While this episode definitely won't make anyone's top ten list of great Family Guy, there was a much better balance between random humor and storytelling in this outing". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, and said that Family Guy [...] "started things out {{on the wrong foot}} with an oh-so-relevant Jackass storyline. [...] Most of the Jackass stuff <b>was</b> <b>way</b> <b>too</b> stale–Peter jackknifing Quagmire into the crate of bees notwithstanding–but thankfully it was just setup for a far superior storyline, the introduction of a younger 'New Brian'".|$|E

[...] Rewatching the episode in 2014, Myles McNutt stated that [...] "Solitary" [...] and [...] "Raised by Another" [...] felt like [...] "the first that go all-in on Lost as a serialized mystery," [...] in part as Claire's story {{is the first to}} reveal a character's destined voyage to the island in the form of flashbacks.

According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until it <b>was</b> <b>way</b> <b>too</b> late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] just find something to go back and change." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Vaughan {{has written}} for television, and has {{endeavored}} to have his previous works adapted into film, he stresses that he developed Saga strictly to be a comic book {{and not to be}} adapted to other media, explaining [...] "I wanted to do something that <b>was</b> <b>way</b> <b>too</b> expensive to be TV and too dirty and grown-up to be a four-quadrant blockbuster." [...] Vaughan has also indicated that he has an ending in mind for the series and that he plans five issues ahead, having written the first six issues as the first story arc, which would have ended with the two main characters dying on the rocketship launch pad in issue 5 if the series had not been successful. By June 2016, Vaughan indicated that he knew what the last page of the series' final issue would be.|$|E

The video was shot between those of [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] and [...] "Green Light", and took about one and half days of filming. Jay-Z performed his rap scenes first, [...] afterwards Knowles studied his scene, and then did her impersonation of him. Melina said: [...] "If anybody knows Jay-Z, it would be Beyoncé". Knowles commented on her impersonation of Jay-Z on MTV, [...] "I love what I did in [...] because it's completely out of my character, {{or at least the}} character that people think I am. I was pretending to be Jay, and he was there, and I told him he had to leave, because I couldn't do it with him in the room — it <b>was</b> <b>way</b> <b>too</b> embarrassing. I think I did a pretty good job. I had the lip curl down!" [...] The video premiered on February 28, 2007, on BET's 106 & Park, with the video for Knowles' other single release, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] (2007) featuring Shakira, premiering the same day on Total Request Live (TRL).|$|E

500|$|Mark Robson was {{strongly}} considered {{and was in}} talks to direct, but after seeing The Omen, the producers hired Richard Donner. Donner had previously been planning [...] when he was hired in January 1977 for $1million to direct Superman and Superman II. Donner felt {{it was best to}} start from scratch. [...] "They had prepared the picture for a year and not one bit was useful to me." [...] Donner was dissatisfied with the campy script and brought in Tom Mankiewicz to perform a rewrite. According to Mankiewicz [...] "not a word from the Puzo script was used." [...] "It was a well-written, but still a ridiculous script. It was 550 pages. I said, 'You can't shoot this screenplay because you'll be shooting for five years'," [...] Donner continued. [...] "That was literally a shooting script and they planned to shoot all 550 pages. You know, 110 pages is plenty for a script, so even for two features, that <b>was</b> <b>way</b> <b>too</b> much." [...] Mankiewicz conceived having each Kryptonian family wear a crest resembling a different letter, justifying the 'S' on Superman's costume. The Writers Guild of America refused to credit Mankiewicz for his rewrites, so Donner gave him a creative consultant credit, much to the annoyance of the Guild.|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{felt that}} [...] "Retreat to Move Forward" [...] {{was one of}} the best episodes of an uneven season. Sepinwall, however, felt it [...] "petered out" [...] towards the end, and that the Tracy and Kenneth plot did not work until it met the Jenna and Frank story. He noted that without the addition of a guest star, [...] "this one made good use of virtually the entire cast". IGN contributor Robert Canning enjoyed Liz and Jack's relationship in the episode. Canning felt that while the show occasionally hints at a romantic relationship between the two, they should never become linked. In his opinion, the episode demonstrated their non-romantic friendship [...] "perfectly". Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad liked the episode, but noted [...] "...it's the second week in a row where one of the plots <b>was</b> <b>way</b> <b>too</b> over the top for me." [...] Sassone wrote that he was not thrilled with the Kenneth and Tracy plot, citing that it was [...] "way too silly and loud". TV Guides Matt Mitovich said that [...] "Retreat to Move Forward" [...] was [...] "nother very funny, super-huge-guest-star-free episode". Rick Porter of Zap2it reported that he found himself [...] "more attracted" [...] to the second-tier plots than to the Jack and Liz plot, observing that it [...] "had its moments, but the overall story didn't hit too many new notes in their relationship. [...] So yeah, some funny bits here and there with the main story... But we've seen this kind of dynamic between Liz and Jack before, and so it didn't have the same comedic force as in the past." [...] Kevin D. Thompson for The Palm Beach Post praised 30 Rock for doing a perfect job with its three plots in the episode, and said that Jenna's line, [...] "The academy loves dead singers and the handicapped. And Janis was both!", was [...] "ands-down, the funniest line of the show." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{basketball}} observers, {{in addition}} to Abdul-Jabbar, believe that Kareem's reticence, whether through disdain for the press corps or simply because of introversion, contributed to the dearth of coaching opportunities offered to Abdul-Jabbar by the NBA.

Abdul-Jabbar said: [...] "I didn't understand that I also had affected people that way and that's what it was all about. I always saw it like they were trying to pry. I <b>was</b> <b>way</b> <b>too</b> suspicious and I paid a price for it."
