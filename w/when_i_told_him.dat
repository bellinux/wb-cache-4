He almost fell out of his chair <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I was only 18." [...] Molly Ringwald had also wanted to play Sloane, but {{according}} to Ringwald, [...] "John wouldn't let me do it: he said that the part wasn't big enough for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Two years later, on 5 April 2007, Chanderpati {{last saw}} Manoj. [...] "He ate his food {{and left to}} sleep at the shop since he had a class XII {{compartment}} exam in English {{to take the next}} day. Unlike other days, next morning, he did not show up." [...] The following day Babli's uncle arrived to speak with Manoj. According to Chanderpati, [...] "He said he had come to recover some money that Manoj had borrowed, had tea and left <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that Manoj was away for an exam. We only discovered late in the evening that Babli, too, was missing and the two had run away." [...] Manoj had eloped with Babli to Chandigarh and married her on 7 April at a Durga temple, their commitment to one another transcending their willingness to abide by the societal norms.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Macaluso, outdoor {{editor of}} the Baton Rouge Morning Advocate {{recalled}} a fishing trip with Gresham on Toledo Bend Reservoir at the Texas-Louisiana boundary. Macaluso described Gresham as [...] "the most famous of all Louisiana outdoors writers and media members... He was like a loaf of good French bread, crusty-hard {{on the outside and}} tender on the inside. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that, he laughed [...] 'Don’t tell anyone else'..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'E's a beastly little rascal, that's wot 'e is," [...] {{said the}} indignant Bill, who had {{surprised}} himself by his powers of narration; [...] "fancy larfin' <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> of pitchin' {{the baby to}} the sharks." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{asked me}} what <b>I</b> read, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> a thin smile fluttered across his white face.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} explain to 'im who would be doing the heaving, but 'e wouldn't listen to me. He sat on them ledgers like a little wooden image, looking up at me and shaking his 'ead, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> of storms and shipwrecks he just smacked 'is lips and his blue eyes shone with joy. Arter a time I saw it was no good trying to persuade 'im, and I pretended to give way.|$|R
2500|$|Konoe {{justified}} his demission to {{his secretary}} Kenji Tomita. [...] "Of course His Imperial Majesty is a pacifist and {{he wished to}} avoid war. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that to initiate war was a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: 'You were worried about it yesterday {{but you do not}} have to worry so much.' Thus, gradually he began to lead to war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more to war. I felt the Emperor was telling me: 'My prime minister does not understand military matters. I know much more.' In short, the Emperor had absorbed the view of the army and the navy high commands." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{present perfect}} {{is used for}} single actions or events (stamattina sono andato a scuola [...] "I went to school this morning"), or change in state (si è arrabbiato quando gliel’ho detto [...] "he got angry <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that"), {{contrasting}} with the imperfect which is used for habits (andavo in bicicletta a scuola ogni mattina [...] "I {{used to go to}} school by bike every morning"), or repeated actions, not happening at a specific time (si arrabbiava ogni volta che qualcuno glielo diceva [...] "he got angry every time someone told him that"). Italians — with the notable exception of Southerners — typically use the present perfect also when referring to ancient facts, in a similar fashion to French.|$|E
2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E

6000|$|... "Whose is it, then, gal?" [...] {{demanded the}} deacon, sharply. [...] "Gar'ner had some such silly notion {{in his head}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of this treasure; but I soon brought him to hear reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay a moment," [...] said Sergeant Drooce, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> {{without causing}} a {{movement}} in a muscle of his face: [...] "look to your pouch, my lad. You Tom Packer, look to your pouch, confound you! Look to your pouches, all you Marines." ...|$|R
2500|$|Describing the {{composition}} of [...] "Oh Yeah", the album's best known track, Blank said, [...] "First I did the music and then I invited Dieter to sing along, and {{he came up with}} some lines which I thought, 'no Dieter, it's too complicated, we don't need that many lyrics'. I had the idea of just this guy, a fat little monster sits there very relaxed and says, [...] "Oh yeah, oh yeah". So I told him, 'Why don't you try just to sing on and on 'oh yeah'?... Dieter was very angry <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> this and he said, 'are you crazy, all the time [...] "Oh yeah"? Are you crazy?! I can't do this, no no, come on, come on.' And then he said, 'some lyrics, like [...] "the moon... beautiful", is this too much?!' and I said, 'no, it's OK', and then he did this 'oh yeah' and at the end he thought, 'yeah it's nice', he loved it himself also. And also I wanted to install lots of human noises, all kind of phonetic rhythms with my mouth; you hear lots of noises in the background which are done with my mouth." ...|$|E
6000|$|I took Sergeant Daw {{into the}} study, {{so that we}} should be alone <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the news. It {{surprised}} even his iron self-control <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the method of the waking. I was myself surprised in turn by his first words: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that Hooja {{had stolen}} her, he stamped {{his foot in}} rage.|$|E
60|$|He drove rapidly off as {{the clock}} struck six, and an uneasy glance he gave the upper windows did not escape me. <b>When</b> Farrar appeared, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what had happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hoot, ay," [...] says he, [...] "and a {{very honest}} man. And, O, by-the-by," [...] says he, [...] "was it you {{that came in}} with Ebenezer?" [...] And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> yes, [...] "Ye'll be no friend of his?" [...] he asked, meaning, in the Scottish way, that I would be no relative.|$|R
5000|$|Jeff Porcaro was {{initially}} dubious, {{and found it}} hard to believe that Fleetwood, a drummer he admired, had no clue what he was doing. [...] "It was only after we continued to talk that Jeff realized I wasn't kidding around. We eventually had a tremendous laugh about it, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> later <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> was dyslexic, it finally made sense." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was quite}} {{reassured}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> Wada had brought along fifty thousand rounds for me.|$|E
60|$|It was a weary work, but {{eventually}} she consented to forgive him. His joy, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> was boundless.|$|E
60|$|And he {{was about}} to rebuke me hotly, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I had come from Maryland, where I was born.|$|E
5000|$|In Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited (1945), Oxford {{undergraduate}} Anthony Blanche {{claims that}} [...] "I was lunching with my p-p-preposterous tutor.

60|$|I thanked him; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of our {{escape and}} our destination, {{he insisted on}} {{accompanying}} us to the sea with {{a great number of}} his fierce males. Nor were we at all loath to accept his escort. We found the canoe where I had hidden it, and bidding Gr-gr-gr and his warriors farewell, the three of us embarked for the mainland.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} {{it would be}} wrong! That was what I meant by wanting to be fai'a with Mr. Gregory <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you about <b>him</b> there in Florence. I don't believe but what it had begun then." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was really}} devoted to me, I believe. But he cheered up <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that I had {{recommended}} him for my successor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Show him {{how you can}} jump," [...] {{interrupted}} Danny Meadow Mouse. [...] "He wouldn't {{believe me}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that you didn't fly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{about your}} owning Prime Minister he got savage and {{declared}} that was the very reason why I shouldn't go." ...|$|E
6000|$|SAVOYARD. Well, I {{was rather}} in a funk about him. Hes {{not exactly what}} I call approachable; {{and he was a}} bit {{stand-off}} at first. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> explained and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> your daughter-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I {{the honor}} of {{speaking}} to Mr. Roylake?" [...] he asked. His quiet steady manner prepossessed me in his favour; it showed no servile reverence for the accident of birth, on the one hand, and no insolent assertion of independence, on the other. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that my name was Roylake, he searched {{one of the large}} pockets of his shooting jacket, produced a letter, and silently offered it to me.|$|R
60|$|We went {{thoroughly}} {{into the}} business of the purchase of the estate at Purfleet. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I inscribe here.|$|R
60|$|Jack's face, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about it, was so woebegone that I felt {{a stab of}} remorse, even in {{the heyday}} of my delight.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stebbing said Maura {{changed a}} five-pound note,' put in Fergus; 'and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to shut up, {{for it was}} all bosh, he punched me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{asked how}} many had come with Sergeant Corney, an' <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> he said that {{all three of us}} could go with the detachment." ...|$|E
6000|$|My uncle said he {{was very}} sorry he had forgotten. He said he {{believed}} in the old saying: [...] "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." [...] He asked me where I was going and, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> a second time he asked me did I know The Arab's Farewell to his Steed. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> left the kitchen {{he was about to}} recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt.|$|R
6000|$|At breakfast, the Indian, evidently {{curious to}} know what would be {{expected}} of him the next day, asked me how I spent the Sunday <b>when</b> at home. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> commonly sat in my chamber reading, etc., in the forenoon, and went {{to walk in the}} afternoon.

6000|$|... "That afternoon, {{as soon as}} I {{was alone}} with Bernard,--I did not give him any time to show me any of his common-acquaintance coolness,--I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the whole thing from {{beginning}} to end. He listened so earnestly that one might have thought he was in church; but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came to the part about his boarding with George and Miss Temple {{he could not help}} laughing. He excused himself, however, and told me to go on. He looked very happy <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> my story, and no one would have supposed that he had ever assumed the air of a mere common acquaintance.|$|R
