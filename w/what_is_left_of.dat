5|$|A log {{portion of}} the {{original}} Oklahoma Row was moved north and now sits {{on the east side}} of Highway 94 in Monte Ne. It is used for storage. The three-story concrete-and-stone tower still stands and remains above water on the edge of Beaver Lake. This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the honeymoon suite. Monte Ne was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 because of the historic significance of being so closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering. Despite this, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe neglect and vandalism. It is covered with spray paint and graffiti, as well as being cracked and full of debris. In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had climbed to the top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney. Because of this incident and the general state of the remains, the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed wire fence around the tower.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Sue Ellen {{goes into}} {{business}} by buying a partnership {{interest in a}} lingerie company. She successfully lures J.R.'s latest mistress, Mandy Winger, away from J.R. by offering her a promising career as model and then as an actress. Sue Ellen and J.R. enjoy a brief reconciliation; however, J.R.'s desire to regain Ewing Oil by {{having an affair with}} Kimberly Cryder destroys <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> their marriage. Sue Ellen decides to leave J.R. for good, but he manages to take John Ross away and put him into hiding in a boarding school. Sue Ellen and her new lover, Nicholas Pearce, confront J.R. at his penthouse and demand he tell them where he hid John Ross. A scuffle breaks out between J.R. and Nicholas, which results in Nicholas' being thrown over the balcony and killed. In response, Sue Ellen shoots J.R. three times; however, he lives and neither she nor J.R. is indicted for any crimes.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} {{must then}} defeat the God Beasts {{before they can}} gather and destroy the world. However, after doing this they realize killing the God Beasts has given more power to their main enemy, who their personal enemies were working for—the Dragon Emperor for Duran and Angela, the Dark Prince for Hawk and Lise, and the Masked Mage for Kevin and Carlie. The already powerful villain absorbs {{the power of the}} Sword of Mana and the God Beasts in order to become a god, but is halted by the Mana Goddess blocking some of its power. After defeating the villain's minions, the characters go and defeat their main enemy, but are unable to stop him from destroying the Mana Tree and eliminating all Mana from the world. The Faerie then fuses with <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the Mana Tree; she will be reborn as the Mana Goddess in a thousand years, but until then Mana will not exist in the world. As the game ends, the characters go back to their homelands.|$|E

25|$|Early Islamic {{philosophy}} and Islamic metaphysics, imbued {{as it is}} with Islamic theology, distinguishes more clearly than Aristotelianism between essence and existence. Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental.

The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from Occasionalism can be seen in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> his work.|$|E

In 1966, he donated that property to the corporate-municipal County of San Bernardino which then made the town of Calico, California into a public historic park, for which it charged an entrance/parking fee.

25|$|The initial crust, {{formed when}} the Earth's surface first solidified, totally {{disappeared}} {{from a combination}} of this fast Hadean plate tectonics and the intense impacts of the Late Heavy Bombardment. However, it is thought that it was basaltic in composition, like today's oceanic crust, because little crustal differentiation had yet taken place. The first larger pieces of continental crust, which is a product of differentiation of lighter elements during partial melting in the lower crust, appeared {{at the end of the}} Hadean, about 4.0Ga. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> these first small continents are called cratons. These pieces of late Hadean and early Archean crust form the cores around which today's continents grew.|$|E

25|$|The Alpini, as well {{as their}} Austrian counterparts: Kaiserschützen, Standschützen and Landeschützen {{occupied}} every hill and mountain top around the whole year. Huge underground bases were drilled and blown into the mountainsides and even deep into the ice of glaciers such as the Marmolada. Guns were dragged by hundreds of troops on mountains up to 3,890 m (12,760 feet) high. Roads, cable cars, mountain railroads and walkways were built up, through and along the steepest of cliffs. Many of these walkways and roads are still visible today, and many are maintained as Via Ferrata for climbing enthusiasts.

Unlike Eastern Yiddish, which is spoken to some degree by Polish and American Jews, Western Yiddish has almost disappeared.

25|$|Post-Irradiation Examination (PIE) is {{the study}} of used nuclear {{materials}} such as nuclear fuel. It has several purposes. It is known that by examination of used fuel that the failure modes which occur during normal use (and {{the manner in which the}} fuel will behave during an accident) can be studied. In addition information is gained which enables the users of fuel to assure themselves of its quality and it also assists in the development of new fuels. After major accidents the core (or <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> it) is normally subject to PIE to find out what happened. One site where PIE is done is the ITU which is the EU centre for the study of highly radioactive materials.|$|E
