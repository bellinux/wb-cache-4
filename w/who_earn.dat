The war room was located at 15, Rakabganj Road and kept track of 160 Lok Sabha constituencies where the party needed to boost its preparations. The Congress party initiated its election campaign in January 2014. It gave extra focus to the new middle class of India which was above the poverty line but not enough rich to be in middle class. This new economic class comprises 700 million people out of the country's total population of 1.2 billion. This class includes railway coolies, servants, rickshaw-pullers, labourers, fishermen, guards and other people <b>who</b> <b>earn</b> their living by doing minor chores.|$|E

40|$|We {{contend that}} {{preferences}} for mates with resources or money might be calibrated on where a potential mate gets her/his money. In three studies (N = 668) {{we examined the}} nature of individuals’ preferences for mates who have resources or money. Both sexes preferred a long-term mate <b>who</b> has <b>earned</b> her/his money over other sources. In particular, women preferred mates <b>who</b> <b>earned</b> their money over other potential means of getting resources (i. e., inheritance, embezzlement, and windfall). Women maintained {{a high level of}} interest in mates <b>who</b> <b>earned</b> their money regardless of duration of the mateship whereas men became less interested in a mate <b>who</b> <b>earned</b> her money in the context of short-term relationships. Overall, the sexes preferred a mate <b>who</b> <b>earned</b> their money more strongly in the long-term than the short-term context. Results are discussed from evolutionary and sociocultural models of mate preferences...|$|R

25|$|In 2006 {{households}} that earn between $25,000 and $75,000 represent approximately the middle {{half of the}} income distribution tables provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Over the past two decades, the number of households in those brackets decreased by 3.9%, from 48.2% to 44.3%. During the same time period, the number of households with incomes below $25,000 decreased 3.5%, from 28.7% to 25.2%, {{while the number of}} households with incomes above $75,000 increased over 7%, from 23.2% to 30.4%. A possible explanation for the increase in the higher earnings categories is that more households now have two wage earners. However, a closer analysis reveals all of the 7% increase can be found in households <b>who</b> <b>earn</b> over $100,000.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Congress {{took up the}} reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which {{provides}} health care for about 6 million children and 670,000 adults from families <b>who</b> <b>earn</b> too much money to qualify for Medicare {{but not enough to}} afford health insurance. Congressional Democrats and many Republicans tried to expand the coverage of the program to other needy families, but they were opposed by President George W. Bush and other Republicans. In 2006, 5.4 million children were eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid, and 9.4 million total children were uninsured. Such children and their families are often treated in emergency rooms of hospitals, a much more expensive alternative for taxpayers than expanding the SCHIP and similar programs.|$|E
25|$|More {{women are}} living in poverty due {{to changes in the}} {{traditional}} family structure. The increase in divorce rates and single parenthood are two major contributing factors to change in the family structure. Female-headed families have the poorest economic outcomes, with economic well-being dependent on the mother’s marital status and race/ethnicity. White women generally have access to other income, through marriage or relationships with the highest income earners: white men. Whereas black women, in comparison to white women, are less likely to have white men as partners, and tend to have partners <b>who</b> <b>earn</b> less than white males, even when equally employed. The absence of second income-earning adults is what, in some cases,impedes the well-being of minority women and children.|$|E
