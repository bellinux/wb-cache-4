500|$|In I, Me, Mine, Harrison {{introduces}} {{these words}} with {{a reference to}} McCartney's heavy-handedness at Apple and likens the scene to a Monty Python comedy routine. In the lyrics to [...] "Run of the Mill", author Ian Inglis notes that, rather than [...] "exacerbat the poisonous atmosphere that hangs over the group, by merely adding to the endless stream of insults and counterinsults", Harrison shows [...] "genuine regret" [...] at what has transpired and [...] "warns against trying to shift the blame" [...] for one's actions. Another biographer, Joshua Greene, suggests that partly through his association with the Hare Krishna movement, Harrison was now [...] "too sure of his life's higher purpose to <b>waste</b> <b>any</b> more time on petty squabbles".|$|E
500|$|John Diefenbaker {{had been}} {{interested}} in politics from an early age, and told his mother {{at the age of}} eight or nine that he would some day be Prime Minister. She told him that it was an impossible ambition, especially for a boy living on the prairies. She would live to be proved wrong. John's first contact with politics came in 1910, when he sold a newspaper to Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in Saskatoon to lay the cornerstone for the University's first building. The present and future Prime Ministers conversed, and when giving his speech that afternoon, Sir Wilfrid commented on the newsboy who had ended their conversation by saying, [...] "I can't <b>waste</b> <b>any</b> more time on you, Prime Minister. I must get about my work." [...] The authenticity of the meeting was questioned in the 21st century, with an author suggesting that it was invented by Diefenbaker during an election campaign.|$|E

He continued to perform well in the series and in the final test match at Bombay, {{he was one of the}} heroes of an India victory with figures of 5/43 & 3/60.

2500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Deadly Impact {{has been largely}} negative. Reviewers for DVD Talk heavily panned the film, with one writing [...] "Rather uninspired {{and more than a}} little bit predictable, Deadly Impact doesn't really bring much of interest to a genre already riddled with clichés." [...] DVD Verdict also panned Deadly Impact, cautioning readers that it was [...] "one hell of a bomb" [...] and to [...] " [...] <b>waste</b> <b>any</b> time on this dud". Beyond Hollywood was also critical in their review, stating that [...] "Deadly Impact is an almost painful experience to behold, even when compared to the stuff Steven Seagal and Val Kilmer are pumping out these days. After the film’s mildly intriguing opening number, the production promptly loses its cinematic footing and never recovers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Merzenich is a neuroscientist who {{has been}} one of the pioneers of neuroplasticity for over three decades.

[...] Merzenich's work was affected by a crucial discovery made by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel in their work with kittens. [...] The experiment involved sewing one eye shut and recording the cortical brain maps. Hubel and Wiesel saw that the portion of the kitten's brain associated with the shut eye was not idle, as expected. Instead, it processed visual information from the open eye.

50|$|London's Western Riverside Waste Authority has {{declared}} that LATS guidance is flawed. The initial definition of municipal waste counted it as <b>any</b> <b>waste</b> that originated from houses or households.

The problem lies when the waste disposal authority collects a proportion of commercial and industrial waste, which in one piece of legislation is counted and in the other is exempt. This leads to the potential for fines for some authorities.|$|R
