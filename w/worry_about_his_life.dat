First of all, I {{have been in}} a coma, so I am already disgruntled with that, and then {{the fact that she was}} not there when I woke up doesn’t make it any better. It’s one more thing on the plate that makes him <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> when he was in a coma. Did they care? Were they around? I don’t know if they were around. All I can sort of remember is Claudia’s voice, vaguely. Sonny took me under his wing and did his best to help me understand and figure out why I am what I am." [...] Garrett on Michael's anger towards Carly. With the announcement of Garrett's casting, many questioned how the character would return to the canvas. Michael finally wakes up on May 18, 2009, with cousin Lulu Spencer (Julie Marie Berman) at his bedside. The now 17-year-old Michael must battle significant health complications before becoming a [...] "normal" [...] teenager. After a risky surgery to keep Michael from slipping into a persistent vegetative state, Michael wakes up. Garrett explained that while Michael healed physically, his mental and emotional health would cause drama. Because Michael and his adoptive half-sister Kristina Davis (Lexi Ainsworth) have very little contact growing up, the writers considered developing a romance between the two. Garrett believed that if either of them were to develop feelings, it would be Kristina, as Michael is too preoccupied with his recovery. Michael is immediately angry with Carly for not being present when he opens his eyes, and believes she is trying to replace him by having another child. The storyline also allows for further development of Michael's relationship with Jason, who also suffered from a brain injury when he was a little older than Michael. Jason becomes Michael's confidant. The story also featured a guest appearance on the June 29, 2009 episode from then Arizona Diamondbacks Outfielder, Connor Jackson, as Michael's physical therapist.|$|E
50|$|In 1433, {{penetrating}} (The Upper) Silesia, the Hussites reached Rybnik. They were slaughtering local people, plundering {{houses and}} burning {{everything that was}} within their sight, especially the symbols of Christianity. In those terrible times, a dying woman wanted the priest to come with the sacramental ministry. Her husband, ignoring the danger, that is, the prowling Hussites, decided to comply with her request. Ultimately, he managed to reach the church and there, he asked the rector for the sacramental ministry for his dying wife. Father Valentine, as a very saintly person, {{was sent to the}} woman’s house. He was a man of great faith, that is why he did not hide with his pious intentions. Therefore, the group of Hussites noticed him going with The Holy Sacrament. They were only waiting for an opportunity to profane the symbol of Christianity. Father Valentine noticed the Hussites dashing towards him but he was not afraid of losing his life, he only wanted to protect the Holy Sacrament from insulting. He found an oak and therein a big, spacious hollow. On the spur of the moment, he put there The Sacred Host. Delighted with his act of heroism, Father Valentine started to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> but it was already too late. The Hussites caught up with him and inflicted truly martyr’s death. The man was observing this incident from the distance, {{and as soon as the}} Hussites went away, he buried the body of the heroic priest. After some time, when the Hussites left Silesia, people began to emerge from their hiding places. The rumour about the heroic priest spread among neighbouring villages and in the place where he was buried, the source of crystal clear water (which later proved to be healing water) ejaculated. Since then, pilgrimages of believers began to head there. According to the folk tales, there were thousands of people who were healed thanks to this water. Years passed, but nobody knew where Father Valentine had hidden The Holy Sacrament. Until one day, some shepherds noticed the brightness over the oak. They informed about this the neighbouring people and priests, and The Sacred Host was found. People associated this fact with the death of Father Valentine. The rector of that time put the cross there to commemorate those events. Since then, the wood, in which the cross and the source of healing water is settled, has been a place of numerous pilgrimages.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} famous J-pops of the new century, Angela Aki’s “手紙～拝啓 十五の君へ～” is a {{polyphonic}} song characterized by a temporally bifurcated autodialogism. Composed of two letters, one of which is attributed to a fifteen-year-old boy and the other to the same person in his adult age, this work carries a question-response structure: the-fifteen-year old boy asks his future self how he can best live <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> The latter finds the letter and provides advice to his younger self. In the song, these elements are intertwined and expressed in combination, with the melody comprising the following components: two couplets, a pre-refrain, three refrains, and an outro. The principal narrator’s status is ambiguous: it is presumed or virtual so that his voice melts into that of the secondary narrator, the hero-scribe appearing in the song. As with many songs, “手紙～拝啓 十五の君へ～” is based on the chiasmus relation between concrete and abstract knowledge and concrete and abstract lectors/auditors as activated by singers. That activation is especially evident in this song, as junior high school students participated in the 75 th NHK (Nippon Hôsô Kyôkai) music contest for which the composer Angela Aki dedicated the song as a set piece, and Angela Aki herself sang it. By singing the song herself, the singer-songwriter becomes a meta-spokesperson of her own voice as songwriter and both principal and secondary narrators, in particular in the voice of the adult who gives advice to himself as a fifteen-year-old <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> Therefore, this song constitutes a situation layered in its expressions, utterances, and narration, thereby accelerating the impact of the song in the world...|$|R
