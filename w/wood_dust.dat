5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} over the warmer months with eggs laid from August to January. The clutch is laid {{on a bed of}} <b>wood</b> <b>dust</b> or leaves and {{consists}} of two to five (or rarely up to eight) round or oval glossy white eggs, each of which is generally 21 to 22mm long by 18mm (0.8 by 0.7in) wide. Clutches tend to have more eggs in earlier rather than later clutches, and in nests located further from cleared land. Eggs are laid at an interval of two to three days. Incubation takes 18 to 21 days. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and feeds them for their first few days before the male begins helping. She leaves to feed and drink twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Both parents take part in feeding the young, on a diet predominantly of seeds with some fruit. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless and blind and remain in the nest for an extended period. Covered in silvery-white down, they have pink skin and darker blue-grey skin around the eye. By seven days they open their eyes, and are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day six. They are almost covered in feathers by day 21, and fledge (leave the nest) at around 23days of age in the wild and up to 30days of age in captivity.|$|E

40|$|Corn fiber, <b>wood</b> saw <b>dust</b> and {{newsprint}} are lignocellulosic {{materials that}} can yield potentially fermentable sugars. Aqueous, liquid pretreatments involving high temperatures at saturation vapor pressure {{were used to}} promote effective enzymatic conversion of the cellulose to glucose. The pretreatments consisted of mixing <b>wood</b> saw <b>dust,</b> newsprint or white fiber in liquid water while the slurry was heated to temperatures of 220 to 260 °C at saturation vapor pressure. The temperature was controlled and the pH monitored in all runs. Small amounts of KOH (2. 0 M) {{were added to the}} slurry during pretreatment to control the pH. The effectiveness of the pretreatment was gauged by the extent of enzyme hydrolysis of the cellulose to glucose in 48 hours. The highest conversion to glucose was 84 % of theoretical for corn fiber, 54 % of theoretical for <b>wood</b> saw <b>dust</b> and 38 % of theoretical for newsprint. Enzymatic conversion for the untreated materials was 17 % of theoretical for the corn fiber, 1 % of theoretical for the <b>wood</b> saw <b>dust</b> and 32 % of theoretical for the newsprint. ^ Water is both an acid catalyst and a hydrating agent, whose acidity needs to be controlled if pretreatment is going to yield high conversion to glucose. This research developed a modified model based on acid hydrolysis of cellulose at the pretreatment conditions. In this model, acidic organic species, which result when glucose, formed from cellulose and degraded at high temperatures, accelerates the hydrolysis of cellulose. The model fit the compositional changes which occurred during various pretreatment conditions. The model suggests that controlling pH is needed to obtain a high yield of reactive cellulose, both accessible and susceptible to enzyme hydrolysis. Otherwise, a cascade of reactions occurs which causes significant auto-hydrolysis. A limited extent of hydrolysis may be desirable since this may help to disintegrate the substrate into smaller particles and thereby increase surface area available to the enzyme. The model suggests that the most effective conditions for pretreatment are between 200 °C and 210 °C for corn fiber, between 240 °C and 250 °C for the <b>wood</b> saw <b>dust</b> and between 200 °C and 230 °C for the newsprint. ...|$|R

In this study, three different types of <b>wood</b> saw <b>dusts</b> were treated with 10 % NaOH solution separately.

In order to know the water absorption behaviour, both chemically treated and untreated <b>wood</b> saw <b>dust</b> reinforced polymer matrix composites were weathered in water at ambient temperature for different time periods. Experimental results showed that the tensile strength of the composites substantially increases due to chemical treatment of the wood particles. After calculation of water uptake, plot of percentage of water absorption versus weathering period was obtained. It has been revealed that chemical treatment of the reinforcing wood particles increases the water absorption of the composites. Results also indicated that water absorption of the composites increases with increasing percentage of wood particles and weathering period.

40|$|Introduction: Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) occurs more often in subjects previously exposed to <b>wood</b> <b>dusts</b> than in non-exposed subjects. Here we report 2 cases of the IPF among workers prolongedly exposed {{to high levels of}} hardwood dusts. Case report: The case No. 1 : An 83 year-old male former smoker, retired joiner developed mild dyspnoea and chronic dry cough over the period preceding the examination. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) identified a mild restrictive pattern and diffusion capacity for carbon dioxide (CO 2) that was severely impaired (57 % of predicted value). High resolution computer tomography (HRCT) identified bilateral, subpleural basal reticular opacities in honeycombing, without any nodules or ground-glass opacities. The case No. 2 : A 73 year-old male retired joiner, never smoker, presented a 3 -year history of progressive breathlessness and non-productive cough in mild hypoxemia. Pulmonary function tests suggested a moderate restrictive pattern in severely impaired diffusion capacity for CO 2 (54 % of predicted value). High resolution computer tomography identified diffuse peripheral reticular opacities and honeycombing of lower fields, with apico-basilar gradient. Both cases received diagnosis of the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Discussion: The pulmonary fibrosis is a common feature of several diseases and may be induced by inflammatory disorders following inhalation of organic and inorganic dusts (e. g., asbestos, silica), and several reports suggest that many cases of the IPF may be in fact secondary to occupational dust exposure as in the case reports we present here. Conclusions: Occupational exposure to <b>wood</b> <b>dusts</b> may be a risk factor for the IPF. Unfortunately, exposure reconstruction is frequently inconsistent and anamnesis often misses other causes of the pulmonary fibrosis (e. g., extrinsic allergic alveolitis).

In this context, different lignocellulosic residues have been explored for the extraction of aromatic monomers. It includes ultrasonic extraction, refluxing extraction, alkaline hydrolysis and accelerated solvent extraction [1]. Aromatic monomers could be used for food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical applications. Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is an annual herbaceous plant. The natural fractions resulting from the industrial transformation of hemp are hemp fiber and its two co-products hemp <b>wood</b> and hemp <b>dust.</b> 5, 500 tons of hemp wood and 2, 300 tons of hemp dust are produced from the transformation of 10, 000 tons of raw material.

Hemp <b>wood</b> and <b>dust</b> are used in gardening, stockbreeding and as litter for animals because of their high absorption capacity. Developing higher value-added applications from these natural by-products would secure the hemp sector. As these coproducts are rich in lignin, the extraction of aromatic monomers in particular ferulic and coumaric acids can represent an interesting valorization for hemp <b>wood</b> and <b>dust.</b> Characterization of this two coproducts using Van Soest method provided a value of 86. 8 % in lignocellulosic materials (50. 6 % cellulose, 18. 2 % hemicelluloses and 18. 0 % lignin) for hemp wood compared to 61. 7 % in lignocellulosic materials (43. 9 % cellulose, 10. 7 % hemicelluloses and 7. 0 % lignin) for hemp dust.
