25|$|At 7:15p.m. on September12, 1952, two brothers, Edward and Fred May, {{and their}} friend Tommy Hyer (ages 13, 12, and 10 respectively) {{witnessed}} a bright object cross the sky, {{coming to rest}} on land belonging to local farmer G. Bailey Fisher. Upon witnessing the object, the boys went {{to the home of}} the May brothers' mother, Kathleen May, where they told the story of having seen a UFO crash land in the hills. From there, Mrs. May, accompanied by the three boys, local children Neil Nunley (14) and Ronnie Shaver (10), and 17-year-old West Virginia National Guardsman Eugene Lemon, traveled to the Fisher farm in an effort to locate <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that the boys had seen.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, however, {{concerns}} regarding immigration from Asian sources revealed overtly xenophobic and racist attitudes among Canadians, particularly English Canadians on the Pacific coast. At {{the time for}} many Canadian identity, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to be, did not include non-Europeans. While inexpensive Chinese labour had been needed to complete the transcontinental railway, {{the completion of the}} railway led to questions {{of what to do with}} the workers who were now no longer needed. Further Chinese immigration was limited and then banned by a series of restrictive and racially motivated dominion statutes. The Komagata Maru incident in 1914 revealed overt hostility towards would-be immigrants, mainly Sikhs from India, who attempted to land in Vancouver.|$|E
25|$|Pottery {{belonging}} to a western stream of Bantu expansion (sometimes called Kalundu) has been found at sites in northeastern Zimbabwe, dated from the seventh century. (The western stream originated {{in the same area}} as the eastern stream: both belong to the same style system, called by Phillipson the Chifumbadze system, which has general acceptance by archaeologists.) The terms eastern and western streams represent the expansion of the Bantu speaking peoples in terms of their culture. Another question is the branches of the Bantu languages which they spoke. It seems that the makers of the Ziwa/Gokomere wares were not the ancestral speakers of the Shona languages of today's Zimbabwe, who did not arrive in there until around the tenth century, from south of the Limpopo river, and whose ceramic culture belonged to the western stream. The linguist and historian Ehret believes that in view of the similarity of the Ziwa/Gokomere pottery to the Nkope of the ancestral Nyasa language speakers, the Ziwa/Gokomere people spoke a language closely related to the Nyasa group. Their language, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> was superseded by the ancestral Shona languages, although Ehret says that a set of Nyasa words occur in central Shona dialects today.|$|E

I really enjoyed having something ... that I had wanted and gone out and taken." [...] Possession proved to be an important motive for rape and murder as well. Sexual assault, he said, fulfilled his need to [...] "totally possess" [...] his victims. At first, he killed his victims [...] "as a matter of expediency ... to eliminate the possibility of [...] caught"; but later, murder became part of the [...] "adventure". [...] "The ultimate possession was, in fact, the taking of the life", he said. [...] "And then ... the physical possession of the remains." ...|$|E

She also took violin lessons, went to dance class, and founded the school's gospel choir. Academically, she took advanced placement classes and received primarily 'A' grades. School officials recognized her as a leader among the student body. Later recalling her education, Hill commented, [...] "I had a love for â€“ I don't know if it was necessarily for academics, more than it just was for achieving, period.

[...] Like several other future professionals from the area, he played football for Wallsend Boys Club. He was also selected for the Newcastle Schools representative team, and at the age of 13 was among a group of players from the team selected to serve as ball boys at the 1974 Football League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
500|$|John Gielgud's New Theatre {{production}} in 1935 featured Gielgud and Laurence Olivier as Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six {{weeks into the}} run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet. Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts and organised the set and costumes to match {{as closely as possible}} to the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later productions. Olivier later compared his performance and Gielgud's: [...] "John, all spiritual, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity... I've always felt that John missed the lower half and that made me go for the other... But <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> when I was playing Romeo I was carrying a torch, I was trying to sell realism in Shakespeare." ...|$|E
500|$|With Villeroi {{shadowing}} Marlborough's every move, Marlborough's gamble {{that the}} French would not move against the weakened Dutch {{position in the}} Netherlands paid off. In any case, Marlborough had promised {{to return to the}} Netherlands if a French attack developed there, transferring his troops down the Rhine on barges at a rate of [...] a day. Encouraged by this promise (<b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worth) the States General agreed to release the Danish contingent of seven battalions and 22 squadrons as a reinforcement. Marlborough reached Ladenburg, in the plain of the Neckar and the Rhine, and there halted for three days to rest his cavalry and allow the guns and infantry to close up. On 6 June he arrived at Wiesloch, south of Heidelberg. The following day, the Allied army swung away from the Rhine towards the hills of the Swabian Jura and the Danube beyond. At last Marlborough's destination was established without doubt.|$|E

500|$|According to Harrison's later recollection, Spector {{suggested}} that [...] "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp" [...] might attract a few cover versions if {{he changed the}} lyrics. In I, Me, Mine, Harrison acknowledges that the song was [...] "a piece of personal indulgence", but [...] "those words were written because that's what it was" [...] â€“ a tribute to Frank Crisp. A number of Crisp's homilies directly inspired other Harrison songs {{during the first half}} of the 1970s, such as [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" [...] and [...] "The Answer's at the End". Harrison went on to identify philosophically with Crisp, of whom he writes elsewhere in I, Me, Mine: [...] "Sir Frank helped my awareness; <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> I felt became stronger, or found more expression by moving into that house, because everything stepped up or was heightened." [...] Leng considers that the song, along with [...] "All Things Must Pass", predicts Harrison's eventual [...] "retreat into an internal musical dialogue, set amid the woods and gardens of Friar Park", a change of perspective marked by his 1979 eponymous solo album.|$|E
500|$|RKO {{had scored}} a major {{financial}} success with Cat People (1942). The film, which cost $141,659, brought in almost $4 {{million in its}} first two years and saved the studio from financial disaster. RKO wanted to move quickly on a sequel {{to build on the}} success of Cat People, but producer Val Lewton wished to make the fantasy-comedy story [...] "The Amorous Ghost" [...] instead. As Lewton and studio wrangled, Lewton commenced production on The Seventh Victim, a horror-murder mystery film, and on May 12, 1943, RKO announced it was delaying production on the sequel The Curse of the Cat People due to the unavailability of key performers. RKO production chief Charles Koerner did not want Lewton to be idle once filming on The Seventh Victim ended nor did he favor the idea of Lewton working on comedy, so Koerner suggested that Lewton direct a horror film set at sea, utilizing the studio's existing ship set, built for Pacific Liner (1939). According to Robert Wise, a longtime collaborator with Lewton, it was this set that gave Lewton the idea for the film. [...] "He would find what we call a 'standing set,' and then tailor his script to the set, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> That's how he made The Ghost Ship. He walked onto a set and saw a tanker, then cooked up the idea for this ship with a murderous captain." [...] One scholar has suggested that Lewton accepted the assignment in part because, as an amateur sailor himself, the ship captain's behavior mirrored Lewton's own views on how to manage a ship, but also because Lewton saw the plot as a way of criticizing his micro-managing superiors at RKO. The budget, as with all of Lewton's films, was set at $150,000.|$|E
