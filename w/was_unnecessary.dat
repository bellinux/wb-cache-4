5|$|As {{there were}} no further goals, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Wright and Denis Irwin missed their penalties; the decisive penalty, taken by Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman, was saved by his {{opposite}} number, Peter Schmeichel. Arsenal manager George Graham admitted his surprise over how the game was decided and thought both clubs would share the trophy; his counterpart Alex Ferguson, though delighted with his team's victory, felt the sudden death aspect <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 193637 season, Miller was {{selected}} for the Colts, a state under-21 team that played at district level. At the end of the 1936 school year, Miller completed year 10 by passing five of his eight subjects. Disinclined towards university studies, he left school without finishing his leaving year and began working as a clerk for a car business. Miller felt confident that he could make a career out of sport and therefore felt that further education <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary.</b>|$|E

5|$|Congressional {{reaction}} to the losses suffered by Lt. Col.

Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary.</b> The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant's Peace Policy. The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|Critics gave {{mixed reviews}} for the album, with their general {{complaint}} {{being that the}} release <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary.</b> Most of them, however, complimented The Weeknd, Twin Shadow and Guéna LG's remixes. It earned an overall score of 57 out of 100, on review aggregator site Metacritic. Commercially, Born This Way: The Remix achieved minor success, entering the charts in ten countries. Its highest position was attained in Japan, where it reached top-twenty, while in the United States, it failed to reach the top-100 of the Billboard 200 albums chart.|$|E

The episode features American actor Edward Norton as con artist Devon Bradley, and would feature The Doors guitarist Robby Krieger as himself, however the scene in which he appeared was removed because Mike Scully, the show runner for the episode, felt the scene <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary.</b> In its original American broadcast, the episode received a 9.7 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} in the 1980 referendum, {{in an attempt to}} build a broad coalition, had sought only the authority to negotiate sovereignty with the Canadian government, and promised a second referendum to ratify the results of any negotiation. Parizeau believed a second referendum <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary</b> and would only encourage the remainder of Canada to use delaying tactics. The draft initial Act featured a question only asking for the authority to declare Quebec sovereign.|$|E
5|$|When O'Brien {{finally decided}} to write a {{biography}} on Madonna in 2005, she wanted the book to be more about the singer's contribution to her music, rather than delving too much into her personal life, unlike other Madonna biographers. The author then interviewed dancers, choreographers, musicians, and producers who worked with Madonna. After its release, the book received a mixed response from critics. They were unanimous that the over-emphasis given on the singer's discography <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary,</b> instead more thought should have been given on exploring her personal life, which {{would have made the}} biography compelling.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{protests from}} TVA that it <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary,</b> the Manhattan District built a {{coal-fired}} power plant at K-25 with eight 25,000 KW generators. Steam generated from the K-25 power plant was subsequently used by S-50. Additional power lines were laid from the TVA hydroelectric plants at Norris Dam and Watts Bar Dam, and the Clinton Engineer Works was given its own electrical substations at K-25 and K-27. By 1945, power sources were capable of supplying Oak Ridge with up to 310,000 KW, of which 200,000 KW was earmarked for Y-12, 80,000 KW for K-25, 23,000 KW for the township, 6,000 KW for S-50 and 1,000 KW for X-10. Peak demand occurred in August 1945, when all the facilities were running. The peak load was 298,800 KW on 1 September.|$|E
5|$|In June 1943, the Allies {{launched}} a major offensive—designated Operation Cartwheel—to capture Rabaul. During {{the next five}} months, Australian and U.S. forces under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur advanced along the north coast of eastern New Guinea, capturing the town of Lae and the Huon Peninsula. U.S. forces {{under the command of}} Admiral William Halsey, Jr. simultaneously advanced through the Solomon Islands from Guadalcanal, and established an air base at Bougainville in November. In June, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that it <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary</b> to capture Rabaul as the Japanese base there could be neutralized by blockade and aerial bombardment. MacArthur initially opposed this change in plans, it was endorsed by the British and United States Combined Chiefs of Staff during the Quebec Conference in August.|$|E

40|$|In learning, a {{semantic}} or behavioral U-shape {{occurs when a}} learner first learns, then unlearns, and, finally, relearns, some target concept (on the way to success). Within the framework of Inductive Inference, previous results have shown, for example, that such U-shapes <b>are</b> <b>unnecessary</b> for explanatory learning, but are necessary for behaviorally correct and non-trivial vacillatory learning. Herein we focus more on syntactic U-shapes. This paper introduces two general techniques and applies them especially to syntactic U-shapes in learning: one technique to show when they are necessary and one to show when they <b>are</b> <b>unnecessary.</b> The technique for the former is very general and applicable to a much wider range of learning criteria. It employs so-called self-learning classes of languages which are shown to characterize completely one criterion learning more than another. We apply these techniques to show that, for set-driven and partially set-driven learning, any kind of U-shapes <b>are</b> <b>unnecessary.</b> Furthermore, we show that U-shapes <b>are</b> not <b>unnecessary</b> in a strong way for iterative learning, contrasting an earlier result by Case and Moelius that semantic U-shapes <b>are</b> <b>unnecessary</b> for iterative learning...|$|R

5|$|On 5 July 1943, Model led the {{northern}} assault on Kursk during Operation Citadel, a plan which had caused great controversy within the German high command. Günther von Kluge and Erich von Manstein, commanding Army Groups Centre and South respectively, had originally urged that the salient be attacked in May, before the Soviets could prepare their defences. Others, including Heinz Guderian, felt that attacking <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary,</b> {{since it would}} occasion heavy tank losses and thus upset plans for increasing German armored strength. Model was also skeptical of the plan's chances, pointing out that Konstantin Rokossovsky's Central Front was strongly dug in and outnumbered him two to one in men, tanks and artillery. Rather than conclude that the offensive be called off, however, he said it should be postponed until he could receive further reinforcements, in particular the new Panther tanks and Ferdinand tank destroyers.|$|E
5|$|Testing program staff {{originally}} {{set test}} Charlie for early 1947. They wanted to explode it deep {{under the surface}} {{in the lee of}} the atoll to test the effect of nuclear weapons as depth charges on unmoored ships. The unanticipated delays in decontaminating the target ships after test Baker prevented the required technical support personnel from assisting with Charlie and also meant that there were no uncontaminated target ships available for use in Charlie. The naval weapons program staff decided the test was less pressing given that the entire U.S. arsenal had only a handful of nuclear weapons and cancelled the test. The official reason given for cancelling Charlie was that the program staff felt it <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary</b> due {{to the success of the}} Able and Baker tests. The deep ocean effects testing that Charlie was to have performed were fulfilled nine years later with Operation Wigwam.|$|E
5|$|The Exchequer of Pleas or Court of Exchequer was a {{court that}} dealt with matters of equity, a set of legal {{principles}} based on natural law and common law in England and Wales. Originally part of the curia regis, or King's Council, the Exchequer of Pleas split from the curia during the 1190s, to sit as an independent, central court. The Court of Chancery's reputation for tardiness and expense resulted in much of its business transferring to the Exchequer. The Exchequer and Chancery, with similar jurisdictions, drew closer together over the years, until an argument was made during the 19th century that having two seemingly identical courts <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary.</b> As a result, the Exchequer lost its equity jurisdiction. With the Judicature Acts, the Exchequer was formally dissolved as a judicial body by an Order in Council of 16December 1880.|$|E

Hence, the position remains to be confirmed by the courts. In addition, the Court decided that it <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary</b> to consider the effect of section8B(2) on issues not related to national security and the constitutionality of the 1989 amendments to the ISA.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first practical jet engines in the late-World War II period led to calls for new jet-powered versions of practically every aircraft then flying. Among these was {{the design of a}} replacement for the de Havilland Mosquito, at that time among the world's leading light bombers. The Mosquito had been designed with the express intent of lightening the aircraft in order to improve its speed as much as possible, a process that led to the removal of all defensive armament, improving performance {{to the point where it}} <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary</b> anyway. This high-speed approach was extremely successful, and a jet-powered version would be even more difficult to intercept.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{issue of}} {{debate within the}} {{sovereignty}} movement became on what terms sovereignty would be put before the electorate.

As a practical matter, Parizeau believed that given the emotional circumstances of separation a special partnership was unlikely, and that given free trade agreements and other multilateral institutions it <b>was</b> <b>unnecessary.</b>|$|E
