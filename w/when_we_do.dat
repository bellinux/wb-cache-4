5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E

25|$|However, {{things are}} not quite that simple. The zero-point energy cannot be {{eliminated}} by dropping its energy from the Hamiltonian: <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> this and solve the Heisenberg equation for a field operator, we must include the vacuum field, which is the homogeneous {{part of the solution}} for the field operator. In fact we can show that the vacuum field is essential for the preservation of the commutators and the formal consistent of QED. When we calculate the field energy we obtain not only a contribution from particles and forces that may be present but also a contribution from the vacuum field itself i.e. the zero-point field energy. In other words, the zero-point energy reappears even though we may have deleted it from the Hamiltonian.|$|E

They discuss fleeing the country, and Georg {{is the first to}} do so. Weeks after he arrives in Germany, he is found dead from a fall from the window of a Frankfurt hotel. The narrator and Edgar likewise acquire passports and go to Germany, but continue to receive death threats after emigrating. Kurt remains in Romania, no longer working; he is later found hanged. The novel ends with the same passage as it began: [...] "When we don't speak, said Edgar, we become unbearable, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> we make fools of ourselves".|$|E
500|$|The vocals, handled {{jointly by}} Shields and Butcher, are kept {{relatively}} {{low in the}} mix, and {{are for the most}} part highly pitched. On occasion Shields sang the higher register and Butcher the lower one. According to Shields, because the band had spent so long working on the album's vocals, he [...] "couldn't tolerate really clear vocals, where you just hear one voice", thus [...] "it had to be more like a sound." [...] Butcher explained her [...] "dreamy, sensual" [...] style vocals, saying, [...] "Often <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> vocals, it's 7:30 in the morning; I've usually just fallen asleep and have to be woken up to sing." [...] To aid this effect, Shields and Ó Cíosóig even sampled Butcher's voice and reused it as instrumentation. The layered vocals on [...] "When You Sleep" [...] were born out of frustration with trying to get the right take. Shields commented that [...] "The vocals sound like that because it became boring and too destructive trying to get the right vocal. So I decided to put all the vocals in. (It had been sung 12 or 13 times)." [...] He explained: ...|$|E

500|$|Arthur R. Marshall led {{the efforts}} to undo the damage. According to Douglas, Marshall was {{successful}} in portraying the Everglades from the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes to Florida Bayincluding the atmosphere, climate, and limestoneas a single organism. Rather than remaining the preserve of conservation organizations, the cause of restoring the Everglades became a priority for politicians. Douglas observed, [...] "Marshall accomplished the extraordinary magic of taking the Everglades out of the bleeding-hearts category forever". At the insistent urging of Marshall, newly elected Governor Bob Graham announced {{the formation of the}} [...] "Save Our Everglades" [...] campaign in 1983, and in 1985 Graham lifted the first shovel of backfill for a portion of the C-38 canal. Within a year the area was covered with water returning to its original state. Graham declared that by the year 2000, the Everglades would resemble its predrainage state as much as possible. The Kissimmee River Restoration Project was approved by Congress in the Water Resources Development Act of 1992. The project was estimated to cost $578million to convert only [...] of the canal; the cost was designed to be divided between the state of Florida and the U.S. government, with the state being responsible for purchasing land to be restored. A project manager for the Army Corps of Engineers explained in 2002, [...] "What we're doing on this scale is going to be taken to a larger scale <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> the restoration of the Everglades". The entire project is estimated to be completed by 2011.|$|E

The Daily Yomiuri reported that [...] "critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and Janet Jackson." [...] Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just {{has to make a}} scene." [...] Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin commented, [...] "I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice." [...] Chuck Taylor of Billboard observed, [...] "Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice... "(You Drive Me) Crazy", her third single... demonstrates Spears' own development, proving that the 17-year-old is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to her music as a [...] "blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry." [...] Sputnikmusic writer Amanda Murray noted the album [...] "offers a marker for Spears' progression as an artist, as a celebrity, and as a woman." [...] In 2010, the album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
500|$|In the Protestant Christian tradition, Martin Luther insisted in the Diet of Worms {{that his}} {{conscience}} was captive to the Word of God, {{and it was}} neither safe nor right to go against conscience. To Luther, conscience falls within the ethical, rather than the religious, sphere. John Calvin saw conscience as a battleground: [...] " [...] the enemies who rise up in our conscience against his Kingdom and hinder his decrees prove that God's throne is not firmly established therein". Many Christians regard following one's conscience as important as, or even more important than, obeying human authority. A fundamentalist Christian view of conscience might be: 'God gave us our conscience so we would know when we break His Law; the guilt we feel <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> something wrong tells us {{that we need to}} repent.' This can sometimes (as with the conflict between William Tyndale and Thomas More over the translation of the Bible into English) lead to moral quandaries: [...] "Do I unreservedly obey my Church/priest/military/political leader or do I follow my own inner feeling of right and wrong as instructed by prayer and a personal reading of scripture?" [...] Some contemporary Christian churches and religious groups hold the moral teachings of the Ten Commandments or of Jesus as the highest authority in any situation, regardless {{of the extent to which}} it involves responsibilities in law. In the Gospel of John (7:53–8:11) (King James Version) Jesus challenges those accusing a woman of adultery stating: [...] "'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.' And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one" [...] (see Jesus and the woman taken in adultery). In the Gospel of Luke (10: 25–37) Jesus tells the story of how a despised and heretical Samaritan (see Parable of the Good Samaritan) who (out of compassion and conscience) helps an injured stranger beside a road, qualifies better for eternal life by loving his neighbor, than a priest who passes by on the other side.|$|E
