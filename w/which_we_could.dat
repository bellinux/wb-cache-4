25|$|In {{the most}} {{straightforward}} case, {{such as the}} sampling of a batch of material from production (acceptance sampling by lots), it would be most desirable to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include {{any one of them}} in our sample. However, in the more general case this is not usually possible or practical. There is no way to identify all rats in the set of all rats. Where voting is not compulsory, {{there is no way to}} identify which people will actually vote at a forthcoming election (in advance of the election). These imprecise populations are not amenable to sampling in any of the ways below and to <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> apply statistical theory.|$|E

500|$|While still {{detained}} by the French, Wodehouse was again mentioned in {{questions in the}} House of Commons in December 1944 when MPs wondered if the French authorities could repatriate him to stand trial. Eden stated that the [...] "matter has been gone into, and, according to the advice given, there are no grounds upon <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> take action". Two months later George Orwell wrote the essay [...] "In Defence of P.G. Wodehouse", where he stated that [...] "it is important to realise that the events of 1941 do not convict Wodehouse of anything worse than stupidity". Orwell's rationale was that Wodehouse's [...] "moral outlook has remained that of a public-school boy, {{and according to the}} public-school code, treachery in time of war is the most unforgivable of all the sins", which was compounded by his [...] "complete lack—so far as one can judge from his printed works—of political awareness".|$|E
500|$|Prompted by the government, the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation {{told the}} public to stand by for an {{important}} announcement from the Prime Minister at 13:15 local time. Smith went first to Government House to inform Gibbs that his Cabinet had declared independence, then to Pockets Hill Studios in east Salisbury to announce UDI to the nation. He read the proclamation aloud, then stated that independence had been declared because it had become [...] "abundantly {{clear that it is}} the policy of the British government to play us along with no real intention of arriving at a solution <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> possibly accept...

500|$|Bartlett's {{decision}} to deposit stores {{on the ice}} ensured that an ice camp, known as [...] "Shipwreck Camp", {{was more or less}} established by the time Karluk sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided [...] "substantial and comfortable houses on <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> rely for shelter for a long time." [...] Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp {{in the direction of the}} island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.|$|E

60|$|But {{it would}} be {{unprofitable}} {{to spend more time}} in disentangling, or rather in showing up the knots in, the ravelled skeins of our neighbours. Much more to the purpose is it to ask if we possess any clue of our own which may guide us among these entanglements. And by way of a beginning, let us ask ourselves--What is education? Above all things, what is our ideal of a thoroughly liberal education?--of that education <b>which,</b> if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> begin life again, we would give ourselves--of that education <b>which,</b> if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> mould the fates to our own will, we would give our children. Well, I know not what may be your conceptions upon this matter, but I will tell you mine, and I hope I shall find that our views are not very discrepant.|$|R
500|$|On 5March 1917, {{shortly after}} commencing {{operations}} with No.1 Squadron, Williams narrowly avoided crash-landing when his engine stopped {{while he was}} bombing the railway terminus at Tel el Sheria. At first believing {{that he had been}} struck by enemy fire, he found that the engine switch outside his cockpit had turned off. Within 500feet of the ground he was able to switch the engine back on and return to base. On 21April, Williams landed behind enemy lines to rescue downed comrade Lieutenant Adrian Cole, having the day before pressed home an attack on Turkish cavalry whilst under [...] "intense anti-aircraft fire"; these two actions earned him the Distinguished Service Order for [...] "conspicuous gallantry". He was promoted major in May and given command of No.1 Squadron, which was re-equipped with Bristol Fighters later that year. [...] "Now for the first time," [...] wrote Williams, [...] "after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> deal with our enemy in the air." [...] His men knew him as a teetotaller and non-smoker, whose idea of swearing was an occasional [...] "Darn me!".|$|E
500|$|March 1917 saw the {{heaviest}} bombing campaign {{carried out by}} the squadron to date; short of its regular [...] ordnance, the pilots improvised by dropping [...] howitzer shells on Turkish forces along the Gaza–Beersheba line. During one such mission on 20March, Lieutenant Frank McNamara earned the Victoria Cross for landing his Martinsyde in the desert under enemy fire and rescuing a fellow pilot whose B.E.2 had been forced down. On 26March, No.1 Squadron took part in the First Battle of Gaza; it suffered its first combat death the next day, when one of its B.E.2s was attacked by a German Rumpler. The unit participated in the Second Battle of Gaza on 19April; like its predecessor, the attack was a failure for the Allies. Williams, later known as the [...] "Father of the RAAF", assumed command of the squadron in May. Two B.E.12s were delivered the same month; like the Martinsydes, they were armed with a forward-firing machine gun and employed as escorts for the B.E.2s. By June, mechanical issues caused by hot summer weather and the threat from new German Albatros scouts were rendering the B.E.2s largely ineffective, and Williams urgently requested newer models. Modern aircraft were eventually delivered, first the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 in October, and then the Bristol F.2 Fighter in December. [...] "Now for the first time," [...] wrote Williams, [...] "after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> deal with our enemy in the air." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Matt Groening, the lone episode (discounting the Tracey Ullman shorts) in which he {{received}} an individual writing credit, though he has co-written for the episodes [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", [...] "The Telltale Head", and [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield". [...] "Colonel Homer" [...] was partly based on the 1980 film Coal Miner's Daughter, which {{tells the story of}} country music singer Loretta Lynn. Groening said he had always wanted to write an episode in which Homer is offered a chance at being rich and famous, other than being with his family, but then chooses his family over glamour at the end. He pitched the idea to the writers of the show, who suggested the parody of Coal Miner's Daughter and also that Homer should become a manager for a country singer. Show runner Mike Reiss was originally skeptical about the episode, as he did not think Homer could get a new job when he already had a full-time job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Reiss eventually gave in, but in future episodes the writers tried to develop the explanation that he got fired from the plant and then rehired at the end. Groening said that during the episode production, he received comments from the production team that Homer was acting like a [...] "jerk" [...] in it, but his explanation was that Homer's behavior was due to his desire to make Lurleen a star and he was oblivious to her attempts to seduce him until the end. Mike Reiss stated that [...] "Whenever we want to write stories about characters getting divorced or actually having an affair, rather than with Homer and Marge, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> never do, we use secondary characters for that." ...|$|E

30|$|Third, {{the model}} is static, but one could easily think of some dynamic implications. For example, {{it may be the}} case that in good times {{supervisors}} gradually reduce their capabilities, so {{they may not be able}} to increase them quickly when bad times arrive, in <b>which</b> case <b>we</b> <b>could</b> end up having (involuntary) supervisory forbearance.|$|R
500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E

A sprinkling with water, a good sweeping,and a free use of Keating's powder, soon made the room habitable. The supper at the hotel was, however, far above the average, and the only thing to complain of was the poor forage supplied to the mules.".|$|E
