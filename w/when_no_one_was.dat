5|$|For a while, he was {{uncertain}} {{whether he would}} attend college, but ultimately he applied and was accepted to Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia, where a friend had also enrolled. Arriving in 1982, he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly philosophy. He found the curriculum rigorous, but was more focused {{than he had been}} in high school and was able to apply himself to his studies. Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden–Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred in 1984 to Northwestern University as a theater major to study performance, emboldened by the realization that he loved performing, even <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> coming to shows. He graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} Norman castles were built from timber, {{but by the end}} of the 11thcentury a few, {{including}} the Tower of London, had been renovated or replaced with stone. Work on the White Tower– which gives the whole castle its name– is usually considered to have begun in 1078, however the exact date is uncertain. William made Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, responsible for its construction, although it may not have been completed until after William's death in 1087. The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England, and was the strongest point {{of the early}} castle. It also contained grand accommodation for the king. At the latest, it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there. Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes. Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower, he was also the first person to escape from it, using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine. He was held in luxury and permitted servants, but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors. After plying them with drink, <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber, and out of the Tower. The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft.|$|E

This will send a strong message {{to the public that}} law is greater than the khap." [...] However, he was disappointed that [...] "the leader [...] got away with death penalty because he intentionally disappeared during the killing." [...] Narendra said, [...] "We will appeal in High Court for death penalty to the main accused, Ganga Raj. We respect the court's decision but he should be punished so that the instigators of the crime get the punishment. Also it is important that it is a very clear message so that no khap gives such directions, ever." [...] Seema seconded Narendra's concerns, [...] "We would have been happier if the main accused was also given the death sentence. The decision of the panchayat was not justified and people should not to be allowed to misuse their power. We have fought this battle alone <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> supporting us."

500|$|The {{first known}} {{recording}} of [...] "My Immortal" [...] {{was made for}} the band's self-titled EP, which solely featured Lee's vocals accompanied by a piano, and slightly different lyrics. The song was cut from the EP before it was released. In 2000, the song was re-recorded for the band's demo album, Origin, which contains a rearranged piano melody and lyrics, including the bridge added by Lee. It was again recorded for the band's debut full-length debut studio album, Fallen where the vocals of the demo version (that were recorded by Lee at 18 years old) were accompanied by slightly different instrumentation. It is also featured on the band's 2003 EP, Mystary, {{which is much more}} similar to the band version. Wind-up Records preferred the Origin version, which is why the exact vocals recorded from 2000 are again included in the song's album version. The version that was recorded and released as a single is moderately alternative to that of the album version, and {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "band version" [...] because of the additional band performing the bridge and final chorus of the song. The later pressings of Fallen contain the single version (or [...] "band version") of [...] "My Immortal" [...] as a hidden track. Lee expressed some dissatisfaction with the early versions of the song saying, [...] "It's not even a real piano. And the sound quality is bad because we had to break into the studio to record it late at night <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> around because we couldn't afford a real session." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stories {{of alleged}} ghostly {{phenomena}} at the Stephenson House {{date back to}} at least the 1970s.

2500|$|Without the tireless work of Maclean's daughter, Nan Milton, {{the memory}} of her father might have been lost. It was not just that she helped found the John MacLean Society and served as it's Secretary, she made the revival possible. At a time <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> interested, she copied out all her father's {{writings}} from his own and other publications in the National Library and typed them up. That was how Hugh MacDiarmid read his works and then championed his ideas [...] Her first husband wrote a biography of MacLean and lent the only copy of the manuscript to the West Indian Socialist CLR James, who left it on a London Tube train. Nan painstakingly reconstructed it for her own biography. Her devotion was remarkable because she hardly knew her father. He became separated from his wife and family when she was an infant because he had time for nothing except work.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{doctrine}} {{well known to}} philosophers that the moon ceases to exist <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> looking at it.

2500|$|Frustration {{is another}} {{major cause of}} {{aggression}}. The Frustration aggression theory states that aggression increases if a person feels {{that he or she}} is being blocked from achieving a goal (Aronson et al. 2005). One study found that the closeness to the goal makes a difference. The study examined people waiting in line and concluded that the 2nd person was more aggressive than the 12th one when someone cut in line (Harris 1974). Unexpected frustration may be another factor. In a separate study to demonstrate how unexpected frustration leads to increased aggression, Kulik & Brown (1979) [...] selected a group of students as volunteers to make calls for charity donations. One group was told that the people they would call would be generous and the collection would be very successful. The other group was given no expectations. The group that expected success was more upset <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> pledging than the group who did not expect success (everyone actually had horrible success). This research suggests that when an expectation does not materialize (successful collections), unexpected frustration arises which increases aggression.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1850s and 1860s some ore {{was still}} being won from the old levels {{in the top of}} the mountain, but the main ore-producing stopes were above and below the High and Low Levels. By the end of the 1850s the Low Level had been driven [...] north of the Engine Shaft. Below it, the 36Fathom Level was being {{extended}} in both directions. Although ore was at first very patchy in that level, stopes had been opened above it in both headings by 1858, and also a sump had gone down to 48fathoms, where a new level was being driven. A major rock fall occurred in 1862 (or 1865), known as [...] "The Big Crush." [...] Miners had cut away two parallel strings of lead ore above the High Horse Level, leaving an unsupported pendant of rock between them. This rock, [...] in length and depth, and [...] thick, fell, crushing its way down the stope to the level below, and removing the floor of Gilgower's Level above. Fortunately this happened one Sunday, <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> in the mine. In 1870 the new Lucy Tongue Level was connected to the south end of the 48Fathom Level, by sinking a sump from above and working a rise from below. Already the new level had discovered some rich ore at the south end of the vein, and in the following years it was steadily driven north.|$|E
