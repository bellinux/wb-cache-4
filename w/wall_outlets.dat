2500|$|In the United States, {{an attempt}} at {{marketing}} electric versions of the wagon, the van and the pick-up as the EMC E36 was launched by the EnVision Motor Company, based in Des Moines, Iowa. They were to be powered by an asynchronous motor {{with a range of}} [...] per charge, that has a top highway speed as high as [...] EMC planned to use regenerative breaking and is coupled to an automatic shiftless button transmission. The battery can be charged through a J1772 plug or from <b>wall</b> <b>outlets</b> of either 110 or 220 volts. [...] This venture has since collapsed into bankruptcy.|$|E
40|$|Design choices {{made for}} built environments, such as <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> height, should address human factors and {{ergonomic}} considerations {{to provide a}} comfortable and convenient environment for everyone, regardless of their capabilities. Previous research, focuing on ambulatory individuals (only one participant was a wheel chair user), indicated {{that the majority of}} participants benefited from raising the <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> height. Similarly, this paper addresses the intersection of ergonomics and the built environment by exploring one aspect of the built environment (<b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> height) on the user extending the sample user population from ambulatory individuals (n= 34) in the previous investigation to include wheelchair users (n= 25). This study aims to provide guidance on how to improve the interpretation of existing building codes for the built environment regarding <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> height. The results showed that for ambulatory individuals, <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> heights located between 91 cm- 101 cm are recommended. For wheelchair users, lower heights (71 cm) may be better design choices. For all participants, a mid-height location (81 cm) is recommended...|$|R

40|$|Most {{everyday}} AC appliances {{are designed}} to operate off of 120 V coming from the <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> in our homes. This voltage is a standard set from our established infrastructure. Unlike AC devices, DC devices {{do not have any}} set standard of voltage they all will run off of. This presents a problem for the DC house as the various loads that will be used will have different required input voltages. One set voltage for a <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> will not suffice for the DC House. This Smart <b>Wall</b> <b>Outlet</b> is designed with a DC-DC converter that will have its output voltage controlled by an on-board microprocessor. The Smart <b>Wall</b> <b>Outlet</b> detects current going into a device, and will adjust the voltage applied to the device to ensure it operates most efficiently. Proof of concept research has already been performed in the past, and this thesis will look towards implementing this concept on a single circuit board...|$|R

50|$|A highly {{fault-tolerant}} {{system might}} continue {{at the same}} level of performance even though one or more components have failed. For example, a building with a backup electrical generator will provide the same voltage to <b>wall</b> <b>outlets</b> even if the grid power fails.|$|E
50|$|Sub-micro AC drives {{belong to}} the class of {{electrical}} components primarily intended to convert voltage and current levels received from <b>wall</b> <b>outlets</b> to be compatible with motors built in another region (such as allowing motors built in France {{to run in the}} United States without major modification).|$|E

50|$|The contestants in this {{challenge}} are tasked {{to build a}} triangular frame that would house a solar panel, which would power two lightbulbs and two <b>wall</b> <b>outlets</b> in their sheds, within 60 minutes. To help them, they are given one prototype frame from which they can take and copy their measurements.|$|E
50|$|Some {{adapters}} for <b>wall</b> <b>outlets</b> use an Edison screw, {{allowing a}} light socket {{to become an}} ungrounded electrical outlet (such as to install Christmas lights temporarily via a porch light), or to make a pull-chain switch with two outlets, or to split it for two lamps. Another adapter can make a wall outlet into a lamp holder (lamp socket).|$|E

5000|$|In the UK, {{the terms}} jack plug and jack socket are {{commonly}} used for the respective male and female phone connectors. In the US, a stationary (more fixed) electrical connector is called a [...] "jack". The terms phone plug and phone jack are sometimes {{used to refer to}} different genders of phone connectors, but are also sometimes used colloquially to refer to RJ11 and older telephone plugs and the corresponding jacks that connect wired telephones to <b>wall</b> <b>outlets.</b>|$|E
50|$|Conductive {{charging}} {{requires a}} physical {{connection between the}} electronic device's battery and the power supply. The need for a metal-to-metal connection between the charger and the device requiring charging {{is one of the}} main drawbacks of this method. To accomplish this without the use of physical cords connected to <b>wall</b> <b>outlets,</b> special attachments are made from electronic devices which are fitted with technology that can detect when the device makes connection with the power source, often a charging base. Conduction based wireless accessories may include changeable backs for cellular phones, special sleeves and attachable clips.|$|E
50|$|A {{diversion}} safe, or hidden safe, {{is a safe}} that is {{made from}} an otherwise ordinary object such as a book, a candle, a can, or even a <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> plug. Valuables are placed in these hidden safes, which are themselves placed inconspicuously (for example, a book would be placed on a book shelf).|$|R
5000|$|An {{electric}} utility {{has the capacity}} to generate and distribute electricity (the underlying capability). The wiring from the electric company’s distribution grid (the service) provides the means to supply electricity to support typical usage for a residential consumer’s house (service functionality), and a consumer accesses electricity generated (the output of invoking the service) via a <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> (service interface).|$|R
50|$|If {{the track}} is {{properly}} anchored, a hanging fixture may be suspended from it. The track itself {{can also be}} suspended. Rather than being hard-wired to a junction box (which requires a feeder device to be snapped into the track, either in the middle or at one end), {{it can also be}} end-fed from a standard <b>wall</b> <b>outlet.</b> Outlets can also be snapped into line-voltage track.|$|R
50|$|According to {{corporate}} lore, Collins found his inspiration {{in a dramatic}} Alabama lightning storm. As he watched the electric discharges strike the ground, he imagined the dancing limbs of a powerful creature, one that could be harnessed {{in the service of}} the public. He turned to a colleague, APC engineer Dan Clinton, to create the first drawings of Reddy Kilowatt, an “electrical servant” with lightning bolt arms and legs, wearing safety gloves and shoes. He added a friendly face with a light bulb nose and <b>wall</b> <b>outlets</b> for ears.|$|E
50|$|Most modern North American {{homes are}} wired to receive 240 volts from the transformer, {{and through the}} use of {{split-phase}} electrical power, can have both 120 volt receptacles and 240 volt receptacles. The 120 volts is typically used for lighting and most <b>wall</b> <b>outlets.</b> The 240 volt outlets are usually placed where the oven and stovetop, water heater, and clothes dryer would go (if they are electric, rather than using natural gas). Sometimes a 240 volt outlet is mounted in the garage for machinery or for charging an electric car.|$|E
5000|$|A {{completely}} {{flat wall}} socket (pictured) 50×50 millimetres (about 2×2 inches) with the 3 flat {{holes in the}} middle. This design matches the look, junction boxes etc. of other Danish <b>wall</b> <b>outlets</b> (such as those for AC power). [...] It supersedes an earlier round model which had a slightly recessed circular depression where the plug goes. Sockets etc. based on this 50mm module may be densely packed on walls etc. both vertically and horizontally, so plugs with their cords etc. need to stay within a traditional 43 mm(?) circle around the center to avoid collisions.|$|E
50|$|The first {{electric}} toothbrush, the Broxodent, {{was invented}} in Switzerland in 1954 by Dr. Philippe Guy Woog. Woog's electric toothbrushes were originally manufactured in Switzerland (later in France) for Broxo S.A. The device plugged into a standard <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> and ran on line voltage. Electric toothbrushes were initially created for patients with limited motor skills and for orthodontic patients (such as those with braces).|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Audio {{amplifier}} {{power supplies}} have typically utilized power transformers to provide safety isolation from a <b>wall</b> <b>outlet.</b> These transformers provide ohmic disconnect between the power supply and the AC mains. The power transformer and its inherent weight and expense can be eliminated by implementing an off line rectified system for high voltage {{portions of the}} amplifier. An optical isolator circuit {{has been designed to}} allow audio signals to pass while providing the isolation necessary to protect users from a <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> power source short circuit. The optical isolator used to pass the input signal in this design is a Fairchild 6 N 136 high speed opto-isolator. An identical opto-isolator has been employed to provide negative feedback for temperature stability and to maintain the operating point necessary to pass an audio signal. The circuit passes an input signal from the now optically isolated preamplifier stage to the power amplification stage with minimum distortion. The designed isolator does not exceed 1. 0 % total harmonic distortion, which is quite acceptable for high quality audio applications. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R
