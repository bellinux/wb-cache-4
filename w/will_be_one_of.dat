One example is the Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims {{to reduce the cost}} of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E

Released in 1939, The Will has carried on an enduring legacy, due in part to its sympathetic view on the lives of the average Egyptian people, who did not enjoy much luxuries at the time, and who often faced struggles with love and employment similar to the ones faced by the protagonist in the film, making the film a social commentary on its era.|$|R
40|$|Free <b>will</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{fundamental}} {{aspects of human}} cognition. In the context of cognitive neuroscience, various experiments on time perception, sensorimotor coordination, and agency suggest {{the possibility that it}} is a robust illusion (a feeling independent of actual causal relationship with actions) constructed by neural mechanisms. Humans are known to suffer from various cognitive biases and failures, and the sense <b>of</b> free <b>will</b> might <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them. Here I report a positive correlation between the belief in free will and paranormal beliefs (UFO, reincarnation, astrology, and psi). Web questionnaires involving 2076 subjects (978 males, 1087 females, and 11 other genders) were conducted, which revealed significant positive correlations between belief in free will (theory and practice) and paranormal beliefs. There was no significant correlation between belief in free will and knowledge in paranormal phenomena. Paranormal belief scores for females were significantly higher than those for males, with corresponding significant (albeit weaker) difference in belief in free <b>will.</b> These results <b>are</b> consistent with the view that free <b>will</b> <b>is</b> an illusion which shares common cognitive elements with paranormal beliefs...|$|R
