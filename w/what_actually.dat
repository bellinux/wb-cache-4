5|$|Militarily, it is {{difficult}} to draw many lessons from Salamis, because of the uncertainty about <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> happened. Once again the Allies chose their ground well in order to negate Persian numbers, but this time (unlike Thermopylae) had to rely on the Persians launching an unnecessary attack for their position to count. (Hale, John R.).|$|E
5|$|Some {{historians have}} {{questioned}} the reliability of some of Bede's accounts. One historian, Charlotte Behr, thinks that the Historia's account of {{the arrival of the}} Germanic invaders in Kent should not be considered to relate <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> happened, but rather relates myths that were current in Kent during Bede's time.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{lasted until}} 1753 and {{involved}} many of London's periodicals. It eventually resulted in countless essays, poems, {{and even a}} series of mock epic poems starting with Smart's The Hilliad. Although it is unknown <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> started the dispute, it resulted in a divide of authors who either supported Fielding or supported Hill, and few in between.|$|E

5|$|A battle {{certainly}} ensued {{although there}} are naturally two accounts as to <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> took place. According to the Burmese chronicles, the Burmese command fielded an army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome, as a decoy and the two armies lurked on the flanks in order to encircle any overstretched Siamese forces. As planned, the Siamese vanguard troops pressed on Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army waiting on the left flank to encircle the Siamese forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank drove back the remaining Siamese forces into the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Henry Fairfield Osborn named {{a second}} genus of small {{theropod}} from the Morrison Formation, Ornitholestes. This genus {{was based on}} a partial skeleton from Bone Cabin Quarry, north of Como Bluff. Ornitholestes became intertwined with Coelurus in 1920, when Charles Gilmore, in his influential study of theropod dinosaurs, concluded that the two were synonyms. This was followed in the literature for decades. The two genera were not formally compared, however, nor was there a full accounting of <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> belonged to Coelurus, until John Ostrom's study in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The Marian {{government}} {{produced a}} pamphlet with all six recantations plus {{the text of}} the speech Cranmer was to have made in the University Church. His subsequent withdrawal of his recantations was not mentioned, though <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> happened soon became common knowledge, undermining the effectiveness of Marian propaganda. Similarly, the Protestant party had difficulty in making use of the event, given Cranmer's recantations. The exiles' propaganda concentrated on publishing various specimens of his writings. Eventually John Foxe put Cranmer's story to effective use in 1559, and it features prominently in his Acts and Monuments when it was first printed in 1563.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern {{what ought to}} be done, insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of {{what ought to be}} done in a perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world, capable of being presented as a solution to the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.|$|E
5|$|The war, lasting {{less than}} three {{quarters}} of an hour, is considered the shortest in recorded history. Several durations are given by sources, including 38, 40 and 45 minutes, but the 38-minute duration is the most often quoted. The variation is due to confusion over <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> constitutes the start and end of a war. Some sources take {{the start of the}} war as the order to open fire at 09:00 and some with the start of actual firing at 09:02. The end of the war is usually put at 09:40, when the last shots were fired and the palace flag struck, but some sources place it at 09:45. The logbooks of the British ships also suffer from this with St George indicating that cease-fire was called and Khalid entered the German consulate at 09:35, Thrush at 09:40, Racoon at 09:41, and Philomel and Sparrow at 09:45.|$|E
5|$|William left England {{towards the}} end of 1086. Following his arrival back on the {{continent}} he married his daughter Constance to Alan Fergant, the Duke of Brittany, in furtherance of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings. William's son Robert, still allied with the French king Philip I, appears to have been active in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French Vexin in July 1087. While seizing Mantes, William either fell ill or was injured by the pommel of his saddle. He was taken to the priory of Saint Gervase at Rouen, where he died on 9 September 1087. Knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts. Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of the principals, but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> happened. The other, the De Obitu Willelmi, or On the Death of William, {{has been shown to be}} a copy of two 9th-century accounts with names changed.|$|E

5|$|President Arthur {{departed}} Haifa on April 4 for a ten-day excursion in the Mediterranean, calling at Jaffa, Beirut, Alexandria, and Naples, among others, before sailing for the United States from Haifa on April 17. While docked at Naples on April 23, crewmen from President Arthur {{got into}} a confrontation {{with members of the}} Blackshirts, the Italian fascist paramilitary group. Five of the Blackshirts had broken noses and black eyes; five American seamen were arrested and a further 15 Americans swam out to their steamer to avoid arrest. After calling at Halifax, the liner docked at Pier 86 in New York on March 8, carrying among its cargo 75,000bags of onions from Alexandria, 16,000cases of lemons from Palermo, and two cases of Jaffa oranges for Nathan Straus. Only 500well-wishers greeted the ship, arriving as it did on the Jewish sabbath, but President Arthur was greeted by the largest police detail in many years because of rumors of a mutiny on board the ship. Sources are unclear as to <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> happened aboard the ship, but it is known that virtually the entire crew, including the captain, was replaced before the next voyage.|$|E
5|$|Written by Christopher Priest, the {{opportunity}} to write this four-part story was offered to Priest after his previous script, Sealed Orders, had been cancelled. The scene breakdown was commissioned on 5 December 1980 and the scripts on 6 February 1981. Priest's story idea dealt with the 'secret' of <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> powered the TARDIS, in this case fear. Somewhere hidden inside the TARDIS was the one being the Doctor feared above all others, and the psychic {{tension between the two}} of them produced the energy to move through space and time. The story involved the Doctor having to confront and ultimately defeat this fear, and was designed to write out the character of Adric. After hearing nothing from the production office with regard to his completed scripts or his payment for them, Priest made contact with John Nathan-Turner. He was told that the scripts were unusable and that he would not be paid. After a bitter dispute Priest was paid and both Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward forced to pen a letter of apology over their treatment of the writer. The script was replaced by Saward's script Earthshock.|$|E
25|$|A {{critical}} {{finding of}} the study {{is that many of the}} 'disconnects' between the public's preferences and <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> is taking place are caused by weak or non-existent implementation tools – rather than by inadequate policies, as contained in the City/County Comprehensive Plan and other already adopted legislation.|$|E

25|$|But most {{teachers}} felt the increases were not enough, and a statewide strike occurred. A special {{convention of the}} FEA voted to approve a resolution which condemned the increases as inadequate. In February 1968, FEA president Jane Arnold said the state association would support local teachers if they walked off the job. Thousands did. Since strikes were illegal, <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> happened were mass resignations.|$|E

25|$|A diesel–electric locomotive's {{power output}} is {{independent}} of road speed, {{as long as the}} unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop tractive effort (also referred to as drawbar pull or tractive force, which is <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel–electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.|$|E
25|$|The {{person may}} not {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> happened, while emotions experienced during the trauma may be re-experienced without the person understanding why (see Repressed memory). This {{can lead to}} the traumatic events being constantly experienced as if they were happening in the present, preventing the subject from gaining perspective on the experience. This can produce a pattern of prolonged periods of acute arousal punctuated by periods of physical and mental exhaustion. This can lead to mental health disorders like acute stress and anxiety disorder, traumatic grief, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, conversion disorders, brief psychotic disorder, borderline personality disorder, adjustment disorder...etc.|$|E
25|$|The Santa Barbara County sheriff {{released}} a videotape showing Jackson's arrest. They also {{released a}}n audiotape of his ride to the police station. In it, Jackson complains about the handcuffs and is politely told by an officer how he can relieve the discomfort. He is heard to be whistling, and he asks for the air conditioning to be turned on (it was). Police allege these tapes prove that Jackson's claims are false; Jackson, along with his family, claim that what is being shown is merely a biased portion of <b>what</b> <b>actually</b> occurred. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer ordered an independent investigation into Jackson's complaints. After interviewing 163 witnesses, the complaints were rejected in August 2004.|$|E
