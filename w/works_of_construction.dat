Although there was an increase in the labour force, a variety of social problems also emerged with the concentration of new populations in the suburbs of the old city, such as Nikaia, Keratsini, Drapetsona and Korydallos.|$|E

The architectural works done here in the 4th and 5th centuries have been compared - owing to the execution of the main pillars, the round based pseudo-columns, the brick decorations - to the mausoleum of Amir Esma’il the Samanid in Bukhara. The plan of the mosque’s dome chamber and that of its secondary aisles at the corners of the perimeter have been likened to those of Heidaryyah Qazvin and the Jameh Mosque of Golpayegan. Assuming seven periods of restoration and essential repair, it is said that the most ancient part of the ensemble is its principle dome construction, now surrounded by adjunctions of later periods.|$|E

In Bernard's spare time for which was very limited he wrote about antique furniture and was preparing a book on the subject before his untimely death. Another passion was paintings but painting for himself and his particular sense of humour. Bernard found the time to paint very limited. In his painting the Tax Inspectors we see Bernard's humour bounce through with a crazed inspection in of tax officials going over a corpse with magnifying glass and probe. In The Au pair Robinson take on the foreign au pair invasion of the 1970s, this au pair, in casual wear, tennis racket to the ready and a general coolness to the sight of the parents and children within the interior - Mother on her knees and father laying a table while holding a dangling child. The style of Bernard Robinson's paintings could be associated with the great cubists or abstract painters of the period such as Picasso and Braque; his handling of paint bear him out as a phenomenal painter who knew his craft and, like Picasso's heavy narrative, he informs by subtle messages conveyed with a rigour of style and oil to canvas that its hard not to be impressed and informed at once.
