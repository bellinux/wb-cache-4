40|$|The waste {{management}} specialist {{must be able}} to identify and analyze waste generation sources and to propose proper solutions to prevent the waste generation and encurage the waste minimisation. In certain situations like implementing an integrated {{waste management}} sustem and configure the waste collection methods and capacities, practitioners can face the challenge to classify the generated waste. This will tend to be the more demanding as the literature does not provide a coherent system of criteria required for an objective <b>waste</b> <b>classification</b> process. The waste incineration will determine no doubt a different <b>waste</b> <b>classification</b> than waste composting or mechanical and biological treatment. In this case the main question is what are the proper classification criteria witch can be used to realise an objective <b>waste</b> <b>classification?</b> The article provide a short critical literature review of the existing <b>waste</b> <b>classification</b> criteria and suggests the conclusion that the literature can not provide unitary <b>waste</b> <b>classification</b> system which is unanimously accepted and assumed by ideologists and practitioners. There are various classification criteria and more interesting perspectives in the literature regarding the <b>waste</b> <b>classification,</b> but the most common criteria based on which specialists classify waste into several classes, categories and types are the generation source, physical and chemical features, aggregation state, origin or derivation, hazardous degree etc. The traditional classification criteria divided waste into various categories, subcategories and types; such an approach is a conjectural one because is inevitable that according to {{the context in which the}} <b>waste</b> <b>classification</b> is required the used criteria to differ significantly; hence the need to uniformizating the <b>waste</b> <b>classification</b> systems. For the first part of the article it has been used indirect observation research method by analyzing the literature and the various documents available in the virtual space, on the websites of certain international organizations involved in the wide and complex issue of waste management.

40|$|In this paper, a {{solid waste}} bin {{detection}} and <b>waste</b> level <b>classification</b> {{system that is}} rotation invariant is presented. First, possible locations and orientations of the bin are detected using Hough line detection. Then cross correlation is calculated to differentiate the true bin position and orientation from those of other similar objects. Next, features are extracted {{from the inside of}} the bin area and together with detected bin corners they are used to determine the bin's waste level. A few features are also obtained from the outside of the bin area to check whether there is rubbish littered outside the bin. The proposed system was tested on shifted, rotated and unrotated bin images containing different level of waste. In the experiment, bin detection was treated separately from <b>waste</b> level <b>classification.</b> For bin detection, if 95 of the opening area is captured then the bin is considered detected correctly. The <b>waste</b> level <b>classification</b> is only considered for the correctly detected bins where the waste level is classified as empty, partially full or full. The system also checks the presence of rubbish outside the bin. In training, only images containing unrotated bin were used while in testing images containing both unrotated and rotated bin were used in equal number. The system achieves an average bin detection rate of 97. 5 and <b>waste</b> level <b>classification</b> rate of 99. 4 despite variations in the bin's location, rotation and content. It is also robust against occlusion of the bin opening by large objects and confusion from square objects littered outside the bin. Its low average execution time suggests that the proposed method is suitable for real-time implementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{radioactive}} <b>waste</b> <b>classification</b> system {{currently used}} in the United States primarily relies on a source-based framework. This has lead to numerous issues, such as wastes that are not categorized by their intrinsic risk, or wastes that do not fall under a category within the framework and therefore are without a legal imperative for responsible management. Furthermore, in the possible case that advanced fuel cycles were to be deployed in the United States, the shortcomings of the source-based classification system would be exacerbated: advanced fuel cycles implement processes such as the separation of used nuclear fuel, which introduce new waste streams of varying characteristics. To {{be able to manage}} and dispose of these potential new wastes properly, development of a classification system that would assign appropriate level of management to each type of waste based on its physical properties is imperative. This dissertation explores how characteristics from wastes generated from potential future nuclear fuel cycles could be coupled with a characteristics-based classification framework. A static mass flow model developed under the Department of Energy's Fuel Cycle Research & Development program, called the Fuel-cycle Integration and Tradeoffs (FIT) model, was used to calculate the composition of waste streams resulting from different nuclear fuel cycle choices: two modified open fuel cycle cases (recycle in MOX reactor) and two different continuous-recycle fast reactor recycle cases (oxide and metal fuel fast reactors). This analysis focuses on the impact of waste heat load on <b>waste</b> <b>classification</b> practices, although future work could involve coupling waste heat load with metrics of radiotoxicity and longevity. The value of separation of heat-generating fission products and actinides in different fuel cycles and how it could inform long- and short-term disposal management is discussed. It is shown that the benefits of reducing the short-term fission-product heat load of waste destined for geologic disposal are neglected under the current source-based radioactive <b>waste</b> <b>classification</b> system, and that it is useful to classify waste streams based on how favorable the impact of interim storage is on increasing repository capacity. The need for a more diverse set of waste classes is discussed, and it is shown that the characteristics-based IAEA classification guidelines could accommodate wastes created from advanced fuel cycles more comprehensively than the U.

For calculations of HP 3 to 8, 10, 11 and 13 to 14, a general analytical protocol for {{the determination of}} elements and substances in waste has been developed in France and is submitted to CEN TC 292 'Characterisation of waste' for standardization.

40|$|Issue: Low-grade {{wood waste}} {{is defined by}} the {{feedstock}} quality requirements set by the regional endusers. These quality requirements are typically driven by the finished products. Therefore, there is a direct correlation between the value of the low-grade material and the marketability of the processed product. Low-grade wood includes railroad ties, and demolition, painted, and pressure-treated wood. Wood wastes having the lowest or no value to the processor or end-user are classified as low-grade wood. Also, wood requiring special handling is considered low-grade because of the additional processing and marketing costs. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends low-grade wood be identified at the scale house upon arrival to the facility. Immediate identification of the low-grade wood allows the appropriate fee to be charged. The different fee charges should reflect the level of labor and equipment effort required to process the wood waste, as well as, the lower potential market value of the load. Once the low-grade wood is identified, the load should be directed to a separate tipping area from the higher quality material. This practice assumes an on-site tipping space exists for several <b>waste</b> stream <b>classifications.</b> An important step in upgrading low-grade wood waste is to keep the various categories of feedstocks segregated. Many of the newer facilities realized this variability of the supply and prepared the receivin...|$|R
