Ideas invented by us, such as those found in mythology, legends, and fairy tales are created by us from other ideas we possess. Lastly, innate ideas, such as our ideas of perfection, are those ideas <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>as</b> a result of mental processes that are beyond what experience can directly or indirectly provide.|$|E

500|$|Hall {{noted in}} 2007 that other team members {{were willing to}} come back to help: [...] "We went through such turmoil but stayed for the love of the universe, the game and each other. Former team members often mention that if I ever got the {{intellectual}} property back and was going to make Anachronox 2, just tell them when and where. <b>We</b> <b>have,</b> <b>as</b> we say, 'The Love.

500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>as</b> believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E

60|$|While inmates of the Calabooza, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>as</b> much of {{the fruit}} as we wanted; and to this cause, and others that might be mentioned, may be {{ascribed}} the speedy restoration of our sick to comparative health.|$|R

2500|$|GamesRadar {{approved}} of the game, awarding a 90%, but added a disclaimer that the gaming experience is best [...] "if your machine is up to it". GameSpot's review agreed with the high system requirements noting that [...] "the load times {{are one of the}} biggest gripes that <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> <b>as</b> you will spend quite a bit of time waiting for a game to start up, even on high-end machines...also a bit demanding in the hardware department." ...|$|E
