5|$|America's Asian {{conflicts}} against Japan, North Korea, and North Vietnam brought Sun Tzu to {{the attention}} of American military leaders. The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, has directed all units to maintain libraries within their respective headquarters for the continuing education of personnel in the art of war. The Art of <b>War</b> <b>is</b> mentioned as an example of works to be maintained at each facility, and staff duty officers are obliged to prepare short papers for presentation to other officers on their readings. Similarly, Sun Tzu's Art of <b>War</b> <b>is</b> listed on the Marine Corps Professional Reading Program. During the Gulf War in the 1990s, both Generals Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. and Colin Powell employed principles from Sun Tzu related to deception, speed, and striking one's enemy's weak points.

According to Mary Kaldor, the new <b>wars</b> can <b>be</b> contrasted with earlier wars {{in terms of their}} goals, the methods of warfare and how they are financed (Kaldor, 2006 : 7). The first characteristic of the new <b>wars</b> <b>is</b> its goals. While old <b>wars</b> <b>were</b> about the geo-political or ideological goals, new <b>wars</b> <b>are</b> about the identity. Other scholars point out that new <b>wars</b> <b>are</b> waged because of greed rather than grievance and that the war itself becomes the purpose (Berdal and Malone, 2000) (F 0 a). The second characteristic of the new <b>wars</b> <b>is</b> the changed mode of warfare. As a breakdown of public authority blurs the distinction between public and private combatants, and between combatants and civilians, civilian casualties are increasing and civilians are sometimes deliberately targeted as an object of wars(F 0 b). The third one is the relation between new wars and global economy. The state failures and the civil <b>wars</b> <b>are</b> usually driven by global war economy. It seems plausible that the new <b>wars</b> <b>are</b> emerging. However if we look at wars in detail, we can find out some facts that refute the new wars hypothesis. First...|$|R

War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction. All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during <b>war</b> <b>is</b> forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment. Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the <b>war</b> <b>is</b> in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.|$|E
