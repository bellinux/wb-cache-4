5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Kerry Packer {{established}} the rival World Series Cricket (WSC) competition. It introduced {{many of the}} now commonplace features of One Day International cricket, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a <b>white</b> <b>ball</b> and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from {{the players on the}} pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England {{and other parts of the}} world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.|$|E

5|$|The {{current crest}} of the club {{is based on the}} {{official}} emblem of the city of Maribor, which is in turn based on a 14th-century seal with minor differences. The badge is formed in a shape of a shield, and shows the former Piramida Castle that used to stand on top of the Pyramid Hill before it was demolished {{at the end of the}} 18th century. A violet blossom forms the backdrop. Unlike the coat of arms of the city of Maribor, the current badge of the club does not represent a white dove facing downwards to the castle, but an athlete. At the top of the shield the name of the club and the year of its foundation is inscribed. The entire badge uses only two colours, purple and yellow. Previous versions of the crest included the colour white, one of the traditional colours of the club, in the form of a white castle in the centre and a <b>white</b> <b>ball</b> that was on top of the shield. Since May 2012 the official badge includes a yellow star above the crest, which indicates the first ten domestic titles won by the club.|$|E

2500|$|<b>White</b> <b>balls</b> were {{introduced}} when one-day matches began being played at night under floodlights, {{as they are}} more visible at night; all professional one-day matches are now played with <b>white</b> <b>balls,</b> {{even when they are}} not played at night. The <b>white</b> <b>balls</b> have been found to behave differently to the red balls, most notably that they swing a lot more {{during the first half of}} an innings than the red ball, and that they deteriorate more quickly. Manufacturers claim that <b>white</b> and red <b>balls</b> are manufactured using the same methods and materials, other than the dying treatment of the leather. Another problem associated with <b>white</b> cricket <b>balls</b> used in One Day Internationals is that they quickly become dirty or dull in colour, which makes it more difficult for batsmen to sight the ball after 30-40 overs of use. Since October 2012, this has been managed by the use of two new <b>white</b> <b>balls</b> in each innings, with a different ball used from each bowling end; the same strategy was used in the 1992 and 1996 Cricket World Cups. Between October 2007 and October 2012, the issue had been managed using one new ball from the start of the innings, then swapping it at the end of the 34th over with a [...] "reconditioned ball", which was neither new nor too dirty to see. Before October 2007, except during 1992 and 1996 World Cups, only one ball was used during an innings of an ODI and it was the umpires discretion to change the ball if it was difficult to see.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We study a {{generalized}} Friedman’s urn model with multiple drawings of <b>white</b> and blue <b>balls.</b> After a drawing, the replacement follows {{a policy of}} opposite reinforcement. We give the exact expected value and variance {{of the number of}} <b>white</b> <b>balls</b> after a number of draws, and determine the structure of the moments. Moreover, we obtain a strong law of large numbers, and a central limit theorem for the number of <b>white</b> <b>balls.</b> Interestingly, the central limit theorem is obtained combinatorially via the method of moments and probabilistically via martingales. We briefly discuss the merits of each approach. The connection to a few other related urn models is briefly sketched. 1...|$|R
25|$|Swing {{balls are}} bowled {{with the same}} grip and {{technique}} as fast balls although the seam is usually angled slightly rather than straight, and the slower ball grip may be used. It is difficult to achieve swing with a cutter grip since the ball will spin in flight, varying {{the orientation of the}} shiny and rough surfaces as it moves through the air. Many players, commentators on the game, and fans agree that swing is easier to achieve in humid or overcast conditions, and also that the red ball used in Test cricket swings more than the <b>white</b> <b>ball</b> used in the one-day game.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we present an {{analysis}} of some generalization of the classic urn and balls model. In our model each urn has a fixed capacity and initially is filled with <b>white</b> <b>balls.</b> Black balls {{are added to the}} system of connected urns and gradually displace <b>white</b> <b>balls.</b> We show a general form of formulas for the expected numbers of black balls in a given urn and we analyze some special cases (parallel and serial configurations). We are mainly interested in a counterpart of the Coupon Collector Problem for the model considered. The primary motivation for our research is the formal analysis of the mix networks (introduced by D. Chaum) and its immunity to so-called flooding (blending) attacks...|$|R
25|$|They {{were first}} {{developed}} by WACA curator John Maley {{for use in}} the World Series Cricket matches, set up in the 1970s by Australian businessman Kerry Packer. Drop-in pitches became necessary for the World Series as they had to play in dual purpose venues operating outside of the cricket establishment. Along with other revolutions during the series including the <b>white</b> <b>ball,</b> floodlights, helmets, and coloured clothing, drop-in pitches were designed to also make games more interesting. They would start off bowler friendly seaming and spinning with uneven bounce for the first two days of a game. After that they became extremely easy for batting meaning high targets were chaseable on the fourth and fifth days, although there would still be something in the pitch for the bowlers.|$|E
25|$|This {{distribution}} can {{be illustrated}} as an urn model with bias. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each <b>white</b> <b>ball</b> has the weight ω2. We {{will say that}} the odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now we are taking n balls, one by one, {{in such a way that}} the probability of taking a particular ball at a particular draw is equal to its proportion of the total weight of all balls that lie in the urn at that moment. The number of red balls x1 that we get in this experiment is a random variable with Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the game}} uses a <b>white</b> <b>ball</b> {{instead of the}} red one used in {{first-class}} cricket, the ball can become discoloured and hard to see as the innings progresses, so the ICC has used various rules {{to help keep the}} ball playable. Most recently, ICC has made the use of two new balls (one from each end), the same strategy that was used in the 1992 and 1996 World Cups so that each ball is used for only 25 overs. Previously, in October 2007, the ICC sanctioned that after the 34th over, the ball would be replaced with a cleaned previously-used ball. Before October 2007 (except 1992 and 1996 World Cups), only one ball would be used during an innings of an ODI and it was up to the umpire to decide whether to change the ball.|$|E

25|$|The {{distribution}} may {{be illustrated}} by the following urn model. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each <b>white</b> <b>ball</b> has the weight ω2. We {{will say that the}} odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now we are taking balls randomly {{in such a way that}} the probability of taking a particular ball is proportional to its weight, but independent of what happens to the other balls. The number of balls taken of a particular color follows the binomial distribution. If the total number n of balls taken is known then the conditional distribution of the number of taken red balls for given n is Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution. To generate this distribution experimentally, we have to repeat the experiment until it happens to give n balls.|$|E

Cinderella's animal friends, {{including}} Jaq and Gus, refashion it for her, completing the design with a necklace and sash discarded by Drizella and Anastasia, respectively. When Cinderella comes downstairs wearing the dress, the stepsisters are upset when they realize Cinderella is wearing their accessories, and tear the dress to shreds before leaving for the ball with their mother. A heartbroken Cinderella storms out into the garden in tears, where her Fairy Godmother appears before her. Insisting that Cinderella goes to the ball, the Fairy Godmother magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, the mice into horses, Cinderella's horse, Major, into a coachman, and dog, Bruno, into a footman, before turning Cinderella's ruined dress into a <b>white</b> <b>ball</b> gown and her shoes into glass slippers.

25|$|Pink balls were {{developed}} in the 2000s to enable Tests and first-class matches played at night. The red ball is unsuited to night tests due to poor visibility, and the <b>white</b> <b>ball</b> is unsuited to first-class cricket because its rapid deterioration makes it unable {{to be used for}} eighty overs as specified in the rules, so the pink ball was designed to provide a satisfactory compromise on both issues. It is still considered more difficult to see than a white ball; and the leather is more heavily dyed than in a red ball, which better preserves its colour and visibility as it wears but also gives it slightly different wear characteristics. It has performed well enough in testing and first-class cricket to be approved for use in international cricket. A pink ball was used {{for the first time in}} an international match in July 2009 when the England Woman's team defeated Australia in a one-day match at Wormsley, and a pink ball was used in a day-night Test match for the first time in November 2015. Other colours were also experimented with, such as yellow and orange (glowing composite), for improved night visibility, but pink proved to be the preferred option.|$|E
