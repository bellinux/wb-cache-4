The first working title was 'Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi,' and Shantanu (Moitra, the music director) told him. So he said, 'Munnabhai to theek hai, yeh Mahatma Gandhi kaun hai?'

During recording sessions in September 1990 for Dangerous, Jackson recorded a 6:40 minute demo of [...] "Dangerous", {{which he wrote}} with Bill Bottrell.

Here the keyboards are spacey, in strong contrast to the taunt, mechanical rhythm track.

The demo was released in November 2004, on [...] A different, longer version also exists, with Jackson heard screaming at the beginning—after a sound protection wall fell on {{him as he was}} about to record. [...] "The genesis of the songs we co-wrote [...] ", said Bottrell, [...] "consisted of Jackson humming melodies and grooves, and him then leaving the studio while I developed these ideas with a bunch of drum machines and samplers".

2500|$|Jaffe {{eventually}} set {{three conditions}} for the casting of Brando: That {{he would have to}} take a fee far below what he typically received; he'd have to agree to accept financial responsibility for any production delays his behavior cost; and he had to submit to a screen test. Coppola convinced Brando to a videotaped [...] "make-up" [...] test, in which Brando did his own makeup (he used cotton balls to simulate the character's puffed cheeks). Coppola had feared Brando might be too young to play the Don, but was electrified by the actor's characterization as the head of a crime family. Even so, he had to fight the studio in order to cast the temperamental actor. Brando had doubts himself, stating in his autobiography, [...] "I had never played an Italian before, and I didn't think I could do it successfully." [...] Eventually, Charles Bluhdorn, the president of Paramount parent Gulf+Western, was won over to letting Brando have the role; when he saw the screen test, he asked in amazement, [...] "What are we watching? <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> old guinea?" [...] Brando was signed for a low fee of $50,000, but in his contract, he was given a percentage of the gross on a sliding scale: 1% of the gross for each $10million over a $10million threshold, up to 5% if the picture exceeded $60million. According to Evans, Brando sold back his points in the picture for $100,000, as he was in dire need of funds. [...] "That $100,000 cost him $11million," [...] Evans claimed.|$|E

[...] Li Kui, then 72, stated to Emperor Dezong, [...] "I do not fear going that far a distance, but I am afraid that I would die on the way and not complete my task." [...] Emperor Dezong, who was saddened by the remarks, told Lu, [...] "Li Kui is too old." [...] Lu responded, [...] "An emissary to a far-away foreign state {{needs to have a}} good reputation. [...] Further, if Li Kui, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> old, is sent as an emissary, then in the future, no official younger than Li Kui would dare to refuse such a task."

[...] Li Kui was afraid that this meant that Trisong Detsen intended to detain him, and therefore responded, [...] "That Li Kui would never be willing to come here."
