5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural <b>way.</b> <b>Those</b> who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E

25|$|M.N. Roy, an ex-member of the Anushilan Samiti, {{perhaps the}} most {{important}} secret revolutionary organisation operating in East Bengal in the opening years of the 20th century, went to Moscow in by the end of April 1920. The new Russian government under Lenin evinced interest in him and encouraged him to form an Indian Communist Party. Roy went on to found the émigré Communist Party of India on 17 October 1920 in Tashkent. On his return to India, M.N. Roy who had read Gandhi Vs. Lenin met Dange in 1922. Dange at that time was closely associating with Lotvala to spread Marxian ideas. It was during this period that Dange grew in prominence as a Marxist; a sure <b>way</b> <b>those</b> days to invite antagonism from the British Government.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{reviews for}} Trans-Europe Express were positive.

500|$|Gandhi {{tried to}} test and prove to himself his brahmacharya, {{less than a}} year before his {{assassination}} in January 1948. In February 1947, he asked his confidants such as Birla and Ramakrishna if it would be wrong for him to experiment his brahmacharya oath. He began his experiments by publicly asking in February for volunteer women. He progressed from first letting different volunteers to sleep in the same room but different beds, then later in the same bed but clothed, and finally sleeping naked. Gandhi kept the bedroom doors open all night during these experiments. According to the 1960s memoir of his grandniece Manu, Gandhi feared in early 1947 that he and she may be killed by Muslims in the run up to India's independence in August 1947, and asked her when she was 18-year-old if she wanted to help him with his experiments to test their [...] "purity", for which she readily accepted. None of the women who participated in the brahmachari experiments of Gandhi indicated that they had sex or that Gandhi behaved in any sexual <b>way.</b> <b>Those</b> who went public said they felt they were sleeping with their ageing mother.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film two stars {{out of four}} and asked about the title character, [...] "Why should I care about this guy? He feels no pain and nothing can kill him, so {{therefore}} he's essentially a story device for action sequences." [...] James Berardinelli gave Wolverine {{two and a half}} stars out of four, calling the action scenes competently executed but not memorable, and considering that when dealing with Wolverine's past [...] "there's little creativity evident in the <b>way</b> <b>those</b> blanks are filled in", and that the revelations made Wolverine [...] "less compelling". Comparatively, Bill Gibron of AMC's Filmcritic.com website gave the film a positive [...] "4.0 out of 5 stars," [...] saying that although Hugh Jackman is [...] "capable of carrying even the most mediocre effort, he singlehandedly makes X-Men Origins: Wolverine an excellent start to the summer 2009 season." [...] He predicted [...] "there will be purists who balk at how Hood and his screenwriters mangle and manipulate the mythology;" [...] and further said that [...] "any ending which leaves several characters unexplained and unaccounted for can't really seal the full entertainment deal." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with multiple}} critics lauding {{the performances of}} actors Anna Torv and John Noble. In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker wrote this his [...] "mind was blown not once, but twice" [...] due to the many revelations about two universes; Fringe [...] "has vaulted to {{the upper reaches of}} current television". In a second review, Tucker praised the [...] "beautifully, startlingly executed" [...] special effects when the [...] "hole" [...] in the universe closed. Writing for The A.V. Club, critic Zach Handlen gave the episode an A, and felt the episode made him {{want to go back and}} rewatch season one because the finale had [...] "so many references and back story nods that I wanted to have everything in my head together". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought the finale [...] "leads to a wealth of possibilities... The déjà universe was a bold move. I can’t wait to see what our friends at Fringe do with it". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, critic Maureen Ryan heaped praise on the [...] "excellent" [...] episode, and complimented [...] "the quietly creepy atmosphere, the slowly building tension in the dual Walter/Olivia stories, the <b>way</b> <b>those</b> stories were skillfully woven together, the suitably tense lakeside encounter between Olivia, Peter and Mr. Jones".|$|E

2500|$|Melford Spiro {{remarks on}} an {{interesting}} difference {{with the concept}} of suffering in Burmese folk religion as opposed to Buddhism.

In contrast, folk faith places the cause of suffering on mischievous evil spirits. In this <b>way</b> <b>those</b> that suffer are free from blame involving misdeeds they did in their past life. They didn’t do anything wrong, but they must deal with the nuisance of nats. Burmese folk religion also allows for a cure to suffering, in the form of supernatural help from magical people, or offerings to the spirits.|$|E
