2500|$|GM (Genetically modified) grains are {{not allowed}} in South Australia, where some grain {{producers}} have called for the moratorium to be lifted. [...] They argue the GM technology would help them tackle weeds and other pests, and that farmers {{should be able to}} choose how they run their enterprises {{and whether or not they}} wanted to grow the 'premium products' described by Leon Bignell, the South Australian (SA) Agriculture Minister. Producers have also said their GM-free grain is not translating to higher profits. Bignell conceded more work needed to be done to market produce as GM-free but said he was confident producers would see higher financial returns in the near future. [...] In March 2015, Bignell told farmers they should not use GM but should instead rely upon what he called [...] 'God's gifts'. [...] He said the [...] "amazing" [...] results of the Government's 'New Horizons' [...] soil improvement program [...] "prove," [...] in his view, that grain producers [...] "do not need genetic modification technology." [...] He said that [...] "Instead of using the top five centimetres of the soil, you go down to 50cm or even deeper. You put clay in it when it's needed, you put organic matter where it's needed as well."

Bignell added that [...] "If you look at GM and the promises around increases of about seven per cent in yields, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> go for seven per cent when you can get 50 to 100 per cent increases in yield without having to use genetically modified seeds?" ...|$|E

The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said.
