5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E

5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E

5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} {{deterioration of the}} heart muscle's ability to contract, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> heart failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy can cause the heart to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts of the heart (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause the heart to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the role}} of {{mitochondria}} as the cell's powerhouse, {{there may be some}} leakage of the high-energy electrons in the respiratory chain to form reactive oxygen species. This was thought to result in significant oxidative stress in the mitochondria with high mutation rates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Hypothesized links between aging and oxidative stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging. A vicious cycle was thought to occur, as oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial DNA mutations, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> enzymatic abnormalities and further oxidative stress.|$|E

5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset {{muscle weakness}} {{caused by the}} immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} autonomic nervous system, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|High {{rainfall}} {{can cause}} widespread flooding, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas. Such floods cause rivers to burst their banks and submerge homes. The Ghaggar-Hakra River, which only flows during India's monsoon season, can flood and severely damage local crops. Floods can be exacerbated by fires {{during the previous}} dry season, which cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic, or water repellent. In various ways governments may help people deal with wet season floods. Flood plain mapping identifies which areas {{are more prone to}} flooding.

5|$|The {{cervical}} canal {{is lined}} with a single layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells. The two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> cancer of the cervix. Cervical cytology tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and HPV vaccination.

5|$|The social {{problems}} arising from alcoholism are serious, {{caused by the}} pathological changes {{in the brain and}} the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. Alcoholism is associated with loss of employment, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for drunk driving or public disorder, or civil penalties for tortious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> depression.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} can {{be associated}} with minor complications such as broken teeth or lacerations of the tissues of the upper airway. It can also {{be associated with}} potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents which can result in a severe and sometimes fatal chemical aspiration pneumonitis, or unrecognized intubation of the esophagus <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> potentially fatal anoxia. Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation. Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.|$|E
5|$|Acne is a {{very common}} problem, {{particularly}} during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum {{can lead to a}} blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a comedo, (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> infection, particularly by the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> death.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a steady supply of objects to tinker with, chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets.
