25|$|Words do {{not enter}} the Interlingua {{vocabulary}} solely because cognates exist in {{a sufficient number of}} languages.

25|$|Morse Code {{cannot be}} treated as a {{classical}} radioteletype (RTTY) signal when it comes to calculating a link margin or a link budget for the simple reason of it possessing variable length dots and dashes as well as variant timing between letters and <b>words.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> purposes of Information Theory and Channel Coding comparisons, the word PARIS is used to determine Morse Code's properties because it has an even number of dots and dashes.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson was {{the primary}} author of the Declaration of Independence. At age 33, {{he was one of}} the {{youngest}} delegates to the Second Continental Congress beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, where a formal declaration of independence from Britain was overwhelmingly favored. Jefferson chose his <b>words</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Declaration in June 1775, shortly after the war had begun, where the idea of Independence from Britain had long since become popular among the colonies. He was inspired by the Enlightenment ideals of the sanctity of the individual, as well as by the writings of Locke and Montesquieu.|$|E
25|$|Fiquito is {{an extreme}} {{supporter}} of Puerto Rican independence, {{but at the same}} time, he claims to hold a pragmatic, Puerto Rican-centric view on how the movement, perceived as having a waning popularity in current times, should regain mass appeal to Puerto Ricans. At the same time, he rejects what he perceives as the orthodoxy of the traditional pro-independence movements, particularly the Puerto Rican Independence Party, whose leadership he abhors. He reserves his strongest <b>words</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> political leadership of the NPP (a constant target), although he can be equally harsh to political leaders of all the other Puerto Rican parties.|$|E

25|$|One {{liter of}} ethanol contain 21.1 MJ, a liter of {{methanol}} 15.8 MJ and a liter of gasoline approximately 32.6 MJ. In other <b>words,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same energy content as one liter or one gallon of gasoline, one needs 1.6 liters/gallons of ethanol and 2.1 liters/gallons of methanol. The raw energy-per-volume numbers produce misleading fuel consumption numbers however, because alcohol-fueled engines {{can be made}} substantially more energy-efficient. A larger percentage of the energy available in a liter of alcohol fuel {{can be converted to}} useful work. This difference in efficiency can partially or totally balance out the energy density difference, depending on the particular engines being compared.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Rome, fellatio was {{considered}} profoundly taboo. Sexual acts were generally {{seen through the}} prism of submission and control. This is apparent in the two Latin <b>words</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> act: irrumare (to penetrate orally), and fellare (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it {{was considered}} to be abhorrent for a male to perform fellatio, since that would mean that he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from a woman or another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, anal sex – known practitioners were supposed to have foul breath and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table.|$|E
25|$|Although critic Dennis Harvey {{found the}} script full of plot holes, {{they were no}} {{more so than in}} the average slasher film. He criticized the main {{character}} of Eddie as bland, but had good words for Andrew Levitas' performance as the hedonistic Chaz. Laura Kern found the dialogue corny, but had very positive <b>words</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> way each character was brought to life (which, she felt, made it all the more difficult to watch each person die). Critics Jeff Shannon and Peter Hartlaub also found the characters well-developed, and Hartlaub thought the performances by Dylan Fergus and Matt Phillips were the best in the film. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Wilmington similarly enjoyed the way the film presented the audience with various stereotypes (drag queen, leatherman, sex addict) and then killed them off, leaving the most fully realized character alive.|$|E
