As angry as I may be about activities undertaken <b>without</b> <b>my</b> knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I'm still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior.|$|E
5|$|There {{are among}} other things four cadenzas for oboe, clarinet, bassoon and flute which run quite freely {{alongside}} one another, with no harmonic connection, and <b>without</b> <b>my</b> marking time. They are just like four streams of thought, each going its own way– differently and randomly for each performance– until they meet in a point of rest, as if flowing into a lock where they are united.|$|E

25|$|When evening comes, I go back home, {{and go to}} my study. On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by <b>without</b> <b>my</b> feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E
25|$|The 1991 film Not <b>Without</b> <b>My</b> Daughter {{was criticized}} for its {{portrayal}} of Iranian society. Filmed in Israel, {{it was based on}} the Pulitzer-nominated autobiography by Betty Mahmoody. In the book and film, an American woman (Mahmoody) traveled to Tehran with her young daughter to visit her Iranian-born family of her husband. Mahmoody's husband then undergoes a strange transformation in Iran, ranging from an educated and sophisticated citizen to an abusive, backwards peasant, eventually deciding that they will not return to the United States. Betty is told that she can divorce him and leave, but their daughter must stay in Tehran under Islamic law. Ultimately, after 18 months in Iran, Betty and her daughter escape to the American embassy in Turkey.|$|E

25|$|Most times {{a foreign}} {{language}} is spoken in film, subtitles are used to translate the dialogue for the viewer. However, there are occasions when foreign dialogue is left unsubtitled (and thus incomprehensible {{to most of the}} target audience). This is often done if the movie is seen predominantly from the viewpoint of a particular character who does not speak the language. Such absence of subtitles allows the audience to feel a similar sense of incomprehension and alienation that the character feels. An example of this is seen in Not <b>Without</b> <b>My</b> Daughter. The Persian language dialogue spoken by the Iranian characters is not subtitled because the main character Betty Mahmoody does not speak Persian and the audience is seeing the film from her viewpoint.|$|E

500|$|... "Terrance and Philip in Not <b>Without</b> <b>My</b> Anus" [...] {{was written}} by Trisha Nixon and South Park co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and {{directed}} by Parker.

500|$|I {{left this}} church at age 18.... I {{wanted to know}} what was happening, why so many {{seemingly}} good people didn't believe in any organized religion yet cared passionately about their behavior and value of their lives....

500|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. Parker and Matt Stone originally considered doing a full-length Queef Sisters episode {{in the style of the}} second season premiere [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not <b>Without</b> <b>My</b> Anus", but they decided against it based on the negative fan reaction to that episode.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers noted a {{significant}} amount of crude and vulgar humor in [...] "Terrance and Philip in Not <b>Without</b> <b>My</b> Anus", even by South Park standards; The Sydney Morning Herald noted the episode contained 29 separate fart jokes in the span of 22 minutes. Global Television Network in Canada reported no complaints about the episode in the weeks after its release.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Dooom 2, Thornton's 2008 {{follow-up}} to First Come, First Served, {{was produced in}} response to The Return of Dr. Octagon. According to Thornton, [...] "I'm one of those artists that people take my music <b>without</b> <b>my</b> consent. People love to snatch my music and do things on their own. You got people that put me on beats I never rapped on. I just feel that it's a bad thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, Parker and Stone {{considered}} {{making a}} full-length episode of The Queef Sisters. The duo had pulled a similar stunt {{with the second}} season premiere. Instead of the expected follow-up to [...] "Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut", in which the identity of Cartman's father was to be revealed, Parker and Matt Stone showed the episode [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not <b>Without</b> <b>My</b> Anus", a Terrance and Phillip-centered episode as an April Fools' Day prank. Since [...] "Eat, Pray, Queef" [...] was coincidentally also set to air on April Fools' Day, they considered a similar joke revolving around Katherine and Katie. However, since [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not <b>Without</b> <b>My</b> Anus" [...] infuriated South Park fans at the time, they decided {{not to do it}} and wrote a full script for [...] "Eat, Pray, Queef" [...] instead. The original prank is referenced in the episode, when The Canada Channel announces that it will not air a much-anticipated part two episode of Terrance and Phillip, and instead will show the Queef Sisters as an April Fools' Day prank. The angry reaction from the boys mirrors the real-life fan reaction to the South Park second season premiere.|$|E

500|$|Charles Stowe, her son, {{later wrote}} {{that his mother}} searched for higher purpose in {{everything}} she did, from growing potatoes to writing.
