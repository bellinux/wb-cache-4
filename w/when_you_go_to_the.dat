There was some speculation as to what Reznor's role would be within the company, but he was later named chief creative officer. He promised {{that he and the}} other members would strive to create a music subscription service that will be like [...] "having your own guy <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> record store, who knows what you like but can also point you down some paths you wouldn't have necessarily encountered". The service was officially launched in the United States on January 21, 2014.|$|E
2500|$|On {{specific}} crossovers with Daredevil, {{which had}} completed its first season {{by the time}} Jessica Jones began casting, Loeb said [...] "they’re in the same area. In some cases {{they are in the}} same neighborhood. One {{of the things that is}} important to us is, when you enter the police station, it’s the same police station. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hospital, you start to see the same people. [...] we don’t want people suddenly going, [...] "Wait, is that Matt Murdock that’s walking down the street?" [...] Because that’s going to feel odd, and in a weird way feel false." [...] On existing in the MCU, specifically in the same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, [...] "Jessica Jones is a very, very different show than Daredevil. We exist in a cinematic universe, [...] the mythology of the universe is connected, but they look very different, tonally they’re very different… That was my one concern coming in: Am I going to have to fit into Daredevil or what’s come before? And the answer is no." ...|$|E
2500|$|La Russa {{says it is}} {{important}} that relievers know their roles and the situations which they will be called into a game. He added, [...] "Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You want the guy who can handle that pressure. That, to me, is most important." [...] Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth." [...] Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other cable channels. Former manager Jim Fregosi said managers do not like to be second-guessed. [...] "Even if you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> closer", said Beane. [...] He noted the incremental increase gained by a closer in a three-run save situation [...] "is worth it because losing is so painful in that situation." [...] Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they were paid big money to pitch in that role. Former general manager Pat Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers. [...] "There are just too many specialists, guys who can only pitch one inning and only pitch certain innings and throw only 20 pitches. I think most pitchers are capable of pitching more", said Gillick.|$|E

"Very well," [...] said Gwendolen, {{arranging}} her hat fastidiously, [...] "then {{you will}} please {{to consider that}} you are half happy, {{which is more than}} I am used to seeing you."

60|$|That {{exuberance}} of manner {{which one}} notes, the first thing, in his intercourse with Venetians, characterizes all classes, but is most excessive and relishing in the poor. There {{is a vast}} deal of ceremony with every order, and one hardly {{knows what to do}} with the numbers of compliments it is necessary to respond to. A Venetian does not come to see you, he comes to revere you; he not only asks if you be well when he meets you, but he bids you remain well at parting, and desires you to salute for him all common friends; he reverences you at leave-taking; he will sometimes consent to incommode you with a visit; he will relieve you of the disturbance when he rises to go. All spontaneous wishes which must, with us, take original forms, for lack of the complimentary phrase, are formally expressed by him,--good appetite to you, when you go to dinner much enjoyment, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theatre; a pleasant walk, if you meet in promenade. He is your servant at meeting and parting; he begs to be commanded when he has misunderstood you. But courtesy takes its highest flights, as I hinted, from the poorest company. Acquaintances of this sort, when not on the Ciò ciappa footing, or that of the familiar thee and thou, always address each other in Lei (lordship), or Elo, as the Venetians have it; and their compliment-making at encounter and separation is endless: I salute you! Remain well! Master! Mistress! (Paron! parona!) being repeated as long as the polite persons are within hearing.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. For common gifts, {{necessity}} makes pertinences {{and beauty}} every day, {{and one is}} glad when an imperative leaves him no option, since if {{the man at the}} door have no shoes, you have not to consider whether you could procure him a paint-box. And as it is always pleasing to see a man eat bread or drink water, in the house or out of doors, so it is always a great satisfaction to supply these first wants. Necessity does everything well. In our condition of universal dependence, it seems heroic to let the petitioner[460] be the judge of his necessity, and to give all that is asked, though at great inconvenience. If it be a fantastic desire, it is better to leave to others the office of punishing him. I can think of many parts I should prefer playing to that of the Furies.[461] Next to things of necessity, the rule for a gift, which one of my friends prescribed, is that we might convey to some person that which properly belonged to his character, and was easily associated with him in thought. But our tokens of compliment and love are for the most part barbarous. Rings and other jewels are not gifts, but apologies for gifts. The only gift is a portion of thyself. Thou must bleed for me. Therefore the poet brings his poem; the shepherd, his lamb; the farmer, corn; the miner, a gem; the sailor, coral and shells; the painter, his picture; the girl, a handkerchief of her own sewing. This is right and pleasing, for it restores society in so far to its primary basis, when a man's biography[462] is conveyed in his gift, and every man's wealth is an index of his merit. But it is a cold lifeless business <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shops to buy me something which does not represent your life and talent, but a goldsmith's. That is fit for kings, and rich men who represent kings, and a false state of property, to make presents of gold and silver stuffs, as a kind of symbolical sin-offering,[463] or payment of blackmail.[464] ...|$|E
