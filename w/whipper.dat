5|$|A tribute video played next, {{highlighting}} the wrestlers from ECW that had died between the promotion's end in 2001 and One Night Stand. A three-way dance was next, with Tajiri facing Little Guido Maritato and Super Crazy. Tajiri was accompanied {{to the ring}} by The Sinister Minister and Mikey Whipwreck, and Guido was accompanied by his fellow F.B.I. members. One {{of the highlights of}} the match occurred when Super Crazy deliver a moonsault off the balcony onto {{all the members of the}} F.B.I. Guido was the first eliminated when Whipwreck delivered a <b>Whipper</b> Snapper while the referee was distracted. Tajiri picked up the three count to eliminate Guido. Super Crazy won the match after performing a moonsault off the top rope onto Tajiri, getting the three-count in the process.|$|E

25|$|The {{first stage}} {{production}} {{was written by}} Steinbeck, produced by Sam H. Harris and directed by George S. Kaufman. It opened on November 23, 1937, in the Music Box Theatre on Broadway. Running for 207 performances, it starred Wallace Ford as George and Broderick Crawford as Lennie. The role of Crooks was performed by Leigh <b>Whipper,</b> the first African-American member of the Actors' Equity Association. <b>Whipper</b> repeated this role in the 1939 film version.|$|E
50|$|Dog <b>whippers</b> {{became less}} common {{from the late}} 18th century onwards, presumably because animals were {{increasingly}} unwelcome at church services. One of the last recorded dog <b>whippers</b> was one John Pickard, who was appointed to Exeter Cathedral in 1856. A small room in the cathedral is still known as the Dog <b>Whipper's</b> Flat.|$|R
50|$|Dynamic rope is well-suited {{to handle}} <b>whippers,</b> which put {{a great deal}} of strain on a rope and equipment. Dynamic rope is rated by the UIAA to handle a {{specific}} number of <b>whippers</b> before being retired.|$|R

25|$|In 1957, Kiniski {{competed in}} Montreal and Toronto. His feuds with <b>Whipper</b> Billy Watson, Yukon Eric, Édouard Carpentier, and Pat O’Connor pushed his career further.|$|E
25|$|His {{legacy is}} well-remembered in York Region where he lived. W.J. Watson Public School in Keswick, Ontario is named in his honour. <b>Whipper</b> Billy Watson was {{inducted}} into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1995. Over {{the course of the next}} twelve years, Watson gained 130 pounds to weigh 350 pounds. He died on February 4, 1990 in Orlando, Florida.|$|E
25|$|Born in Odense, Denmark, Hansen {{emigrated to}} Canada during the mid-1950s and {{eventually}} {{became involved in}} professional wrestling making his debut in the Toronto-area for Frank Tunney's Maple Leaf Wrestling in 1968. As Eric the Red, a modern-day Viking, Hanson faced veterans such as Dutch Momberg, The Assassin, Wild Bull Curry and Tiger Jeet Singh during his first year and also formed a short-lived tag team with <b>Whipper</b> Billy Watson.|$|E
50|$|Some villages {{employed}} dog <b>whippers</b> in a {{more general}} capacity, dealing with stray and disruptive dogs throughout the village. In this sense dog <b>whippers</b> were precursors of modern animal control officers, much like church 'bang beggars' were to today's police officer. In addition, churches that found their coffers lacking {{had the option of}} hiring out their services or giving their staff other tasks to complete. The role was similar to the 'Sluggard Waker' that entailed poking or hitting drowsy members of the congregation on the head with a long, outfitted pole.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Whipper’s</b> {{ideology}} regarding antislavery {{was unique}} and complex. One of his main tenets rested in moral reform. Moral reform {{refers to the}} idea that the abolitionist movement [...] "served as a check on the evil dispositions of blacks and inculcated moral principles.|$|R
25|$|Kiniski began wrestling in {{his native}} Canada {{for the first time}} in November 1956, debuting for Toronto's Maple Leaf Wrestling. His first main-event match in the {{territory}} took place at Maple Leaf Gardens in January 1957, when he teamed with Buddy Rogers against <b>Whipper</b> Billy Watson and Pat O'Connor and saw the beginning of a lengthy feud with Watson that spanned across Canada; the Kiniski-Watson feud gained national exposure due to their matches sometimes being seen on CBC Television. He also challenged NWA World Heavyweight titleholders Watson, Thesz and Dick Hutton for the title on several occasions between 1955 and 1957.|$|E
25|$|On {{the advice}} of wrestler Yukon Eric, Sammartino {{contacted}} Toronto promoter Frank Tunney hoping {{to take advantage of}} Toronto's large Italian population. Despite McMahon trying to blackball him there as well, Tunney decided to take a chance. Sammartino made his Toronto debut in March 1962 and very quickly, with the help of self-promotion in local newspapers and radio programs, became an attraction. His ability to speak Italian also ingratiated himself with that immigrant population. With Canadian legend <b>Whipper</b> Billy Watson, Sammartino won his first professional wrestling championship in September 1962, the local version of the International Tag Team Championship. Soon, he was in demand by other promoters in different Canadian territories.|$|E
25|$|From {{that point}} on, Watson was {{positioned}} {{as a legitimate}} main event performer, a position that was cemented during Watson's feud with Nanjo Singh, which began in January 1942. Watson soon became a crowd favourite {{and within a few}} years was a mainstream celebrity and one of Toronto's most popular citizens. Frank Tunney estimated that <b>Whipper</b> Watson drew more than five million people in main events of shows in Toronto. As {{one of the most popular}} wrestlers in the city’s history, Watson spent 31 years entertaining fans. His debut at Maple Leaf Gardens was on October 3, 1940, and his last match was held on November 28, 1971.|$|E
5000|$|The huntsman, {{who may be}} a professional, is {{responsible}} for directing the hounds. The Huntsman usually carries a horn to communicate to the hounds, followers and <b>whippers</b> in. Some huntsmen also fill the role of kennelman (and are therefore known as the kennel huntsman). In some hunts the master is also the huntsman.|$|R
5000|$|Mutation {{is common}} within the species, caused by [...] "budgerigar colour genetics". However, <b>Whipper's</b> unique {{mutation}} is long curly feathers, short flightless wings and apparent blindness. It is {{suspected that the}} mutation, which is known to budgerigar breeders as the [...] "feather duster" [...] mutation, caused unrestricted feather growth, resulting in the budgerigar's dishevelled appearance.|$|R
50|$|In 1808, Trevithick {{entered a}} {{partnership}} with Robert Dickinson, a West India merchant. Dickinson supported several of Trevithick's patents. The first of these was the Nautical Labourer; a steam tug with a floating crane propelled by paddle wheels. However, it {{did not meet the}} fire regulations for the docks, and the Society of Coal <b>Whippers,</b> worried about losing their livelihood, even threatened the life of Trevithick.|$|R
25|$|Watson {{was well}} known for his {{contributions}} to charity. He raised millions for campaigns such as the Easter Seals and was responsible for having 150,000 children join a safety club. He made many public appearances across Canada in support of children with physical disabilities and held an annual Easter Seals skate-a-thon at the Gardens. In 1974, he also started the “Whipper Watson Snowarama for Timmy” {{to raise money for}} the construction of a therapeutic pool. To date, Snowarama for Easter Seals Kids has raised over 16.1 million dollars provincially to help support children and youth with physical disabilities. Today, his campaign to build The <b>Whipper</b> Watson Therapeutic Pool at Southlake Regional Health Centre is illustrated in a mural in the facility.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{she served}} as {{chairman}} of the Negro Division of the Hollywood Victory Committee, providing entertainment for soldiers stationed at military bases. (The military was segregated, and black entertainers were not allowed to serve on white entertainment committees.) She elicited the help of a friend, the actor Leigh <b>Whipper,</b> and other black entertainers for her committee. She made numerous personal appearances at military hospitals, threw parties, and performed at United Service Organizations (USO) shows and war bond rallies to raise funds to support the war on behalf of the Victory Committee. Bette Davis was the only white member of McDaniel's acting troupe to perform for black regiments; Lena Horne and Ethel Waters also participated. McDaniel was also a member of American Women's Voluntary Services.|$|E
25|$|The first {{professional}} wrestling {{show at the}} Gardens was held on November 19, 1931 and attracted 15,800 people to see world champion Jim Londos in the main event. The show was promoted by Jack Corcoran, who passed the reins to Frank Tunney and his Maple Leaf Wrestling promotion in 1939. Under Tunney, Toronto and the Gardens was for decades a thriving centre for professional wrestling. Local hero <b>Whipper</b> Billy Watson became the city's top wrestling attraction in the 1940s and 1950s. The last WWE-promoted event {{to be held at}} Maple Leaf Gardens was on September 17, 1995. Boxing was also a regular offering at the Gardens for many years. The first world title bout in the building was on September 19, 1932, with bantamweight champion Panama Al Brown knocking out challenger Emile Pladner in the first round.|$|E
50|$|King Richard’s Faire is {{a renaissance}} fair held in Carver, Massachusetts, which recreates a 16th-century marketplace, {{including}} handmade crafts, foods, musicians, singers, dancers, minstrels, mimes, jugglers, <b>whippers,</b> magicians, comedians, puppeteers, gymnasts, exotic animals (including Siberian tigers and ligers), acrobats, mud beggars, stilt walkers, knights jousting on horseback, a royal court, and the fictional King Richard. King Richard’s Faire is the longest-running renaissance fair in New England.|$|R
50|$|The red {{sandstone}} St Margaret's Church, {{overlooking the}} village green, {{dates from the}} early 16th century. Notable features include a rare example of a dog <b>whipper's</b> pew and a memorial to Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere. A war memorial stands in the churchyard, which also contains the war graves of a soldier of the First World War and a soldier and airman of the Second World War.|$|R
2500|$|Nadim {{worked as}} an {{assistant}} for {{the head of the}} montage section, Salah Abu Seif in many feature films and really benefited from the experience of the film [...] "Saif Al-Galad" [...] (the <b>Whipper's</b> sword). Cutting and arranging one shot after the other, this movie was growing more and more consistent and the result was that most of the critics praised the montage of the film when it was screened at Cannes Film Festival in 1946.|$|R
25|$|On March 26, 1947, he {{defeated}} Enrique Torres {{to capture}} the Los Angeles Heavyweight Championship. Then on February 22, 1949, George was booked as the feature attraction at New York City's Madison Square Garden in what would be pro wrestling's first return to the building in 12 years. By the 1950s, Gorgeous George's star power was so huge {{that he was able}} to command 50% of the gate for his performances, which allowed him to earn over $100,000 a year, thus making him the highest paid athlete in the world. Moreover, on May 26, 1950, Gorgeous George defeated Don Eagle to claim the AWA World Heavyweight Championship (Boston version), which he held for several months. During this reign he was beaten by the National Wrestling Alliance World Champion Lou Thesz in a highly publicized bout in Chicago. However, perhaps Gorgeous George's most famous match was against his longtime rival <b>Whipper</b> Billy Watson on March 12, 1959, in which a beaten George had his treasured golden locks shaved bald before 20,000 delighted fans at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens and millions more on national television.|$|E

5000|$|The attire for {{traditional}} beagling on foot normally {{consists of a}} green coat and stockings, white breeches and a cap (similar in style to those worn when riding a horse), or a green flat cap. Many packs have a coloured collar to distinguish themselves from other packs. As with foxhounds a handful of packs have a different coloured uniform, either red or blue coats being worn, while in a few hunts the huntsman's coat may be a different colour from those worn by the <b>whippers</b> in. Beagles generally have a higher pitched [...] "cry" [...] when hunting a line than foxhounds do.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} section of the piece, the tubular bell sounds three more times, causing the {{whipping}} players to freeze. One of them runs offstage and returns {{with a pair of}} scissors. He uses the scissors to cut open Miron's shirt, and he reaches inside his belly. He pulls out a music box. He places the music box on one of three small tables {{at the front of the}} stage and opens it. Hearing a melody, he goes to a second glockenspiel which is located in front of Miron, and he plays along with the music box melody. The klangplatten performer interrupts him, and he runs offstage. The other two <b>whippers</b> follow suit in turns, retrieving a music box from Miron's belly, placing it on one of the tables, and playing along with their melody on the glockenspiel.|$|R
2500|$|The more ardent Democrats, {{called the}} [...] "Straightout Democrats", gained {{strength}} after the General Assembly elected [...] former Governor Franklin J. Moses Jr. and William <b>Whipper</b> to circuit judgeships, {{as they were}} considered corrupt. The nominations were blocked by Governor Chamberlain, but the Straightouts believed that meaningful political reform would happen only when Democrats gained power. In their opinion, every race from governor to coroner had to be contested.|$|E
2500|$|The University Act of 1869 reorganized the University and {{provided}} it with generous financial support. [...] An amendment {{was added to}} the act by W. J. <b>Whipper,</b> a black representative from Beaufort, that would prevent racial discrimination from the admissions policy of the University. [...] The legislature further proved its seriousness towards racial equality by electing two black trustees to the governing board of the University on March 9, 1869. A normal school was established by the legislature {{on the campus of the}} University as well as a preparatory school since most of the black students of the state were ill-prepared for the academic work required at a university. [...] In addition, to encourage enrollment by blacks, tuition and other fees were abolished. [...] On October 7, 1873, Henry E. Hayne, the Secretary of State of South Carolina, became the first black student when he registered for the fall session in the medical college of the University.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, CHUM was calling itself [...] "Radio One", as its ratings {{continued}} to increase. [...] An {{important part of}} CHUM's success was the station's unpredictable morning man Al Boliska, who joined CHUM in October 1957, after working at station CKLC in Kingston, Ontario. [...] By 1959, Boliska had {{made a name for}} himself as a disc jockey who got listeners talking. [...] He also made them laugh, and became known for telling what he called the [...] "World's Worst Jokes". [...] Boliska also did a number of stunts, such as taking part in a professional wrestling match with <b>Whipper</b> Billy Watson. [...] When he lost, that led to another stunt, where Boliska stayed away from his show for several days, saying he was now too discouraged by the loss to do his show. [...] A hypnotist was called in, and Boliska's self-esteem was restored. [...] Boliska left CHUM in late 1963 to go 'across the street' to CKEY. He was replaced by WKBW Buffalo radio & TV personality Jay Nelson, popularly known as [...] "Jungle Jay" [...] from his role as host of a children's show on Buffalo's Channel 7 which was also popular among Toronto youngsters. He would be followed by housewives' jock John Spragge; singer/DJ Mike Darow; Pete Nordheimer, replaced in 1961 by Bob McAdorey, teen DJ Dave Johnson, and all night DJ Bob Laine. [...] Later additions to the CHUM DJ lineup included Duff Roman and Brian Skinner, both of whom came from rival Toronto rocker CKEY (then owned by Jack Kent Cooke).|$|E
60|$|This was {{too much}} to be borne, and Frank rode up red with passion; and a lot of others, {{including}} the <b>whipper,</b> soon followed.|$|E
60|$|The Parson's behests were obeyed. The hounds {{followed}} Mick {{into the}} plantation, and {{were followed by}} {{two or three of}} the more eager of the party, who did not object to receiving wet boughs in their faces, or who delighted in riding for half an hour with their heads bowed close down over their saddle-bows. The rest remained with the <b>whipper,</b> outside.|$|E
60|$|Though the {{majority}} of those who were in the habit of hunting with the Kelly's Court hounds had been at the breakfast, there were still a considerable number of horsemen waiting on the lawn in front of the house, when Frank and his friends sallied forth. The dogs were collected round the huntsman, behaving themselves, for the most part, with admirable propriety; an occasional yelp from a young hound would now and then prove that the <b>whipper</b> [36] had his eye on them, and would not allow rambling; but the old dogs sat demurely on their haunches, waiting the well-known signal for action. There they sat, as grave as so many senators, with their large heads raised, their heavy lips hanging from each side of their jaws, and their deep, strong chests expanded so as to show fully their bone, muscle, and breeding.|$|E
