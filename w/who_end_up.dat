It was followed in 1951 by Cornell University professor Arthur Mizener's The Far Side of Paradise, a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald that rekindled interest in the couple among scholars. Mizener's biography was serialized in The Atlantic Monthly, and a story about the book appeared in Life magazine, then one of America's most widely read and discussed periodicals. Scott was viewed as a fascinating failure; Zelda's mental health was largely blamed for his lost potential.|$|E

500|$|Marcie Bianco of Quartz {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "centered around women's desire" [...] and Haynes structured {{it in a way}} that [...] "elevates the power of women's gaze". The omission of Carol from Best Picture, Bianco concluded, illustrates [...] "yet again how sexism operates in the world, and in the Academy specifically, as the refusal to see women as protagonists and agents of desire." [...] Writing for Paper magazine, Carey O'Donnell observed that gay romances are only [...] "Oscar surefires" [...] when they use the tragedy and desolation equation, and [...] "a depiction of two strong women in love with each other ... <b>who</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> being [...] " [...] with their lesbian relationship [...] "seems to still be troubling to many."

500|$|It is {{stated in}} the Indian texts that the legendary Kurukshetra War leads {{to the death of}} all the hundred sons of Gandhari. On the night before Duryodhana's death, Krishna visits Gandhari to offer his condolences. Feeling that Krishna {{deliberately}} did not {{put an end to the}} war, in a fit of rage and sorrow Gandhari places a curse on Krishna that he, along with everyone else from his Yadu dynasty, will perish. According to the Mahabharata, a fight breaks out at a festival among the Yadavas, <b>who</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> killing each other. Mistaking the sleeping Krishna for a deer, a hunter named Jara shoots an arrow that fatally injures him. Krishna forgives Jara and dies. The pilgrimage (tirtha) site of Bhalka in Gujarat marks the location where Krishna is believed to have died. It is also known as Dehotsarga, states Diana L. Eck, a term that literally means the place where Krishna [...] "gave up his body". The Bhagavata Purana in Book 11, chapter 31 states that after his death, Krishna returned to his transcendent abode directly because of his yogic concentration. Waiting gods such as Brahma and Indra were unable to trace the path Krishna took to leave his human incarnation and return to his abode.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, Austen {{studies was}} {{influenced}} by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's seminal The Madwoman in the Attic (1979), which contrasts the [...] "decorous surfaces" [...] with the [...] "explosive anger" [...] of 19th-century female English writers. This work, along with other feminist criticism of Austen, has firmly positioned Austen as a woman writer. Gibler and Gubar suggested that what are usually seen as the unpleasant female characters in the Austen books like Mrs. Norris in Mansfield Park, Lady Catherine de Bourgh in Pride and Prejudice and Mrs. Churchill in Emma were in fact expressions of Austen's anger at a patriarchal society, whom are punished in guilt over her own immodesty in writing novels while her heroines <b>who</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> happily married are expressions of Austen's desire to compromise with society. The Gilbert-Gubar thesis proved to be influential and inspired scholars to reexamine Austen's through most have a more favorable opinion of her heroines than Gilbert and Gubar did., Other scholars such as Linda Hunt have argued that Austen used realism {{as a way of}} attacking patriarchy from the outside as opposed to subverting it from within by irony as Gilbert and Gubar claimed. The interest generated in Austen by these critics led to the discovery and study of other woman writers of the time. Moreover, with the publication of Julia Prewitt Brown's Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form (1979), Margaret Kirkham's Jane Austen: Feminism and Fiction (1983), and Claudia L. Johnson's Jane Austen: Women, Politics and the Novel (1988), scholars were no longer able to easily argue that Austen was [...] "apolitical, or even unqualifiedly 'conservative'". Kirkham, for example, described the similarities between Austen's thought and that of Mary Wollstonecraft, labelling them both as [...] "Enlightenment feminists". Kirham argued that by showing women were just as capable of being rational as men that Austen was a follower of Wollstonecraft. Johnson similarly places Austen in an 18th-century political tradition, although she outlines the debt Austen owes to the political novels of the 1790s written by women.|$|E

A 2006 report from the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) concluded that [...] "BSAC currently takes the view that based on evidence from available statistics and risk assessment, the increased risk attendant to allowing planned solo diving is unacceptable". The data underlying the statistics which are used {{to point to the}} dangers of solo diving are questionable: for example, divers <b>who</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> dying alone but originally had started out as part of a buddy pair are often considered to be [...] "diving solo" [...] in such statistics, but whether the separation was a consequence of the triggering incident rather than a cause is not analyzed.|$|E
