According to Hagin, God revealed that Branham was teaching false doctrine and God was removing Branham because of his disobedience.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, an Italian stone mosaic {{that was}} part of a set of four stones which had {{decorated}} the Amber Room was found in Germany, in the possession of the family of a soldier <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> helped pack up the amber chamber. The mosaic came {{into the hands of the}} Russian authorities and was used in the reconstruction effort.|$|E

First appearing in Philadelphia, Redheffer exhibited his machine to the public, charging high prices for viewing.

It was discovered the machine was actually powered by a device Redheffer claimed was powered by the machine.|$|E
5|$|For his part, Thompson said {{he thought}} the judge was trying to protect Moore's {{criminal}} conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.|$|E
5|$|High (early) dating hypothesis: Giovanni Pettinato {{supports}} {{an early}} dating for Ebla {{that would put}} the destruction at around 2500 BC. Pettinato, while preferring the date of 2500 BC, later accepted the event could have happened in 2400 BC. The scholar suggests the city was destroyed in 2400 BC by a Mesopotamian such as Eannatum of Lagash—who boasted of taking tribute from Mari—or Lugalzagesi of Umma, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> reached the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|In 1896, Budge was {{approached}} by a resident of Gebelein <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> found more mummies.

He began excavations and a total of six mummified bodies were removed from shallow sand graves at Baḥr Bila Mâ (Waterless River) located at the eastern slopes of the north-most hill at Gebelein.|$|E
5|$|Music {{journalist}} Peter Doggett {{notes the}} irony of the surf music reference. In 1970, business manager Michael Jeffery committed Hendrix to contributing to the soundtrack for Rainbow Bridge; his music is heard during surfing scenes with David Nuuhiwa and others. Pioneer surf guitarist Dick Dale, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> met Hendrix in Los Angeles in 1964, believed the mention was Hendrix's way of encouraging his recuperation when Dale was seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|On July 31, 1846, {{the party}} left Blacks Fork {{after four days}} of rest and wagon repairs, eleven days behind the leading Harlan-Young group. Donner hired a {{replacement}} driver, and the company was joined by the McCutcheon family, consisting of 30-year-old William, his 24-year-old wife Amanda, two-year-old daughter Harriet, and a 16-year-old named Jean Baptiste Trudeau from New Mexico, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> knowledge of the Native Americans and terrain {{on the way to}} California.|$|E

5|$|The {{director}} of On the Job, Erik Matti, took inspiration from a service driver of Viva Films <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been temporarily {{released from prison}} to perform contract killings before being reincarcerated. Matti shelved this idea until he ended his hiatus from directing. In 2009, he submitted a short film he directed entitled The Arrival and an eight-minute trailer of On the Job, featuring Joel Torre, to film festivals {{in an attempt to}} pitch the project. Both entries were met with critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|A graphic {{description}} of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had a confrontation with it, but accounts describing {{the details of the}} creature's appearance are inconsistent. In common with many other sea monsters it is unable to tolerate fresh water, therefore those it is pursuing have only to cross a river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian spirit, and the only one able to control it.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} an amateur radio {{operator}} <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> received a faint SOS signal from Star Dust initially raised hopes {{that there might}} have been survivors, but all subsequent attempts over the years to find the vanished flight failed. In the absence of any hard evidence, numerous theories arose —including rumours of sabotage (compounded by the later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to British South American Airways); speculation that the flight might have been blown up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by passenger Paul Simpson; or even the suggestion that Star Dust might have been taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight's final Morse code message).|$|E

5|$|After Jesus' death, his {{followers}} said {{he rose from}} the dead, although exact details of their experiences are unclear. Some of those <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> witnessed Jesus' resurrection later died for their belief, which indicates that their beliefs were likely genuine. According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|As more {{information}} about Burge's reign was published, activists worked to save some Chicago inmates on death row <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been wrongfully convicted. In 1998, representatives from the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Chicago Law School, the London-based International Center for Criminal Law and Human Rights, law professor Anthony Amsterdam, former federal judges George N. Leighton and Abner Mikva, Illinois judge R. Eugene Pincham, and British activist Bianca Jagger, called for a stay of execution for Aaron Patterson, a death row inmate from Chicago. His conviction for murder was based primarily on a confession which he claimed was coerced by torture from Burge and his officers.|$|E
5|$|By December 1974, Lennon and Pang {{considered}} {{buying a}} house together, and he refused to accept Ono's phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet with Ono, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused {{to such an extent}} that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her that his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.|$|E

5|$|By March 1, 2005, over a {{year after}} the war ended, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) had {{disarmed}} and demobilized 103,018 people <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fought for former president Charles Taylor or the two rebel groups, Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) or the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL). That year most former AFL elements were concentrated at Camp Schiefflin. The previous AFL personnel, including those of the Navy and Air Force, were slowly retired with pensions obtained by the MND and international partners from a number of international donors.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan {{placed a}} {{moratorium}} on executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 death row inmates who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois death row inmates. Given {{the number of cases}} of alleged brutality to be investigated, inmates <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been abused and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges. A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E
5|$|In {{a speech}} at the Berlin Geographical Society in 1919, Detzner claimed that the natives of New Guinea had opposed Australian {{domination}} and resisted a military recruitment that amounted to slavery, that even the English plantation holders wished to remain independent of Australia, and that the natives were collecting money to build a war memorial for the Germans. The report on Detzner's speech, transmitted from a news agency in London, caused a small flutter in Australian government circles, but generally was dismissed; an earlier report by the Australian judiciary had absolved the Australian force of improper recruiting or treatment of the New Guineans. An angry letter to the editor from another Australian source, <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been in service in Morobe from 1914–1915, received little attention.|$|E
