5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Khrushchev {{opened a}} Central Committee meeting to {{hundreds}} of Soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting. For the first time, {{the proceedings of the}} Committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the Committee, since any dissenters <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.|$|E
5|$|Young's {{claims that}} the new decipherments were merely a {{corroboration}} of his own method, meant that Champollion would have to publish more of his data to make clear {{the degree to which}} his own progress built on a systematicity that was not found in Young's work. He realized that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it apparent to all that his was a total system of decipherment, whereas Young had merely deciphered a few words. Over the next year he published a series of booklets about the Egyptian gods, including some decipherments of their names.|$|E
60|$|There is {{no doubt}} {{whatever}} that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> succeeded in ultimately escaping from this pertinacious ghost, and poor Poopy <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the best {{of her way to}} Sandy Cove alone, but for the fortunate circumstance that Corrie fell; and, being only a couple of paces in advance of his companion, Bumpus fell over him.|$|R

5|$|After the Free State {{government}} dismissed {{an ultimatum}} from Pretorius to cease what he {{regarded as the}} marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the Free State to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough and that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> terms.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk came {{to believe}} that {{communist}} triumph in Southeast Asia was inevitable and that Cambodia's military was incapable of defeating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), even with U.S. support. If Cambodia (and his rule) was to survive, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a bargain with the devil. On 10 April 1965 he broke off diplomatic relations with the U.S. and swung politically to the left. To gain foreign support, both economic and political, Sihanouk turned to the People's Republic of China. One of the terms of the agreement between Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai was that Cambodia would allow the use of its eastern border by the North Vietnamese in their effort to reunify the two Vietnams.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{shouting}} match, between Brillstein and Moss, ensued. Both Brillstein and Michaels {{were stunned}} by how poorly the executives had prepared themselves. They finally left after Moss refused {{to commit to}} anymore than six episodes of a possible prime time series; Brillstein and Michaels had wanted 17. Afterwards, Michaels was convinced his relationship with NBC was, {{at this point in}} time, over. [...] "They <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> me feel special come back, and they didn't," [...] he recalled years later.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Steeple Tree Hill, the Japanese were less {{inclined}} to engage the Australian forces, nevertheless the advance continued to be frustratingly slow for the Australian commanders. The terrain over which the final part of the advance was undertaken was particularly taxing on the troops involved. Many of the slopes up which {{they were required to}} advance had gradients of at least 45 degrees, which meant that even reasonably short distances took considerable time To make matters worse, near the junction of the Siki Creek, a landslide caused by the Allied bombing, coupled with a number of land mines that the Japanese had planted, blocked the main road to Sattelberg, meaning that the soldiers from the 2/48th <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the final attack on Sattelberg without armoured support. In an effort to counter this problem, Whitehead determined that the tanks would be re-allocated to the 2/23rd, in the hope that a new route would be opened up by the engineers.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} and California {{sea lions}} {{were used in}} the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from enemy soldiers, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, as they {{would not be able to}} discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (dolphins and sea lions), MK7 (dolphins), and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational in the Gulf War and Vietnam War. The dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.|$|E
25|$|Soldiers with uniforms {{showing the}} German flag, who {{identified}} themselves as German KSK, special forces, came to interrogate him.

25|$|More deals were made. The Clippers traded Marko Jarić (in a {{sign and}} trade transaction) and Lionel Chalmers to the Minnesota Timberwolves in {{exchange}} for Sam Cassell and a lottery-protected 1st round pick in the 2006 NBA draft. In relation to the lottery-protected pick, {{in order for the}} Clippers to acquire the pick, the Timberwolves <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs, or Minnesota would retain the pick.|$|E
25|$|Cruz {{has stated}} {{that when he was}} a child, his mother told him that she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an affirmative act to claim Canadian {{citizenship}} for him, so his family assumed that he did not hold Canadian citizenship. In August 2013, after the Dallas Morning News pointed out that Cruz had dual Canadian-American citizenship, he applied to formally renounce his Canadian citizenship and ceased being a citizen of Canada on May 14, 2014.|$|E
25|$|The first Vernay-Faunthorpe {{expedition}} {{took place}} in 1922. At the time, many of the animals Vernay was seeking, such as the Sumatran rhinoceros and Asiatic lion, were already rare and facing the possibility of extinction. To acquire these specimens, Vernay <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> many appeals to regional authorities {{in order to obtain}} hunting permits. The relations he would forge during this time would assist later museum related expeditions headed by Vernay in gaining access to areas previously restricted to foreign visitors.|$|E

25|$|Cape Santo André (Saint Andrew Cape), a {{place that}} shows {{evidence}} of Romanization and of probable earlier importance, was known in Classical Latin as Promontorium Avarus and in Ancient Greek as Auaron akron (Αὔαρον ἄκρον), a name of Celtic origin. It is of ancient cult in Póvoa, and was common to see groups of fishermen, holding lights in their hands, making pilgrimage to the Cape's chapel on the last evening of November. They believed Saint Andrew fished, from the depths, {{the souls of the}} drowned. Those who did not visit Santo André in life <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the pilgrimage as a corpse.|$|E
25|$|Staff {{meetings}} to adjust command structure were nearly a daily event in Alexander's army. They created an ongoing expectation among the Hetairoi of receiving {{an important and}} powerful command, {{if only for a}} short term. At the moment of Alexander's death, all possibilities were suddenly suspended. The Hetairoi vanished with Alexander, to be replaced instantaneously by the Diadochi, men who knew where they had stood, but not where they would stand now. As there had been no definite ranks or positions of Hetairoi, there were no ranks of Diadochi. They expected appointments, but without Alexander they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their own.|$|E
25|$|According to the Odyssey, Menelaus's fleet {{was blown}} by storms to Crete and Egypt, {{where they were}} unable to sail away due to calm winds. Only five of his ships survived. Menelaus had to catch Proteus, a shape-shifting sea god, to find out what sacrifices to which gods he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> to {{guarantee}} safe passage. According to some stories the Helen who was taken by Paris was a fake, and the real Helen was in Egypt, where she was reunited with Menelaus. Proteus also told Menelaus that he was destined for Elysium (Heaven) after his death. Menelaus returned to Sparta with Helen eight years after he had left Troy.|$|E

25|$|General Douglas MacArthur had {{repeatedly}} requested Washington D.C. {{to send him}} additional troops with which to initiate an offensive campaign and had been pointedly told he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> do with the troops on hand. MacArthur had decided {{as soon as he}} had reached Australia that the key to its defense lay not on the mainland but in New Guinea. On 13 September 1942 he ordered parts of the 32nd Division to Papua New Guinea even though they had less than two months of training. This would become part of the opening ground offensive against Japanese troops in the Southwest Pacific Area, and MacArthur expected the Americans to quickly and easily advance on and capture the Japanese forward base at Buna.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{planning}} {{did not see}} a {{deployment of}} General Gerow's V Corps until VII Corps had achieved a major breakthrough. V Corps then <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a close drive together with VII Corps towards Bonn. However, after the first days the American senior command realized that VII Corps would need extra assistance to achieve a breakthrough. Therefore, V Corps was ordered to join the fighting. The Corps was situated south of VII Corps. Gerow's first action was to relieve the 28th Division with the 8th Infantry Division, to assist the drive of the already fighting 4th Division. The division was assisted by a CCR from the 5th Armored Division. The corps took over Hürtgen and Kleinhau as objectives from the 4th Division and started its attack on 21 November.|$|E
