5|$|Isis first {{affected}} Baja California Sur on September 2 as {{a tropical}} storm. Shortly after making landfall, a <b>weather</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>station</b> at San José del Cabo recorded sustained winds of 26mph (42km/h), and gusts reaching up to 46mph (74km/h). A {{station on the}} Islas Marías also reported sustained winds of 54mph (87km/h). The winds left widespread areas without power or telephone. The storm produced heavy rainfall in the southern portion of the peninsula, including a 24‑hour total of 12.99inches (330mm) at Los Cabos and a peak rainfall total of 24.02inches (610mm) at Santiago. A married couple was killed after attempting to cross a flooded stream in Los Cabos. Initially, reports indicated a family was missing in La Paz, though they were later proven false. Flooding from the storm closed all roads {{to the north of}} Los Cabos and caused damage to the roads in the area. Mudslides from the rain buried at least 120cars in the area.|$|E

50|$|BW-8 was {{intended}} as a link in a northern air ferry route known to U.S. planners as the Crimson Route, but it transpired that few aircraft were ferried to Europe through it.

During the two years Colonel Balchen was in command, he led numerous expeditions throughout the island, primarily in rescue operations for downed aircrew.|$|E
