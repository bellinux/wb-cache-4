5|$|Although many campaigns were {{fought in}} Asia and the Pacific, the {{major focus of}} the U.S. Army <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the European Theater, where most its {{strength}} was ultimately deployed. U.S. forces saw action in the invasion of North Africa in November 1942, and the subsequent Tunisia Campaign in 1943. The U.S. Army participated in the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943, and then the Allied invasion of Italy in September. Hopes for a quick capture of Rome were frustrated by the Germans, who conducted a fighting withdrawal to the Gustav Line, which the landing at Anzio and the fighting at Monte Cassino in January 1944 failed to break. The Gustav Line was finally broken in May 1944, while Rome was captured on 4 June, and the Germans retreated to the Gothic Line in Northern Italy, where the Allies were held until they broke into the Po Valley in a successful offensive in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|Forster wrote well-polished German prose, {{which was}} not only scientifically {{accurate}} and objective, but also exciting and easy to read. This differed from conventional travel literature of the time, insofar as it presented {{more than a mere}} collection of data – it also demonstrated coherent, colourful and reliable ethnographical facts that resulted from detailed and sympathetic observation. He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations. His main focus <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In A Voyage Round the World he even presented the songs sung by the people of Polynesia, complete with lyrics and notation. The book {{is one of the most}} important sources concerning the societies of the Southern Pacific from the times before European influence had become significant.|$|E

He was dropped in 1992 {{after a number of}} poor performances. However, his consistent heavy scoring in county cricket meant that he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the fringes of selection.|$|E

He further reported that Jalouse <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> site, so that Temple would readily observe any enemy activity. Dawes also brought with him a letter from Temple stating that prisoners from Jason had reported that 15,000 troops in France were to march to Holland to be embarked on transports.|$|E

Remick's music publishing company, in 1916. Fred had already been hunting for new music and dance ideas. Their chance meeting was to deeply affect the careers of both artists. Astaire <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the lookout for new steps on the circuit and was starting to demonstrate his ceaseless quest for novelty and perfection.

Rachel continued to scheme, even trying to evict Alice from the house Steve had given her, causing Alice to have another mental breakdown.

25|$|Faslane {{itself was}} chosen to host these vessels {{at the height of}} the Cold War because of its {{geographic}} position, which forms a bastion on the relatively secluded but deep and easily navigable Gare Loch and Firth of Clyde on the west coast of Scotland. This position provides for rapid and stealthy access through the North Channel to the submarine patrolling areas in the North Atlantic, through the GIUK gap to the Norwegian Sea. At the time it was chosen, the location was also close to the American SSBN base at Holy Loch, which operated 1961–1992. One boat <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> patrol at any given time.|$|E
25|$|Juliette Benzoni {{received}} in 1973 the Alexandre Dumas Prix for her complete work at that time, the Catherine and the Marianne series.

She mentioned in the Magazine Littéraire that the medal <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> her working table. In 1988 Académie française, (founded in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu) had chosen her for the Literature prize Prix Louis Barthou, {{in the form of a}} silver medal for Félicia au soleil couchant. In 1998 at the age of 78 she received the Knight of National Order of Merit – Chevalier de l'Ordre National, awarded by the President of the French Republic.|$|E
25|$|Under her {{editorial}} management {{it proved}} the swiftest journalistic success on record, numbering its subscribers by the hundred thousand, and while other papers took {{a loss for}} granted in the beginning, putting itself upon a paying basis at the outset. While she had assistants in every department, among their names those of some most distinguished in our literature, she was herself the inspiration of the whole corps, and under the advice and suggestion of its proprietors she held it on an even course. There was scarcely a poet, or a story-writer, or novelist of any rank in America or England {{who is not a}} contributor to its pages, and its purity, its self-respect, its high standard, and its literary excellence, were unrivalled among periodical publications. The influence of such a paper within American homes was something hardly to be computed. It <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the side of good and sweet things; it made the right seem the best and pleasantest; it taught while it has amused; it held the happiness, well-being, and virtue of women and the family as its first consideration, and it created a wholesome atmosphere wherever it was constantly read. Through its columns, its editor made her hand felt in countless families for nearly 16 years, and helped to shape the domestic ends of a generation to peace and righteousness.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{declarations}} in {{the offseason}} that he may continue to play past 2016/17, an impending retirement announcement <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the cards for Redhage in the back-end of the 2016–17 season. Such speculation came to fruition on 30 January 2017 when Redhage, nine days after his 36th birthday, announced via a press conference at Bendat Basketball Centre that this season {{would be his last}} in the NBL. Four days later, on 3 February, Redhage made his 372nd appearance for the Wildcats, scoring six points off the bench in the team's 94–63 win over the Brisbane Bullets in Perth. With his 372nd game played as a Wildcat, he moved into second spot on the team's all-time games played list, placing him behind only Ricky Grace (482). On 10 February, in his final regular season game at Perth Arena, Redhage tied his season high with 11 points to help the Wildcats defeat the Sydney Kings 101–74; nine of his points came in the last five minutes of the game. The Wildcats went on to finish the regular season in third place with a 15–13 record, and after sweeping the Cairns Taipans in the semi-finals, they moved on to the NBL Grand Final for the sixth time in eight years. There the Wildcats swept the Illawarra Hawks 3–0 in the best-of-five series to claim their eighth NBL championship, while Redhage collected his fourth title to bow out of the NBL on a high. The Wildcats not only collected their eighth championship, but went back-to-back {{for the first time since}} 1990/1991. In the 95–86 title-clinching Game 3 win on 5 March 2017 at Perth Arena, Redhage started at power forward in his 393rd and final NBL game and finished the contest with three points. Despite his limited role in 2016/17, Redhage competed in every game for the Wildcats, averaging 2.7 points, 1.2 rebounds and 7.8 minutes in 33 games.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, King {{said that}} Flagg {{had been a}} {{presence}} in his writing {{since the beginning of}} his career, with the idea coming to him in college. He first wrote a poem, [...] "The Dark Man", about a man who rides the rails and confesses to murder and rape; written {{on the back of a}} placemat in a college restaurant, the one-page poem was published in 1969, but the character never left King's mind. To the author, what made Flagg interesting was [...] "the idea of the villain as somebody who <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the outside looking in, and hated people who had good fellowship and good conversation and friends".|$|E

'We were at the market square, having fun,' he said. There were some girls {{with him and his}} friends, so I asked, 'Was she worth it?' 'Yes, trainer, she was,' he told me. I told him to get his gear and join the training session. At his wedding, I heard the woman he met that day was now his wife and mother of his children. Bernadien is her name." ...|$|E

[...] The Golden Gophers threw eight passes for zero {{completions}} and two interceptions. [...] Left tackle Stanley Muirhead, playing his final game for Michigan, {{was credited with}} the success of the defense:In his last game against Minnesota, November 24, Muirhead was everywhere. He made three-fourths of the tackles under punts, and <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the ball. A check was made during the game of Muirheads's tackles.

500|$|According to his biographer, Scarry: [...] "No {{president}} of the United States... has suffered as much ridicule as Millard Fillmore". He ascribed much of the abuse to a tendency to denigrate the presidents {{who served in the}} years just prior to the Civil War as lacking in leadership. For example, later president Harry Truman [...] "characterized Fillmore as a weak, trivial thumb-twaddler who would do nothing to offend anyone", responsible in part for the war. Anna Prior, writing in The Wall Street Journal in 2010, stated that Fillmore's very name connotes mediocrity. Another Fillmore biographer, Finkelman, commented, [...] "on the central issues of the age his vision was myopic and his legacy is worse... in the end, Fillmore <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> {{the wrong side of the}} great moral and political issues". Rayback, however, applauded [...] "the warmth and wisdom with which he had defended the Union".|$|E
500|$|Phillips, meanwhile, <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> {{the lookout}} for someone who could bring to a broader {{audience}} {{the sound of the}} black musicians on whom Sun focused.

[...] In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, [...] "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield [...] "Scotty" [...] Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.|$|E
