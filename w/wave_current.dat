40|$|ABSTRACT:　 In this paper, a {{mathematical}} model is developed to simulate the change in mean velocity for the coexistent case of <b>waves</b> and <b>current.</b> The experimental results of mean velocity profile in a <b>wave</b> 2 <b>current</b> flume have shown following features: Eulerian mean current profile for following current is more uniformly distributed than the corresponding pure current case, whereas, {{the case of an}} opposing current leads to the more straight profile. This model is based on Eulerian mean framework, and motions of <b>wave</b> and <b>current</b> are solved simultaneously. The comparisons of numerical results and experimental data show that the mathematical model presented in this paper is reasonable and feasible [...] KEY WORDS:　 interaction of <b>waves</b> and <b>current,</b> mean velocity changes, following current, opposing current 1. 　INTROD UCTION The phenomena of <b>wave</b> 2 <b>current</b> combined flow are very common in estuarine and coastal zone. The combined motion of <b>wave</b> and <b>current</b> controls and affects many physical processes in offshore and coastal engineering, such as sediment t ransport, particularly the suspended sediment t ransport, erosion around offshore st ructures and so on. So the accurate prediction of velocity profiles is very important to estimate suspended sediment t ransport. The interaction processes of <b>waves</b> and <b>current</b> are very complicated. On one hand, <b>waves</b> affect the <b>current</b> velocity profiles, and on the other hand, the presence of current causes the change of many wave parameters, such as wave height, wave length, etc. A lot of theoretical and numerical models have been presented to describe <b>waves</b> 2 <b>current</b> combined flow, but most researchers focused on the boundary layer st ructure and shear st ress, e. g., Wu et al., (1999) ...|$|R

The performances of the three algorithms were examined to compare the polarity of the traveling <b>wave</b> <b>current,</b> the differential traveling wave and the traveling wave energy for the comparison of the busbar protection. Two out of three modes should meet the criteria when 3 modes are used. Simulation results show that all 3 principles for busbar protection can distinguish between internal and external faults within 2  ms and the traveling wave differential protection possesses the highest sensitivity and reliability. The algorithm is also less influenced by any branch traveling <b>wave</b> <b>current</b> due to the transformer, which can result in difficulties when determining the polarity {{and direction of the}} traveling <b>wave</b> <b>current.</b> The reliability, therefore, of the algorithm requires further research.

During the year 2000, a Broadband Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (BADCP) collected continuous <b>wave</b> and <b>current</b> measurements. Bed morphology was continually mapped by a Scanning Acoustic Altimeter (SAA) in a 1 m alongshore by 1. 5 m cross-shore area immediately offshore from the MISO frame. Relict ripples were observed to dominate the bedforms throughout much of the year. Ripple growth in the alongshore direction was observed during conditions of marginally critical flow as defined by the critical combined <b>wave</b> and <b>current</b> Shields parameter. As flow conditions increased above the critical level, ripple growth in the alongshore direction ceased, and cross-shore wavelengths began to grow and dominate. Together, these observations and data sets are used to evaluate the applicability of existing ripple prediction algorithms.

It is generally believed that these arcs are produced by an interaction of Io with the Jovian magnetosphere.

40|$|Seiche {{oscillations}} {{in a free}} entrance bay are investigated {{within the}} framework of the linear theory of long waves in two-dimensional formulation. Analytical solution for a rectangular basin of constant depth for the case when the nodal line of the level is located at the basin entrance is obtained. It is shown that allowance for two-dimensional spatial character is important for transverse seiches: the wave currents depend on two spatial coordinates, and their amplitudes are the functions of the basin width and length. The amplitudes of <b>wave</b> <b>current</b> velocities are the functions of the basin width and length for transversal seiches and are directly proportional to the initial level deviations as well as inversely proportional to square root of the basin depth. It is found that for the longitudinal seiches the <b>wave</b> <b>current</b> velocities are normal to the bay entrance and their maximum values do not depend on its width and length. The longitudinal seiches are characterized by the highest velocities of the wave currents. The features of the seiches in a free entrance basin and in a completely enclosed one are compared, their similarities and differences are determined. The lowest seiche mode in the basin with a free entrance is the Helmholtz mode. It is absent in an enclosed basin and also this mode has no nodal lines within the bay. <b>Wave</b> <b>current</b> for the Helmholtz mode is always directed perpendicularly to the basin entrance and its maximum velocity does not depend on the basin width and length. It is directly proportional to free surface initial deviation and inversely proportional to square root of the basin depth. The lowest current velocities will take place at an open boundary of the basin.

40|$|The dynamic {{feature of}} the Modaomen Estuary (ME) in the Pearl River Delta in {{southern}} China {{has been the subject}} of extensive research. In previous studies, wave–current interaction (WCI) was often neglected due to its complexity. This study uses a coupled hydrodynamic module TELEMAC- 2 D and wave propagation module TOMAWAC in the TELEMAC-Mascaret modeling system to quantify the effects of WCI on the hydrodynamics in the ME. The coupled <b>wave</b> and <b>current</b> modeling system was well validated against the field measurements at selected locations. The model results show that WCI varies with the seasonal change in runoff in the ME. The effect of <b>waves</b> on the <b>currents</b> is insignificant during the wet season with a current change of no more than 0. 07 m/s; but, in contrast, the currents have a noticeable effect on waves. However, during the dry season, the interactions of <b>waves</b> and <b>currents</b> on each other are found to be equally significant. When <b>wave</b> model and <b>current</b> model are coupled, the velocity could increase up to a maximum of 0. 30 m/s and decrease up to a maximum of 0. 17 m/s. WCI is greatly affected by the propagation directions of <b>wave</b> and <b>current</b> in both seasons. Generally, wave height decreases and current increases for a following wave and current; wave height increases and current decreases for an opposing <b>wave</b> and <b>current.</b> The effects of <b>waves</b> on <b>currents</b> change with the tide.
