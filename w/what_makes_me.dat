500|$|Jackson faced {{numerous}} {{disagreements with}} the song's co-producer. It {{has been reported}} that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak {{to be part of the}} collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson's 29-second introduction. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. [...] "I said, 'Michael we've got to cut that intro'" [...] Jones later recalled. [...] "He said: 'But that's the jelly! ... That's <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> want to dance'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That's <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> want to dance', well, the rest of us just have to shut up." [...] Jones also wanted to change the track's title to [...] "Not My Lover", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the finished product sounded close to the demo. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted him neither and the two fell out for several days.|$|E

Kapadia's part—written specially for her—is that of a forty-year-old married woman and a Mumbai University professor, who, {{after the death of}} her mother, loses her sense of happiness and takes a job as a visiting professor of South Asian studies in California. The story follows Leela's acclimation to her new surroundings and particularly her relationship with one of her students there, Kris (Mhatre), a young Indian-American man. Kapadia noted about working in the film, [...] "While in production, I'm all tensed up, and that is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> take my acting to the next level." [...] Maitland McDonagh from TV Guide wrote, [...] "Dimple Kapadia shines in this family melodrama... intelligent, nuanced performance is the film's highlight." [...] Ziya Us Salam from The Hindu called her [...] "a charmer all the way. Exhilarating is the air she breathes, bewitching is the glance she casts and enticingly vulnerable is her condition." ...|$|E

500|$|Feige {{announced}} that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during the Marvel Studios panel, with an intended release date of August 1, 2014. He stated that the film's titular team would consist of the characters Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon. Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team. In August 2012, James Gunn entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including Peyton Reed and the duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden. The Avengers director Joss Whedon, who signed a deal to creatively consult {{on all of the}} films leading up to , was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying [...] "James [...] is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> think it will work... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon... He has a very twisted take on it, but it all comes from a real love for the material. It's {{going to be hard for}} [...] to keep up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Irwin [...] "takes {{the humor}} very seriously... I {{remember}} {{being a little}} kid wondering why we laugh and <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> laugh. I always was a class clown. I was always interested in what makes laughter happen and now I get to dig into the theory of it every day." [...] Irwin thinks {{of himself as a}} fiction writer and refers to himself as a humorist, [...] and states, [...] "I call myself a humorist and storyteller instead of a comedian because I play in libraries and there's no three-drink minimum." [...] Irwin's stories often reflect life in a small Southern town with recurring themes of growing up and growing old, the bonds of family, the complexities of racial relations in the Deep South, especially during the 1960s and the important art of the practical joke.|$|E
2500|$|Owning a {{high and}} {{powerful}} soprano C voice, in the intermittent low notes Thu Minh presented without recognizable speciality. After {{her efforts to}} learn from many international singers and especially inspired by Whitney Houston, she gradually overcame this drawback. She always believed: [...] "fame is not <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> happiest, but artistic differences and uniqueness", thus, she [...] "always tries to cultivate and train herself for her own 'Thu Minh style', vocal technique and performance style". [...] Thu Minh also genuinely said that the [...] "frugal","straight-forwarded, critical and perfectionism" [...] in her music career, inherited from her mother, {{is such a good}} element for her job because it helps bring the audience her best music performances, regardless of how long it costs in execution time. For example, the album Body Language took two years to complete. Thus, in 2007, Thu Minh had shifted to Boston, Massachusetts, in the US to pursue international education on music and graduated in Berklee College of Music.|$|E

On September 24, 2013, Nipsey Hussle and Karen Civil TV released the first trailer for the mixtape, featuring him driving around Crenshaw, Los Angeles, {{and talking about}} his upbringing in the city. On October 3, 2013, he released another second trailer for the mixtape, also revealing 1,000 hard copies of the mixtape would be sold for $100 each. He explained his decision to RapRadar saying, [...] "It’s 2013. Whether we accept it or not, buying music is a choice, not a requisite. When I think of the psychology behind <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> purchase an artists album, it’s always a form of reciprocation. Almost like a token of appreciation after I experience the product. The reason I chose to charge $100 dollars each copy and only start with 1000 units is because I tailor making my music {{for those who are}} listening. it's not about stepping outside of what I’m known for in hopes of new discovery. What that means less is fans that are better served. I'm more or less focused on fully serving the ones that have connected all ready. That being said its a value over volume thing. if I'm goin to offer a product made with no compromise or concession to the platforms (radio, A opinion, label bias) ect...ect..then the way we sale it has to change." ...|$|E
