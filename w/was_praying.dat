25|$|As Rebecca and her entourage {{approached}} Abraham's home, they spied Isaac from {{a distance}} {{in the fields of}} Beer-lahai-roi.

Seeing such a spiritually exalted man, Rebecca immediately dismounted from her camel and asked the accompanying servant who he was. When she heard that this was her future husband, she modestly covered herself with a veil. Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, married her, and loved her.|$|E
25|$|The next {{challenge}} to Assyrian domination {{came from the}} Elamites in 694 BC, with Nergal-ushezib deposing and murdering Ashur-nadin-shumi (700–694 BC), the Assyrian prince who was king of Babylon and son of Sennacherib. The Chaldeans and Babylonians again allied with their more powerful Elamite neighbours in this endeavour. This prompted the enraged Assyrian king Sennacherib to invade and subjugate Elam and Chaldea and to sack Babylon, laying waste to and largely destroying the city. Babylon {{was regarded as a}} sacred city by all Mesopotamians, including the Assyrians, and this act eventually resulted to Sennacherib's being murdered by his own sons while he <b>was</b> <b>praying</b> to the god Nisroch in Nineveh.|$|E
25|$|A legend arose that James {{had been}} warned against invading England by supernatural powers. While he <b>was</b> <b>praying</b> in St Michael's Kirk at Linlithgow, a man strangely dressed in blue had {{approached}} his desk saying his mother {{had told him to}} say James should not to go to war or take the advice of women. Then before the King could reply, the man vanished. David Lindsay of the Mount and John Inglis could find no trace of him. The historian R. L. Mackie wondered if the incident really happened as a masquerade orchestrated by an anti-war party: Norman Macdougall doubts if there was a significant anti-war faction. Three other portents of disaster were described by Paolo Giovio in 1549 and repeated in John Polemon's 1578 account of the battle. When James was in council at the camp at Flodden Edge a hare ran out of his tent and escaped the weapons of his knights; it was found that mice had gnawed away the strings and buckle of the King's helmet; and in the morning his tent was spreckled with a bloody dew.|$|E

The band name {{is said to have}} come to McCartney as he <b>was</b> <b>praying</b> in the hospital while Linda was giving birth to their second child together, Stella, on 13 September 1971. Paul McCartney recalled in the film Wingspan that the birth of Stella was [...] "a bit of a drama"; there were complications at the birth and that both Linda and the baby almost died.

2500|$|The Wallachian truce {{was again}} {{endangered}} {{after less than}} two years. In early 1657, Rákóczi intervened in the Swedish Deluge, which caused him to be absent from the capital and sparked a succession crisis at home.
