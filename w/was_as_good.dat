5|$|Milne was {{naturally}} right-footed, though trained {{hard with}} his left foot as a boy to become equally skilled with both feet. Former Dundee United teammate Paul Hegarty stated that Milne possessed great pace, as well as bravery, a good work ethic, {{and an ability to}} score important goals. Another former Dundee United teammate, Davie Dodds, said that Milne <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> a finisher as any player in Scottish football during the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|After seeing Pablo {{work with}} the first-team squad during {{pre-season}} training, coach César Ferrando {{was quoted as saying}} he would pick Pablo and ten others for the coming campaign. He <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as his word: Pablo made his Segunda División debut in a 1–1 draw away to Terrassa on 31 August 2002, and went on to start 38 of Albacete's 42 matches as they finished the season in third place and were promoted to La Liga. After only a few second-tier matches, he had made sufficient impact to attract interest from clubs both domestic and foreign and receive a call-up to the Spanish under-21 team for a friendly match against Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|Between September 2 and September 17, the Breeders {{performed}} in eleven cities, among which were St. Louis, Denver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. Support groups the Funs and the Neptunas opened {{for them at}} five and six of these shows, respectively. The band then played at the Hollywood Bowl concert, and wrapped up the tour on September 20 at the Goose Island 312 Urban Block Dance Party event in Chicago. In addition to their new songs, they performed numerous selections from Last Splash and Pod (1990). The tour received good reviews from critics; appraisal included comments that the performances were rousing, and that the band <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as—or better than—in its heyday.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000–01 season, Arsenal {{finished}} second in the Premier League for the third consecutive season – this time ten points behind Manchester United. The title race <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as over by February, when Arsenal lost 6–1 to United at Old Trafford. The season gave priority to cups, with the best chance of ending their three-year wait for a trophy being in the FA Cup; Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-finals and met Liverpool in the final. Although they dominated most of the match and went a goal up, they succumbed to two late Michael Owen goals and lost 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Amazing {{raised its}} price from 75 cents to $1.00 with the November 1975 issue. The {{schedule}} switched to quarterly {{beginning with the}} March 1976 issue; as a result, the 50th anniversary issue had a cover date of June 1976. In 1977, Cohen announced that Amazing and Fantastic had lost $15,000, though Amazings circulation (at nearly 26,000) <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> {{as it had been}} for several years. Cohen looked for a new publisher to buy the magazines, but in September of the following year sold his half-share in the company to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. White had occasionally suggested to Cohen that Amazing would benefit from a redesign and investment; he made the same suggestions to Bernhard in early October. According to White, Bernhard not only said no, but told him he would not receive a salary until the next issue was turned in. In late 1978 White resigned, and returned all manuscripts in his possession to their authors, even if copy-edited and ready for publication. White claimed Bernhard had told him to do this, though Bernhard denied it.|$|E

5|$|In 1909 Harold Oliver {{moved to}} Lyrup, South Australia {{and started a}} farm growing fruit. During this time, he captained the Lyrup {{football}} team. In 1909, after never previously winning a game, the Lyrup football club won the local riverland league premiership. They subsequently traveled to Mildura where they lost twice to the home team. The Mildura Cultivator praised Oliver's marking and kicking reporting that it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as anyone who had played at the ground. An umpire at the game from Melbourne told Harold {{that he would be}} welcome in Melbourne to play football if he wanted to. At the end of 1909 Oliver was contemplating moving to Queensland to join his sister in the state but two friends, the Musgrave brothers, who played for West Suburbans in Adelaide suggested he come down and visit.|$|E
5|$|In total, Crawford {{played in}} eight games in 1919, scoring 488 runs and taking 20 wickets. Wisden commented that his batting <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> {{as it had}} ever been, but his bowling lacked spin and accuracy. He played only four more times in {{first-class}} cricket. Part of the explanation was that he joined Dunlop Rubber as a manager at one of its mills in Rochdale. He played as an amateur for Rochdale Cricket Club in 1920, but by 1921 {{he had left the}} club—the Manchester Guardian speculated that he had returned to Surrey. He returned to live with his family in Merton Park, and played for the local cricket club. Of his first-class matches, one was for Surrey against the Australian touring team of 1921 and the others were for teams representing the Gentlemen. In his entire first-class career, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an average of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at 20.66.|$|E
5|$|The French {{fell back}} c. 3km and {{attempted}} to regroup to hold the village of San Giuliano. With the French outnumbered and driven from their best defensive position, the battle <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as won by the Austrians. Melas, who was slightly wounded, and 71, handed over command to his chief-of-staff, General Anton von Zach, and Kaim. The Austrian centre formed into a massive pursuit column in order to chase the French off the battlefield, with the advance guard commanded by GM Franz Xaver Saint-Julien. The column formed up around Spinetta, southeast of Marengo, and advanced down the New Road. However, delays in the flanks led to the Austrian army forming a crescent shape with a thinly stretched central sector. On the Austrian right wing, O'Reilly wasted time hunting down a 300-man French detachment led by Achille Dampierre (which was finally captured) and moved southeast. This took his troops out of supporting distance from the Austrian main body. On the Austrian left, Ott hesitated to press hard against the French because GdB Jean Rivaud's small brigade of French cavalry hovered to the north.|$|E

5|$|The view of some modern {{scholars}} {{that the}} 4th-century cavalry {{was a more}} efficient service than the infantry was certainly not shared by Ammianus and his contemporaries. Ammianus describes three major battles which were actually or nearly lost due to the incompetence or cowardice of the Roman cavalry. (1) The Battle of Strasbourg (357), where the cavalry, including cataphracts, were routed by their German counterparts at an early stage, leaving the Roman infantry right wing dangerously exposed. After fleeing behind the infantry lines, it took the personal intervention of Julian to rally them and persuade them {{to return to the}} fight. (The cataphracts were later ordered to wear female clothes by Julian as punishment). (2) During his Persian campaign (363), Julian was obliged to sanction two cavalry units for fleeing when caught by surprise attacks (one unit was decimated, the other dismounted). Later, the Tertiaci cavalry regiment was ordered to march with the camp followers for deserting the field just as the infantry was on the point of breaking the Persian line. (3) At the Battle of Adrianople (378), the Roman cavalry was largely responsible for the catastrophic defeat. Scholae units started the battle by an unauthorised attack on the enemy wagon circle, at a moment when their emperor Valens was still trying to negotiate a truce with the Goths. The attack failed, and when the Gothic cavalry appeared, the Roman cavalry fled, leaving the Roman infantry left wing exposed. The Gothic cavalry then routed the Roman left wing, and the battle <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as lost.|$|E

The estate, worth $70,000, was {{entrusted}} to Roach for investment until Baker's four children came of age. Since the money {{could not be}} claimed until 1881, it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as a long-term interest-free loan to Roach, who was soon {{to take advantage of}} it to expand his business.|$|E

25|$|However, this <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> {{as it got}} for England, as the Sri Lankan skipper, {{along with}} Michael Vandort {{proceeded}} to build a big partnership for the third wicket. They ended day 2 on 105/2, and carried on well into the afternoon session of day 3, and both picked up centuries in the process. Mahela Jayawardene also passed 7,000 test runs in his innings, the first Sri Lankan to achieve this milestone.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{a record}} benefit against the Australians {{and a few}} {{wonderful}} performances in 1961 (notably 8 for 47 against Hampshire), decline set in for the previously incomparable bowler.

In 1962, though he <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as ever in the Tests against Pakistan, with little support for him and Higgs, Statham fell further and only just reached 100 wickets, with Lancashire only just escaping finishing last.|$|E

25|$|The vehicle's inner {{structure}} {{received as}} much attention as the aerodynamics of its exterior. Fiberglass outer panels were retained, but the Sting Ray emerged with nearly twice as much steel support in its central structure as the 1958—62 Corvette. The resulting extra weight was balanced by a reduction in fiberglass thickness, so the finished product actually weighed a bit less than the old roadster. Passenger room <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as before despite the tighter wheelbase, and the reinforcing steel girder made the cockpit both stronger and safer.|$|E
25|$|The 1972 series <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> {{and tough}} an Ashes series as {{there has been}} (with the {{possible}} exception of 2005). The seasoned pros of England in Boycott, Edrich, D'Oliveira, Illingworth himself, Underwood and Snow faced the upcoming young Australians (Ian and Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee, Rod Marsh, Doug Walters) who would dominate for the middle part of the decade. The series was drawn 2–2 but included tight games at Headingley and particularly the Oval, where the match lasted almost six days with Australia chasing 242 with only 4 wickets in hand.|$|E
25|$|But that <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as it got.

But the fizz had gone out of the West Indies. In 10.2 overs before bad light stopped play, Vaas took two wickets – both lbw – and Muralitharan one, and West Indies ended the day on 17 for 3.|$|E
