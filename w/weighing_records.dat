40|$|The {{quantification}} {{of errors}} inherent in methods of measuring dietary intake has been handicapped {{by the absence}} of independent markers for testing their validity. The doubly labeled water technique permits a precise measure of energy expenditure in free-living persons. Because energy expenditure must equal energy intake in populations in energy balance, this technique may be used to validate the assessment of energy intake. A series of studies demonstrated good agreement between mean energy intake and mean energy expenditure when food intake was recorded by observers or when it was self-reported by normal-weight, self-selected, highly motivated volunteer subjects using <b>weighed</b> <b>records.</b> However, in randomly recruited men and women, energy intake by <b>weighed</b> <b>records</b> was 82 % and 81 %, of energy expenditure, respectively, indicating underestimation of habitual intake.

40|$|Weights of beef cows {{recorded}} {{on a monthly}} basis were analysed using a random regression model. Data originated from a selection experiment in Western Australia, involving two herds of about 300 cows, Polled Herefords and a four breed synthetic, the so-called Wokalups. Weights were subject to large seasonal effects. Short mating periods and thus tight calving seasons led to substantial confounding between age and season at <b>weighing.</b> <b>Records</b> between 19 and 84 months were considered, up to 62 per cow, yielding 27 728 and 29 033 records for 922 and 1020 cows, respectively. Only phenotypic random regressions for animal effects, ignoring relationships, were considered. Covariances between regression coefficients and error variances were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood. A variety of models, involving random regressions on orthogonal polynomials of age, on segmented polynomials and on sine and cosine functions and different assumptions about the structure of error variances, were considered. Analyses identified a distinct cyclic, seasonal pattern of variation, both between animals and for temporary environmental effects. This could only partially be attributed to scale effects. Orthogonal polynomials proved well capable of modelling such sinuousity but required a high order of fit and thus a large number of parameters. Alternative curves utilising the known periodicity (12 months) provided more parsimonious parameterisations. Due to the high degree of confounding between age and season of recording their contributions to the total variance could not be separated. 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} a {{range of}} dietary assessment instruments in general practice. METHODS: Using a randomised block design, brief assessment instruments and more complex conventional dietary assessment tools were compared with an accepted "relative" standard [...] a seven day <b>weighed</b> dietary <b>record.</b> The standard was checked using biomarkers, and by performing test-retest reliability in additional subjects (n = 29). OUTCOMES: Agreement with <b>weighed</b> <b>record.</b> Percentage agreement with <b>weighed</b> <b>record,</b> rank correlation from scatter plot, rank correlation from Bland-Altman plot. Reliability of the <b>weighed</b> <b>record.</b> SETTING: Practice nurse treatment room in a single suburban general practice. SUBJECTS: Patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (n = 61) or age/sex stratified general population group (n = 50). RESULTS: Brief self completion dietary assessment tools based on food groups caten during a week show reasonable agreement with the relative standard. For % energy from fat and saturated fat, non-starch polysaccharide, grams of fruit and vegetables and starchy foods consumed the range of agreement with the standard was: median % difference - 6 % to 12 %, rank correlation 0. 5 to 0. 6. This agreement is of a similar order to {{the reliability of the}} <b>weighed</b> <b>record,</b> as good as or better than test standard agreement for more time consuming instruments, and compares favourably with research instruments validated in other settings. Under-reporting of energy intake was common (40 %) and more likely if subjects were obese (body mass idex (BMI) > or = 30 60 % under-reported; BMI < 30 29 %, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Agro-Pecuária - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaIn this study, {{growth and}} {{reproductive}} records from two Portuguese breeds of sheep - Merino Branco (MB) and Merino Preto (MP) {{were analyzed by}} linear model methodologies to assess the importance of systematic environmental factors on these traits. Data were gathered from flocks registered in the Herd Books owned by the Portuguese Merino Breeders Association from 1995 to 2008. Growth traits evaluated were adjusted weights at 30 (PA 30), 60 (PA 60) and 90 (PA 90) days of age and average daily weight gains from birth to 30 (GMD 30), 60 (GMD 60) and 90 (GMD 90) days of age. A total of 36029 <b>weighing</b> <b>records</b> were used for MB and 16098 records for MP. To evaluate prolificacy, 29008 and 12827 records were analyzed for MB and MP, respectively. Separated {{statistical analyses were performed}} for each breed. Growth data were analyzed as a trait of the lamb and models included the fixed effects of sex, type of birth, age of dam, season of birth and the interactions sex * type of birth, year of birth * breeder, age of dam * type of birth and type of birth * season of birth and ewe and residual as random effects. Prolificacy was evaluated as a repeated trait of the ewe and the model contained the fixed effects of season of birth of the ewe, lambing season, age of ewe at lambing and the interactions year of lambing * breeder and age of ewe at lambing * lambing season and the residual as random effect. Adjusted weights for MB single born lambs were 11, 12 ± 0, 03 Kg for PA 30, 17, 74 ± 0, 06 Kg for PA 60 and 24, 20 ± 0, 09 Kg PA 90. Corresponding weights for MP were 11, 17 ± 0, 04 Kg for PA 30, 17, 40 ± 0, 08 Kg for PA 60 and 23, 42 ± 0, 13 Kg PA 90, respectively. MB twin lambs weighted 1, 85 Kg, 2, 71 Kg and 3, 16 Kg less than singles (p < 0, 001), for PA 30, PA 60 and PA 90, respectively. On average, single born MP lambs were 14 % heavier than twins and, as observed for MP lambs, differences increased with age. Males were significantly heavier than females (p < 0, 001). Observed differences were 0, 4 Kg for PA 30, 0, 7 Kg for PA 60 and 1, 0 Kg for PA 90 in the MB breed and 0, 5 Kg for PA 30, 0, 9 Kg for PA 60 and 1, 3 Kg for PA 90 for MP. For both breeds, ewes of intermediate ages (4 and 5 years old) had in general heavier lambs than younger or older ewes (p < 0, 001). Lambs born in the Fall were lighter as compared to those born in Winter (p < 0, 001) (11 % for MB and 13 % for MP). Average daily gains for MB singles were 220 ± 0, 001 gr/day for GMD 30, GMD 60 and GMD 90, respectively. Corresponding values for MP were 230 ± 0, 001 gr/day, 220 ± 0, 001 gr/day and 210 ± 0, 001 gr/day. In both breeds, differences between singles and twins (p < 0, 001) ranged from 20 to 30 gr/day for all growth intervals. Males grew faster than the females (p < 0, 001), with differences of 8 gr/day for GMD 30 and 10 gr/day for GMD 60 and GMD 90 in the MB. For MP larger differences were observed between sexes (10 gr/day for GMD 30 and GMD 60 and 20 gr/day for GMD 90). As for fixed age weights, a quadratic effect of age of dam was also observed for all weight gains in the two breeds. Consistently higher weight gains were obtained in lambs born in Winter than in the Fall (range 20 to 50 gr/day). Prolificacy was low for both breeds (average 1, 10 lambs/ewe lambing). For MB, most of the variation was due to the interactions year of lambing * breeder and age (P< 0, 001) of ewe at lambing * lambing season (P< 0, 001) reflecting probably large management differences. In the MP breed,besides these effects, age of ewe at lambing was significant (p< 0, 001). Four year old and older ewes showed higher prolificacies (range 1, 14 to 1, 16) than younger ewes (range 1, 06 to 1, 10). The results of this study show that the same environmental factors affect growth performance in both breeds. Growth rate is slower than typical meat sheep breeds, but having in perspective that animals are raised in extensive grazing conditions, the growth potential shown by both breeds is reasonable. In terms of reproduction, prolificacy is rather low, showing however an increase with increasing age. The combined results of growth and reproductive performance reveal that these genotypes show great longevity and adaptability to local production systems.

40|$|Background/Objectives:The Child And Diet Evaluation Tool (CADET) is a 24 -h food diary that {{measures}} the nutrition intake of children aged 3 - 7 years, {{with a focus}} on fruit and vegetable consumption. Until now CADET has not been used to measure nutrient intake of children aged 8 - 11 years. To ensure that newly assigned portion sizes for this older age group were valid, participants were asked to complete the CADET diary (the school and home food diary) concurrently with a 1 -day <b>weighed</b> <b>record.</b> Subjects/Methods:A total of 67 children {{with a mean age of}} 9. 3 years (s. d. : ± 1. 4, 51 % girls) participated in the study. Total fruit and vegetable intake in grams and other nutrients were extracted to compare the mean intakes from the CADET diary and <b>Weighed</b> <b>record</b> using t-tests and Pearson's r correlations. Bland-Altman analysis was also conducted to assess the agreement between the two methods. Results:Correlations comparing the CADET diary to the <b>weighed</b> <b>record</b> were high for fruit, vegetables and combined fruit and vegetables (r= 0. 7). The results from the Bland-Altman plots revealed a mean difference of 54 [*]g (95 % confidence interval: - 88, 152) for combined fruit and vegetables intake. CADET is the only tool recommended by the National Obesity Observatory that has been validated in a UK population and provides nutrient level data on children's diets.

40|$|Published online 04 August 2009. Zinc is an {{essential}} nutrient required for numerous metabolic functions. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop a zinc-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and to determine its relative validity. A 74 -item FFQ was designed for the measurement of zinc intake. Food items were included in the FFQ if their zinc content was > 0. 5 mg/ 100 g, and the food item contributed > 5 % of the recommended dietary intake. Female subjects (n[*]=[*] 22) were recruited to complete the questionnaire in addition to maintaining a <b>weighed</b> food <b>record</b> for 7 days. Mean intake of zinc obtained from the <b>weighed</b> <b>records</b> (8. 8 [*]±[*] 2. 3 mg/day; mean ± SD) was significantly lower than that obtained from the FFQ (10. 5 [*]±[*] 3. 1 mg/day; P[*]<[*] 0. 01).

40|$|Objectives: To {{develop an}} interview-administered food-frequency {{questionnaire}} (FFQ) to assess usual long-term intake of foods and nutrients amongst {{women from the}} largest South Asian communities residing in Britain. Methods: A list of foods and dishes consumed by these South Asian communities was compiled from data collected in previous studies. Foods which contributed to interindividual variation in the intake of the various macronutrients or were rich in fat or fibre {{were included in the}} FFQ. Portion size for traditional foods were estimated using sets of eight colour photographs. A nutrient database was modified to make it appropriate for South Asian diets. The reliability of the FFQ was assessed in a group of volunteer South Asian women (n= 14) of differing regional and religious backgrounds. A preliminary validation exercise was conducted in a group of Punjabi Muslim women (n= 11) who had kept 7 -day <b>weighed</b> <b>records</b> 2 years previously. ] Results: The reliability of this FFQ was high, with most women being classified in the same tertile for energy and macronutrient intake in the two interviews. The main sources of energy and macronutrients identified by the FFQ were similar to those identified by the <b>weighed</b> <b>records</b> but the average nutrient intakes estimated by the FFQ were slightly higher. The level of agreement between the two dietary methods, measured by the ability of the FFQ to classify women in the same tertile of intake as the <b>weighed</b> <b>records,</b> was high for percentage energy intake from fat, protein and carbohydrates, but less so for absolute nutrient intakes. These results were, however, limited because of the small sample size. Conclusions: This is the first FFQ specifically designed for South Asian communities in Britain. Despite the diversity of diets, these preliminary findings suggest it will be a useful and easy to administer tool in chronic disease epidemiology to obtain standardized information on long-term usual dietary intake from these communities.

Photographic dietary records (PhDR) using mobile phones or cameras are valid and convenient for patients. Innovations in providing dietary interventions via telephone and computer can also inform dietetic practice. Three studies are presented. A mobile phone method was validated by comparing energy intake (EI) to a <b>weighed</b> food <b>record</b> and a measure of energy expenditure (EE) obtained using the doubly labelled water technique in 10 adults with T 2 diabetes. The level of agreement between mean (±sd) energy intake mobile phone (8. 2 ± 1. 7 MJ) and <b>weighed</b> <b>record</b> (8. 5 ± 1. 6 MJ) was high (p= 0. 392), however EI/EE for both methods gave similar levels of under-reporting (0. 69 and 0. 72). All subjects preferred using the mobile phone vs. <b>weighed</b> <b>record.</b> Nineteen individuals with Parkinsons disease kept 3 -day PhDRs on three occasions using point-and-shoot digital cameras over a 12 week period. The camera was rated as easy to use by 89 %, keeping a PhDR was considered acceptable by 94 % and none would rather use a “pen and paper” method. Eighty-three percent felt confident to use the camera again to record intake. An interactive, automated telephone system designed to coach people with T 2 diabetes to adopt and maintain diabetes self-care behaviours, including nutrition, showed trends for improvements in total fat, saturated fat and vegetable intake of the intervention group compared to control participants over 6 months.

Design: Nineteen centres in 12 countries participated at baseline. Nine of these SENECA centres conducted a repeat measurement scheme in elderly people born between 1913 and 1918. These longitudinal centres included 100 subjects per sex per site. Methods: The relative validity of the method was tested by comparing results of the modified diet history with results obtained from a <b>weighed</b> <b>record</b> in 82 subjects. In the follow-up we compared changes in energy intake with changes in body weight and calculated the physical activity ratio in all longitudinal centres. In SENECA's finale we examined the predictive value of dietary patterns observed at baseline for survival 10 years later, making use of the original and an adapted Mediterranean Diet Score. Results: The modified diet history overestimated intake, compared with the <b>weighed</b> <b>record.</b> However, the physical activity ratio and an in-depth study in a metabolic room indicated that the diet history rather underestimated energy intake. We did not find a relationship between changes in energy intake and changes in body weight, but this could be {{explained by the fact that}} most likely we did not measure intake in the dynamic phase of body weight change. Based on the adapted Mediterranean Diet Score, the study results showed a positive relation between a healthy diet and survival. Conclusion: We conclude that the modified diet history has given sufficiently reliable results for the purposes of the study...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} new {{applications}} of technologies, including digital images, to capture dietary behaviour {{in real time}} have been explored. Objectives: To validate a digital method for estimating evening meal intake in a free-living adult population, and to examine the feasibility of the method for recording evening meal intake over a prolonged period of time. Design: The digital method was compared against <b>weighed</b> <b>records</b> of 19 participants&#x 2019; usual evening meals for five consecutive days. Two trained image analysts independently estimated the weight of individual foods within the meals into major food categories, and the nutrient content was calculated. A second study included interviews with 28 participants recording their evening meals on weekdays for three consecutive weeks to get their perspective on the feasibility of the method. Results: High correlation coefficients between the digital method and <b>weighed</b> <b>records</b> were found for all measured food categories and nutrients. Comparable means and acceptable limits of agreement (mean difference +/&#x 2212; 2 SD) were found with regard to macronutrient distribution (e. g. fat content &#x 2212; 5 to 6 E%), energy density (&#x 2212; 75 to 91 kJ/ 100 g), and energy-adjusted foods (e. g. fruit and vegetable content &#x 2212; 241 to 236 g/ 10 MJ). The {{majority of the participants}} expressed satisfaction with the method and were willing to record their evening meals for 1 month or more using the digital method. Conclusion: The digital method is valid and feasible for evening meal estimation in real-time where a prolonged recording period of participants&#x 2019; meals is needed...|$|R
30|$|Participants {{were advised}} {{to keep a}} <b>weighed</b> <b>record</b> of all food items and {{beverages}} consumed, {{both in and out}} of the home, over a period of seven consecutive days. Investigators provided verbal instructions and demonstration on site and daily telephone instructions were also provided for any specific queries. All particiapnts received a calibrated kitchen scale (Tanita KD- 407) and a ‘Home Record’ diary to weigh home-cooked foods, and a smaller pocket-sized ‘Eating and Drinking Away From Home’ diary (the ‘Eating Out’ diary) for recording food intake when foods could not be weighed, generally foods eaten away from home. Unweighed food items were quantified by estimating size based on participant’s description however items were very limited such as biscuits and other bakery items.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The student {{population}} {{are particularly vulnerable}} to poor dietary habits. Given the increasing prevalence of diet related chronic disease, accurate dietary assessment is necessary to inform health interventions and policies specific to this population. However, inaccurate portion size estimation is a major error in dietary assessment. Utilising technology such as digital photography in free-living populations can help improve the accuracy of dietary assessment. Aims and objectives: To assess the validity of digital photography in estimating portion size, energy intake and protein intake in a free-living Scottish {{student population}} using a self-recorded <b>weighed</b> food <b>record</b> as the reference method. Materials and Methods: A convenience sample of student volunteers were required to capture digital photographs of their three main meals using a camera-enabled mobile phone over a 24 -hour period under free-living conditions, while simultaneously keeping a <b>weighed</b> food <b>record.</b> The photographs were analysed by the researcher to ascertain portion size using a food atlas. Energy and protein intake from each meal was calculated using the dietary analysis software program, NetWisp. Comparisons were made between the portion size, energy intake and protein intake calculated using the digital photography method with those obtained from the <b>weighed</b> food <b>record.</b> Results: Sixteen student volunteers {{participated in the study}} (88...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To compare high- and low-glycemic index (Gl) diets in the {{treatment}} of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Research Design and Methods: Sixteen subjects with well-controlled NIDDM and normal lipid profile, 10 of whom continued oral hypoglycemic medication, participated in the study. A diet that emphasized low-GI foods (e. g., porridge, pasta) was compared with a high-GI diet (e. g., processed cereals, potatoes). The Gl of the low-GI diet was 15 % lower than the high-GI diet (77 ± 3 vs. 91 ± 1) but otherwise similar in macronutrient composition and fiber, as determined by a 4 -day <b>weighed</b> <b>record.</b> The diets were instituted under instruction from a dietitian who visited subjects at home on a weekly basis.

40|$|Abstract Background We have {{developed}} a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) {{for the assessment of}} habitual diet, with special focus on the intake of fruit, vegetables and other antioxidant-rich foods and beverages. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the relative validity of the intakes of energy, food and nutrients from the FFQ. Methods Energy intake was evaluated against independent measures of energy expenditure using the ActiReg ® system (motion detection), whereas 7 -days <b>weighed</b> food <b>records</b> were used to study the relative validity of food and nutrient intake. The relationship between methods was investigated using correlation analyses and cross-classification of participants. The visual agreement between the methods was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots. Results We observed that the FFQ underestimated the energy intake by approximately 11 % compared to the energy expenditure measured by the ActiReg ®. The correlation coefficient between energy intake and energy expenditure was 0. 54 and 32 % of the participants were defined as under-reporters. Compared to the <b>weighed</b> food <b>records</b> the percentages of energy from fat and added sugar from the FFQ were underestimated, whereas the percentage of energy from total carbohydrates and protein were slightly overestimated. The intake of foods rich in antioxidants did not vary significantly between the FFQ and <b>weighed</b> food <b>records,</b> with the exceptions of berries, coffee, tea and vegetables which were overestimated. Spearman's Rank Order Correlations between FFQ and <b>weighed</b> food <b>records</b> were 0. 41 for berries, 0. 58 for chocolate, 0. 78 for coffee, 0. 61 for fruit, 0. 57 for fruit and berry juices, 0. 40 for nuts, 0. 74 for tea, 0. 38 for vegetables and 0. 70 for the intake of wine. Conclusions Our new FFQ provides a good estimate of the average energy intake and it obtains valid data on average intake of most antioxidant-rich foods and beverages. Our study also showed that the FFQs ability to rank participants according to intake of total antioxidants and most of the antioxidant-rich foods was good. </p...|$|R

40|$|Dietary {{assessment}} {{is an important}} component of longitudinal studies, allowing examination of the role of nutritional factors on health and societal outcomes. Dietary intake can be assessed by a number of methods, varying in respondent and interviewer burden, cost, and detail of type and quantity, as well as frequency of foods consumed. Many longitudinal studies utilise Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs) because of ease of administration and low cost, but these lack food detail, rely on good memory and have been questioned in terms of their capability to show diet-disease relationships. Estimated diet diaries are growing in popularity because of lower respondent burden than <b>weighed</b> <b>records</b> yet providing equally valid information, with more detail than FFQs. Costs of coding and translation to nutrients can be built into study budgets; estimated diaries should be considered for longitudinal studies to enable the role of diet in health and lifestyle to be accurately investigated...|$|R
40|$|In {{a cohort}} (n 81) of healthy {{children}} aged 1. 5 - 4. 5 years, measurements of energy intake and energy expenditure were compared. Energy intake was calculated following a 4 d <b>weighed</b> <b>record</b> {{completed by the}} mother or guardian of the child. Total energy expenditure was measured using the doubly-labelled water technique. Mean energy intake and expenditure in the cohort were 4773 kJ/d and 4928 kJ/d respectively. The mean relative bias between the techniques was 154 kJ/d. In the older children (3. 5 - 4. 5 years, the mean relative bias was only 37 kJ/d.

40|$|A {{computer-based}} dietary {{assessment tool}}, the meal-based intake assessment tool (MBIAT), is described. In the current study, dietary intakes of Fe and Zn fractions (total Fe, non-haem Fe, haem Fe, meat Fe, total Zn) and dietary components that influence Fe and Zn absorption (vitamin C, phytate, Ca, grams of meat/fish/poultry, black tea equivalents, phytate:Zn molar ratio) were assessed. The relative {{validity of the}} MBIAT was determined in forty-eight UK men aged 40 years and over by comparing its results with those from <b>weighed</b> diet <b>records</b> collected over 12 d. There was good agreement between the MBIAT and the <b>weighed</b> diet <b>records</b> for median intakes of total, non-haem, haem and meat Fe, Zn, vitamin C, phytate, grams of meat/fish/poultry and phytate:Zn molar ratio. Correlations between the two methods ranged from 0. 32 (for Ca) to 0. 80 (for haem Fe), with 0. 76 for total Fe and 0. 75 for Zn. The percentage of participants classified by the MBIAT into the same/opposite <b>weighed</b> diet <b>record</b> quartiles ranged from 56 / 0 for Fe and 60 / 0 for Zn to 33 / 10 for Ca. The questionnaire also showed an acceptable level of agreement between repeat administrations (e. g. a correlation for total Fe of 0. 74). In conclusion, the MBIAT is appropriate for assessing group dietary intakes of total Fe and Zn and their absorption modifiers in UK men aged 40 years and over...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{provide an}} {{independent}} evaluation of seven day <b>weighed</b> dietary <b>records,</b> which are currently accepted {{as the most}} accurate technique for assessing habitual dietary intake in studies investigating the links between diet and health. DESIGN [...] Subjects who had previously participated in the Northern Ireland diet and health study were reselected by stratified random sampling to represent the range of energy intakes in the study as assessed by the seven day <b>weighed</b> dietary <b>record.</b> SETTING [...] Northern Ireland. SUBJECTS [...] 31 Free living adults (16 men and 15 women). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Energy intake {{as measured by the}} seven day <b>weighed</b> dietary <b>record</b> and total energy expenditure estimated concurrently by the doubly labelled water technique. RESULTS [...] Average recorded energy intakes were significantly lower than measured expenditure in the group overall (9. 66 MJ/day v 12. 15 MJ/day, 95 % confidence interval 1. 45 to 3. 53 MJ/day). Among those in the upper third of energy intakes the mean (SE) ratio of intake to expenditure was close to 1. 0, indicating accurate records (men 1. 01 (0. 11), women 0. 96 (0. 08]. In the middle and lower thirds the ratios for men were only 0. 74 (0. 05) and 0. 70 (0. 07) respectively and for women 0. 89 (0. 07) and 0. 61 (0. 07).
