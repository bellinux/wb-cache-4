50|$|In January, it was {{suspected}} that some units were shipping with 24 <b>watt-hour</b> <b>capacity</b> batteries, labeled as 32 watt-hour. The low-capacity batteries {{appear to be}} those manufactured in Tokyo. It was later determined that the software {{used to examine the}} batteries was incorrectly reporting the capacity and has since been reported to be fixed with an upgrade of the BIOS.|$|E
40|$|A {{literature}} review and evaluation {{has been conducted}} on cradle-to-gate life-cycle inventory studies of lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride, sodium-sulfur, and lithium-ion battery technologies. Data were sought that represent the production of battery constituent materials and battery manufacture and assembly. Life-cycle production data for many battery materials are available and usable, though some need updating. For the remaining battery materials, lifecycle data either are nonexistent or, in some cases, in need of updating. Although battery manufacturing processes have occasionally been well described, detailed quantitative information on energy and material flows is missing. For all but the lithium-ion batteries, enough constituent material production energy data are available to approximate material production energies for the batteries, though improved input data for some materials are needed. Due to the potential benefit of battery recycling and a scarcity of associated data, there is a critical need for life-cycle data on battery material recycling. Either on a per kilogram or per <b>watt-hour</b> <b>capacity</b> basis, lead-acid batteries have the lowest production energy, carbon dioxide emissions, and criteria pollutant emissions. Some process-related emissions are also reviewed in this report...|$|E
