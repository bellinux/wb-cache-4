2500|$|Regardless of <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> amateur players {{has grown}} or shrunk, {{the number of}} chamber music concerts in the west has {{increased}} greatly in the last 20 years. Concert halls have largely replaced the home as the venue for concerts.

[...] The repertoire at these concerts is almost universally the classics of the 19th century. However, modern works are increasingly included in programs, and some groups, like the Kronos Quartet, devote themselves almost exclusively to contemporary music and new compositions; and ensembles like the Turtle Island String Quartet, that combine classical, jazz, rock and other styles to create crossover music. Cello Fury and Project Trio offer a new spin to the standard chamber ensemble. Cello Fury consists of three cellists and a drummer and Project Trio includes a flutist, bassist, and cellist.|$|E

It is shown how two parameters determine <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> intersecting spirals change from point to point, and, if so, through what values. These parameters are the divergence δ, which is assumed to be constant, and a quantity ξ, which is the reciprocal of the normalized rise, and which in general varies from point to point. Finally, it is proved that Fibonacci phyllotaxis (in which <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> intersecting spirals are always Fibonacci numbers) produces greater packing efficiency than any other, provided that the lattice varies over the surface...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new version of}} dynamic time warping for samples of observed event times that are modeled as time-warped intensity processes.

As in our setting <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> observed events differs from subject to subject, usual landmark align- ment methods that require <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> events to be the same across subjects are not feasible. We address this challenge by applying dynamic time warping, initially by aligning the event times for pairs of subjects, regardless <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> observed events within the considered pair of subjects match. The information about pairwise alignments is then combined to extract an overall alignment of the events for each subject across the entire sample.

The method is illustrated with a historical fertility study and with on-line auction data...|$|R
