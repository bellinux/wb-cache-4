5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not <b>wish</b> <b>my</b> poems to become boring.|$|E

He handled most of the production on Guerillas in tha Mist.|$|E

500|$|Although he did {{not often}} write or speak about it, Tolkien {{advocated}} {{the dismantling of the}} British Empire and even of the United Kingdom. In a 1936 letter to a former student, Belgian linguist Simonne d'Ardenne, he wrote, [...] "The political situation is dreadful... I have the greatest sympathy with Belgium—which is about the right size of any country! I <b>wish</b> <b>my</b> own were bounded still by the seas of the Tweed and the walls of Wales... we folk do at least know something of mortality and eternity and when Hitler (or a Frenchman) says 'Germany (or France) must live forever' we know that he lies." ...|$|E
500|$|Released {{during the}} {{dominant}} Gangsta rap era of West Coast hip hop, Bizarre Ride {{was described as}} [...] "refreshing" [...] due to its playful, light-hearted humor and lush, jazzy production. Along with albums such as To Whom It May Concern... by Freestyle Fellowship, and I <b>Wish</b> <b>My</b> Brother George Was Here by Del tha Funkee Homosapien, Bizarre Ride helped establish a new alternative scene on the West Coast, followed by artists such as Hieroglyphics, The Coup and Jurassic 5. Despite its wide critical acclaim, the album produced only moderate sales, peaking at No. 75 on the Billboard 200 album chart in 1993. However, {{on the strength of}} the second single, [...] "Passin' Me By", the album was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 28, 1996.|$|E
500|$|Along with Beastie Boys, 3rd Bass, and House of Pain, Ice {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} white rappers to attain major success. Chuck D has credited Ice as a regional breakthrough, stating [...] "He broke through in the mid-South, in a Southern area in Texas, in something that was kind of indigenous to that hip-hop culture down there. He just doesn’t get credit for it." [...] In 1991, 3rd Bass released a single called [...] "Pop Goes the Weasel", and in the lyrics comparing Ice unfavorably to Elvis Presley. The song's music video featured Henry Rollins as Ice, who is depicted as being assaulted by 3rd Bass. Ice responded to [...] "Pop Goes the Weasel" [...] with his 1992 song [...] "The Wrath". Del tha Funkee Homosapien referred to Ice in the lyrics of [...] "Pissin' on Your Steps", which appeared on his 1991 debut album I <b>Wish</b> <b>My</b> Brother George Was Here. Similar to 'Pop Goes the Weasel', the song negatively makes a connection between Ice and Elvis, while saying Ice alongside MC Hammer are mocking hip hop by being commercial. Vanilla Ice answered back to most of his critics in the song [...] "Hit 'em Hard".|$|E

500|$|The {{speech was}} applauded by Congolese delegates in the {{audience}} at the Palais de la Nation and broadcast by radio across the country. It was also broadcast live in Belgium by the state broadcaster, RTBF. After its delivery, the ceremonies were halted. Baudouin marched out of the room. A short inspection of local sites was arranged with Kasa-Vubu and lunch was served to cover the delay and an official lunch was held by the Congo River. After the break, Lumumba was persuaded by the outgoing Belgian resident, Walter Ganshof van der Meersch, to give a second speech which attempted to strike a more conciliatory tone between the two countries. In his second speech, Lumumba praised Baudouin and stated that [...] "I would not <b>wish</b> <b>my</b> feelings to be wrongly interpreted". After Lumumba's second speech, the official act of independence was signed by Lumumba and the Belgian Prime Minister Gaston Eyskens, {{as well as by}} the Foreign Ministers of both countries, bringing the official ceremonies to an end. The delegates then visited a performance of Congolese folklore at the Roi Baudouin Stadium before heading to an evening reception. At this event, Lumumba gave a further conciliatory speech the same evening, written for him by Eyskens, and drank a toast to Baudouin. The King, and much of the Belgian delegation, returned to Brussels on 1 July.|$|E
500|$|During the 1988 presidential election, Kennedy {{supported}} the eventual Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, {{from the start}} of the campaign. In the fall, Dukakis lost to George H. W. Bush, but Kennedy won re-election to the Senate over Republican Joseph D. Malone in the easiest race of his career. Kennedy remained a powerful force in the Senate. [...] In 1988 Kennedy co-sponsored an amendment to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibits discrimination in the rental, sale, marketing, and financing of the nation's housing; the amendment strengthened the ability of the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to enforce the Act and expanded the protected classes to include disabled persons and families with children. After prolonged negotiations during 1989 with Bush chief of staff John H. Sununu and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to secure Bush's approval, he directed passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Kennedy had personal interest in the bill due to his sister Rosemary's condition and his son's lost leg, and he considered its enactment one of the most important successes of his career. In the late 1980s Kennedy and Hatch staged a prolonged battle against Senator Jesse Helms to provide funding to combat the AIDS epidemic and provide treatment for low-income people affected; this would culminate in passage of the Ryan White Care Act. In late November 1989, Kennedy traveled to see first-hand the newly fallen Berlin Wall; he spoke at John-F.-Kennedy-Platz, site of the famous [...] "Ich bin ein Berliner" [...] speech in 1963, and said [...] "Emotionally, I just <b>wish</b> <b>my</b> brother could have seen it." ...|$|E

2500|$|We could {{occasionally}} imitate Jay's {{singing and}} insert our own words: 'It gets real hot working {{down at my}} mom's bookstore.' It {{was a little too}} much to hear these songs about coal miners coming from regular dudes that worked in record stores and bought SST Records and went to Black Flag shows. Three songs, the gospel tune [...] "Warfare", the hymn [...] "Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down" [...] and the ballad [...] "I <b>Wish</b> <b>My</b> Baby Was Born" [...] were taken from High Atmosphere, a compilation of songs recorded by John Cohen in Virginia and North Carolina. Along with Ogan's version of [...] "Coalminers", the murder ballad [...] "Lilli Schull" [...] had previously been released on Oh My Little Darling, a compilation of Southeastern folk song types released on New World Records.|$|E
2500|$|Banda {{personally}} founded Kamuzu Academy, {{a school}} modeled on Eton, at which Malawian children were taught Latin and Greek by expatriate classics teachers, and disciplined {{if they were}} caught speaking Chichewa. Many of the school's alumni have assumed leadership roles in medicine, academia and business in Malawi and abroad. The school remains one of Dr. Banda's most lasting legacies and he said of it [...] "I did not <b>wish</b> <b>my</b> sons and daughters to have to travel abroad to obtain an education as I did." [...] It is claimed, probably incorrectly and unfairly, that Dr. Banda spent almost all the country's education budget on this project, while increasingly ignoring the needs and welfare of the greater majority [...] of Malawians toiling in the rural areas. The National Rural Development Program and Rural Growth Centers were tentative and belated policies aimed at diverting rural populations from moving to the few urban areas which Dr. Banda's ISI macroeconomic policies had created and were now being battered {{by the arrival of}} more and more rural people seeking better opportunities.|$|E
2500|$|Settlers from Britain and Ireland {{arrived in}} Appalachia during the 18th century, and {{brought with them}} the musical traditions of their homelands. These traditions {{consisted}} primarily of English and Scottish ballads—which were essentially unaccompanied narrative—and dance music, such as Irish reels, which were accompanied by a fiddle. [...] Many older bluegrass songs come directly from the British Isles. Several Appalachian bluegrass ballads, such as [...] "Pretty Saro", [...] "Cuckoo Bird" [...] and [...] "House Carpenter", come from England and preserve the English ballad tradition both melodically and lyrically. [...] Others, such as The Two Sisters, also come from England; however, the lyrics are about Ireland. [...] Some bluegrass fiddle songs popular in Appalachia, such as [...] "Leather Britches", and [...] "Pretty Polly", have Scottish roots. [...] The dance tune Cumberland Gap may be derived from the tune that accompanies the Scottish ballad Bonnie George Campbell. Other songs have different names in different places; for instance in England {{there is an old}} ballad known as [...] "A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me", but exactly the same song in North American bluegrass is known as [...] "I <b>Wish</b> <b>My</b> Baby Was Born".|$|E
