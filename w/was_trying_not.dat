It was {{one of the hardest things}} I've ever had to do on a shoot. But it went by so quickly. I had a body suit on underneath my clothes, so there's a little fun fact for you. I <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to break my focus pretty much the entire shoot, because I was really in that zone – thinking a lot about the position I was in a year ago... thinking about the situation and how much I wanted to get all that emotion off my chest." ...|$|E

60|$|During {{this rather}} heated exhortation to coolness and {{discretion}} the pipe had gone out, and Bartle gave the climax to his speech by striking a light furiously, {{after which he}} puffed with fierce resolution, fixing his eye still on Adam, who <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to laugh.|$|E
60|$|I {{stooped to}} arrange my {{footstool}} and compose my countenance. I <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to grin. For the first time, attired in philosophic melancholy of black silk, Enrico looked a boor and a fool. His close-cropped, rather animal head was common above the effeminate doublet, his sturdy, ordinary figure looked absurd in a melancholic droop.|$|E

[...] His English fashion of crying was to screw his black {{knuckles}} into his eyes, howl like a dog, and roll {{himself on his}} back on the sand. It <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to kick him, but I gave Charker the word, [...] "Double-quick, Harry!" [...] and we got down to the water's edge, and got on board the sloop.|$|E

6000|$|Freddie's mouth slowly opened. He <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> {{to realize}} the meaning of what his friend was saying. His was a {{faithful}} soul, and for years--to {{all intents and purposes}} for practically the whole of his life--he had looked up to Derek and reverenced him. He absolutely refused to believe that Derek was intending to convey what he seemed to be trying to convey; for, if he was, well ... by Jove ... it was too rotten and Algy Martyn had been right after all and the fellow was simply....|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile he had {{a curious}} little private {{conflict}} of his own. He <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to think, day and night he <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to think, that Lady Harman was now a very rich woman. Yet some portions of his brain, {{and he had never}} suspected himself of such lawless regions, persisted in the most vulgar and outrageous suggestions, suggestions that made his soul blush; schemes, for example, of splendid foreign travel, of hotel staffs bowing, of a yacht in the Mediterranean, of motor cars, of a palatial flat in London, of a box at the opera, of artists patronized, of--most horrible!--a baronetcy.... The more authentic parts of Mr. Brumley cowered from and sought to escape these squalid dreams of magnificences. It shocked and terrified him to find such things could come out in him. He was like some pest-stricken patient, amazedly contemplating his first symptom. His better part denied, repudiated. Of course he would never touch, never even propose--or hint.... It was an aspect he had never once contemplated before Sir Isaac died. He could on his honour, and after searching his heart, say that. Yet in Pall Mall one afternoon, suddenly, he caught himself with a thought in his head so gross, so smug, that he uttered a faint cry and quickened his steps.... Benevolent stepfather! ...|$|E
60|$|She was {{perfectly}} unreasonable, and right {{in most of}} the things she said. He {{was perfectly}} unreasonable, and right in all of the things he said. Their argument was absurdly hot, and hurt them pathetically. It was difficult, at first, for Carl to admit that he was at odds with his playmate. Surely this was a sham dissension, of which they would soon tire, which they would smilingly give up. Then, he <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to be too contentious, but was irritated into retorting. After fifteen minutes they were staring at each other as at intruding strangers, he remembering {{the fact that she was}} a result of city life; she the fact that he wasn't a product of city life.|$|E

5000|$|Per The ICU Book [...] "The {{first rule}} of {{antibiotics}} <b>is</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to use them, and the second rule <b>is</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to use too many of them." [...] Inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics {{have contributed to the}} emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Self prescription of antibiotics is an example of misuse. Many antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibiotics or that are likely to resolve without treatment. Also, incorrect or suboptimal antibiotics are prescribed for certain bacterial infections. The overuse of antibiotics, like penicillin and erythromycin, has been associated with emerging antibiotic resistance since the 1950s. Widespread usage of antibiotics in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibiotics.|$|R

60|$|His mind {{drifted away}} to still more general speculations, and always he <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> {{to see the}} figure of Sir Isaac, grimly and yet meanly resolute--in possession. Always too like some {{open-mouthed}} yokel at a fair who knows nothing of the insult chalked upon his back, he disregarded how he himself coveted and desired and would {{if he could have}} gripped. He forgot his own watchful attention to Euphemia in the past, nor did he think what he might have been if Lady Harman had been his wife. It needed the chill veracities of the small hours to bring him to that. He thought now of crude egotism as having Sir Isaac's hands and Sir Isaac's eyes and Sir Isaac's position. He forgot any egotism he himself was betraying.|$|E
60|$|Beaton was astonished, {{and in a}} mistaken way he was disgusted. He {{saw that}} Dryfoos was trying to undo Mrs. Mandel's work practically, and get him to come again to his house; that he now {{conceived}} of the offence given him as condoned, and wished to restore the former situation. He {{knew that he was}} attempting this for Christine's sake, but he was not the man to imagine that Dryfoos <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> only to tolerate him, but to like him; and, in fact, Dryfoos was not wholly conscious himself of this end. What they both understood was that Dryfoos was endeavoring to get at Beaton through Conrad's memory; but with one this was its dedication to a purpose of self sacrifice, and with the other a vulgar and shameless use of it.|$|E

I've {{got lots of}} pals, of course, buzzing about all over London and its outskirts, who'd be glad enough to rally round and join the execution-squad; {{but you know how}} it is. Their maters are all pals of my mater, and I don't want to get them into trouble for aiding and abetting my little show, if you {{understand}} what I mean. Now, you're different. You don't know the mater, so it doesn't matter to you if she rolls around and puts the Curse of the Byngs on you, and all that sort of thing. Besides, I don't know." [...] Reggie mused. [...] "Of course, this is the happiest day of my life," [...] he proceeded, [...] "and I'm not saying it isn't, but you know how it is--there's absolutely no doubt that a chappie does not show at his best when he's being married. What I mean to say is, he's more or less bound to look a fearful ass. And I'm perfectly certain it would put me right off my stroke if I felt that some chump like Jack Ferris or Ronnie Fitzgerald <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to giggle in the background. So, if you will be a sportsman and come and hold my hand till the thing's over, I shall be eternally grateful." ...|$|E

25|$|The Constitution of Australia {{provides}} {{in section}} 80 that 'the trial on indictment of any offence against any {{law of the}} Commonwealth shall be by jury'. The Commonwealth can determine which offences are 'on indictment'. It would be entirely consistent with the Constitution that a homicide offence could <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> 'on indictment,' or conversely that a simple Assault could <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> 'on indictment.' This interpretation has been criticised a 'mockery' of the section, rendering it useless.|$|R
6000|$|It {{pressed on}} him with this that never had a man been in so many places at once. [...] "I quite {{understand}} that she's yours. Only you see she's not mine." [...] He felt he could somehow, for honesty, risk that, as he had the moral certainty she wouldn't repeat it and least of all to Mrs. Lowder, who would find in it a disturbing implication. This {{was part of what}} he liked in the good lady, that she didn't repeat, and also that she gave him a delicate sense of her shyly wishing him to know it. That was in itself a hint of possibilities between them, of a relation, beneficent and elastic for him, which wouldn't engage him further than he could see. Yet even as he afresh made this out he felt how strange it all was. She wanted, Susan Shepherd then, as appeared, the same thing Kate wanted, only wanted it, as still further appeared, in so different a way and from a motive so different, even though scarce less deep. Then Mrs. Lowder wanted, by so odd an evolution of her exuberance, exactly what each of the others did; and he was between them all, he was in the midst. Such perceptions made occasions--well, occasions for fairly wondering if it mightn't be best just to consent, luxuriously, to be the ass the whole thing involved. Trying not to be and yet keeping in it was of the two things the more asinine. He was glad there was no male witness; it was a circle of petticoats; he shouldn't have liked a man to see him. He only had for a moment a sharp thought of Sir Luke Strett, the great master of the knife whom Kate in London had spoken of Milly as in commerce with, and whose renewed intervention at such a distance, just announced to him, required some accounting for. He had a vision of great London surgeons--if this one was a surgeon--as incisive all round; so that he should perhaps after all not wholly escape the ironic attention of his own sex. The most {{he might be able to}} do was not to care; while he <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to he could take that in. It was a train, however, that brought up the vision of Lord Mark as well. Lord Mark had caught him twice in the fact--the fact of his absurd posture; and that made a second male. But it was comparatively easy not to mind Lord Mark.|$|E
60|$|He was amusing {{about it}} that evening at dinner--in spite of an odd first impulse, which at the palace quite melted away, to treat it merely as matter for his own satisfaction. This need, this propriety, he had taken for granted even up to the moment of {{suddenly}} perceiving, {{in the course of}} talk, that the incident would minister to innocent gaiety. Such was quite its effect, with the aid of his picture--an evocation of the quaint, of the humblest rococo, of a Venetian interior in the true old note. He made the point for his hostess that her own high chambers, though they were a thousand grand things, weren't really this; made it in fact with such success that she presently declared it his plain duty to invite her on some near day to tea. She had expressed as yet--he could feel it as felt among them all--no such clear wish to go anywhere, not even to make an effort for a parish feast, or an autumn sunset, nor to descend her staircase for Titian or Gianbellini. It was constantly Densher's view that, as between himself and Kate, things were understood without saying, so that he could catch in her, as she but too freely could in him, innumerable signs of it, the whole soft breath of consciousness meeting and promoting consciousness. This view was so far justified to-night as that Milly's offer to him of her company was to his sense taken up by Kate in spite of her doing nothing to show it. It fell in so perfectly with what she had desired and foretold that she was--and this was what most struck him--sufficiently gratified and blinded by it not to know, from the false quality of his response, from his tone and his very look, which for an instant instinctively sought her own, that he had answered inevitably, almost shamelessly, in a mere time-gaining sense. It gave him on the spot, her failure of perception, almost a beginning of the advantage he had been planning for--that is at least if she too were not darkly dishonest. She might, he was not unaware, have made out, from some deep part of her, the bearing, in respect to herself, of the little fact he had announced; for she was after all capable of that, capable of guessing and yet of simultaneously hiding her guess. It wound him up a turn or two further, none the less, to impute to her now a weakness of vision by which he could himself feel the stronger. Whatever apprehension of his motive in shifting his abode might have brushed her with its wings, she at all events certainly didn't guess that he was giving their friend a hollow promise. That was what she had herself imposed on him; there had been in the prospect from the first a definite particular point at which hollowness, to call it by its least compromising name, would have to begin. Therefore its hour had now charmingly sounded. Whatever in life he had recovered his old rooms for, he had not recovered them to receive Milly Theale: which made no more difference in his expression of happy readiness than if he had been--just what he <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to be--fully hardened and fully base. So rapid in fact was the rhythm of his inward drama that the quick vision of impossibility produced in him by his hostess's direct and unexpected appeal had the effect, slightly sinister, of positively scaring him. It gave him a measure of the intensity, the reality of his now mature motive. It prompted in him certainly no quarrel with these things, but it made them as vivid as if they already flushed with success. It was before the flush of success that his heart beat almost to dread. The dread was but the dread of the happiness to be compassed; only that was in itself a symptom. That a visit from Milly should, in this projection of necessities, strike him as of the last incongruity, quite as a hateful idea, and above all as spoiling, should one put it grossly, his game--the adoption of such a view might of course have an identity with one of those numerous ways of being a fool that seemed so to abound for him. It would remain none the less the way to which he should be in advance most reconciled. His mature motive, as to which he allowed himself no grain of illusion, had thus in an hour taken imaginative possession of the place: that precisely was how he saw it seated there, already unpacked and settled, for Milly's innocence, for Milly's beauty, no matter how short a time, to be housed with. There were things she would never recognise, never feel, never catch in the air; but this made no difference in the fact that her brushing against them would do nobody any good. The discrimination and the scruple were for him. So he felt all the parts of the case together, while Kate showed admirably as feeling none of them. Of course, however--when hadn't it to be his last word?--Kate was always sublime.|$|E
