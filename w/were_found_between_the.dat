25|$|Most of the {{fuselage}} {{was destroyed in}} the fire. Exceptions included the nose and {{the underside of the}} cockpit. The tips of the wings and ailerons were nearly undamaged. The front wing spar was sufficiently intact that it was able to keep the wings together. The inner parts of the wing, including the spoilers, were destroyed, but two of the spoiler actuators were salvageable. The tail was largely intact. Most light alloy components in the engines were destroyed, although the compressor blades were intact and showed no sign of damage prior to impact. Three components – the left main landing gear, an engine cowling and the outer right engine – <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> runway and the wreckage, and had not been consumed in fire.|$|E

25|$|One small 2009 {{double-blind}} study of autistic children found that 40 hourly treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres provided {{significant improvement in}} the children's behavior immediately after treatment sessions but this study has not been independently confirmed. More recent, relatively large-scale controlled studies have also investigated HBOT using treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres and have found less promising results. A 2010 {{double-blind study}} compared HBOT to a placebo treatment in children with autistic disorder. Both direct observational measures of behavioral symptoms and standardized psychological assessments were {{used to evaluate the}} treatment. No differences <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> HBOT group and the placebo group on any of the outcome measures. A second 2011 single-subject design study also investigated the effects of 40 HBOT treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres on directly observed behaviors using multiple baselines across 16 participants. Again, no consistent outcomes were observed across any group and further, no significant improvements were observed within any individual participant. Together these studies suggest that HBOT at 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheric pressure does not result in a clinically significant improvement of the behavioral symptoms of autistic disorder.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} had 5 first-class passengers, 28 business-class passengers (9 {{on lower}} deck and 19 on upper deck), and 126 economy-class passengers. Of {{the first class}} passengers, 1 received a minor injury and 4 received no injuries. Of the business-class passengers, 14 (2 on lower deck, 12 on upper deck) died, 2 (1 on lower deck, 1 on upper deck) received serious injuries, 7 (2 on lower deck, 5 on upper deck) received minor injuries, and 8 (4 on lower deck, 4 on upper deck) were uninjured. Of the economy class passengers, 65 died, 33 received serious injuries, 14 received minor injuries, and 11 were uninjured. The lower deck passengers who died were seated in rows 22 through 38. 64 of 76 passengers in the forward economy section {{were killed by the}} explosion of the centre fuel tank, which resulted in intense fire. In the upper deck of the business class section, 12 of 19 passengers and 1 of 2 flight attendants died due to smoke inhalation and fire; 10 bodies, originating from the upper deck of business class, <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> stairwell and the 2L exit on the main deck. All passengers in the aft economy section survived.|$|E
2500|$|A {{criminal}} investigation also began {{weeks after the}} shooting, when the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA) forwarded {{the case to the}} state's attorney's office and the FBI. The U.S. attorney's office confirmed on April 13, 2015, that they had been conducting a federal {{criminal investigation}} of the McDonald case in conjunction with the state attorney's office, after contradictions <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> initial police report and the dash-cam video. The police report said that McDonald had lunged at an officer, but the video footage showed that McDonald made no lunges. [...] The video does show that McDonald was swinging the knife in his right hand in a wide, but aimless manner as he walked down the street, and also appears to show that McDonald turns slightly to look briefly at Van Dyke and another officer who are pointing guns at him, but that he continues to walk away from both officers at the moment Van Dyke opens fire on him.|$|E

2500|$|They {{found two}} ditches running east-west {{on the north}} side of Carter Lane, between 5266, {{interpreted}} as the southern defences of the tower. There was [...] of an earlier ditch, estimated at [...] deep originally, and [...] of a later, V-shaped ditch that was about [...] wide and [...] deep originally. Another ditch was found on Ludgate Hill, some [...] north of the southern ditches. It was estimated at [...] wide and [...] deep originally. Pits and a well <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> ditches, interpreted as the bailey of the castle, but no sign of a keep or other masonry. Watson suggests that a motte and keep may have existed to the east of the Ludgate Hill entrance of Ludgate Square. There is now an office building at 29 Ludgate Hill called Montfichet House. In 2009 a series of tunnels was discovered under the building. These tunnels are off limits to all but the owners, and a group of archeologists has had no success suggesting individual admission.|$|E
2500|$|About [...] before zero hour, {{the party}} stole forward in pairs, wearing white smocks and helmet-covers and formed two waves [...] {{apart at the}} tripods. Three more tripods had been placed [...] further on, to help the raiders keep direction. The Stokes mortars of the 99th Trench Mortar Battery opened fire, one mortar firing [...] "rapid" [...] at a {{particular}} German post at zero and one minute later, the divisional artillery began the box-barrage, as the raiding party moved to within [...] of the objective and lay down. When the Stokes mortars ceased fire, the party rushed the German position through three rows of barbed wire, each [...] thick. The first wave moved towards {{the east side of}} the salient, then from there to the western face, as the second wave jumped over the trench and ran along the parados, until they saw Germans in the trench near the apex. Several Germans were shot and the rest taken prisoner. After twenty minutes searching dugouts, the party withdrew with [...] (including two officers), having smashed a machine-gun and killed or wounded [...] soldiers. One raider was killed and twelve wounded. Another raid was ordered for [...] then postponed until 10 February. On this raid several Germans were killed as they retreated and soldiers in four dugouts were killed with hand-grenades, when they refused to surrender. Seven prisoners were taken and the party of [...] three killed, seven wounded and three missing. The Germans retaliated on 12 February, when about [...] raided the area between [...] and took seven prisoners. Five dead Germans <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> posts but machine-gun fire prevented no man's land being searched.|$|E
60|$|After {{surveying}} the basin, itself, with sufficient care, Bob pulled the dingui {{back towards the}} ship, Mark sounding as they proceeded. But two difficulties <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> points {{that it was so}} desirable to bring in communication with each other. One of these difficulties consisted in a passage between two lines of reef, that ran nearly parallel for a quarter of a mile, and which were only half a cable's-length asunder. There was abundance of water between these reefs, but the difficulty was in the course, and in the narrowness of the passage. Mark passed through the latter four several times, sounding it, as it might be, foot by foot, and examining the bottom with the eye; for, in that pellucid water, with the sun near the zenith, it was possible to see two or three fathoms down, and nowhere did he find any other obstacle than this just mentioned. Nor was any buoy necessary, the water breaking over {{the southern end of the}} outer, and over the northern end of the inner ledge, and nowhere else near by, thus distinctly noting the very two points where it would be necessary to alter the course.|$|E

A Thracian fort of the Iron Age (10th century BC) was found on the mountain of Tupcha. Around the 1st century the area was occupied by the Carpi people who displaced the local Celts from the area.|$|E
