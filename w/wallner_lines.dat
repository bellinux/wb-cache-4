40|$|A failure {{analysis}} investigation {{was performed on}} a fractured polymer impeller used in a respiratory blower. Light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and finite element analysis techniques were utilized to characterize the mode(s) of failure and fracture surfaces. A radial split down the impeller center was observed with symmetric fracture faces about the impeller bore. Fractographic analysis revealed brittle fracture features including <b>Wallner</b> <b>lines,</b> mirror, mist and hackle features stemming from the impeller bore, emanating radially outward. Crazed fibrils and faint fatigue striations suggest that intermittent load cycling led to initiation, and rapid propagation of multiple crack fronts originating along the impeller lip. Finite element analysis revealed a flexural condition induces localized stresses along the impeller lip. Significant wear features were also observed within the impeller bore, which {{may have contributed to}} premature failure of the impeller. The brittle fracture morphology and defects within the impeller bore suggest that premature failure occurred because of multiple interacting factors including: intermittently high centrifugal velocities, imbalance bore and shaft conditions, defects within the bore caused by machining, and stress concentrations along the circumference of the impeller lip...|$|E
40|$|Metallurgical coke is {{a complex}} brittle {{heterogeneous}} material consisting of carbon derived from fusible, semi-fusible and inert coal particles that forms a porous composite matrix. This paper presents a novel approach to assess and quantify the breakage behaviour and microstructural weaknesses in a pilot oven metallurgical coke. The approach uses fractography, a method commonly applied to determine the fracture behaviour and origin(s) in homogeneous materials, such as metals and ceramics. Determination of the fracture origin(s), paths of crack propagation and microstructural weaknesses in such a complex heterogeneous material as metallurgical coke represents a significant advance in both the application of fractography and the assessment of coke strength and breakage behaviour. Identification of the key features {{that contribute to the}} cokeâ€™s failure will facilitate better prediction of coke strength from coal properties and ultimately optimisation of the coal blending process. Key features and markings have been clearly identified on fracture surfaces that can either {{be traced back to the}} fracture origin or give an indication of the type of fracture or stresses to which the coke has been subjected, including the directionality and strength of those stresses. These markings include hackle, hackle twist and <b>wallner</b> <b>lines,</b> as well as markings generated by conchoidal and overload fractures. A three-step approach was applied to determine the breakage behaviour in stabilized lumps of the pilot oven coke, in which fractured coke surfaces were analysed at the macro, micro and submicron levels. The observed mechanisms of failure were quantified and summarised using a radar diagram...|$|E
