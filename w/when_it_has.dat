5|$|The laws {{of physics}} apply the abstractions of {{mathematics}} to the real world, often {{as if it were}} perfect. For example, a crystal is perfect <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> no structural defects such as dislocations and is fully symmetric. Exact mathematical perfection can only approximate real objects. Visible patterns in nature are governed by physical laws; for example, meanders can be explained using fluid dynamics.|$|E

5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset necessarily splits the graph into at least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself a cut. A minimal cutset of a connected graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component. A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates {{the creation of a}} world government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war and the pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E
5|$|Food {{is mostly}} {{selected}} by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs {{have been caught}} on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs (Rana clamitans) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past. Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> no smell, even in complete darkness.|$|E

5|$|In 1797 {{the poet}} Samuel Taylor Coleridge rented the cottage. While he lived there he wrote {{many of his}} better known works. He was visited by William Wordsworth and other early members of the Romantic movement. Coleridge moved out in 1799 and the {{building}} was refurbished. Almost 100 years after his occupation some of his admirers leased the property and eventually bought it, after a national campaign and significant private funding. In 1909 they handed {{it over to the}} National Trust who have run it as a writer's home museum since then. In the later 20th and early 21st centuries further renovation and expansion was undertaken, since <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> won awards as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|The Greek text of {{the codex}} is a {{representative}} of the Caesarean text-type. It belongs to the textual family f13, known also as Ferrar Family. Also the handwriting and the menology show that is a close member of the group. According to Kurt and Barbara Aland it agrees with the Byzantine standard text 151 times, and 72 times with the Byzantine <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> the same reading as the original text. It agrees 31 times with the original text against the Byzantine. It has 57 independent or distinctive readings. Alands placed it in Category III.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was {{the headquarters of}} the Manchester Fire Brigade until the brigade was replaced by the Greater Manchester Fire Service in 1974. The fire station closed in 1986, since <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been largely unused despite several redevelopment proposals. It was placed on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register in 2001 and in 2010 Manchester City Council served a compulsory purchase order on the fire station's owner, Britannia Hotels. Britannia announced in 2015 their intention to sell the building opening up the possibility of redevelopment after nearly 30 years of dereliction.|$|E

5|$|The {{nucleus of}} an atom {{will have no}} spin <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> even numbers of both {{neutrons}} and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of thermal equilibrium. However, for certain elements (such as xenon-129) {{it is possible to}} polarize a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called hyperpolarization. This has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} hunts almost entirely at night, {{watching}} from a perch before dropping or gliding silently {{down to its}} victim, but very occasionally it will hunt in daylight <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> young to feed. This species takes {{a wide range of}} prey, mainly woodland rodents, but also other mammals up {{to the size of a}} young rabbit, and birds, earthworms and beetles. In urban areas, birds make up a larger proportion of the diet, and species as unlikely as mallard and kittiwake have been killed and eaten.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{considers}} the laws governing {{the shapes of}} cells, at least in simple cases such as the fine hairs (a cell thick) in the rhizoids of mosses. He analyses the geometry of cells in a frog's egg <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> divided into 4, 8 and even 64 cells. He shows that uniform growth can lead to unequal cell sizes, and argues that the way cells divide {{is driven by the}} shape of the dividing structure (and not vice versa).|$|E

5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.|$|E
5|$|Each half of {{the pitch}} is then divided again by a line, {{referred}} to as the 23metre line or 25yard line, positioned 22.90m from each back line. Historically, this was first used to resume play after the ball passed over the back line and marked by flags {{at the side of the}} pitch. In 1949, deliberate defensive offenses in this area resulted in a penalty corner. From 1961, players on the defensive team who were not involved at the penalty corner stood behind this line (this was then moved to the half-way line two years later). The line was also used for the offside rule between 1987 until the rule was abolished in 1996. Nowadays, there are detailed rules regarding fouls and free-hits in the 23metre region of the pitch. Since 2015, the 23metre line has also been used for the attacking team to resume play <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> gone over the back line (this replaced long corners).|$|E
