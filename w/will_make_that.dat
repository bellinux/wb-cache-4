Time {{reviewer}} John Skow {{described the}} novel as [...] "cliché and crude literary calculation", where events [...] "refuse to take on life and momentum" [...] and the climax [...] "lacks only Queequeg's coffin to resemble a bath tub version of Moby-Dick." [...] Writing for The Village Voice, Donald Newlove declared that [...] "Jaws has rubber teeth for a plot. It's boring, pointless, listless; if there's a trite turn to make, Jaws <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> turn." [...] An article in The Listener criticized the plot, stating the [...] "novel only has bite, so to say, at feed time," [...] and these scenes are [...] "naïve attempts at whipping along a flagging story-line." [...] Andrew Bergman of The New York Times Book Review felt that despite the book serving as [...] "fluid entertainment", [...] "passages of hollow portentousness creep in" [...] while poor scene [...] "connections [...] stark manipulations impair the narrative." ...|$|E

No woman should be authorised {{to stay at home}} to bring up her children. Society should be totally different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because {{if there is such a}} choice, too many women <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> one.

6000|$|In {{order that}} we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding with free minds, it will be well {{to begin with a}} little gossip about the Marches.

Also the Bible speaks of them often, does it not, and what was, is, and shall be, as Solomon says. Oh! why hesitate? Without doubt this woman is a witch who poses as an innocent modern spiritualist.

This was at Berlin, on the very eve of the Review; and Chasot and his Austrian are made happy in that small matter. And on the morrow [end of May, 1750], the Austrian attends accordingly; but, to his astonishment, has hardly begun to taste the manoeuvres, when--one of Friedrich's Aides-de-Camp gallops up: 'By the King's command, Mein Herr, you retire on the instant!' ...|$|E
