5|$|Courageous and Glorious <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> similar {{except that}} they carried a total of 48 aircraft. They {{commonly}} flew {{the same types of}} aircraft as Furious, although they are also known to have flown the Fairey Seal, the Blackburn Shark, and the Blackburn Ripon.|$|E
5|$|Coursers <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> {{preferred}} {{for hard}} battle {{as they were}} light, fast and strong. They were valuable, but not as costly as the destrier. They were also used frequently for hunting.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, non-combat {{roles of}} the equites cohortales {{differed}} significantly from the alares. Non-combat roles such as despatch-riders (dispositi) <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> filled by cohort cavalry.|$|E
50|$|Weeklies (such as Time and Newsweek) <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> dated a week ahead. Monthlies (such as National Geographic Magazine) <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> dated a month ahead, and quarterlies <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> dated {{three months}} ahead.|$|R
50|$|Source {{of income}} {{is where the}} income is {{considered}} to arise under the relevant tax system. The manner of determining the source of income <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> dependent {{on the nature of}} income.

Financing income (e.g., interest, dividends) <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> treated as arising where the user of the financing resides. Income related to use of tangible property (e.g., rents) <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> treated as arising where the property is situated. Income related to use of intangible property (e.g., royalties) <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> treated as arising where the property is used. Gains on sale of realty <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> treated as arising where the property is situated.|$|R
50|$|The amount {{subject to}} sales tax <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> the net sales price. Such price <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> after any {{applicable}} discounts.|$|R
5|$|Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{apparently}} feed on microflora {{and must}} obtain {{high levels of}} calcium carbonate from their environment for proper shell formation. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> found on green vegetation, whereas Succinea sp. B was more frequently found on dead vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Reviews of The Great Lover <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> positive, {{many of them}} {{noting the}} ability of Dawson to evoke the {{personality}} of Brooke and produce an accurate sense of his contemporaries and contemporary society.|$|E
5|$|September 5, 2008– Hurricane Hanna moves ashore {{near the}} South Carolina– North Carolina border, packing strong winds and torrential rains. Aside from minor {{structural}} damage, the storm's effects <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> minor.|$|E
50|$|The test <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> done at one {{and five}} minutes after birth, and may be {{repeated}} later if the score is and remains low. Scores 7 and above <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> normal, 4 to 6 fairly low, and 3 and below <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> regarded as critically low.|$|R
50|$|The Baccharis pilularis shrub <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> {{smaller than}} 3 m in height. Erect plants <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> mixed (and intergrade completely) with {{prostrate}} plants. It <b>is</b> glabrous and <b>generally</b> sticky.|$|R

5|$|Tropical Storm Arlene caused light {{rainfall}} across southeastern Mississippi, typically between 1 and 2inches (25 to 50mm). Effects <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> minimal.|$|E
5|$|A Cure for Pokeritis {{was one of}} many Vitagraph Studios one-reel or shorter comedies {{starring}} Bunny and Finch in {{a domestic}} setting, known popularly as Bunnygraphs or Bunnyfinches. The number of these shorts originally produced is unknown because Vitagraph's films <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> not archived. Estimates vary considerably; totals in excess of 150, 200, or 260 have been proposed. Most are now lost.|$|E
5|$|A common {{concern among}} reviewers is the {{overhead}} perspective, which critics have bemoaned for {{preventing them from}} judging pathway routes and an object's location in relation to its background. Besides this, the actual visuals <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> well received, {{as well as the}} setting and animations. The audio was commended for combining both originality and nostalgia, even though it looped frequently.|$|E
50|$|Platform 2 <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> {{used for}} trains {{terminating}} at this station, and platform 3 <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> used for trains starting from this station.|$|R
50|$|They <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> not toxic but {{considered}} non-edible due {{to their}} fibrous texture in the mature stage that they <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> found at.|$|R
50|$|Just as prisms and antiprisms <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> not {{considered}} Archimedean solids, so bipyramids and trapezohedra <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> {{not considered}} Catalan solids, despite being face-transitive.|$|R
5|$|Academic {{computer}} scientists <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created {{and were not}} involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{economist}} Zdzisław Sadowski, the Poles <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> euphoric {{about the end}} of the era of communist rule and Soviet domination. Because of the belief that the Balcerowicz Plan would quickly result in universal Western-like prosperity, the plan enjoyed broad social support, which would cause any conceivable competing pursuits of more moderate economic policies to be politically unrealistic.|$|E
5|$|After Theophrastus, though {{interest}} in Aristotle's ideas survived, they <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> taken unquestioningly. It is {{not until the}} age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology resumed. The first medical teacher at Alexandria, Herophilus of Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, noting that the latter pulse while the former do not.|$|E
50|$|Thai public <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> apathetic to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but the Muslim {{minority}} in the country, of nearly 4 million, <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> against Israel.|$|R
5000|$|On average, {{a quality}} pump-action shotgun <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> less {{expensive}} than a quality handgun (self-loading shotguns <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> more expensive than their pump-action counterparts).|$|R
5000|$|Different {{varieties}} {{have different}} coloration, although young dolphins <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> gray, with darker gray above than below. Plumbea-type adults <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> dark gray. [...] Chinensis-type adults from Australia <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> light gray above and lighter, possibly with some spotting, below, {{and as the}} dolphins age the rostrum, melon and dorsal fin get lighter. [...] Chinensis-type adults from South China <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> white with dark spots on the sides, although the white portions appear to be pink because of blood flow beneath the skin.|$|R
5|$|Although skull {{proportions}} varied, abelisaurid skulls <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> {{very tall}} and very short in length. In Carnotaurus, for example, the skull {{was nearly as}} tall as it was long. The premaxilla in abelisaurids was very tall, so {{the front of the}} snout was blunt, not tapered as seen in many other theropods.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Robbins medallions {{were also}} struck, in very small numbers, in 14k gold. These medallions <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> {{ordered by the}} mission crew as a {{personal}} memento of their flight and were often taken to the lunar surface in the Landing Module. For {{the duration of the}} Apollo program, Robbins medallions (3–7 gold and 80–450 silver per mission) were flown into space.|$|E
5|$|Armored and {{mechanized}} divisions normally {{made use}} of three brigades, with each brigade having up to four combat battalions; depending on the division type, these <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> a three to one mix, with either three mechanized battalions and one armored battalion, or vice versa. Given {{the size of the}} forces deployed across the border, it is thought that the Iraqi Army planned to continue the offensive, after the successful capture of Khafji, in order to seize the valuable oil fields at Dammam.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., it <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> {{estimated}} at a use {{which is less}} than highest-and-best use, and therefore it <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> lower than market value.|$|R

5|$|As Julio made landfall, it {{produced}} lightning and locally heavy rainfall, which left {{more than a}} dozen communities isolated due to flooding. The flooding damaged several houses and killed two people. Winds <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> light, although strong enough to damage a few electrical poles and small buildings. In nearby Sinaloa, rainfall from the storm led to an emergency evacuation of 500 residents.|$|E
5|$|As {{the tunnels}} were constructed, they <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> {{supported}} by wooden beams and posts. Once the mine had been finished, the internal space {{was filled with}} combustibles, such as brushwood, firewood, resin, and other incendiary substances; once ignited, these would burn the supporting props, causing the mine to collapse, bringing down with it the structures lying above. From the 15th century, gunpowder was also used, although the aim remained to burn the props.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{scientists}} {{generally recognized}} that the number of neurons in the adult brain (roughly 100 billion) did not increase significantly with age, giving neurobiologists good reason to believe that memories <b>were</b> <b>generally</b> not the result of new neuron production. With this realization came the need to explain how memories could form in the absence of new neurons.|$|E
25|$|Louisiana's {{criminal}} law largely rests on English common law. Louisiana's administrative law <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> {{similar to the}} administrative law of the U.S. federal government and other U.S. states.
