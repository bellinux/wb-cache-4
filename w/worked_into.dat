5|$|Principal {{photography}} in New Orleans, Louisiana, was delayed following Hurricane Katrina {{because of the}} devastation caused by the storm {{and the collapse of}} the levees. Many of the exteriors were set to be shot in New Orleans, including a key sequence involving the Canal Street Ferry across the Mississippi River. After the city was reopened, the cast and crew returned to New Orleans to continue filming. Some scenes of the post-Katrina devastation were <b>worked</b> <b>into</b> the plot, including those in the Lower 9th Ward; additionally, evidence of Katrina's impact on the city was <b>worked</b> <b>into</b> the script.Deja Vu starts production in New Orleans|work= USA Today|date= February 2, 2006|accessdate=2008-10-19|quote= |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-02-02-deja-vu_x.htm}} The filming crew spent two weeks filming a scene at the Four Mile Bayou in Morgan City, Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|After {{missing a}} few weeks, Mercury {{returned}} wearing a protective face mask and his injury was <b>worked</b> <b>into</b> the angle, with {{both he and}} Nitro attempting to injure the Hardys in various ways for revenge. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February which concluded the feud. He also wrestled in singles competition on SmackDown! until {{he was released from}} his WWE contract on March 26, 2007.|$|E

5|$|The trial De Iniusta details {{took place}} at Salisbury in November 1088, and {{concerned}} St-Calais' equivocal actions in the revolt against King William II's rule {{that had taken place}} earlier in the year. The work is one of the primary sources for the early part of King William II's reign, and was probably compiled from notes taken by the bishop's subordinates and then <b>worked</b> <b>into</b> a tractate that was designed to present the bishop's case in the best light. It was probably composed during the 1090s when St-Calais was engaged in an effort to regain the favour of King William after his return from the sentence of exile he received at the trial.|$|E
5|$|Vincent {{was chosen}} as the game's protagonist due to the scope for {{expanding}} his backstory, which was left very vague in Final Fantasy VII. The fact that his main weapon was a gun also <b>worked</b> <b>into</b> the team's desire to create a more action-oriented game. Prior to the solidification of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, the development team originally considered using other gunfighter characters from the Final Fantasy series, such as Final Fantasy VIIs Barret Wallace, Final Fantasy VIIIs Irvine Kinneas or Final Fantasy X-2s Yuna. However, after the release of Before Crisis and Advent Children, and with the expansion of the Final Fantasy VII mythos, they settled on Vincent.|$|E
5|$|As {{the debate}} over Zeus raged, the Nike team was making rapid {{progress}} developing the actual system. Test firings of the original A models of the missile began in 1959 at White Sands Missile Range. The first attempt on 26 August 1959 was of a live booster stage and dummy sustainer, but the booster broke up shortly before booster/sustainer separation. A similar test on 14 October was a success, followed by the first two-stage attempt on 16 December. The first complete test of both stages with active guidance and thrust vectoring was successfully carried out on 3 February 1960. Data collected from these tests led to changes to the design to improve speed during the ascent. The first test of the Zeus B took place in May 1961. A number of Zeus missiles broke up during early test flights due to excessive heating of the control surfaces, and numerous changes were <b>worked</b> <b>into</b> the system to address this.|$|E

5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he <b>worked</b> <b>into</b> the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
5|$|Nests {{built in}} the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of dry grass, twigs, and other plant {{material}}s. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be <b>worked</b> <b>into</b> the nest. In cavity nests, the hole is filled with a shapeless mass of grass {{with a cup of}} soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, they are simply given a soft lining. The nest entrance is on the side, and is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie (Helichrysum pumilio), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and camphor (Cinnamomum). This consistent use of aromatics suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites.|$|E
5|$|The Briscoes {{have been}} {{involved}} with the promotion since its early days, debuting at PWG's fourth-ever show Are You Adequately Prepared to Rock? in October 2003, losing to Super Dragon and B-Boy. Due to the costs of bringing them in from the East coast and the sabbatical from the sport the brothers took, they would not appear again until May 20, 2006, at Enchantment Under the Sea, falling to Cape Fear (Quicksilver and El Generico). At the 2006 Battle of Los Angeles, the Briscoes' numerous no-shows were <b>worked</b> <b>into</b> the company's kayfabe when PWG announced days before that they had been pulled from the tournament as punishment. They wound up appearing anyway, attacking Commissioner Dino Winwood on Night One. The next night, they wrestled in a three-way tag team match for the PWG World Tag Team Championship against Homicide and B-Boy and defending champions Arrogance (Chris Bosh and Scott Lost), who went on to retain the titles.|$|E

5|$|After {{the team}} split, Nitro, {{alongside}} Melina, was quickly placed into the Intercontinental Championship picture, winning the title twice. In November, after serving his suspension {{and a brief}} stint back in OVW, Mercury returned to WWE, reuniting MNM to answer an open challenge put out by The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) for the December to Dismember pay-per-view. At the event, MNM lost to the Hardys. MNM and the Hardys met again at Armageddon {{as part of a}} four-way ladder match, which also included the teams of Dave Taylor and William Regal and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. During the match, which saw London and Kendrick retain the WWE Tag Team Championship, Mercury was legitimately injured when he was struck in the face with a ladder, necessitating a trip to the emergency room where his broken nose received 15 stitches. The facial injury was <b>worked</b> <b>into</b> the angle, and when Mercury returned wearing a protective covering on his face, the rivalry between the teams intensified with MNM actively seeking to injure {{one or both of the}} Hardys, even going so far as to attack and perform a Snapshot on Matt on exposed concrete following a match. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February, which concluded the feud.|$|E
5|$|The insertion-loss {{method of}} {{designing}} filters is, in essence, to prescribe a desired function of frequency for the filter as an attenuation {{of the signal}} when the filter is inserted between the terminations relative to the level {{that would have been}} received were the terminations connected to each other via an ideal transformer perfectly matching them. Versions of this theory are due to Sidney Darlington, Wilhelm Cauer and others all working more or less independently and is often taken as synonymous with network synthesis. Butterworth's filter implementation is, in those terms, an insertion-loss filter, but it is a relatively trivial one mathematically since the active amplifiers used by Butterworth ensured that each stage individually <b>worked</b> <b>into</b> a resistive load. Butterworth's filter becomes a non-trivial example when it is implemented entirely with passive components. An even earlier filter which influenced the insertion-loss method was Norton's dual-band filter where the input of two filters are connected in parallel and designed so that the combined input presents a constant resistance. Norton's design method, together with Cauer's canonical LC networks and Darlington's theorem that only LC components were required {{in the body of the}} filter resulted in the insertion-loss method. However, ladder topology proved to be more practical than Cauer's canonical forms.|$|E
25|$|Rattans are {{extensively}} {{used for}} making baskets and furniture. When cut into sections, rattan {{can be used}} as wood to make furniture. Rattan accepts paints and stains like many other kinds of wood, so it is available in many colours, and it can be <b>worked</b> <b>into</b> many styles. Moreover, the inner core can be separated and <b>worked</b> <b>into</b> wicker.|$|E
