5|$|The Princess Theatre Society, while promising, {{failed to}} {{convince}} the Old Strathcona Foundation that it <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> profitably managing the theatre, and negotiations broke down in April 1996.

5|$|The transit circle <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> {{determining}} {{both right}} ascension and declination of a star, unlike the more simple and common transit instrument {{that can only}} determine the right ascension.

5|$|A {{multi-purpose}} breed, the Norman Cob {{was formerly}} used wherever {{there was a}} need. It was utilized {{in a variety of}} agricultural and other work by farmers, and was used by the army for pulling artillery. The postal service used it to pull mail carriages, which it <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> doing at a fast trot over bad roads for long distances. Postal workers appreciated the breed for its willingness to remain calm, stationary and tethered for long periods of time. Due to the modernization of agriculture and transport, it is now used very little in these areas.|$|E

His highest one day score, a match-winning 146, came in the 1965 Gillette Cup final against Surrey. In his previous Gillette Cup match, the quarter-final against Somerset, Boycott took 32overs to accumulate 23runs.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{represented}} {{a huge number}} of available aircraft, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) was still recovering from losses suffered at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June. While units were largely reconstituted in terms of quantity by this time, pilot quality was in clear decline. Moreover, though the overall number of planes committed to battle by 12October dwarfed any force that Japan had previously fielded in the air, the U.S. Navy's Fast Carrier Force <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> committing a much larger, significantly better-trained force.|$|E
5|$|Another {{part of the}} machine's {{exhibition}} was {{the completion of the}} knight's tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the director with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.|$|E

5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would suggest. He <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its thick frontal armour, {{flanking}} manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour, giving a tactical advantage to the Tiger II in most engagements. Moreover, the main armament of the Tiger II <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> knocking out any Allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding , well beyond the effective range of Allied tank guns.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} more ships joined the fleet {{in the early}} 1900s: Peterborough, which was {{acquired}} from the Shellharbour Steam Navigation Company, and Merimbula. At the time Merimbula was the company's finest vessel. She was a 1122-ton screw steamer which provided accommodation for 106 passengers (96 saloon and 10 second class) as well as possessing refrigerated cargo space, and she <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> between 13 and 14 knots. Unfortunately she ran aground off Beecroft Head in 1928.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Moor quickly apologized. While General Ewing {{respected}} {{the discipline of}} the German regiment, he preferred a different atmosphere in his own command, better suited to Americans. He <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> recognizing the military tradition of other units while accommodating {{the unique needs of}} his own. General Ewing was ordered to North Carolina in 1865, and was planning an expedition up the Roanoke river to co-operate with the Army of the James, when Lee surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Construction was in two phases. A {{level section}} from Tiverton to Lowdwells on the Devon/Somerset border, opened in 1814, and <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> {{carrying}} broad-beam barges, carrying up to 40tons. The Somerset section, suitable for tub-boats, which were about 20feet (6.1m) long {{and capable of}} carrying eight tons, opened in 1839. It included an inclined plane and seven boat lifts, the earliest lifts to see commercial service in the UK. The lifts predated the Anderton Boat Lift by nearly 40 years.|$|E
5|$|Despite its problems, the {{locomotive}} displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction {{from the two}} power bogies on its trial runs. When properly fired, the Leader <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> {{keeping up with the}} schedules, even running ahead on occasions. However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the Central Section of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was never used on a revenue-earning service because of the risk of failure of the valve gear and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.|$|E
50|$|The Turing machine <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> {{processing}} an unrestricted grammar, {{which further}} implies that it <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> robustly evaluating first-order logic in {{an infinite number}} of ways. This is famously demonstrated through lambda calculus.|$|R
