It was introduced as the official currency of East Germany in July 1990, replacing the East German mark (Mark der DDR), in preparation for unification on 3 October 1990.

60|$|There {{is little}} doubt that old Osborne {{believed}} all he said, and that the girls were quite earnest in their protestations of affection for Miss Swartz. People in Vanity Fair fasten on to rich folks quite naturally. If the simplest people are disposed to look not a little kindly on great Prosperity (for I defy any member of the British public to say that the notion of Wealth has not something awful and pleasing to him; and you, if you are told that the man next you at dinner has got half a million, not to look at him with a certain interest)--if the simple look benevolently on money, how much more do your old worldlings regard it! Their affections rush out to meet and <b>welcome</b> <b>money.</b> Their kind sentiments awaken spontaneously towards the interesting possessors of it. I know some respectable people who don't consider themselves at liberty to indulge in friendship for any individual who has not a certain competency, or place in society. They give a loose to their feelings on proper occasions. And the proof is, that the major part of the Osborne family, who had not, in fifteen years, been able to get up a hearty regard for Amelia Sedley, became as fond of Miss Swartz {{in the course of a}} single evening as the most romantic advocate of friendship at first sight could desire.|$|E

50|$|For each {{of these}} exceptions, GDR {{citizens}} had to apply for individual approval, which was never guaranteed. In addition, even if travel was approved, GDR travellers could exchange {{only a very small}} amount of East German Marks into Deutsche Marks (DM), thus limiting the financial resources available for them to travel to the West. This led to the West German practice of granting a small amount of DM annually (Begrüßungsgeld, or <b>welcome</b> <b>money)</b> to GDR citizens visiting West Germany and West Berlin to help alleviate this situation.|$|E

50|$|Begrüßungsgeld (<b>welcome</b> <b>money)</b> was, from 1970 until 29 December 1989, a {{gift from}} the {{government}} of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) to visitors from the German Democratic Republic (GDR - East Germany). This situation originated with the policy of the GDR government restricting the amount of East German Marks (M) that could be exchanged into Deutsche Marks (DM) by GDR citizens when on approved travel to the West. At first, the GDR allowed the exchange of 70 M annually into DM, however by 1989, this sum was reduced to 15 M annually, which greatly restricted the ability of GDR citizens to travel to the West, even if they were approved to do so.|$|E

40|$|Is there {{anything}} easier today than travelling? Everything {{is in the}} network, moving: life itself is moving on. Travelling {{is no longer the}} privilege of few persons and its words seem to stand out as global slogans. Everywhere, even in the political programs, people talk about welcome and hospitality. Yet, within the outward easiness of travel, a lot is damaged: travel often looks like a simple moving or a consumption displacement. Travel seems also to speak willingly the only unsafe language of exchange and money. Therefore it’s no wonder that other words (and this arouses suspicion) are less pronounced: the other and the self-detachment, the uniqueness and the fragility of lives, the responsibility. The freedom still. The book makes three fundamental movements on the side of community and language (Travel, community and tale), of globalisation (<b>Welcome,</b> <b>money</b> and unsafeness) and of the otherness (Travel and uniqueness). The new edition add four chapters unpublished: Eight rules for travelling; Ulysses and Abraham; The new other. Geography of the human; Travelling and logos...|$|E

50|$|Like {{the first}} film, the {{production}} of Jaws 2 was troubled. The original director, John D. Hancock, proved to be unsuitable for an action film {{and was replaced by}} Jeannot Szwarc. Scheider, who only reprised his role to end a contractual issue with Universal, was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc. Martha's Vineyard was again used as the location for the town scenes. Although some residents guarded their privacy, many islanders <b>welcomed</b> the <b>money</b> that the company was bringing. The majority of filming was at Navarre Beach, Florida, because of the warm weather and the water's depth being appropriate for the shark platform. Like the first film, shooting on water proved challenging. After spending hours anchoring the sailboats, the wind would change as they were ready to shoot, blowing the sails in the wrong direction. The corrosive effect of the saltwater damaged some equipment, including the metal parts in the sharks. As with the first film, footage of real sharks filmed by Australian divers Ron & Valerie Taylor was used for movement shots that could not be convincingly achieved using the mechanical sharks.|$|R

5000|$|One of the {{principal}} factions in the Pleasant Valley War was the Hashknife Outfit, {{a branch of the}} Aztec Land and Cattle Company in Arizona and Colorado. The company bought the Hashknife brand and some 33,000 head of cattle and 2,000 horses from main headquarters in Texas. Along with the cattle and the brand, also came a number of original Hashknife cowboys. These cowboys were notorious for their rowdy and violent behavior. Holbrook initially <b>welcomed</b> the <b>money</b> of the cattle company and its associated cowboys, until they saw what they were in for. The buckaroos of the outfit quickly gained the unsavory reputation of being the [...] "thievinist, fightinest bunch of cowboys” in the United States. Gunfights soon escalated with the locals and the cowboys for various reasons. The cowboys fought what they perceived as rustlers and thieves preying on the company's cattle, but they also targeted and harassed local ranches and farms that competed with the outfit. They also sided with the cattlemen during the war, harassing sheepherders in the region. On more than one occasion, Hashknife cowboys herded thousands of sheep into the Little Colorado River, where they drowned, or used horses to ride into a herd and scatter it. In 1886 there were twenty-six shooting deaths in Holbrook alone, which had a population of only about 250 people.|$|R

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{regulatory}} reform in financial services regulation follows a predictable pattern in democratic states. A hyperactive market generates a bubble, the bubble deflates, and much financial pain ensues for {{those individuals who}} bought {{at the top of}} the market. The financial mess brings the scrutiny of politicians, who vow 2 ̆ 2 Never again! 2 ̆ 2 A political battle ensues, with representatives of the financial services industry fighting a rearguard action to preserve its prerogatives amidst cries for the bankers 2 ̆ 7 scalps. Regulations, carefully crafted to win the last war, are promulgated. Memories fade of the foolish enthusiasm that fed the last bubble. Slowly, greed once again comes to displace fear as the primary motivating influence in the marketplace. And as night follows day, another market run-up occurs, leading to a correction, and another round of calls for retribution against the greedy moneychangers who brought on the crisis. This is a familiar story, not worth belaboring yet again, despite the opportunity afforded by the financial crisis ensuing from the collapse of the market for subprime mortgages. We had our latest bubble, followed by the market deflation, and the politicians are now responding to the calls for vengeance, and perhaps, reform. Instead of focusing narrowly on the latest iteration of this recurring pattern, in this Article I want to compare the political response to this iteration of financial meltdown with last century 2 ̆ 7 s response to the stock market crash of October 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression. Comparing the two era 2 ̆ 7 s responses affords an opportunity to explore the influence, if any, that international competition in financial services regulation might have on the political thirst for retribution. International competition in financial services was not much of a factor in the 1930 s when Franklin Delano Roosevelt pursued his New Deal agenda; American capital markets were relatively independent of financial markets in the rest of the world. Today, however, international competition has the potential to substantially constrain the regulatory decisions that Barack Obama 2 ̆ 7 s administration is currently contemplating. The question: Does international competition limit the quest for political retribution? One hypothesis: competition among jurisdictions to attract financial services providers might limit the understandable urge to make the bankers pay for causing the financial crisis. Politicians may trip over each other as they rush to punish the money changers who caused the crisis, but do they want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs? Exacting a pound of flesh may suit short-term political imperatives, but the financial services industry is an important source of tax revenues, and more importantly, campaign contributions for politicians. Sending the industry offshore would cut into a critical revenue source. And there is no shortage of jurisdictions what would <b>welcome</b> the <b>money</b> changers with open arms. The alternative hypothesis, however, is that the populist anger - particularly when it is fueled by severe economic disruption in the real economy and high unemployment - simply dominates in the political economy of modern democracies. In that scenario, the short term benefits that accrue to political actors from appealing to popular anger over the financial crisis outweigh any potential long term benefits that those actors might reap from protecting the financial sector. Which force - competition or populism - is likely to prevail in the current fight to reform financial regulation? To give away the ending, my money is on populism, not competition. But there are limits to populism 2 ̆ 7 s force...|$|R
40|$|The "Geologischen Bundesanstalt" (GBA: Austrian Geological Survey) {{still holds}} hidden treasures. A {{good example is}} a {{collection}} of bills and other papers labelled "Schloenbach-Reisestipendien-Stiftung" (SF: Schloenbach Foundation for travel grants) accidentally found in the attic. Also in the register of the archives of the GBA, many references to the SF are found. In the "Verhandlungen der Geologischen Reichsanstalt" from 1873 to 1921 the Director of the survey reported on the finances of the SF. The collapse of the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy meant the end of the SF and the similar, but younger, "Robert-Jaeger-Preisstiftung" and "Friedrich-Teller-Studienfonds". Georg Justin Carl Schloenbach was born in 1841 in Liebenhalle (Hannover, Germany). His father, Albert Schloenbach, was inspector of the saltworks. After his studies at the universities of Göttingen, Tübingen, Mü↔nchen and Berlin, Georg took his Doctor's degree in 1863 at the University of Halle. Having travelled widely in Europe, he took a position as "Sektionsgeologe" in the "Geologische Reichsanstalt" (GRA) in Vienna, refusing a position as professor at the mining academy in Peru. By 1870 he was professor at the "Deutsche Polytechnikum" (Technical University) at Prague. In the same year he died due to the extreme conditions at the military front in the Banat, where he was mapping. His broad interests included the Cretaceous and Jurassic of northern Germany, and later also the Cretaceous of Bohemia and its brachiopod faunas. He made important contributions to Bohemian stratigraphy. His manuscript maps of the Cretaceous of Bohemia can still be found in the Library of the GBA. He published many papers, 50 of which in the journals of the "Geologischen Reichsanstalt", and many others remained unfinished. In 1873, Albert Schloenbach provided a large amount of money to create a fund, the SF. The interest of the money should be used for travel grants to do fieldwork, collect fossils and study collections. At the board meeting of the GRA on the 20 th November 1877, a report was presented on the unveiling of a plaquette in memory of the deceased Schloenbach. Originally it was planned to install it in the Banat, near the place where he died, but it was considered more convenient {{to put it in the}} meeting room of the GRA, now housing a large part of the archives for the geology of raw materials, where it still can be found. The SF was a <b>welcome</b> source of <b>money</b> for research travels in the Austrian double monarchy and abroad. In the list of its beneficiaries one finds famous geologists, such as Dionys Štur, Friedrich Teller, Guido Stache, Alexander Bittner, Georg Geyer, Franz Eduard Suess, Wilhelm Hammer, Otto Ampferer, Franz Kossmat, Bruno Sander and, after 1918, as the last one Erich Spengler...|$|R
