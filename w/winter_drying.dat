Observed precipitation in the Mediterranean region is defined by wet winters and drier summers, and is characterized by substantial spatial and temporal variability. The observed drying trend since 1950 was predominantly due to <b>winter</b> <b>drying,</b> with very little contribution from the summer. However, in the CMIP 5 multimodel mean, the precipitation trend since 1950 is evenly divided throughout the seasonal cycle. This may indicate that in observation, multidecadal internal variability, particularly that associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), dominates the wintertime trend. An estimate of the observed externally forced trend shows that <b>winter</b> <b>drying</b> dominates in observations but the spatial patterns are grossly similar to the multimodel mean trend. The similarity is particularly robust in the eastern Mediterranean region, indicating a radiatively forced component being stronger there.

40|$|When a {{suspension}} drop evaporates, it leaves behind a drying stain. Examples of these drying stains encountered {{in daily life}} are coffee or tea stains on a table top, mineral rings on glassware {{that comes out of}} the dishwasher, or the salt deposits on the streets in <b>winter.</b> <b>Drying</b> stains are also present in industrial processes, for example in the printing and coating industry, where the non-uniform drying of drops can be a problem. Pattern formation by evaporation of colloidal suspension drops can however also be used as a tool to manufacture tiny structures on a scale where direct manipulation is not possible. In order to either prevent ring-stain formation or control the type of stains that are formed, one needs to understand the basic physics of evaporating drops and their internal fluid flow. In this thesis we focused on the fundamentals of drop evaporation, evaporation-driven flow in drying drops, and the subsequent particle transport and deposition. We used a simple model system: a macroscopic sessile water drop that evaporates under atmospheric conditions and contains spherical polystyrene particles. By evaporation of these colloidal suspension drops remarkable, highly-ordered drying patterns were obtained. The particle arrangement inside these patterns originates from a competition between particle diffusion and convection and therefore depends on the evaporation rate of the drop and the particle size...|$|E
40|$|The {{roles of}} {{anthropogenic}} climate change and internal climate variability in causing the Mediterranean region's late 20 th Century extended <b>winter</b> <b>drying</b> trend are examined using 19 coupled models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. The observed drying {{was influenced by the}} robust positive trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) from the 1960 s to the 1990 s. Model simulations and observations are used to assess the probable relative roles of radiative forcing, and internal variability in explaining the circulation trend that drove much of the precipitation change. Using the multi-model ensemble we assess how well the models can produce multidecadal trends of realistic magnitude, and apply signal-to-noise maximizing EOF analysis to obtain a best estimate of the models' (mean) sea-level pressure (SLP) and precipitation responses to changes in radiative forcing. The observed SLP and Mediterranean precipitation fields are regressed onto the timeseries associated with the models' externally forced pattern and the implied linear trends in both fields between 1960 and 1999 are calculated. It is concluded that the radiatively forced trends are {{a small fraction of the}} total observed trends. Instead it is argued that the robust trends in the observed NAO and Mediterranean rainfall during this period were largely due to multidecadal internal variability with a small contribution from the external forcing. Differences between the observed and NAO-associated precipitation trends are consistent with those expected as a response to radiative forcing. The radiatively forced trends in circulation and precipitation are expected to strengthen in the current century and this study highlights the importance of their contribution to future precipitation changes in the region...|$|E

40|$|The Mediterranean {{region has}} {{experienced}} persistent drying {{since the middle}} of the 20 th Century and global climate models project further drying in the future as a consequence of increasing greenhouse gases. The Mediterranean region is also known to oscillate between decades of relatively wet and dry conditions due to the strong influence of multidecadal North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). It is therefore of great importance to understand the relationship between forced long-term drying resulting from human influences and those due to natural variability. To this end, we used observations, reanalyses and comprehensive global climate models in this thesis research. The roles of anthropogenic climate change and internal climate variability in causing the Mediterranean region's late 20 th Century extended <b>winter</b> <b>drying</b> trend were examined using 20 th Century observations as well as 19 coupled climate models from the CMIP 3. The drying was strongly influenced by the robust positive trend in the NAO from the 1960 s to the 1990 s. Model simulations and observations were used to assess the probable relative roles of radiative forcing and internal variability in explaining the circulation trend that drove much of the precipitation change. It was concluded that the radiatively forced trends were {{a small fraction of the}} total observed trends. Instead it was argued that the robust trends in the observed NAO and Mediterranean rainfall during this period were largely due to multidecadal internal variability with a small contribution from the external forcing. Differences between the observed and NAO associated precipitation trends are consistent with those expected as a response to radiative forcing. The radiatively forced trends in circulation and precipitation are expected to strengthen in the current century and these results highlight the importance of their contribution to future precipitation changes in the region. The Mediterranean precipitation climatology and trend were further examined by comparing the newest generation of global climate models (CMIP 5) used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, to the previous generation (CMIP 3) and to observations over the latter half of the 20 th Century for both the summer and winter half years. The observed drying trend since 1950 was predominantly due to <b>winter</b> <b>drying,</b> with very little contribution from the summer. However, in the CMIP 5 multimodel mean, the precipitation trend since 1950 is evenly divided throughout the seasonal cycle. This may indicate that in observation, multidecadal internal variability, particularly that associated with the NAO, dominates the wintertime trend. An estimate of the observed externally forced trend showed that <b>winter</b> <b>drying</b> dominated in observations but the spatial patterns were grossly similar to the multimodel mean trend. The similarity was particularly robust in the eastern Mediterranean region, indicating a radiatively forced component being stronger there. These results also revealed modest improvement for the CMIP 5 multimodel ensemble in representation of the observed six-month winter and summer climatology. We further explored the detailed mechanisms leading to the NAO-associated precipitation change, such as the role of the change in mean circulation versus that of the storm tracks in the regional moisture budget, which had not been investigated previously. We employed a moisture budget analysis using 15 CMIP 5 models and the ERA-Interim Reanalysis to investigate the relationship between the NAO and the various moisture budget terms for the six-month winter and summer. Compared with the ERA-Interim, the models performed well in their simulation of the relationship between the naturally varying NAO and the large-scale moisture budget. Our results indicated that the shift in the midlatitude transient eddies induced modest moisture convergence, rather than divergence, over the Mediterranean under a positive NAO. The reduction in precipitation in this region during a positive NAO was dominated by the mean moisture divergence, which opposed the transient contribution. There were significant differences between the patterns of NAO-induced moisture budget anomaly and changes due to external radiative forcing. Under radiative forcing there was enhanced evaporation over the Mediterranean Sea, Italy and eastern Europe and drying by the shift in the wintertime storms over nearly all of Europe and the Mediterranean. Under a positive phase of the NAO, on the other hand, there was modest reduction in evaporation and wetting by the storms over the Mediterranean, and drying over northern Europe. The dependence of the Mediterranean moisture budget on the NAO was similarly explored in the summer half of the year and in this season the models exhibited more disagreement with observations, but otherwise showed the similar results as winter. The stronger anthropogenic induced drying signal over the eastern Mediterranean provided a basis to examine the possible cause and impact of the recent severe and persistent drought in Syria that occurred directly prior to the uprising of 2011. The drought devastated Syrian agriculture, resulting in food shortages, widespread unemployment, the collapse of rural social structure and a mass migration of agricultural refugees to Syria's urban areas. Anger at the government's failure to ameliorate conditions was one spark for the uprising that evolved into civil war. We found that though droughts occur periodically in Syria due to natural causes it is likely that the recent drought was more extreme due to the century long drying trend caused by increased radiative forcing. It was estimated that the anthropogenic trend made a drought of such severity several times more likely. Droughts as persistent as the recent one are projected to be commonplace in a future warmer world...|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} can represent {{a significant step}} forward due to the acquisition and analysis of historical time series of higher than usual frequency data (hourly), which allows to perform far more robust and significant statistical analysis of the variability and tendencies of the extreme storms, {{as well as the}} droughts. Two long historical series of hourly precipitation data were digitalized starting from analogical records, collected in Tuscany, Italy, one next to the coastline, the other over the inland mountains, covering 1945 - 2002 and 1930 - 2005, respectively. Data quality as well as homogeneity were checked by means of few statistical tests, such as the run test, including the comparison with data colleted at nearby rain gauges. The analysis of the overcomes of specific hourly thresholds, computed {{on the basis of the}} reference period 1961 - 1990, has shown significant increases at both sites in the latest 15 years with regards to the previous times, as well as an increased seasonality, resulting in the concentration of the most intense and extreme rainfalls in September-November. A significant decrease of the number of rainy hours was observed at both sites, mainly due to <b>winter</b> <b>drying</b> and, limited to the mountainous gauge, a relevant increase of the average hourly precipitation intensity. The analysis of reference percentiles for the hourly precipitation, such as, 99 °, 99, 5 ° e 99, 9 °, has shown positive trends at both sites, as well as the precipitation series consisting of 3, 6, 12 and 24 consecutive hours events.

40|$|According {{to climate}} {{projections}} {{for the end}} of the twenty-first century, regional responses to global warming include a strong and widespread drying over the northern Mediterranean, particularly intense in summer. Many authors have reported observed negative precipitation trends in the last decades and have considered them evidences that the projected drying is already detectable. Because of the strong decadal variability of precipitation series, however, it is not straightforward to discern whether observed trends are attributable to an external signal or whether they are consistent with internal variability alone. In order to assess if precipitation series in the northern Mediterranean region are compatible with the presence of a persistent signal, we examine the sensitivity of trend estimations to the choice of time interval: since internal variability is expected to be random, the magnitude of natural precipitation changes varies greatly when estimated for intervals with different arbitrary initial and final years. Instead, series under the influence of a persistent signal exhibit trends of similar magnitude in a wide range of consecutive intervals. In this regard, our results indicate that only in winter and from mid-twentieth century onwards the evolution of precipitation series is consistent with what one would expect if a persistent signal was superimposed to internal variability. Trends for other seasons and periods, instead, are sensitive to the choice of time interval. In addition, we find that the recent observed <b>winter</b> <b>drying</b> trends are largely explainable by an upward trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) observed in the last decades of the twentieth century. The role played by climate change and internal variability in the observed winter northern Mediterranean drying is examined using historical (forced) and pre-industrial (unforced) CMIP 5 climate simulations. For area-averaged precipitation we find that neither historical nor pre-industrial simulations contain trends as strong as the observed ones. We consider two explanations for this result: (1) observed trends have a forced origin but the forcing (or the response to the forcing) is underestimated in historical simulations, and (2) observed trends are mainly natural but climate models underestimate the range of internal variability of northern Mediterranean precipitation. Consistent with the fact that the NAO plays the main role in the evolution of northern Mediterranean precipitation, observed NAO trends are also stronger than those present in historical and pre-industrial simulations. Considering trends at grid-point scale, instead, observed precipitation trends are within the spread of unforced simulated trends and, therefore, no drying signal is detectable...|$|E
