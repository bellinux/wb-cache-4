25|$|Much {{of the use}} of and {{research}} on interactive writing takes place in the field of second language learning, <b>whether</b> <b>students</b> are learning English or another world language (Chinese, French, Spanish, etc.). Dialogue journals are reported as valuable instructional tools in language classes with children and adolescents, with university students, and with adults in adult education programs. The writing can take place between students and the teacher or between language learners and native language speakers. The purposes might be overall language acquisition, development of writing abilities, extension of learning of the language beyond time in class, promotion of ability to transition to academic writing in university classes, and easing of the trauma of transition to life in the United States.|$|E

"Among other reasons, {{we believe}} [...] rankings: imply a false {{precision}} and authority {{that is not}} warranted by the data they use; obscure important differences in educational mission in aligning institutions on a single scale; say nothing or very little about <b>whether</b> <b>students</b> are actually learning at particular colleges or universities; encourage wasteful spending and gamesmanship in institutions' pursuing improved rankings; overlook {{the importance of a}} student in making education happen and overweight the importance of a university's prestige in that process; and degrade for students the educational value of the college search process. We ask you to make the following two commitments: 1. Refuse to fill out the U.S. News and World Report reputational survey. 2. Refuse to use the rankings in any promotional efforts on behalf of your college or university, and more generally, refuse to refer to the rankings as an indication of the quality of your college or university." ...|$|E
6000|$|A third charge {{brought against}} Browning's art {{is that he}} makes all his {{characters}} talk [...] "Browningese"; that is, that he endows all of them {{with the power to}} use such words and sentences and thought processes as are natural to him and to him only. Mr. Stedman in emphasizing this characteristic of the poet says of Pippa Passes: [...] "The usual fault is present--the characters, <b>whether</b> <b>students,</b> peasants, or soldiers, all talk like sages; Pippa reasons like a Paracelsus in pantalettes." [...] It is, of course, obvious at the first glance that {{there is a lack of}} verisimilitude in Pippa's rich and beautiful soliloquies. Certainly no fourteen-year-old mill girl could so describe a sunrise, or play so brilliantly with a sunbeam in a water-basin, or outline so cleverly the stories of the happiest four in Asolo. The same is true of Phene's long speech to Jules; no untutored girl brought up in degradation, could present such thoughts in such words. When we analyze Browning's way of presenting a character, however, we find that the lack of verisimilitude is usually external and has to do chiefly with expression. Browning works on the fundamental assumption that he has a poetic right to make all sorts of people articulate. He lends his mind out in the service of their thoughts and feelings. He makes people reveal themselves by putting into words their elusive, dim, tangled, and even unrecognized motives and hopes and joys and despairs. He sums up in the speeches all the potentialities of the situation. All the significance latent in the type of character and environment is somehow heightened and symbolized. All this is put in his own highly individual diction. Yet it can hardly be said that he violates poetic realism in the deeper sense, for he never puts a halo around a situation, never goes counter to its potentialities. Instead he strikes fire from it. He shows what is actually in the situation, but at white heat and laid bare to its center. When this method has once been recognized, discomfort on the score of lack of verisimilitude practically disappears, and the reader yields himself to the joy of the rich, subtle, and stimulating analysis.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine what specific types of criticism students perceive as being most helpful, <b>whether</b> <b>student</b> perceptions of helpfulness in different types of criticism vary according to individual levels of speech anxiety or exhibitionism, and <b>whether</b> <b>student</b> perceptions of helpfulness in different types of criticism vary according to study and instructor sex differences. The subjects were 309 college students enrolled in a basic speech communication course. Ten of the classes were taught by male instructors, ten by female instructors. The subjects were administered a revised version of the Personal Report of Confidence as a Speaker. The results indicated that students did not have a general preference for criticism of delivery or content. They apparently felt that both types of criticism were equally important. Also, student preferences indicated that instructors should include both positive and negative comments in their criticism. (NR) ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{discover}} how often visual, auditory, and/or kinesthetic senses are used when students of low-incidence special education receive instruction. Low-incidence disabilities are physical and intellectual abnormalities that severely impact an individual’s ability to function independently in daily life. The research was completed through weekly observations in a classroom designed for students with low-incidence disabilities, including autism and traumatic brain injuries. Throughout the school day, it was noted <b>whether</b> the <b>students</b> reacted to the instruction using their auditory, visual, and/or kinesthetic sense. The students’ visual response was measured by marking <b>whether</b> the <b>student</b> made eye contact with the educator; the auditory response by marking <b>whether</b> the <b>student</b> verbally responded to teacher prompts; and the kinesthetic response by marking <b>whether</b> the <b>student</b> physically followed the teacher’s directions. It was found that students of low-incidence disabilities responded most frequently when the kinesthetic sense was engaged. This means that the students physically followed the teacher’s directions more frequently than made eye contact with the educator or verbally responded to teacher prompts...|$|R
