Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting <b>worked</b> <b>up</b> <b>about</b> possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to stay behind.|$|E

Andy sends Darryl a text that only reads [...] "Megan Fox", a reference to the actress. Creed notes that he understands, but cannot speak, Pirate slang. Andy attempts to motivate Michael with a pep talk taken from the 1979 movie Rocky II.

Fans have speculated that this may be a reference to the third season episode [...] "The Coup", which used the game as a plot device.|$|E

[...] In meeting the third of these, Lamont had to overcome the resistance of the prime minister and the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, who told Lamont: [...] "I can't see what you are so <b>worked</b> <b>up</b> <b>about.</b> We are in the ERM. What difference does it make if it is in the Treaty?" [...] Lamont decided to ignore their objections. At the next negotiating meeting on the treaty, he told his fellow European finance ministers that Britain would not accept membership of the ERM as a treaty obligation. As a result, the meeting agreed to remove it.|$|E

He summed up his displeasure by stating, [...] ""Sunshine" [...] has nothing to offer, and this {{nothing is going to}} be offered relentlessly and earnestly, like a holy missive." [...] In a {{primarily}} negative review, Joanne Kaufman writing for The Wall Street Journal, called the film [...] "a warmed-over stew of sci-fi and gothic horror". Unenthusiastic, she affirmed, [...] "There are the predictable malfunctions that compromise the space craft, the banal speechifying about the fate of mankind, the issue of who will live and who will die. Who cares? The characters are so sketchily drawn that it's hard to keep them straight, let alone get <b>worked</b> <b>up</b> <b>about</b> their survival." [...] Also describing an unfavourable opinion, Marrit Ingman of The Austin Chronicle professed the film exhibited [...] "problems which arise in the film's third act" [...] which causes [...] "a profoundly implausible plot turn that sends the movie skidding into bogeyman horror. It cheapens the sentiment, and the film doesn't recover." ...|$|E

[...] Daniel and Imogen clashed again when she dropped her birthday dress after he ran into her on his skateboard. Daniel bought her a new dress, {{but it was too}} big for Imogen and she refused to accept it. Later that day, Imogen accidentally crushed Daniel's skateboard during a driving lesson, but Daniel believed it was her way of getting revenge for the dress. Imogen developed feelings for Daniel after they teamed up for a community project. Phillipps commented that Daniel and Imogen had developed [...] "a great chummy friendship", so he thought Daniel would {{be surprised to learn that}} Imogen has feelings for him.|$|E

50|$|Combinatorics in Oxford in the 1970s was {{dominated}} by matroid theory, dueto the influence of Dominic Welsh and Aubrey William Ingleton.Much of Seymour's early <b>work,</b> <b>up</b> to <b>about</b> 1980, was on matroid theory, andincluded three important matroid results: his D.Phil. thesison matroids with the max-flow min-cut property (for which he won his firstFulkerson prize); a characterization by excluded minors of the matroidsrepresentable over the three-element field; and a theorem that all regular matroids consist of graphic and cographic matroids pieced together in asimple way (which won his first Pólya prize). There were several othersignificant papers from this period: a paper with Welsh on the criticalprobabilities for bond percolation on the square lattice; a paper in whichthe cycle double cover conjecture was introduced; a paper onedge-multicolouring of cubic graphs, which foreshadowsthe matching lattice theorem of László Lovász; a paper proving that allbridgeless graphs admit nowhere-zero 6-flows, a step towards Tutte's nowhere-zero 5-flow conjecture;and a paper solving thetwo-paths problem, which was the engine behind much of Seymour'sfuture work.|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} {{measurements}} of the prototypes of readout electronics for the lumi-nosity detector (LumiCal) at the ILC, developed within the EUDET consortium, are presented. The proposed front–end (FE) architecture comprising switched-gain preamplifier, pole-zero cancellation circuit (PZC) and switched-gain shaper is described. The preamplifier works {{for a wide range}} of input capacitance values up to 100 pF. The input charge dynamic range is 0. 4 fC to 10 pC and covers more than 4 orders of magnitude. The circuit has to be fast with a peaking time of about 70 ns. The prototype ASICs are designed and fabricated in 0. 35 µm CMOS tech-nology. The results of measurements on gain, noise, high input rate performance and crosstalk are presented. In parallel to the FE ASIC the digitizer ASIC (ADC) is also developed and the prototypes are fabricated in 0. 35 µm CMOS technology. The design of the pipeline 10 bit ADC with 1. 5 -stage architecture is described. The functional ADC unit <b>works</b> <b>up</b> to <b>about</b> 35 MHz sampling frequency.

Even then, there are exceptions; Gedamondas is low-tech, but the Gedamondans can use naturally occurring steam from their volcanic vents, and the Agitar, who can generate thousands of volts of electricity can electrocute people in any hex, regardless of tech level. Also, while chemical firearms do not, as a general rule, work in nontech hexes, matches and certain kinds of chemical explosives will, although the explosives can be dangerously unstable in nontech hexes. In some of the hexes, however, the Well World computer allows the inhabitants access to limited manipulation of reality, or “magic” (this is most commonly in low- and semi-tech hexes, but high-tech magic hexes have been mentioned).
