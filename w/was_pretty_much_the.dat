Stations tried to {{be all things to all}} people, and specialised programming was not really thought about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s).

25|$|Ahead {{of their}} first final against {{cross-town}} rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It {{was also the first}} time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant Jeremy Cameron outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the Adelaide Crows by 6 goals, with Franklin and Tom Papley kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same in the preliminary final against the Geelong Cats at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2 point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.|$|E

According to Pahls, [...] "For years, [...] had few friends and no sex life; {{he was forced to}} spend many hours at school or on the job, and when he came home he 'escaped' by drawing home-made comics. When he suddenly found a group of friends that would accept him for himself, as he did in Cleveland in 1964, the 'compensation' factor went out of his drawing, and this <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> end of Fritz's impetus." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} the lead vocals, Swivel decided {{to rework the}} 1980s sound on the snares as they were originally very tight. He therefore added a gated reverb for the snap sound which was long and drawn‑out snap sound. He also subbed in an additional kick underneath to add some real oomph to the bottom. Owing to the work Swivel had accomplished during production, the final mix took only a few hours. He said: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} tracks, but I just enjoyed it, to be honest. I knew how I wanted it to sound, and it <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> last song we cut; a lot of the mixing was nailed in the production as well, which helped. Dream did a great job producing this track." [...] The bar one guitar track of [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] was entirely programmed. Similarly, the live drum section in the hook was actually done with programmed drums. Once the mixing was over, Swivel's impression were as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E

[...] "By that point, iPod had become the world's de facto digital entertainment device," [...] he recalled. [...] "To beat it, Microsoft needed to offer something that would make Apple's device look pitifully old-fashioned. The Zune HD didn't do that. Its design marked it as being different from an iPod, but that <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> only difference. There was no reason to buy the Zune unless you wanted to stand apart from the Apple cult. And there was a cost to standing apart from Apple: Because of its popularity, there were millions of apps and accessories for the iPod. As good as it was, the Zune HD couldn’t match Apple’s sheer market power." [...] Nevertheless, it was an effective enough product that Manjoo had started using it as his primary music player." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the film's release, Bambi {{received}} mixed reviews from the critics, mainly {{because of the lack of}} fantasy elements in the film and objection towards a dramatic story of animals and their struggle to survive in the woods and avoid the threat of humans. Hunters spoke out against the movie, and in a 1942 edition of the magazine Outdoor Life, editor Raymond Brown wrote that the film was [...] "... the worst insult ever offered in any form to American sportsmen." [...] The New York Times claimed, [...] "In the search for perfection, Mr. Disney has come perilously close to tossing away his whole world of cartoon fantasy." [...] Film critic Manny Farber called it [...] "... entirely unpleasant ..." [...] and agreed with The New York Times statement saying, [...] "In an effort to trump the realism of flesh and blood movies, he [...] has given up fantasy, which <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> magic element". Even Disney's daughter Diane complained, saying that Bambi's mother did not need to die. When Walt claimed that he was only following the book, Diane protested, saying that he had taken other liberties before and that Walt Disney could do whatever he wanted.|$|E

Former guitarist and primary songwriter Ryan Ross told NME the band had [...] "nine or ten new songs going right now," [...] which picked up in the same direction of Pretty. Odd. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same with the last record," [...] bassist Jon Walker said. [...] "We haven't stopped writing songs since we stopped recording Pretty. Odd., because {{we have a lot to}} write about [...] It's sounding 'pretty awesome,' which is probably what we're going to call the next record," [...] Ross joked. [...] "We've got quite a few new ideas and songs we've been working on, and we're hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year." [...] The article explained that Walker said the band would be taking time off for the holidays and then re-entering the studio to record new music. In June 2009, singer Brendon Urie revealed the band had been writing for [...] "roughly half a year now" [...] at Ross' Topanga Canyon, California home, and continued to take the band [...] "further down the sun-dappled, retro-pop path [...] began exploring on Pretty. Odd.": [...] "We've always been a pop band. We've always been fans of pop music, whether it's The Beatles – which is, like, the beginning of pop music – we've always been fans of good catchy melodies and lighthearted music." [...] Spencer Smith, drummer, added, [...] "We moved to California since the last record, so that's inspiration. We started surfing, too, so maybe we'll get a little Beach Boys vibe on this one." [...] During this time, Smith moved in with Urie, while Ross began writing his own material with Walker at his home.|$|E

The guests sat so far apart, and the music made so much noise, that conversation was nearly out of the question; though the King and the Dauphin exchanged a few words {{in the course of the}} evening.
