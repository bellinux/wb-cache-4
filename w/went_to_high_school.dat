5000|$|Mac & Devin <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> was panned by critics. JP DelaCuesta of AllHipHop {{gave the}} film a 3/10, saying [...] "There’s {{no other way}} to say this except Mac and Devin <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> is bad - plain and simple. The {{on-screen}} collaboration between these two Hip-Hop heavyweights is a joke, and for their sakes, hopefully a joke that they and everyone involved with Mac and Devin were in on. At the end of the day, the only thing that Mac and Devin <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> proves is that we need How High 2, and we need it bad!" [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "The protégé completes his evolution when he uses his high-school valedictorian speech to perform “Young, Wild & Free,” the hit single from Mac & Devin <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> <b>High</b> <b>School.</b> “Young, Wild & Free” is everything Mac & Devin <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> should be but isn’t: fun, light, goofy, entertaining, and young. In moments like this, the movie possesses a strange, disarming innocence, but it forces audiences to endure a punishing gauntlet of misogyny and non-starting comedy to get to that middling moment of moderate enjoyment." ...|$|R

5|$|Writer and {{producer}} Bob Gale conceived the idea after he visited {{his parents in}} St. Louis, Missouri {{after the release of}} Used Cars. Searching their basement, Gale found his father's high school yearbook and discovered he was president of his graduating class. Gale thought about the president of his own graduating class, who was someone {{he had nothing to do}} with. Gale wondered whether he would have been friends with his father if they <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> together. When he returned to California, he told Robert Zemeckis his new concept. Zemeckis subsequently thought of a mother claiming she never kissed a boy at school when, in fact, she was highly promiscuous. The two took the project to Columbia Pictures, and made a development deal for a script in September 1980.|$|E
