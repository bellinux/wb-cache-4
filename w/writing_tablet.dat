Berthe van Regemorter identified a similar figure in the Neo-Hittite Stela of Tarhunpiyas (Musée du Louvre, AO 1922.), dating to the late 8th century BCE, who is seen holding what may be a form of tablature with a unique button closure. <b>Writing</b> <b>tablets</b> of ivory were found in the ruins of Sargon's palace in Nimrud.
