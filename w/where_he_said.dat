5|$|His father, Hyman Krustofski, was a rabbi and {{strongly}} opposed young Herschel's wish {{to become a}} comedian; he wanted the boy to go to yeshiva instead. Krusty did attend the school, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he made the other students laugh by doing funny impressions of his father. As a result, Krusty became a slapstick comedian behind his father's back. One night, Krusty performed at a rabbi's convention and a rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. Rabbi Krustofski, {{who was in the}} audience, recognized him, was furious and disowned his son, and now it has been 25 years since they have seen or spoken to each other.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few days PATU and RLI patrols arrested five insurgents, two of whom were deserters. One of these {{defected}} and agreed to guide the security forces to the ZIPRA base camp, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> there were two guerrillas waiting for him to return, unaware of his desertion and subsequent defection. Shown the way by the ex-cadre an RLI patrol attacked the camp on 24 January and killed one of the two; the other fled and was captured a few days later. The members of Gang 1 were now all killed or captured while only one was outstanding from Gang 2. Gangs 3 and 4 were revealed to be near Sipolilo on 21 January by a black shopkeeper, and two Gang 3 members were encountered by Henson's troop on 24 January. Henson himself opened fire and killed one, who it emerged was the Gang 3 commander. His troop then followed about 10 men until 26 January, when they lost the insurgents' tracks.|$|E

25|$|A {{few weeks}} later, Tebbit gave an {{interview}} to John Mortimer for The Spectator <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> of Thatcher: It's a question of her leadership when our aims aren't clearly defined. When people understand what she's doing there's {{a good deal of}} admiration for her energy and resolution and persistence, even from those people who don't agree with her. Now there's a perception that we don't know where we're going so those same qualities don't seem so attractive. Thatcher disagreed and her biographer claims she was suspicious of Tebbit's motives. Furthermore, Thatcher commissioned the firm Young and Rubicam to carry out their own polling, which concluded that Thatcher's leadership was not the problem. Throughout the rest of 1986 and into the 1987 election, Thatcher continued to use Young and Rubicam, which eventually caused tensions with Tebbit during the election campaign.|$|E

In the late 1920s, he became interested in the teachings of Gurdjieff and Alfred Richard Orage, whom he met in New York City while studying at the Academy.
