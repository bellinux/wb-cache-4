25|$|As the {{government}} enacts laws limiting operating areas of non-Mandarin-speaking taxi drivers, a Cantonese-speaking driver (Leung Kin-ping) finds himself marginalised as {{he fails to}} pass the national Mandarin proficiency test. The driver's wife instructs him to stop using Cantonese with their son, Kongson, so that the boy <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> at his Mandarin medium of instruction school. A series of vignettes further illustrate the increasing dominance of Mandarin and Leung's struggle adjusting. He is unable to make himself understood by his Mandarin GPS unit and is ridiculed by a passenger for it. Two Mandarin-speaking fares opt to take another cab when they realise he cannot speak the language. One of his passengers, an office lady (Catherine Chau), is fired from her job for failing to clearly explain something to a client in Mandarin.|$|E

500|$|In the United States {{the cost}} of {{certification}} for mass-produced items is typically minuscule, and is usually more than offset by the advantages of being certified. In 1975 The New York Times estimated the cost per item for obtaining kosher certification at 6.5 millionths of a cent ($0.000000065) per item for a General Foods frozen-food item. According to a 2005 report by Burns & McDonnell, most US national certifying agencies are non-profit, only charging for supervision and on-site work, for which the on-site supervisor [...] "typically makes less per visit than an auto mechanic does per hour". However, re-engineering an existing manufacturing process can be costly. Certification usually leads to increased revenues by opening up additional markets to Jews who keep kosher, Muslims who keep halal, Seventh-day Adventists who keep the main laws of Kosher Diet, vegetarians, and the lactose-intolerant who wish to avoid dairy products (products that are reliably certified as pareve meet this criterion). According to the Orthodox Union, {{one of the largest}} kashrut organizations in the United States, [...] "when positioned next to a competing non-kosher brand, a kosher product <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> by 20%".|$|E
2500|$|Strategy C weakly dominates {{strategy}} D. [...] Consider playing C: If one's opponent plays C, {{one gets}} 1; if one's opponent plays D, one gets 0. [...] Compare this to D, where one gets 0 regardless. [...] Since in one case, one does better by playing C instead of D and never does worse, C weakly dominates D. [...] Despite this, [...] is a Nash equilibrium. [...] Suppose both players choose D. [...] Neither player will do any better by unilaterally deviatingif a player switches to playing C, {{they will still}} get 0. [...] This satisfies the requirements of a Nash equilibrium.

2500|$|Defection by {{the first}} player is the unique subgame perfect {{equilibrium}} and required by any Nash equilibrium, it can be established by backward induction. [...] Suppose two players reach {{the final round of}} the game; the second player <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> by defecting and taking a slightly larger share of the pot. [...] Since we suppose the second player will defect, the first player does better by defecting in the second to last round, taking a slightly higher payoff than she would have received by allowing the second player to defect in the last round. [...] But knowing this, the second player ought to defect in the third to last round, taking a slightly higher payoff than he would have received by allowing the first player to defect in the second to last round. [...] This reasoning proceeds backwards through the game tree until one concludes that the best action is for the first player to defect in the first round. [...] The same reasoning can apply to any node in the game tree.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2014, New York Representative Carolyn B. Maloney visited the Chengdu Panda Base in Sichuan, China and {{announced}} her plan to bring giant pandas to New York City. Initially, she aimed to exhibit them at the Central Park Zoo, though switched her attention to Bronx after deciding the 6.5-acre zoo didn't {{have the resources to}} care for the animals. Maloney and her supporters, which include Maurice R. Greenberg, Newt Gingrich, and John A. Catsimatidis, have been met with many obstacles throughout their campaign. Initially, the largest issues were the lack of support from Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Hall, and Chinese officials insisting that no more pandas be brought to the United States. However, in October 2015, Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai announced that China was willing to enter preliminary talks with New York over the matter, and soon after de Blasio and City Hall signed a letter appealing to Chinese officials, which was drafted by Maloney in 2014. Despite her efforts, Maloney's campaign still has yet to overcome two critical steps in acquiring pandas: funding and the zoo's consent. Both de Blasio and the Wildlife Conservation Society refuse to fund the project, not wanting taxpayer or vital zoo money to go towards the highly expensive project. David Towne, chairman of the American-based Giant Panda Conservation Foundation, estimated that the cost of bringing pandas to NYC would be around $50-million. The foundation has also said that the cost of keeping just one animal is about $1-million a year, including food, trainers, and habitat upkeep. Additionally, China loans out their pandas for a hefty fee. A study published by the Washington Post in 2005 found that the four U.S. zoos holding pandas (Memphis Zoo, San Diego Zoo, Smithsonian National Zoological Park, and Zoo Atlanta) had spent $33-million more on the animals than revenue made off of them between 2000 and 2003. Despite the figures, Maloney believes pandas in NYC <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> since the city has a higher population than those four cities combined, and received a record-breaking 56.4-million visitors in 2014. Still, the WCS continues to steer away from the aspect of bringing in pandas. In 2014, a senior official from the WCS said Maloney's campaign had reached [...] "a new level of absurdity" [...] when it was announced she intended to bring a Chinese delegation to the Central Park Zoo and, in November 2015, Jim Breheny, WCS Executive Vice President and Bronx Zoo Director, released a statement saying: ...|$|E
