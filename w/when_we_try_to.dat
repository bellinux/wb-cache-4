25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; I know of no one who has said that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> produce a vacuum.|$|E

If a function is known in advance to be Riemann integrable, then this technique will give the correct value of the integral. But under these conditions the indicator function [...] will appear to be integrable on [...] with integral equal to one: Every endpoint of every subinterval will be a rational number, so the function will always be evaluated at rational numbers, and hence it will appear to always equal one.

2500|$|Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda expounded on the words, [...] "Then the Lord God formed ( [...] , wa-yitzer) man," [...] in [...] Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda {{taught that}} the word וַיִּיצֶר, wa-yitzer is written with two yuds (...) to show that God created people with two inclinations (yetzerim), one good and one evil. Rav Nahman bar Isaac demurred, arguing that {{according}} to this logic, animals, of which [...] writes , wa-yitzer with a single yud, should have no evil inclination (yetzer hara), but we see that they injure, bite, and kick, plainly evincing an evil inclination. Rather, Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi explained that the two yuds by saying, [...] "Woe is me because of my Creator (yotzri), woe is me because of my evil inclination (yitzri)!" [...] Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi thus indicated that the two yuds indicate the human condition, where God punishes us for giving in to our evil inclination, but our evil inclination tempts us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> resist. Alternatively, Rabbi Jeremiah ben Eleazar explained that the two yuds reflect that God created two countenances in the first man, one man and one woman, back to back, as [...] says, [...] "Behind and before have You formed me." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be definite, {{as to what}} we {{mean when}} we say that this or that is [...] "the Good," [...] we find {{ourselves}} involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and {{was said to be}} a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case — or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall rouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to [...] "values" [...] — that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects — lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to [...] "values" [...] lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has [...] "value", we are giving expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different.|$|E
