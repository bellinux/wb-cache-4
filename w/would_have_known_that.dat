5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> even if all the boats were fully occupied, {{more than a thousand}} people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E
25|$|Since {{both the}} accused persons read some tracts after they ordered them, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the tracts had seditious tendencies. The tracts {{were easy to}} read and a quick flip through them would easily give the reader a gist of their message.|$|E
25|$|The most absurd {{part of this}} absurd fraud (at least, to English eyes) is one which, oddly enough, has {{received}} comparatively little comment. I mean {{the point at which}} the Mayor asked for a warrant, and the Captain pointed to the bayonets of his soldiery and said, 'These are my authority'. One would have thought anyone <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> no soldier would talk like that.|$|E

25|$|Inspector Kelsey {{interviews}} {{everyone and}} Adam Goodman reveals his true identity (undercover British agent {{posing as a}} gardener) to Miss Bulstrode. Jennifer Sutcliffe, an expert tennis player, complains that her racquet feels unbalanced and writes to her mother asking for a new one. Meanwhile, she swaps racquets with Julia Upjohn, who prefers Jennifer's as it was refurbished recently. Later a strange woman arrives and gives Jennifer a new racquet, saying it is a gift from her Aunt Gina. The woman takes the old racquet (actually Julia's racquet). Julia later realises that Aunt Gina <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Jennifer's racquet had been refurbished and restrung recently, so {{she would not have}} assumed the problem is in the strings. Soon enough, Jennifer's aunt writes that she did not send the new racquet.|$|E
500|$|Anderson stated {{she was in}} Berlin {{to inform}} Princess Irene of Prussia (sister of Tsarina Alexandra and cousin of Tsar Nicholas II) of her survival.

500|$|... "Cocoon" [...] {{is a song}} based {{around a}} bassline and beats that [...] "sound like {{fingertips}} on skin". Discussing the glitch sound of the song, Björk said: [...] "when you take technology and use the areas where it breaks, where it's faulty, you're entering a mystery zone where you can't control it." [...] Björk's whispered vocals in [...] "Cocoon" [...] were described as [...] "near-cracking falsetto and a breathy ecstasy". Lyrically, for Michael Cragg from The Guardian newspaper, [...] "it feels almost intrusive, like reading someone's diary as they write about a new love", as Björk had just started the relationship with Barney. Its lyrics are set between metaphor, with her singing [...] "who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> a boy like him would have entered me lightly, restoring my blisses" [...] and over-sharing, whilst also stating [...] "He slides inside, half awake, half asleep... gorgeousness, he's still inside me".|$|E

2500|$|...From sample {{pictures}} {{shown on}} the McFarlane message board, {{it can be seen}} that the base of Gretzky's figure said [...] "Wayne Gretzky, 1997 Farewell.". Most hockey fans <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Gretzky had retired on April 18, 1999.|$|E
2500|$|According to the New York Times, if Clinton was a {{recipient}} of classified emails, [...] "it {{is not clear that}} she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> they contained government secrets, since they were not marked classified." [...] The newspaper reported that [...] "most specialists believe the occasional appearance of classified information in the Clinton account was probably of marginal consequence." [...] Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, said that inadvertent [...] "spillage" [...] of classified information into an unclassified realm is a common occurrence.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 October, a {{group of}} protesters who were arrested on the bridge {{filed a lawsuit against}} the city, alleging that {{officers}} had violated their constitutional rights by luring them into a trap and then arresting them. In June 2012, a federal judge ruled that the protesters had not received sufficient warning of arrest pending entrance onto the Brooklyn Bridge. Although video evidence showed the police warning protesters by bullhorn, after reviewing it, Judge Jed S. Rakoff sided with plaintiffs, saying, [...] "a reasonable officer in the noisy environment defendants occupied <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> a single bull horn could not reasonably communicate a message to 700 demonstrators".|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> loyalty {{does not}} consist in outrage and murder, sir," [...] I answered, [...] "nor in the ridiculing of them. And brutes cannot be loyal save through interest." ...|$|R
6000|$|Knight continued, {{putting away}} the case: 'I felt as anybody {{naturally}} <b>would</b> <b>have,</b> you <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> my words on your choice {{the other day}} were invidious and unfair, and thought an apology should take a practical shape.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Some historians dispute Stephens's {{interpretation}} of the Conference. Michael Vorenberg writes that Lincoln <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> a constitutional amendment cannot be [...] "prospectively" [...] ratified, and therefore [...] "the story is suspicious at best." [...] Vorenberg suggests that although Lincoln might have expressed his preference for [...] "gradual emancipation", {{he would not have}} sought to portray this option as legally or politically possible. William C. Harris also doubts the 'prospective ratification' story, on the grounds that this offer is not mentioned by Campbell in his 1865 letter to Curtis. James McPherson suggests: [...] "It is probable that Stephens was reading his own viewpoint into Seward's remarks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Semmelweis's {{views were}} much more favorably {{received}} in the United Kingdom than on the continent, but he was more often cited than understood. The British consistently regarded Semmelweis as having supported their theory of contagion. A typical example was W. Tyler Smith, who claimed that Semmelweis [...] "made out very conclusively" [...] that [...] "miasms derived from the dissecting room will excite puerperal disease." [...] One {{of the first to}} respond to Semmelweis's 1848 communications was James Young Simpson, who wrote a stinging letter. Simpson surmised that the British obstetrical literature must be totally unknown in Vienna, or Semmelweis <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the British had long regarded childbed fever as contagious and would have employed chlorine washing to protect against it.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the play}} deals with {{political}} themes, politics {{is not the}} play's purpose, nor is a critique of politics. The play has obvious political connections as title refers to the rape case of Colonel Francis Charteris, dubbed [...] "Rapemaster General of Great Britain". However, the play is more focused on morality {{and there is no}} direct correlation between any of the characters and Charteris. Of course, the contemporary audiences <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> there was a connection, as Bertrand Goldgar argues, [...] "there {{can be little doubt that}} the audiences at the Haymarket in June would have immediately connected Fielding's Rape upon Rape with the Charteris affair." [...] However, the use of [...] "rape" [...] in the play is more than just forced sexual intercourse; it is used to describe all abuses of freedom and the corruption of power.|$|E
6000|$|... "Messire," [...] said Sir Sagramore, [...] "I {{will tell}} you the whole story, for I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it was through no disgrace but by mishap of battle that I am come to this pass." ...|$|R
50|$|Just as Daniel James became {{successful}} he {{lost his}} first wife Elizabeth. She had not enjoyed the best of health and died in 1847. She {{was buried in the}} Liverpool Necropolis, a cemetery built {{on the outskirts of the}} expanding and overcrowded city. Daniel remarried in 1849 to Sophia Hitchcock and when she died in 1870 she was also buried in the Necropolis. Daniel married for a third time at the age of 70 to his children’s former governess. However, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he still deeply loved his first wife Elizabeth as he chose to be buried with her, and when he died in 1876 his wish was granted.|$|R

2500|$|During early February 2006, Blagojevich {{appeared}} on The Daily Show {{to discuss his}} executive order that pharmacists must dispense any drugs for which a customer had a valid prescription, including birth control pills and Plan B. This measure was being challenged on the show by state legislator Ron Stephens from Greenville, Illinois. Blagojevich was interviewed by Jason Jones, who repeatedly pretended to be unable to pronounce Blagojevich's name and simply called him [...] "Governor Smith". At {{one point in the}} interview, Jones, who was acting as if he were against the governor's order, told him, [...] "I'll be in charge of what my listeners hear." [...] This prompted Blagojevich to turn to the camera and ask, [...] "Is he teasing me or is that legit?" [...] Two weeks after the interview, Blagojevich said that he was unaware {{of the nature of the}} show. Stephens said he knew beforehand that the show was a comedy show: [...] "I thought the governor was hip enough that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that,</b> too." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{attack on}} the Confederate right flank had petered out by noon, but it caused great commotion {{throughout}} Rosecrans's army as Thomas sent staff officers to seek aid from fellow generals along the line. West of the Poe field, Brannan's division was manning the line between Reynolds's division on his left and Wood's on his right. His reserve brigade was marching north to aid Thomas, but at about 10 a.m. he received one of Thomas's staff officers asking for additional assistance. He knew that if his entire division were withdrawn from the line, it would expose the flanks of the neighboring divisions, so he sought Reynolds's advice. Reynolds agreed to the proposed movement, but sent word to Rosecrans warning him of the possibly dangerous situation that would result. However, Brannan remained in {{his position on the}} line, apparently wishing for Thomas's request to be approved by Rosecrans. The staff officer continued to think that Brannan was already in motion. Receiving the message on the west end of the Dyer field, Rosecrans, who assumed that Brannan had already left the line, desired Wood to fill the hole that would be created. His chief of staff, James A. Garfield, who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Brannan was staying in line, was busy writing orders for parts of Sheridan's and Van Cleve's divisions to support Thomas. Rosecrans's order was instead written by Frank Bond, his senior aide-de-camp, generally competent but inexperienced at order-writing. As Rosecrans dictated, Bond wrote the following order: [...] "The general commanding directs that you close up on Reynolds as fast as possible, and support him." [...] This contradictory order was not reviewed by Rosecrans, who by this point was increasingly worn out, and was sent to Wood directly, bypassing his corps commander Crittenden.|$|E
