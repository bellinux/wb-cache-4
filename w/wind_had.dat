5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on December 13, 2010 that Voyager 1 {{had passed the}} reach of the radial outward flow of the solar wind, as measured by the Low Energy Charged Particle device. It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere. Since June 2010, detection of solar <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event. On this date, the spacecraft was approximately 116 AU or 10.8billion miles (17.3billion kilometers) from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1945 Hitler and his generals {{launched}} Operation North Wind (Unternehmen Nordwind). The {{goal was}} {{to break through the}} lines of the US 7th Army and French 1st Army to support the southern thrust in the Ardennes offensive, the final major German offensive of the war. After limited initial gains by the Germans, the Americans halted the offensive. By 25 January, Operation North <b>Wind</b> <b>had</b> officially ended.|$|E
5|$|The bomb sight {{was also}} {{supplied}} with the Emergency Computor, a simple circular slide rule for use when the main computor stopped working. In {{this case the}} bomb aimer would dial in the same basic parameters on the various disks, and read out the proper sighting angle at the bottom. <b>Wind</b> <b>had</b> to be estimated and calculated by hand. The angles were then entered manually into the sight; the drive cables were clutched out, the aiming angle entered using the operating handle, and the drift angle set by a small locking screw.|$|E
30|$|The meridional <b>wind</b> {{component}} <b>has</b> {{a positive}} value {{when the wind}} is blowing from south to north. A south <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> a positive meridional constituent, while a north <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> a negative one. In case of zonal component, values are positive when {{the wind is blowing}} from west to east. Thus, a west <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> a positive zonal constituent while an east <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> a negative one.|$|R

5|$|A fairly strong easterly <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> been blowing {{for three}} days; {{on the evening}} of the third day, the mosquitos arrived, flying high, about fifty feet, and looking like a cloud of mist over Carancahua Bay. At the ranch, they set {{everything}} on fire that had blood in it, and all work was suspended by unanimous consent...little or nothing was done for nearly five days; by this time the main body had passed, though plenty remained to make everything uncomfortable for about two weeks. This migration was from east to west and the line was about three miles wide.|$|E
5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|The Great Fire {{started at}} the bakery (or baker's house) of Thomas Farriner (or Farynor) on Pudding Lane shortly after midnight on Sunday, 2 September and spread rapidly west across the City of London. The major {{firefighting}} technique of the time was to create firebreaks by means of demolition; this, however, was critically delayed owing to the indecisiveness of Lord Mayor of London Sir Thomas Bloodworth. By the time that large-scale demolitions were ordered on Sunday night, the <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> already fanned the bakery fire into a firestorm that defeated such measures. The fire pushed north on Monday {{into the heart of}} the City.|$|E

5|$|Also in {{the region}} was the British 74-gun ship of the line HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile three years earlier. Swiftsure was passing slowly along the North African coast after being {{detached}} from Keith's fleet to join Warren's squadron off Malta, escorting a small convoy en route. Hallowell's ship was understrength as more than 80 men had been removed from the ship for service in Egyptian waters and illness rendered another 59 unfit for duty, while the vessel itself was in a poor state of repair and leaking badly. Progress had been slow, and a northeasterly <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> also significantly delayed Hallowell's passage. When he learned from a passing vessel that there was a French squadron {{in the region}}, he ordered the convoy to separate and sailed for Malta alone in an effort to join Warren more rapidly and warn him of Ganteaume's return. At 03:30 on 24 June his lookouts sighted sails to the southwest. Hallowell immediately assumed that the distant ships were the enemy and he turned away from the French and tacked into the wind. By 05:30, lookouts on the nearest French ships, the ships of the line Jean Bart and Constitution had spotted the distant British vessel and were ordered to give chase.|$|E

50|$|The {{solar wind}} {{is divided into}} the slow solar wind and the fast solar wind. The slow solar <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> a {{velocity}} of about , a temperature of 1.4-1.6 K and a composition that is a close match to the corona. The fast solar <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> a typical velocity of 750 km/s, a temperature of 8 K and nearly matches the photosphere's. The slow solar wind is twice as dense and more variable in intensity than the fast solar wind. The slow <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> a more complex structure, with turbulent regions and large-scale organization.|$|R

25|$|Chief Engineer Mitchell {{tried to}} start the steam {{turbines}} to enable the ship {{to move away from}} the mole. At 1350 hrs atmospheric pressure had fallen to 742mm of mercury and the <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> risen to a Force 8 gale. At 1422 hrs the waves and wind drove London Valour aground. At 1430 hrs London Valour transmitted a Mayday radio message.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 Voyager 1 {{reported}} that the outward velocity of the solar <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> dropped to zero, and scientists predicted it was nearing interstellar space. In 2011, data from the Voyagers determined that the heliosheath is not smooth, but filled with giant magnetic bubbles, theorized to form when the magnetic field of the Sun becomes warped {{at the edge of}} the Solar System.|$|E
25|$|This comment concurs {{with the}} opinion of an eyewitness. The {{explorer}} John Hanning Speke was aboard Brisk as a passenger, and described the capture scene in The Discovery of the Source of the Nile.

40|$|The CMS <b>winding</b> <b>has</b> now {{arrived at}} its {{constructive}} phase. This means that some practical aspects regarding the <b>winding</b> itself <b>have</b> to be considered, {{such as the}} minimum requirement of conductor performance for each layer of each $ 9 module. Several magnetic calculations have been already performed, but the <b>winding</b> <b>has</b> been never analyzed in detail, {{in order to understand}} the impact of the self-field on its performances. This analysis and its implications are $ 9 reported in this paper...|$|R
25|$|Despite these complexities, most of {{the data}} {{indicate}} that wind energy {{is one of the}} most cost efficient sources of renewable energy but approximately two times the cost of coal generated power in 2006. When the costs associated with pollution are factored in it was competitive with coal- and gas-fired power stations even then. By 2014, <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of any power source in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1830, Richard Roberts {{patented}} {{the first}} self-acting mule. The Stalybridge mule spinners strike was in 1824, this stimulated {{research into the}} problem of applying power to the winding stroke of the mule. The draw while spinning had been assisted by power, but the push of the <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> been done manually by the spinner, the mule could be operated by semiskilled labour. Before 1830, the spinner would operate a partially powered mule with a maximum of 400 spindles after, self-acting mules with up to 1,300 spindles could be built.|$|E
25|$|Allied {{aircraft}} {{had already}} reported {{the position of}} the German ships about 1300. About the same time a lone German Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor sighted and attacked both cruisers only to be repelled by anti-aircraft gunfire. The German aircrew immediately turned north-east, reporting {{the position of the}} British cruisers more than half an hour later to Erdmenger. Captain Charles Clark on HMS Glasgow, assuming that he had been reported then also turned north-east, working around Erdmenger's position to intercept. The sea was becoming rougher and the <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> increased to 30 knots, making sailing difficult for the destroyers and torpedo boats.|$|E

25|$|The English ships {{except in}} the rigging and masts had {{sustained}} only little damage, since the Spanish aim was to board and overpower. None of this was achieved as the English fire or the rough sea, depending on sources, had been strong enough not to allow the Spanish galleys into grappling position. The English casualties were only light at best but soon the <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> died down and therefore were becalmed just before Gibraltar itself. They were {{in desperate need of}} shot and powder as most of the bigger ships were close to being out of ammunition {{by the end of the}} action.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} and hydrogen bombs fell to earth near the fishing village of Palomares. This settlement {{is part of}} Cuevas del Almanzora municipality, in the Almeria province of Andalucía, Spain. Three of the weapons were located on land within 24 hours of the accident—the conventional explosives in two had exploded on impact, spreading radioactive contamination, while a third was found relatively intact in a riverbed. The fourth weapon {{could not be found}} despite an intensive search of the area—the only part that was recovered was the parachute tail plate, leading searchers to postulate that the weapon's parachute had deployed, and that the <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> carried it out to sea.|$|E
25|$|During April 1881, {{under the}} command of John William Nicholson, the Advance got away from a near miss when leaving the Grey River at Greymouth under tow of the steam tug Dispatch. The tow ropes were lost and the vessel drifted into the breakwater, moving too fast for the anchor to have held her. The sails were raised, but the <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> died away, and the crew lost control of the vessel. The Dispatch, however, managed to take the Advance in tow once again and left her on the flat {{opposite}} the town. Three feet of water had washed aboard, but no major damage was sustained.|$|E
