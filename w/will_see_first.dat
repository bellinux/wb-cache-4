In the opposite direction, at the top of a long, gentle slope, a mile and a half away, you will see the grand Triumphal Arch. That is at the barrier of the city. The view is not entirely open, however, out to the arch. About midway, in the centre of the Grand Alley, is a tall obelisk, standing on a high pedestal, and farther along there are one or two fountains. Still you can see the Triumphal Arch very plainly, it is so large, and it stands so high.|$|E

But in the midst of these fifty tall things that smoke, he will see one, a little taller than any, and more delicate, that does not smoke; and in the midst of these fifty masses of blank wall enclosing 'works'--and doubtless producing works profitable and honourable to France and the world--he will see one mass of wall--not blank, but strangely wrought by the hands of foolish men of long ago, for the purpose of enclosing or producing no manner of profitable work whatsoever, but one-- ...|$|E

This will represent a valuable scientific resource for the southern sky and in addition provide a basis for photometric and astrometric calibration of imaging data...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) <b>will</b> <b>see</b> <b>first</b> {{light in}} mid- 2008, and is {{expected}} to discover scores of pulsars in GeV γ-rays. For most, days to weeks will separate recorded gamma events. Rotation parameters provided by radio or X-ray instruments permit pulsation searches with greater sensitivity than what the LAT can achieve alone. But the gamma pulsar candidates tend to be the young ones with large timing noise, meaning that the ephemerides need to be updated relatively frequently over the years of the GLAST mission. We describe the criteria used to identify gamma pulsar candidates, and the observation campaign underway to provide ephemerides useful for the pulsed gamma searches, with some illustrations of the LAT's capabilities...|$|E

The Army of the future conceives of small combat units with netted communications enhanced with information from distributed and fused sensors, tactical intelligent assets enabling increased situation assessment, and on-the-move planning (FFW, 2004). The increase in information flow won’t come without a cost, however. Information management will be a key aspect of this distributed system. The availability of such technologies as Augmented Cognition (AugCog), will allow the system to be tailored to the situational and cognitive needs of the warfighter.
