The irony of the digital age is that, as technology gets more invisible, people {{are more interested in}} being able to see it again, as in Apple Computer's iMac, with its translucent blues and milky plastics that simultaneously tease and reveal.|$|E
25|$|Until then, all {{results from}} the solar radio-spectrographs had been {{inferred}} from studying the Sun by looking at its spectrum with only very limited angular resolution. Wild wanted to actually see what these phenomena looked like on the Sun, actually get a moving picture of them. The frequency range that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> in was around about the metre wavelengths. To get the resolution roughly equivalent {{to that of the}} human eye at these long wavelengths required an aperture some three kilometres in diameter. So I devised a method of synthesising a three kilometre aperture with 96 antennas in a ring.|$|E

Producers were {{undecided}} on what age DCI Murray would be, but had originally pictured an actress older than Bullmore. After auditioning, Bullmore returned a month later, intent on playing Murray [...] "tough", however, when meeting casting director Beverley Keogh in the toilets beforehand, Bullmore recounted that Keogh said to her: [...] "That's not what we've got you back for. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> in seeing a warmer side".|$|E

500|$|The intense {{collaboration}} between Dylan and The Hawks {{that produced the}} basement recordings {{came to an end}} in October 1967 when Dylan relocated to Nashville to record a formal studio album, John Wesley Harding, with a different crew of accompanying musicians. The same month, drummer Levon Helm rejoined his former bandmates in Woodstock, after he {{received a phone call from}} Danko informing him that they were getting ready to record as a group. In his autobiography, Helm recalled how he listened to the recordings The Hawks had made with Dylan, and remembered that he [...] "could tell that hanging out with the boys had helped Bob to find a connection with things <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> in: blues, rockabilly, R They had rubbed off on him a little." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the draft}} {{followed}} Maguire's idea of retelling {{the story of}} the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation [...] "goes far afield" [...] from the novel. As Holzman observed in an interview with Playbill, [...] "It was [...] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops– and really the whole plot– is different onstage." [...] Schwartz justified [...] the deviation, saying [...] "Primarily <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> in the relationship between Galinda– who becomes Glinda– and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies." [...] In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda - and eventually becoming the Tin Woodman instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, and Doctor Dillamond not being murdered.|$|E

The reissue has different cover artwork, as well as four bonus tracks – the track listing of which was revealed on February 1. The bonus tracks are: a new song recorded especially for the reiussue, titled [...] "Why Walk on Water When We've Got Boats", two re-recorded songs that were originally featured on their debut album, And Their Name Was Treason – [...] "Heartless" [...] and the aforementioned [...] "You Should've Killed Me When You Had the Chance" [...] – and a cover of the Kelly Clarkson song, [...] "Since U Been Gone". The new tracks were recorded at The Wade Studio. In addition to these bonus tracks, is a bonus DVD with footage of A Day to Remember's performance in Ocala, two music videos, as well as behind the scenes footage of recording and commentary on the re-release. The re-release came about after Victory asked the band whether or not {{if they were going}} to do a new album. Commenting about Victory's inquiry about a new album, Woodard [...] "We weren't ready to do it , so they asked if, you know, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> in doing a re-release with new artwork and adding some new songs." ...|$|E

It was either to protect the prince from the contamination which his caste would suffer if the vessels were touched by low-caste hands, or it was to protect his highness from poison. Possibly it was both. I believe a salaried taster has to taste everything before the prince ventures it--an ancient and judicious custom in the East, and has thinned out the tasters a good deal, for of course it is the cook that puts the poison in. If I were an Indian prince I would not go to the expense of a taster, I would eat with the cook.|$|E

60|$|Little of this {{learning}} troubled {{me in my}} {{visits to}} the cathedral, or even the fact that, next to St. Peter's, {{it was the largest}} church in the world. It was sufficient to itself by mere force of architectural presence, without the help of incidents or measurements. It was a city in itself, with a community of priests and sacristans dwelling in it, and a floating population of sightseers and worshipers always passing through it. The first morning we had submitted to make the round of the chapels, patiently paying to have each of them unlocked and wearily wondering at their wonders, but only sympathizing really with the stern cleric who showed the ceremonial vestments and jewels of the cathedral, and whose bitter face expressed, or seemed to express, abhorrence of our whole trivial tourist tribe. After that morning we took our curiosity into our own keeping and looked at nothing that did not interest us, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> most in those fellow-beings who kept coming and going all day long.|$|E
6000|$|His {{acquaintance}} {{with books and}} his schooling began early. He learned his letters at a dame school. Mr. William Wells, an Englishman, opened a classical school {{in one of the}} spacious Tory Row houses near Elmwood, and, bringing with him English public school thoroughness and severity, gave the boy a drilling in Latin, which he must have made almost a native speech to judge by the ease with which he handled it afterward in mock heroics. Of course he went to Harvard College. He lived at his father's house, more than a mile away from the college yard; but this could have been no great privation to him, for he had the freedom of his friends' rooms, and he loved the open air. The Rev. Edward Everett Hale has given a sketch of their common life in college. [...] "He was a little older than I," [...] he says, [...] "and was one class in advance of me. My older brother, with whom I lived in college, and he were most intimate friends. He had no room within the college walls, and was a great deal with us. The fashion of Cambridge was then literary.

Carlyle's essays were being printed at the time, and his French Revolution. In such a community--not two hundred and fifty students all told,--literary effort was, as I say, the fashion, and literary men, among whom Lowell was recognized from the very first, were special favorites. Indeed, there was that in him which made him a favorite everywhere." ...|$|E
