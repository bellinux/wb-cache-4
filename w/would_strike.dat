5|$|Initially, some {{forecasts}} {{predicted the}} storm <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> the Baja California Peninsula as {{a tropical storm}}; a tropical storm watch was briefly issued from Sante Fe to Cabo San Lucas accordingly. Over 100 shelters were opened in the municipalities of Los Cabos, La Paz and Comondú, respectively. In all, Ivo contributed to heavy rainfall across Baja California Sur; however, damage was not reported.|$|E
5|$|Late August, 1996– Hurricane Edouard {{produces}} strong swells to the coastline, causing two {{deaths from}} drowning. In addition, one computer model predicts the hurricane <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> near Atlantic City with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) on Labor Day. This causes Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist {{weekend of the}} year, though the order never occurs.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{pressure}} {{continued for}} the establishment of the 8-hour day. At the convention of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1888, the union decided to campaign for the shorter workday again.

5|$|The list of Florida hurricanes from 2000 to {{the present}} {{has been marked by}} several devastating North Atlantic hurricanes; as of 2017, 79tropical or {{subtropical}} cyclones have affected the U.S. state of Florida. Collectively, cyclones in Florida during the time period resulted in more than $73billion in damage (2017USD). Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were responsible for 147direct fatalities and at least 92indirect casualties during the period. Eight cyclones affected the state in both 2004 and 2005, which were the years with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state. Every year included at least one tropical cyclone affecting the state. During the 2004 season, more than one out of every five houses in the state received damage. After Wilma in 2005, it would be 11 years until another hurricane <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> the state, and 12 years until another major hurricane <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> the state.|$|E
5|$|When {{firing the}} same shell, the 16-inch/45 Mark 6 {{had a slight}} {{advantage}} over the 16-inch/50 Mark 7 when hitting deck armor—a shell from a 45cal gun would be slower, meaning {{that it would have}} a steeper trajectory as it descended. At , a shell from a 45cal <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> a ship at an angle of 45.2degrees, as opposed to 36degrees with the 50cal.|$|E
5|$|Before Alma made landfall, gale {{warnings}} and a hurricane watch was issued for Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Barbados. As Alma progressed westward, gale warnings were also issued for the Paria and Paraguaná peninsulas of Venezuela, the Guajira Peninsula, and the ABC islands. Initially, the Trinidad and Tobago weather service anticipated Alma <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> Tobago, {{but as the}} storm approached, the trajectory over Trinidad became apparent.|$|E

5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Japanese <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> at Port Moresby again, the {{garrison}} was strengthened and MacArthur ordered {{the establishment of}} new bases at Merauke and Milne Bay to cover its flanks. The Battle of Midway in June 1942 led to consideration of a limited offensive in the Pacific. MacArthur's proposal for {{an attack on the}} Japanese base at Rabaul met with objections from the Navy, which favored a less ambitious approach, and objected to an Army general being in command of what would be an amphibious operation. The resulting compromise called for a three-stage advance. The first stage, the seizure of the Tulagi area, would be conducted by the Pacific Ocean Areas, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. The later stages would be under MacArthur's command.|$|E
5|$|As in the 2005 season, {{the team}} {{predicted}} it was highly probable {{that at least}} one major hurricane would directly impact the United States. The forecast suggested an 81%probability {{that at least one}} major hurricane <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> the U.S. mainland, a 64%chance of at least one major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States (including the Florida peninsula), and a 47%chance of at least one major hurricane striking the Gulf Coast of the United States from the Florida Panhandle westward. The team also predicted that the potential for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was above average. A few months later, on April 4, 2006, CSU issued another forecast confirming its December predictions.|$|E
5|$|Davout {{anticipated}} {{the problems and}} withdrew his corps from Regensburg, leaving a garrison of only 2,000 for defence. The northbound Austrian columns in the KelheimAbbach zone ran into the four French columns heading west towards Neustadt {{in the early hours}} of the 19th. The Austrian attacks were slow, uncoordinated, and easily repulsed by the experienced French III Corps. Napoleon knew there was fighting in Davout's sector and had already devised a new strategy that he hoped would beat the Austrians: while the Austrians attacked to the north, Masséna's corps, later augmented by Oudinot's forces, <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> southeast towards Freising and Landshut in hopes of rolling up the entire Austrian line and relieving the pressure on Davout. Napoleon was reasonably confident that the joint corps of Davout and Lefebvre could pin the Austrians while his other forces swept the Austrian rear.|$|E
50|$|A call {{to strike}} was {{approved}} {{to pressure the}} administration to talk to and negotiate with students.

5|$|In foreign affairs, Walter {{negotiated}} with Scotland in 1195 {{and with the}} Welsh in 1197. Scotland claimed Northumbria, or northern England. Negotiations broke down, but {{relations between the two}} countries remained good throughout the rest of Richard's reign. Talks with the Welsh began after the English lords Roger Mortimer and William de Briouze expanded into Welsh territory in 1195, causing a concern that the Welsh lord Rhys ap Gruffydd <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> back across the border. In 1196, Walter quickly suppressed a popular uprising in London led by William Fitz Osbern. FitzOsbern was an orator who harnessed the discontent of the poor residents of London against high taxes. His oratory provoked a riot in London, and he was apprehended and hanged on Walter's orders.|$|E
5|$|Passing roughly 345mi (555km) {{northeast}} of the Leeward Islands on September17, Igor gradually weakened as it experienced increased wind shear and dry air intrusion. Over the following several days, the storm became exceedingly large, with tropical storm-force winds covering an area about 865mi (1,390km) wide. Due to an overestimated bias in Igor's intensity, forecasts from the NHC showed that the storm <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> Bermuda as a major hurricane. However, weakening was more marked than anticipated {{and by the time}} its center neared the territory on September20, winds decreased to 75mph (120km/h). Igor made its closest approach to Bermuda around 0230UTC, passing roughly 40mi (65km) to the west-northwest.|$|E

Bob Ayling's management faced strike action by cabin crew over a £1 billion cost-cutting drive to return BA to profitability in 1997; this was the last time BA cabin crew <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> until 2009, although staff morale has reportedly been unstable since that incident. In an effort to increase interaction between management, employees, and the unions, various conferences and workshops have taken place, often with thousands in attendance.|$|E

5|$|The {{rhetoric of}} the French Revolution {{inspired}} many Irishmen to fight for similar principles of liberty, equality, and brotherhood in their own nation; liberty in this context largely meant independence from Great Britain. With these goals in mind, in 1791 Dublin lawyer Wolfe Tone founded the Society of United Irishmen. Allying itself with the French Republic, the society was suppressed by the British authorities and forced to go underground when war broke out between France and Great Britain in 1793. Tone and other members secretly travelled to France to convince the French National Convention to invade Ireland. Such an invasion, they argued, could rely on support from large numbers of Irish irregulars, and if successful <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> a severe blow to the British war effort—perhaps even severe enough to force Britain to seek peace.|$|E
5|$|When the Prussians broke camp, {{they left}} {{a handful of}} light troops to {{demonstrate}} before the French advance post commanded by the Comte de Saint Germain. These light troops constituted the flank guard on the Schartau hill, which lay {{at right angles to}} the Janus and Pölzen. Frederick had no intention of either forming a line parallel to the enemy or of retreating. His army could move as a unit twice as fast as the Allies' army. If, at the moment of contact, the Allies had already formed their line of battle facing north, then his attack <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> their right flank; if they were still on the move in columns eastwards or northeastwards, the heads of their columns would be crushed before the rest could deploy in the new direction, deployment being a lengthy affair for most armies.|$|E
5|$|While {{the storm}} was passing near Dominica, the San Juan, Puerto Rico Weather Bureau warned about {{the threat of the}} {{hurricane}} which <b>would</b> <b>strike</b> the island within a day or two. The advisory was sent via telegraph to 75police districts and was broadcast from the naval radio station every two hours; this was the first hurricane warning broadcast by radio. Warnings were also posted for 12ports along the southern coast, causing ships to avoid the island or remain at port. Effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312, and not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of Puerto Rico. By comparison, the weaker 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane killed approximately 3,000people.|$|E
