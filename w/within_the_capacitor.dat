This type of fluid-level measurement system alleviates many shortcomings of fluid-level measurement methods currently being used, including limited applicability of any one fluid-level sensor design. Measurement acquisition shortcomings include the necessity for power to be supplied to each sensor and for the measurement to be extracted from each sensor via a physical connection to the sensor. Another shortcoming is existing measurement systems require that a data channel and signal conditioning electronics be dedicated to each sensor. Use of wires results in other shortcomings such as logistics needed to add or replace sensors, weight, potential for electrical arcing and wire degradations. The fluid level sensor design is a simple passive inductor-capacitor circuit that is not subject to mechanical failure that is possible when float and lever-arm systems are used.

The device {{is made up of}} a planar gap capacitor with a micro-fluidic channel situated between the plates. As the temperature changes, the water level in the channel moves across the capacitor plates. This rising level of high permittivity liquid <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacitor</b> modifies the capacitance and as a result modifies the scattering parameter S 11. The sensor can then be integrated with an antenna and interrogated at distance by a reader. The detected radar echo level changes in proportion to temperature when illuminated by the wave reader. Simulations were performed in order to optimize the design for the capacitor and channel, and to verify the change of S 11. The micro-fluidic device was fabricated using an Su- 8 micro-machining process. Measurements were performed using a VNA and a probe measurement station in order to verify the change in S 11 with respect to the level of water in the micro-fluidic channel. The S 11 measurements yield an 8 dB range which is in agreement with the theoretical calculations that are explained in the paper. For the radar echo measurements, a 4 dBm range is obtained. This corresponds to a 10 ° K measurable temperature range.

40|$|Automotive battery models, {{compared}} with personal electronics, {{are more complex}} as they experience a larger range of current discharge/charge rates. Electronics have a constant power demand, and thus a constant current is demanded from the battery. Vehicles have fluctuating power demands, dependent on the acceleration rate, and thus a non-constant current is demanded. There are many different classifications of automotive battery models depending on the fidelity required. Most automotive battery models {{can be attributed to}} one of two classifications: electrochemical and equivalent circuit, although there are some exceptions (e. g. neural network, linear, etc.). Electrochemical models incorporate individual particle interactions with great detail, resulting in high accuracy and simulation time. It follows that electrochemical models are frequently used in the design of new battery technologies. In a contrast equivalent circuit models (ECMs) simplify complex chemical interactions as circuit components consisting of limited parameters, trading model accuracy for speed and computational simplicity. Equivalent circuit models are frequently used when the battery is a component of a larger comprehensive model or when real-time convergence is essential. For this reason, equivalent circuit models are the preferred model for vehicle simulation, design, and control systems. The internal resistance (Rint) equivalent circuit model is currently dominant within the literature. Consisting of a single parameter (Rint), the Rint model is easy to characterize and implement. This model is often expanded by expressing the resistance as a function of temperature and relative capacity (i. e. state of charge or SOC), as well as current direction. This model can be found in industrial vehicle modeling software such as Autonomie. However the Rint model does not capture the nature of the battery voltage response which displays a hysteresis, or time lagged, effect. This effect includes, but is not limited to, faradic charge-transfer resistance (SEI interface), double-layer capacitance, lithium-ion diffusion, or kinetic faradic impedance. The Thevenin equivalent circuit model accounts for this effect by introducing two additional parameters, a resistor and capacitor (R 2 and C 1) in parallel, in series with the internal resistance (Rint). This adaptation allows the model to capture the hysteresis effect, as the voltage across the secondary resistor (R 2) {{is a function of the}} energy stored <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacitor</b> (C 1). It has been shown that, despite its simplicity, the Thevenin model displays a large improvement in prediction accuracy relative to the Rint model. In this work the impact of the hysteresis effect, and need for higher fidelity battery models, is investigated. To this end, the Rint and Thevenin models are characterized with the hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) test scaled to the current demands exhibited in the UDDS and US 06 drive cycles using a LiFePO 4 battery. The characterized models are then validated with the measured battery voltage response to simulated UDDS and US 06 drive cycle representative current profiles. The two models are then compared across the US 06, HWFET, and UDDS drive cycles in Autonomie software. The model simulation results, expressed in terms of electrical consumption (Wh mi- 1), are given context with reference to 2014 commercial electrified vehicles...|$|E
