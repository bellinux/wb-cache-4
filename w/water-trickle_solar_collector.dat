Two types of minichannel <b>solar</b> thermal <b>collectors</b> are analyzed experimentally: aluminum minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> for low temperature applications, and copper minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> for low to medium temperature applications. The aluminum minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> {{has been tested}} {{for over a year}} alongside a conventional copper flat-plate <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> of similar dimensions as the aluminum minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> to compare the performance of both system. Experimental results shows the aluminum minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> is more efficient in water heating due to the aluminum minichannel tube design. Analysis of the thermal resistances, thermal inertia and a simulation comparing the speed of response of both collectors indicate that the aluminum minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> is capable of heating the working fluid quicker than the conventional copper flat-plate collector. Preliminary data show that the copper minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> is capable of reaching temperatures above 100 °C for low grade steam generation. Using a steam heat exchanger, steam can be generated with the copper minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> with steam temperatures over 100 °C. Mathematical models are developed to use as predictive tools to simulate performances of the aluminum and copper minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> under various operating conditions. The mathematical model for single-phase flow simulating the performance of an aluminum minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> has good agreement with experimental data from the same type collector. Multiple two-phase pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient correlations are validated and compared to experimental data from the literature in order to select the best one to represent the copper minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collector.</b> The pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient correlations are selected from Muller-Steinhagen and Heck [1] and Odeh et al. [2], respectively. The pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient correlations are coupled to solve the two-phase flow heat transfer problem. Although the two-phase mathematical model cannot be validated with experimental data at this time, simulations comparing the performance of the copper minichannel operating under single-phase and two-phase flow are presented. Results show that efficiency decreases as the operating temperature of the collector increases. Even with the higher heat transfer coefficient during two-phase flow, the efficiency operating at temperature of the order of 100 to 110 °C in two-phase conditions are lower than operation in single-phase flow at temperatures between 50 and 90 °C. However, the difference of efficiency during single-phase flow with inlet temperature of 90 °C and during two-phase flow with inlet temperature of 100 °C is less significant, ranging from 3 % to 10 %. Economic analysis is provided showing that the market for solar thermal technology in the United States is slow due to the decreasing prices of natural gas. Although there are incentives and rebates across the nation for solar thermal technology, these rebates and incentives are not widely informed. More contributions in both the government and business sectors are required in promoting awareness of solar thermal technology. Market potential of the minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> are analyzed. Analysis shows that the aluminum minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> can replace the existing low temperature, conventional copper flat-plate <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> due to the experimental data showing the aluminum minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> being more effective than the copper flat-plate collector. In addition, prices for aluminum are significantly cheaper than copper. Depending on the costs of extrusion process of aluminum minichannel tubes, and the labor and manufacturing costs to fabricate aluminum minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collectors,</b> the costs of aluminum minichannel <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> per square meter can be lower than conventional <b>solar</b> thermal <b>collectors...</b>|$|R

Therefore, conditional flat plate <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> are not efficient enough, but new constructions of <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> are required. One of such new constructions can be a semi-spherical <b>solar</b> <b>collector,</b> capable to receive the solar energy from all sides.

Theoretical calculations of the energy gain from such collector have been performed and verified by comparison of the calculated daily energy sums with the measured ones, and good coincidence has been obtained. The results obtained from these calculations show, that the energy gain from the semi-spherical <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> with the base area 1 m 2 {{is similar to that of}} tracking to the sun flat collector of 1 m 2 area.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to study the characteristics of mango chips drying using a double plated <b>solar</b> <b>collector.</b> The materials used were sliced mangoes with the thickness of 3, 6, and 8 mm. The equipments used for this research were double plated <b>solar</b> <b>collector,</b> thermocouple, digital balance, thermometer, vacuum oven, and desiccators. The research parameters included {{the rate of heat}} energy absorbed by the double plated <b>solar</b> <b>collector,</b> the heat energy losses, the efficiency of the double plated <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> and the moisture content of the chips. The results of this study suggested that the use of double plated <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> could increase the temperature and the amount of heat energy, thus speed up the drying process of the mango chips. The energy needed to evaporate the moisture content in mango decreased in proportion to the increase in drying time. The difference in mango chips’ thickness resulted in different decrease rate in water content until it reached a constant state. The efficiency of the double plated <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> was 77. 82 %...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{variations}} in efficiency between two different <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> have been measured. <b>Solar</b> <b>collector</b> efficiency has been measured {{at different levels}} of flow. In addition, there has been made calculations of heat gained by the solar system {{in the course of a}} day. The effect of reduced transmission at an increasing angle of incidence, has been discussed. Comparisons of the two models show a minor improvement in efficiency in the latest <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> models. Comparing daily energy gain for the system show the similar result. The difference is seen most clearly when considering efficiency per. A solar heating system consists of a <b>solar</b> <b>collector,</b> a heat store and a heat distribution system. The system examined in this thesis, has water as a heat carrier medium, and a pump that circulates the water through the <b>solar</b> <b>collectors.</b> The essential elements of a <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> are the collector plate which can transfer energy from the sun to the water, and a cover sheet. The latter’s function is to prevent heat loss from the collector plate, and as such it makes the <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> function as a green house. Efficiency is an indicator of how well the <b>solar</b> <b>collector,</b> eventually the entire system, manages to exploit solar energy. In the thesis, efficiency has been analysed using a calorimetric method. Here the large storage tank holding almost 500 litres is used as a calorimeter. An easy way of measuring efficiency is looking at the increase in temperature in the heat store, and total radiation in the course of one day. Studies of the new <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> show that as much as 50 % of the energy received by the <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> in the course of a day is useful energy. The flow rate tells us how fast the water flows through the collector plates. The water absorbes energy from the collector plates, which are heated by the sun. In the experiments, three types of flow were chosen manually. The flow rates were between 0. 85 and 2. 0. Comparing data from both models show no significant difference in efficiency by changing the flow rate. The efficiency is apparently not affected by variations of flow rate in the <b>solar</b> <b>collectors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Outdoor air {{temperature}} {{range in the}} Baltic region is below average values in Europe. Range of outdoor {{air temperature}} in the Baltic region is - 3 ºC in winter and + 16 ºC in summer. And solar radiation intensity is lower {{in comparison with the}} average European values. The average solar radiation intensity reaches 1100 kWh/m 2 per year in Baltic region. Therefore, there is a particular need to optimize the solar thermal system in the Baltic region. <b>Solar</b> <b>collector’s</b> operation methods investigated on the IPE solar energy polygon according different parameters. The most common types of <b>solar</b> <b>collector’s</b> operation were investigated and compared: by the time, by the heat carrier temperature differences of input and output, by the solar radiation intensity and operation control methods in various combinations. Theoretical and practical advantages and disadvantages of using each control methods were analyzed. <b>Solar</b> <b>collector’s</b> operation system could be regulated in accordance with the solar radiation intensity, by the boiler lower temperatures and by the outdoor air temperature to determine precisely the <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> efficiency of the parameter changes. This may help to avoid the previous operation systems testing regime deficiencies. The precision of <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> operation depends on the type of operation systems: heat losses and the collector efficiency calculation accuracy, the sensor is accuracy, the time between the regulation regimes, and the range of heat carrier pumps action operation sensors.
