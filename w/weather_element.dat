On 18 November, the game engine made its debut in the action role-playing genre of video games, being ran on Dragon Age: Inquisition. On 17 March 2015, Battlefield Hardline became the second game of its series to run on Frostbite 3. On 14 July, the game engine was introduced to the sports genre of video games, being put to use on Rory McIlroy PGA Tour.

On 7 June, Mirror's Edge Catalyst became the first action-adventure game to run on Frostbite. On 27 September, the game engine debuted on the FIFA video game series, being employed on FIFA 17. It was a fortuitous move to transition FIFA to Frostbite because it allowed the addition of new features. For example, the dynamic <b>weather</b> <b>element</b> would allow the weather to change mid-match. On 21 October, Battlefield 1 became the third title of its series to be released under the third generation of the game engine. On 21 March 2017, Mass Effect: Andromeda was released on Frostbite.|$|E

40|$|Liquid Natural Gas {{resource}} development is often conducted worldwide. Recently the drilling area has gradually expanded from shallow sea {{area to the}} deep ocean. A Floating LNG facility (FLNG) and a LNG carrier ship (LNG) are assumed {{to operate in the}} open sea expected to wind, wave and current. In this situation, an operational capability evaluation of the LNG would be needed to grasp the operational weather limitation. The effect of each <b>weather</b> <b>element,</b> i. e. wind, wave and current, giving manoeuvring effect to ships, is expected to assess exactly as external loads. In such a situation, wind interaction effect under the operating condition that a FLNG and a LNG are in same closed area is not clearly understood. This paper treats and proposes one estimation method of wind load for the operation of side-by-side offloading including interaction effect of a FLNG and a LNG. The proposed wind load estimation method based on the wind tunnel experiments represents the shielding effect of the LNG behind the FLNG. Operational assessment on ship manoeuvring under strong wind is calculated using the proposed wind load method in the final stage. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{quantify}} important climatic shifts that took place over Malta and Venice that could be considered as a determining factor on their choice as two prime tourist destinations. Rather than making use of traditional tourist climate indices, this study identifi es long-term trends in weather variables and their derived bioclimatic indices. These climate derivatives are based on a set of high temporal observations (some of which are collected every 30 minutes) and are thus able to capture valuable information that traditional monthly distribution cannot provide. The derivatives obtained from the elementary meteorological observations showed that the level of comfort experienced by visiting tourists over the long term is deteriorating due to increased heat stress. Nonetheless, the increased occurrence of optimal wind speed conditions, as well as a reduced occurrence of gale storms and wind chill events is making these destinations more attractive. A careful study of the output of IPCC climate model projections sheds light on a critical future bioclimate condition during current peak visiting months (July and August) at both destinations. This may imply a required shift, as a form of adaptation, of the visiting periods at these two destinations. This study should allow tourist planners to determine which <b>weather</b> <b>element</b> is a likely future obstacle to the overall bioclimatic suitability of outdoor tourism activities. peer-reviewe...|$|E

The classification {{does not make}} a difference between the seasons of the year, but the occurrence of the classes obviously reflects the annual cycle. Another important feature of this classification is that only a minor part of the theoretically possible combination of the various types and sub-types occurs in all stations of both countries. The objective version of the classification starts from ten possible <b>weather</b> <b>element</b> which are reduced to four according to factor analysis, based on strong correlation between the elements. This analysis yields 3 to 4 factors depending on the specific criteria of selection. The further cluster analysis uses four selected weather elements belonging to different rotated factors. They are the diurnal mean values of temperature, of relative humidity, of cloudiness and of wind speed. From the possible ways of hierarchical cluster analysis (i. e. no a priori assumption on the number of classes), the method of furthest neighbours is selected, indicating the arguments of this decision in the paper.

Based on the flux data measured at five typical ecosystems of China during mid-growing season (June-August) from 2003 to 2006, we analyzed the responses of net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE), light use efficiency (LUE, defined as Gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) /Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)), and water use efficiency (WUE, defined as GEP/Evapotranspiration (ET)) to the changes in cloudiness. The five ecological sites included Changbaishan temperate mixed forest (CBS), Dinghushan subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest (DHS), Xishuangbanna tropical rainforest (XSBN), Inner Mongolia semi-arid Leymus chinensis steppe (NMG), and Haibei alpine frigid Potentilla fruticosa shrub (HB). Our analyses show that cloudy sky conditions with cloud index (k(t)) values between 0. 4 and 0. 6 increased NEE, LUE, and WUE of the ecosystems at CBS, DHS, NMG and HB from June to August. The LUE of tropical rainforest at XSBN was higher under cloudy than under clear sky conditions, but NEE and WUE did not decrease significantly under clear sky conditions from June to August. The increase in GEP with increasing diffuse radiation received by ecosystems under cloudy skies was the main reason that caused the increases in LUE and net carbon uptake in forest ecosystem at CBS, DHS, and alpine shrub ecosystem at HB, compared with clear skies. Moreover, for the ecosystem at CBS, DHS, and HB, when sky condition became from clear to cloudy, GEP increased and ET decreased with decreasing VPD, leading {{to the increase in}} WUE and NEE under cloudy sky conditions. The decrease in Re with decreasing temperature and increase in GEP with decreasing VPD under cloudy skies led to the increase in LUE. WUE, and net carbon uptake of semi-arid steppe at NMG, compared to clear skies. These different responses among the five ecosystems are attributable to the differences in canopy characteristics and water conditions. From June to August, the peaks of the k(t) frequency distribution in temperate ecosystems (e. g., CBS, NMG, and HB) were larger than 0. 5, but they were smaller than 0. 4 in subtropical/tropical forest ecosystems (e. g., DHS and XSBN). These results suggest that the pattern of cloudiness during the years from 2003 to 2006 in the five ecosystems was not the best condition for their net carbon uptake. This study highlights the importance of cloudiness factor in the prediction of net carbon absorption in the Asia monsoon region under climate change. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
