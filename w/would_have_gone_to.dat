There, he would have met Sarah Jane and her gang, and thwart the magician's plan to put everyone under his mind control.|$|E
5|$|At Christchurch, he {{reduced the}} number of canons serving the church from 25 to 13, through not {{replacing}} clerks who died. Ranulf kept the revenues that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> the missing canons and used it to rebuild the church. Some medieval sources claim that in rebuilding the church at Twynham, he not only demolished the church he was replacing, but nine others that were nearby.|$|E
5|$|Shepard and Slayton put Shepard down {{to command}} the next {{available}} moon mission, which was Apollo 13 in 1970. Under normal circumstances, this assignment <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> Cooper, as the backup commander of Apollo 10, but Cooper was swept aside. A rookie, Stuart Roosa, was designated the Command Module Pilot. Shepard asked for Jim McDivitt as his Lunar Module Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the Apollo 9 mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command a Moon mission. A rookie, Edgar Mitchell, was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.|$|E

5|$|Lord Harald Karstark {{arrives at}} Winterfell, bearing {{news of the}} death of the hunters sent after Sansa Stark and Theon Greyjoy. Ramsay Bolton deduces that Sansa <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> Castle Black where, as the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and her brother, Jon would offer both her and Theon his protection. Ramsay proposes to Roose Bolton that they storm the castle from the {{unprotected}} southern side. Roose warns Ramsay that these actions would turn the entire North against them. Maester Wolkan then enters and announces that Roose's wife Walda Frey has given birth to a son, prompting Ramsay to stab Roose, killing him. He then lures Walda and his baby half-brother into the kennels, where he has them mauled to death by his hounds.|$|E
5|$|As well as St Augustine's, the abbots of {{a number}} of other monasteries in the diocese of Canterbury are known to have professed {{obedience}} to Theobald, as the documents recording the events survive. Not only abbots and priors from within Canterbury, but some from other dioceses swore to obey Theobald, although normally such oaths <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> their diocesan bishop instead. Most of these exceptions occurred because the monastic house claimed exemption from the oversight of their diocesan bishop, and had a tradition of making those oaths to Canterbury instead. Besides these events, Theobald also intervened in the elections of some abbots, although not always successfully. He attempted to secure the right of Gilbert Foliot to remain Abbot of Gloucester after Foliot's election as Bishop of Hereford, but a new abbot was elected by the monks of Gloucester. Theobald was more successful in securing the election of William, who had previously been a monk at Christ Church, to be Abbot of Evesham over the objections of some of the monks of Evesham.|$|E
5|$|For {{whatever}} reason, Ealdred {{gave up the}} see of Worcester in 1062, when papal legates {{arrived in}} England to hold a council {{and make sure that}} Ealdred relinquished Worcester. This happened at Easter in 1062. Ealdred was succeeded by Wulfstan, chosen by Ealdred, but John of Worcester relates that Ealdred had a hard time deciding between Wulfstan and Æthelwig. The legates had urged the selection of Wulfstan because of his saintliness. Because the position of Stigand, the archbishop of Canterbury, was irregular, Wulfstan sought and received consecration as a bishop from Ealdred. Normally, Wulfstan <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> the archbishop of Canterbury, as the see of Worcester was within Canterbury's province. Although Ealdred gave up the bishopric, the appointment of Wulfstan was one that allowed Ealdred to continue his considerable influence on the see of Worcester. Ealdred retained a number of estates belonging to Worcester. Even after the Norman Conquest, Ealdred still controlled some events in Worcester, and it was Ealdred, not Wulfstan, who opposed Urse d'Abetot's attempt to extend the castle of Worcester into the cathedral after the Norman Conquest.|$|E

5|$|Hershey lost 2–1 in {{overtime}} against Binghamton on October 21. The game <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> a shootout, {{but under the}} first usage of the AHL's new video replay system at Giant Center, a Senators goal that had been overturned with 6.5 seconds left {{in overtime}} was restored. The Bears were held to a single goal in a second straight game in a 3–1 loss to Connecticut Whale on October 26, {{but the next day}} saw their first home win and first shutout victory of the season. They defeated the Albany Devils 3–0 and Holtby, who had been sidelined since the previous week by an upper body injury, made 35 saves. Forward T.J. Syner was recalled from the ECHL's Reading Royals and made his Hershey debut in that game. The Bears finished the month with a 3–2 victory against the Penguins on October 28, marking their first winning streak of the season. Orlov would miss the next four games due to an upper body injury, not returning until November 11.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stations}} {{along the}} line also have provisions for other extensions {{as part of the}} IND Second System. The Roosevelt Avenue station has an additional upper level platform and bellmouth provisions east of the station, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> a Queens crosstown line to the Rockaways. The 63rd Drive station has similar bellmouths, which would have fed directly into the inactive portion of the Long Island Rail Road's former Rockaway Beach Branch near its former junction with the LIRR Main Line (Whitepot Junction). One stop west, the Woodhaven Boulevard station has provisions to be converted into an express station. East of the Briarwood station, there were additional trackways built for an extension down Van Wyck Boulevard (today the Van Wyck Expressway) to Rockaway Boulevard, near the current site of John F. Kennedy International Airport. None of these proposals were ever funded, and only the Briarwood bellmouths were used for future expansion, while the Rockaway line was connected instead to the IND Fulton Street Line.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{financial}} problems during the 1980s, Peñarol {{won the national}} championship in 1985 and 1986, and a fifth Copa Libertadores in 1987. The club defeated América de Cali 1–0 with a goal by Diego Aguirre {{in the final seconds}} of extra time, when a tie <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> the Colombians on the goal differential. It was the third Copa Libertadores won by Peñarol at the Nacional de Chile, following victories in 1966 and 1982.|$|E

Tom is principally {{interested}} in horseracing, carousing in London society, and enjoying {{the pleasures of the}} theatre with his friend, Mr Yates. Tom incurs large debts, forcing Sir Thomas to sell the church position that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> Tom's younger brother, Edmund. Eventually, Tom becomes gravely ill due to his dissolute lifestyle, helping to teach him the error of his ways.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} five platforms, and is {{constrained}} by the 9.3 m width of the 426 m long double-track access tunnel. Early forecasts predicted that while double-tracking of the surrounding rail network would improve peak time train congestion, {{the capacity of the}} corridor would not be reached until about 2020. Growth in train patronage and increased services resulted in the tunnel being at maximum capacity from 2011, almost 10 years earlier than predicted. Because of the capacity restrictions, a proposed Hamilton-Auckland commuter train service <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> The Strand Station some 1.5km to the east.|$|E

25|$|Grace {{never went}} to {{university}} as his father was intent upon him pursuing a medical career. But Grace was approached by both Oxford University Cricket Club and Cambridge University Cricket Club. In 1866, when he played a match at Oxford, one of the Oxford players, Edmund Carter, tried to interest him in becoming an undergraduate. Then, in 1868, Grace received overtures from Caius College, Cambridge, which had a long medical tradition. Grace said he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> either Oxford or Cambridge if his father had allowed it. Instead, he enrolled at Bristol Medical School in October 1868, when he was 20.|$|E
25|$|In 1902, {{at the age}} of 15, Dare {{was hired}} by Seymour Hicks to tour as Daisy Maitland in An English Daisy, and to play the title role in Cinderella in 1903–04 at the Shakespeare Theatre in Liverpool. She spent much of 1904 touring but {{returned}} to London to play Aurora Brue in Sergeant Brue for Frank Curzon's theatre company. She left the company to create the role of Angela on in September 1904 in The Catch of the Season at the Vaudeville Theatre opposite Hicks. The role <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> Ellaline Terriss, Hicks' wife, but she was pregnant. Dare left Catch of the Season in 1905 to play Beauty in Sleeping Beauty in Bristol. Terriss later assumed the role of Angela, and Dare's sister Phyllis took over the role from Terriss.|$|E
25|$|As a {{strategic}} blow {{intended to prevent}} American interference in the Dutch East Indies for six months, the Pearl Harbor attack was a success, but unbeknownst to Yamamoto, it was a pointless one. In 1935, {{in keeping with the}} evolution of War Plan Orange, the US Navy had abandoned any intention of attempting to charge across the Pacific towards the Philippines at the outset of a war with Japan. In 1937, the US Navy had further determined even fully manning the fleet to wartime levels could not be accomplished in less than six months, and myriad other logistic assets needed to execute a trans-Pacific movement simply did not exist and would require two years to construct after the onset of war. In 1940, US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Harold Stark had penned a Plan Dog memorandum, which emphasized a defensive war in the Pacific while the US concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany first, and consigned Admiral Husband Kimmel's Pacific Fleet to merely keeping the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia. Moreover, it is questionable whether the US <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> war at all had Japan attacked only British and Dutch possessions in the Far East.|$|E
