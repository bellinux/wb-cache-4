50|$|At Twyford, {{the running}} speed is 125 mph {{on the fast}} lines, and 60 mph (90 mph for the Class 165s and Class 166s) on the relief lines. The up relief line is also signalled for <b>wrong</b> <b>direction</b> <b>running</b> at a speed of 40 mph, or 10 mph for the {{crossover}} onto the Henley branch.|$|E
50|$|Another {{feature of}} single {{direction}} ABS lines {{is the use}} of non-interlocked crossovers to facilitate <b>wrong</b> <b>direction</b> <b>running</b> or trains reversing direction away from a traditional terminal. Operated by hand or from a ground frame, these facilities made use of track circuit shunts and time locked points to ensure that any approaching train would be brought to a standstill before encountering the obstruction. While reversing direction onto the other track required no outside intervention, running against the defined current of traffic would require train orders or the services of a pilotman and such ABS crossovers would feature either telephone communications with the train dispatcher or a structure that could serve as a temporary block station.|$|E
50|$|Prosperi, a keen {{endurance}} runner, {{took part}} in the 1994 Marathon des Sables (Marathon of the Sands) in Morocco. Part way through the six-day 233 kilometre event a sandstorm caused Mauro Prosperi and his cousin James Duchkin to lose his way. He ended up disoriented and ran in the <b>wrong</b> <b>direction,</b> ultimately <b>running</b> several hundred kilometres into Algeria. After 24 hours he ran out of food and water. He arrived at an abandoned Muslim shrine, with the corpse of a holy man in it, and survived by drinking his own urine. He found bats on the low ceilings which he decapitated and then ate the guts and drank the blood from, and he waited for rescue. A helicopter and a plane passed, but he failed to be seen.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a system dynamic model {{for reducing the}} number of motorway accidents due to wrong-way driving. Motorway accidents are often fatal due to high speeds. It is therefore necessary to carry out all the possible countermeasures in order to achieve adequate traffic management. One of the reasons for motorway accidents is driving in the <b>wrong</b> <b>direction.</b> Based on the analysis of the data on motorway accidents caused by driving in the <b>wrong</b> <b>direction</b> and based on the knowledge of individual project elements of junctions and slip roads, this paper will focus on this area. The possible countermeasures, presented here for preventing drivers from driving in the <b>wrong</b> <b>direction</b> on motorways drastically reduce the number of U-turn maneuvers that result in driving in the <b>wrong</b> <b>direction</b> and influence the level of safety on motorways. With the help of this model of system dynamics the countermeasures for {{reducing the number of}} such drivers will be confirmed and their effects will be shown.

50|$|As {{the cost}} of {{electronics}} and signaling hardware fell with respect to {{the cost of}} labor, automatic block signaling began to be replaced by centralized traffic control and other systems that allowed trains to run in any direction on any track. Traffic control systems not only make use of bi-directional signaling, but also prevent trains being routed against the set flow of traffic at interlockings and automatically reduce all <b>wrong</b> <b>direction</b> automatic signals to an obstructed block state. This completely eliminates manual traffic setting procedures in bi-directional ABS schemes and <b>wrong</b> <b>direction</b> contingency procedures in single direction schemes.|$|R
