In a paradoxical way, Schumann's superficial characterization of the G minor Symphony can help us to see Mozart's daemon more steadily.

500|$|In January 2008, Tao became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} after the Singapore Swimming Association (SSA) introduced a 15% levy on the cash awards given to swimmers, with about 6% {{set aside for}} youth development. As part of the government's Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP), she received S$23,750 for winning three individual titles and one team gold at the 2007 SEA Games. She was therefore [...] "taxed" [...] S$3,562.50, with S$1,425 going to youth development. Unhappy with this, Tao said: [...] "If they [...] want to cultivate youth, they should find their own money, not pay using our awards. It's through our hard <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> got the money. So, I don't see {{the point that we}} should give the money to the youths." [...] She itereited that it [...] been her school and not the SSA which had borne the expense of her overseas training. The SSA said it was [...] "very disappointed" [...] with her comments, and pointed out that the association had spent [...] "easily in excess of $20,000" [...] in sending her for competitions abroad such as the World Championships, Hong Kong Open and Japan International, and a stint at the Australian Institute of Sport. SSA Vice-President Oon Jin Gee told the press, [...] "Even with the Sports School funding it, it's our taxpayers' dollars going into her development. It doesn't matter which avenue it comes from, it's still Singapore's support for her." ...|$|E

2500|$|With Prisoner of Azkaban, {{production}} of the Harry Potter films switched to an eighteen-month cycle, which producer David Heyman explained was [...] "to give each [...] the time it required." [...] Chris Columbus, {{the director of the}} previous two films, decided not to return to helm the third instalment as he [...] "hadn't seen [...] own kids for supper in the week for {{about two and a half}} years." [...] Even so, he remained on as a producer alongside Heyman. Guillermo del Toro was approached to direct, but considered the film [...] "so bright and happy and full of light, that [...] wasn't interested." [...] Marc Forster turned down the film because he had made Finding Neverland and did not want to direct child actors again. M. Night Shyamalan was considered to direct but turned it down because he was working on his own film, The Village. Warner Bros. then composed a three-name short list for Columbus's replacement, which comprised Callie Khouri, Kenneth Branagh (who played Gilderoy Lockhart in Chamber of Secrets) and eventual selection Alfonso Cuarón. Cuarón was initially nervous about accepting as he had not read any of the books, or seen the films. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct, as he had immediately connected to the story. Cuarón's appointment pleased J. K. Rowling who loved his film Y Tu Mamá También and was impressed with his adaptation of A Little Princess. Heyman found that [...] "tonally and stylistically, [...] was the perfect fit." [...] As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Cuarón assigned Radcliffe, Grint and Watson to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuarón recalls, [...] "Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.' That was the most important piece of acting <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> did on Prisoner of Azkaban, because it was very clear that everything they put in those essays was going to be the pillars they were going to hold on to for the rest of the process." ...|$|E
