5|$|Her husband {{announced}} {{his campaign for}} President of the United States in mid-1999, something that she agreed to. She did say, however, {{that she had never}} dreamed that he would run for office. The Bush campaign worked to assure voters that as First Lady, she would not seek to emulate then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. When asked who she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> out of the past First Ladies, she insisted it would be herself.|$|E
5|$|In January 2009, Lovato {{first started}} writing the songs for her sophomore album Here We Go Again, right after filming {{from the first}} season of Sonny with a Chance. In April 2009, Lovato {{explained}} about the album's process and collaborating with other songwriters and artists, such as Jon McLaughlin and The Academy Is... lead singer William Beckett. Unlike her first studio album Don't Forget, she did not collaborate with the Jonas Brothers, as {{she wanted to see}} what her sound <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> without their input. According to Lovato, the album's writing process was nearly completed in just two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917.|$|E

5|$|Doakes {{tries to}} {{question}} Dexter about his involvement, but is stopped by an indignant Debra, {{who says that}} Dexter is a hero. Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> if everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E
5|$|Following the McIntosh-Prescott Report, which {{indicated}} the long-term faults {{with the class}} that still required solving, successful {{efforts were made to}} bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was implemented to provide up-to-date information on the submarines to the media, to improve the public perception of the class by providing factual information on the status of the project and responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, widely held within the RAN, that the Collins-class boats <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> any other vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, and with all the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal in ensuring that the boats were at an operational standard.|$|E
5|$|The planning, {{design and}} {{development}} phases of Millennium {{took place over}} five years. The first rumors that a new record-breaking roller coaster would be built at Cedar Point, which included speculation about a ten inversion roller coaster from Bolliger & Mabillard and an Arrow Dynamics MegaLooper, began circulating in early 1998. A roller coaster from D. H. Morgan Manufacturing was also rumored. On July 2, 1999, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name Millennium Force, which raised more speculation about what the ride <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like.</b> About a week later, the first track pieces were seen at the park, which confirmed that the ride would be manufactured by Intamin. Cedar Point officials also confirmed {{that it would not}} have inversions.|$|E

Comedy Central accepted it right away, thinking that Benson's antics <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> by their audience. Benson said the pitch was easiest pitch he had ever made in his career.|$|R

5|$|The writers {{had wanted}} an episode where Burns becomes {{bankrupt}} and shows what Burns <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> {{as a person}} in the real world. The idea with the recycling plant was that Burns did not have any sort of evil plan, he just could not help being himself. Burns really was trying to change and this was reflected in the end when he tried to give Lisa her share of the profits, with Lisa refusing. Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode. The staff joked about this being a suitable series finale, due to the episode ending with Homer suffering from another heart attack after Lisa tells Homer what 10% of Burns' $120,000,000 check really is.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the story}} {{involves}} Madoc returning to Wales to recruit more settlers for his colony. During this time, he meets with Owen Cyveilioc, a poet who tells Madoc to discuss the matter with the Congress of Bards. During the meeting, a young bard prophesies that Madoc <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Merlin in America and that he is trying to recreate an Arthurian greatness. Afterward, he meets with Llewelyn, an individual trying to reclaim his title as Prince of Wales. Madoc tries and fails to convince him to come to America. Madoc returns to his original home, and there he stops an attempt to remove the body of Gwynned from a grave on holy ground. Instead, Madoc offers to take the corpse back with him to America where it could be buried without any worry. The rest of Madoc's time back in Wales is spent trying to get his brother David, the king, to free another brother, Rodri, whom he has imprisoned. However, Rodri escapes after his release was promised. As Madoc sets out to return to the colony, they are met by Rodri's boat. Rodri informs Madoc that he is working with Llewelyn to overthrow David and restore the rightful king. Although Madoc is upset by the potential warfare, he leaves with the promise by Llewlyn that Britain will be fine.|$|E

25|$|Stephen King {{met with}} Goodwin {{while he was}} writing his novel 11/22/63, due to her being an {{assistant}} to Johnson, and King used some of her ideas in the novel on what a worst-case scenario <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> if history had changed.|$|E

25|$|The 1971 TV special Play It Again, Charlie Brown was {{the first}} time that someone other than Peter Robbins voiced Charlie Brown which in this case was Chris Inglis.

25|$|The pagan sacrifices, {{known as}} blót, were {{seasonal}} celebrations where gifts were offered to appropriate gods and {{attempts were made}} to forecast what the coming season <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like.</b> Similar events were sometimes convened in times of crisis, for much the same reasons. The sacrifices, consisting of gold, weapons, animals, and even human beings, were hung on the branches of a holy tree.|$|E
60|$|This, {{she took}} it, {{was a fair}} sample of what she might expect after marriage. Marriage meant--to come to essentials--that two people were very often and for lengthy periods alone together, {{dependent}} on each other for mutual entertainment.

25|$|Dennett {{finds that}} many people find it {{difficult}} to see this, so he uses the case of RoboMary to further illustrate what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> for Mary to possess such a vast knowledge of the physical workings of the human brain and color vision. RoboMary is an intelligent robot who, instead of the ordinary color camera-eyes, has a software lock such that she is only able to perceive black and white and shades in-between.|$|E
25|$|Despite this setback, he {{achieved}} {{one of his}} campaign objectives. His total of 52,533 votes exceeded the threshold of votes set by New York law (50,000) and hence guaranteed the Green Party of New York an automatic ballot line {{for the next four}} years (see election results, New York governor). He said that, with no political machine and no money backing him, the likelihood of winning the governorship <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> climbing Mount Everest barefooted.|$|E
