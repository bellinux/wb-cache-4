While the strong linkages between water, food, and the environment call for an integrated and multidisciplinary modelling approach, a complete and consistent modelling system to evaluate food-water relationships in Europe was missing so far. This paper therefore develops a simulation framework to jointly assess agricultural and water policies and discusses first result. The partial equilibrium model for agriculture CAPRI (Britz and Witzke 2011), combining a global market model with regionalized supply side models for European administrative regions, has been extended with a module for irrigated agriculture to complement its existing environmental indicators and agri-environmental modelling capabilities. This modelling framework enables analyzing the likely impacts of increasing water stress on agricultural production at the level of administrative NUTS 2 regions, as well as looking at the sustainable use of water, the implementation of water policies or the integration of water issues in the Common Agricultural Policy. This innovative approach has been tested in a pilot case study including two regions (Andalucia in Spain and Midi-Pyrenees in France), selected according to data availability. The paper discusses the methodological and data issues, and presents preliminary results, highlighting the interrelations between water and agricultural developments in Europe. We find that incorporating water issues in EU-wide agro-economic models is crucial to analyse future agricultural policies in a context of climate change and increasing pressure on water resources.

3000|$|Based on the geo-statistical {{theory and}} ArcGIS geo-statistical module, datas of 30 {{groundwater}} level observation wells {{were used to}} estimate the decline of groundwater level in Beijing piedmont. Seven different interpolation methods (inverse distance weighted interpolation, global polynomial interpolation, local polynomial interpolation, tension spline interpolation, ordinary Kriging interpolation, simple Kriging interpolation and universal Kriging interpolation) were used for interpolating groundwater level between 2001 and 2013. Cross-validation, absolute error and coefficient of determination (R 2) was applied to evaluate the accuracy of different methods. The result shows that simple Kriging method gave the best fit. The analysis of spatial and temporal variability suggest that the nugget effects from 2001 to 2013 were increasing, which means the spatial correlation weakened gradually {{under the influence of}} human activities. The spatial variability in the middle areas of the alluvial–proluvial fan is relatively higher than area in top and bottom. Since the changes of the land use, groundwater level also has a temporal variation, the average decline rate of groundwater level between 2007 and 2013 increases compared with 2001 – 2006. Urban development and population growth cause over-exploitation of residential and industrial areas. The decline rate of the groundwater level in residential, industrial and river areas is relatively high, while the decreasing of farmland area and development of water-saving irrigation reduce the quantity of <b>water</b> <b>using</b> <b>by</b> <b>agriculture</b> and decline rate of groundwater level in agricultural area is not significant.|$|R
50|$|The nitrates and {{phosphorus}} in fertilizers cause algal blooms when they run off into {{lakes and rivers}} after heavy rains. Modifications in farming methods have been suggested, such as only using fertilizer in a targeted way {{at the appropriate time}} exactly where it can do the most good for crops to reduce potential runoff. A method used successfully is drip irrigation, which instead of widely dispersing fertilizers on fields, drip-irrigates plant roots through a network of tubes and emitters, leaving no traces of fertilizer to be washed away. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), drip irrigation also prevents the formation of algal blooms in reservoirs for drinking water while saving up to 50% of <b>water</b> typically <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>agriculture.</b>|$|R

Its <b>waters</b> are <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>agriculture,</b> industry and as major drinking water for several cities including Shanghai and Wuxi. The lake also is important for tourism, aquaculture and flood control. Taihu Lake and its surrounding areas are facing three major water-related threats: deteriorating water quality with inflow and runoff from its watershed; flooding during the rainy seasons; and water shortages during drier months. Noxious algae blooms are occurring with increasing frequency and water quality continues to decline. Remedial actions implemented to date have been ineffective. This paper proposes that the problems could be remedied by constructing a by-pass channel (BPC), which would divert low-quality water from the lake during low precipitation periods and allow better quality water to flow into the lake during high flow periods. This remedial action would simultaneously deal with the deteriorating water quality of Lake Taihu and maintain its water level at a desired level. A preliminary assessment of this strategy shows that, if the BPC were implemented, the water quality of Taihu Lake would be improved significantly in few years, the flood disaster would be greatly mitigated, and the water shortage problem in the basin would be alleviated...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, growing water demand in Spain has greatly reduced river flows into Portugal. Increasing {{pressures}} are expected on northern regions of Portugal, {{such as the}} Entre Douro e Minho (EDM), to reduce <b>water</b> <b>use</b> and improve quality. Two models, one theoretical and the other empirical, are developed to analyze <b>water</b> <b>use</b> <b>by</b> EDM <b>agriculture.</b> The theoretical model considers firms consuming and polluting water with multiple inputs, outputs, emissions, interdependent externalities, and transaction costs. The empirical model considers a flexible quadratic restricted profit model of representative farms for the region. A programming approach is followed. The Maximum Entropy technique is used to recover the profit model. An unrestricted profit function is obtained from the restricted profit function. The theoretical results show that when water externalities are interdependent it is not efficient to control each externality independently. Several policies exist to control interdependent externalities. All policies can be cost-effective, in theory. In practice, the policies have many transaction costs. The links between inputs, emissions, and ambient effects often are unknown. The focus then is on reducing farm use of inputs causing externalities. The empirical results show an inelastic response to prices. Nitrogen and water are complements. Coordination is required to reduce the use of each input. The decline of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) supports reduces pressure on water resources. At prices expected in 2000, the subsidies required to maintain farm profits range from three million contos (20 % nitrogen reduction) to twelve million contos (20 % nitrogen reduction plus 30 % water reduction). However, total predicted expenditure for the subsidy program is only 3. 3 million contos, which is clearly insufficient. The marginal value of water is only 5. 6 esc/m 3.

40|$|The {{implicit}} hydrologic {{dimensions of}} {{international efforts to}} mitigate climate change, specifically potential impacts of the Clean Development Mechanism- Afforestation/Reforestation (CDM-AR) provisions of the Kyoto Protocol (KP) on global, regional and local water cycles, are examined. The global impact of the redistribution of <b>water</b> <b>use</b> driven <b>by</b> <b>agriculture</b> and land <b>use</b> change, of which CDM-AR can be a contributing factor, is {{a major component of}} ongoing global change and climate change processes. If converted to forest, large areas deemed suitable for CDM-AR would exhibit increases in actual evapotranspiration (AET) and/or decreases in runoff. Almost 20 % (144 Mha) of all suitable land showed little or no impact on runoff and another 28 % (210 Mha) showed only moderate impact. About 27 % (200 Mha) was in the highest impact class, exhibiting an 80 - 100 % decrease in runoff, and prevalent in drier areas (based on Aridity Index (AI)), the semi-arid tropics, and in conversion from grasslands and subsistence agriculture. Significant impacts on local hydrologic cycles were evident, however large impacts were not predicted at regional or global scale due primarily to the current limit on carbon offset projects under the Kyoto Protocol. Predicted decreases in runoff ranged from 54 % in drier areas to less than 15 % in more humid areas, based on four case studies located across a range of biophysical conditions and project scenarios in Ecuador and Bolivia. Factors other than climate, e. g. upstream/downstream position, were shown to be important in evaluating off-site impacts. This study demonstrates that it will become increasingly important to consider implications on local to regional water resources, and how the hydrologic dimension of CDM-AR impacts on issues of sustainability, local communities, and food security...|$|R
40|$|In this research, I {{describe}} {{the use of}} false rings to reconstruct local histories of seasonal drought in riparian ecosystems in semiarid regions. In tree-ring analysis, false rings are boundary-like features often formed {{as a response to}} drought within the growing season. Drought can be a common feature in hydrologic regimes of dryland rivers but in recent decades drought has been intensifying due to climate change and increasing <b>water</b> <b>use</b> <b>by</b> cities, <b>agriculture</b> and industry. Identifying when and where water availability has decreased along the river course is critical for understanding, and therefore managing, these generally endangered ecosystems. The higher density of trees compared to instrumental data make them ideal candidates for reconstructing site-specific drought patterns. The first part of this dissertation is an observational study conducted on the San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona during 2002. I used dendrometer data and local hydrological data to show that a period of negligible radial growth in cottonwood {{during the middle of the}} growing season coincided with a channel drying event. Tree-ring core samples confirmed that false-rings had formed in each of the instrumented trees. The second part of this dissertation is an experimental study designed to evaluate the effect of different levels of water stress on false-ring formation in cottonwood and willow. I showed that experimental decreases in water availability for periods as short as ten days were enough to induce false-ring formation in willow. Longer periods of reduced water availability were generally required to induce false-ring formation in cottonwood. In the final part of this dissertation, I reconstructed false-ring occurrence in Fremont cottonwoods at three sites along the San Pedro River. I infer from false-ring frequencies that the severity of summer drought has been increasing over the last four to six decades but that the drought severity varies along a hydrological gradient. Overall, the findings in this body of research confirm that false rings in riparian tree species can be used as indicators of seasonal drought and underscore the importance of identifying site-specific responses to reduced water availability along the riparian corridor...|$|R
