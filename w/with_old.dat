5|$|In the 17th century, {{the rectory}} of Quarrington and the vicarage of Old Sleaford {{combined}} {{to form the}} ecclesiastical parish of Quarrington <b>with</b> <b>Old</b> Sleaford. The parish boundaries of Quarrington <b>with</b> <b>Old</b> Sleaford were last altered in 1928. The rectory is in the Diocese and Archdeaconry of Lincoln {{and has been in}} the Lafford Rural Deanery since 1968; the current rector of Quarrington is the Rev Sandra Benham and the patrons are alternatively the Bishop of Lincoln and Sir Lyonel Tollemache, 7th Baronet.|$|E
5|$|Old Sleaford {{was in the}} {{possession}} of Ramsey Abbey at the time of Domesday and later Haverholme Priory, and was eventually served by a vicar; the church was dedicated either to St Giles or to All Saints. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536–41), the king took over collection of the tithes, eventually leasing them to Thomas Horseman and then selling them to Robert Carre. In the 17th century, the rectory of Quarrington and the vicarage were combined to form the parish of Quarrington <b>with</b> <b>Old</b> Sleaford.

5|$|A mile {{south of}} the airport, at a signalized {{intersection}} <b>with</b> <b>Old</b> State Route 82, the road divides. Highway 82 turns eastward again, returning to its southerly heading after another mile when Spring Valley Road turns off to the Glenwood Springs campus of Colorado Mountain College in {{the mountains to the}} north. A half-mile (1km) beyond that junction, at the headquarters of the Garfield County Road and Bridge District, the highway begins a long stretch with a southerly heading.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} whether relationship quality <b>with</b> <b>older</b> adults currently and in childhood, {{as well as}} experience <b>with</b> <b>older</b> adults, was associated <b>with</b> biases toward <b>older</b> adults and interest in working <b>with</b> <b>older</b> adults as a possible career area. The authors sampled undergraduate students (N = 753, M = 18. 97 years, SD = 2. 11 years) from a Northern California university. In hierarchical regression analyses, higher perceived quality of relationships <b>with</b> <b>older</b> adult family members, higher perceived social support, and lower perceived conflict from relationships <b>with</b> <b>older</b> adults {{was significantly associated with}} positive attitudes toward older adults. Interest in working <b>with</b> <b>older</b> adults was significantly associated with taking courses in aging, providing care to an older adult, and volunteering <b>with</b> <b>older</b> adults. These results suggest that positive relationships <b>with</b> <b>older</b> adults are useful in reducing biases, though student interactions <b>with</b> <b>older</b> adults are key in helping to promote interest in working <b>with</b> <b>older</b> adults...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{increasing}} numbers of older people in most global populations and increasing evidence of the efficacy of psychological therapy in older clinical populations, few psychologists work <b>with</b> <b>older</b> clients as compared with other clinical groups. In the present research, the authors examine potential influences on psychologists choosing to specialize in {{working in the field}} of aging. The authors surveyed 1, 498 psychologists Australia-wide to examine which factors exerted the most influence on choosing to specialize in clinical work <b>with</b> <b>older</b> clients. Clinical exposure to older clients and age-related course content within training programs, together with further education external to formal training, were significantly correlated with specializing in aged care. Holding a more negative attitude toward one's own aging was another predictor of specialist category membership, with interest in working <b>with</b> <b>older</b> clients also being a significant factor based on direct logistic regression analysis. In contrast to previous work, amount or quality of contact <b>with</b> <b>older</b> persons did not appear to relate to working <b>with</b> <b>older</b> adults. These findings highlight the importance of quality training experiences in influencing attitudes toward working <b>with</b> <b>older</b> adults...|$|R

5|$|Friedrich Schleiermacher, an {{influential}} nineteenth-century Reformed theologian, saw baptism {{as the way}} the church receives new members and taught that faith is a precondition for baptism. He was ambivalent about the practice of infant baptism, teaching {{that it was not}} an essential institution, but could be continued as long as the church was faithful in bringing children to confirmation. Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into a covenant community, and rejected the idea that baptism should be connected <b>with</b> <b>Old</b> Testament circumcision.|$|E
5|$|NY128 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY22 (ArmonkBedford Road), an arterial boulevard, in the hamlet of Armonk (within {{the town of}} North Castle). NY128 proceeds north on Main Street, a two-lane commercial street, intersecting with an old alignment of NY22, entering the town center for North Castle, where it maintains the commercial backdrop through town. Passing west of Wampus Brook Park, NY128 intersects <b>with</b> <b>Old</b> Mount Kisco Road, an old alignment as it leaves the town center. NY128 soon parallels the park and Wampus Brook on its way north, maintaining the Main Street moniker until an intersection <b>with</b> <b>Old</b> Mount Kisco Road.

5|$|New styles {{such as the}} Maguindanao’s kagungudan and the Maranao’s bago, are {{considered}} fast, rhythmic and showy. Generally genres under this classification have faster tempos {{with an emphasis on}} power and speed, are highly rhythmic and pulsating, and are highly improvised with musicians employing different rhythmic/melodic formulae not used <b>with</b> <b>old</b> patterns. “Young” musicians, specifically young men, gravitate toward this style because of its emphasis on virtuosity and one’s individualism. Generally played after all kamamatuan pieces have been played to give younger musicians the opportunity to participate.|$|E
5|$|St Botolph's Church is {{the parish}} {{church of the}} {{benefice}} of Quarrington <b>with</b> <b>Old</b> Sleaford, which encompasses most of the village of Quarrington in the English non-metropolitan county of Lincolnshire. The benefice is a rectory and falls within the deanery of Lafford and the archdeaconry and diocese of Lincoln; the priest-in-charge is the Reverend Mark Stephen Thomson, who took over from the Reverend Sandra Rhys Benham in 2016. Dedicated to St Botolph, the church is on Town Road. The rectory was constructed in about 2000 and has a study area used as the parish office.|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} two aims: The first {{aim is to}} {{identify}} core competencies for shared decision making (SDM) <b>with</b> frail <b>older</b> persons, {{and the second is}} to determine key elements of a teaching framework, based on the authors' recently developed model for SDM <b>with</b> <b>older</b> patients who are frail. To this end the authors conducted a qualitative inquiry among health professionals (n = 53) and older patients who are frail (n = 16). Participants formulated core competencies and educational needs for SDM <b>with</b> <b>older</b> patients who are frail, which were further explored in the literature. This resulted in practice recommendations and a teaching framework with the following key elements: create a knowledge base for all health professionals, offer practical training, facilitate communication, identify discussion partners, engage patients, and collaborate. The authors' teaching framework for SDM <b>with</b> <b>older</b> patients who are frail may be useful for clinicians, educators, and researchers who aim to promote SDM <b>with</b> <b>older</b> patients who are frail...|$|R

5|$|After 1492, {{a global}} {{exchange}} of previously local {{crops and livestock}} breeds occurred. Maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and turnips traveled from the Old World to the New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival <b>with</b> <b>Old</b> World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on many cultures. Maize and cassava were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.|$|E
5|$|After the 1999 draft, the Rockets {{traded for}} the third overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies, in {{exchange}} for four players and a first round draft pick. However, after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland (stating chemistry problems <b>with</b> <b>old</b> rival and now teammate Barkley), and Barkley suffered a career-ending injury, the rebuilt Rockets went 34–48 and missed the playoffs, {{for only the second}} time in 15 years. In the 2000–01 season, the Rockets worked their way to a 45–37 record, but still did not make the playoffs. In the following offseason, a 38-year-old Olajuwon requested a trade, and, despite stating their desire to keep him, the Rockets reached a sign and trade agreement, sending him to the Toronto Raptors. The proceeding season was unremarkable, as Houston's first season without Olajuwon in almost 20 years finished with a disappointing 28–54 record.|$|E

5|$|Construction was {{slated for}} the {{interchange}} with County Routes 516 and 527 in Old Bridge {{as there is}} no way to access either of them without driving through a residential area off Route 18. The traffic flow along CR 516 (Old Bridge into Matawan) and 527 (Old Bridge into Englishtown/Manalapan) has increased significantly in the past ten years which called for the exit ramp off Route 18. The Old Bridge improvements include adding inside shoulders and widening County Routes 516 and 527. A signalized ramp is to be added for access to County Routes 516 and 527. Subsequently, County Route 516's intersection <b>with</b> <b>Old</b> Matawan Road is to be relocated. The project would cost over $28 million and was slated to begin in 2009 and to end in 2010. As of the end of 2009 the large project was put on hold because of the lack of funds and the economic situation. Demolition was completed in 2009 on Marlboro Road, taking down several residential houses and along Old Matawan Road and CR 516 and taking down an old gas station in preparing for the project. There is no new date released by NJDOT in when construction will begin.|$|E

5|$|Erzherzog Ferdinand Max {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste on 6 May 1863. She was launched on 24 May 1865; the builders were forced to complete fitting-out work quickly, as tensions with neighboring Prussia and Italy erupted into the concurrent Austro-Prussian War and the Third Italian War of Independence in June 1866. Erzherzog Ferdinand Maxs rifled heavy guns were still on order from Krupp, and {{they could not be}} delivered due to the conflict with Prussia. Instead, the ship was armed <b>with</b> <b>old</b> smooth-bore guns. Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, the commander of the Austrian Fleet, immediately began to mobilize his fleet. As the ships became fully manned, they began to conduct training exercises in Fasana. With his flag aboard Erzherzog Ferdinand Max, Tegetthoff brought the Austrian fleet to Ancona on 26 June in an attempt to draw out the Italians, but the Italian commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, refused to engage Tegetthoff. Tegetthoff made another sortie on 6 July, but again could not bring the Italian fleet to battle.|$|E
