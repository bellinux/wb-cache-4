5|$|The {{internal}} {{fuel capacity}} of the Ju 87D was raised to 800L (of which 780L were usable) by adding additional wing tanks while retaining the option to carry two 300L drop tanks. Tests at Rechlin-Lärz Airfield revealed it made possible a flight duration of 2 hours and 15 minutes. <b>With</b> <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> two 300L (80US gal) fuel tanks, it could achieve four hours flight time.|$|E

5|$|To the south, {{the ward}} of Barton {{is the third}} most densely {{populated}} in Salford with little population change between 1991and2001. It has proportionally more over-85-year-olds than {{the city as a}} whole, with low adult and primary school education standards, but significant improvements in GCSE results of late. Some parts of Barton are amongst the worst20% of areas in the country for child poverty, with below-city-average childcare provision. Unemployment is higher than average for Salford.

5|$|Widening of the Kwinana Freeway <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> {{southbound}} lane between Roe Highway and Armadale Road {{began in}} mid-2014. The project aims {{to increase the}} freeway's reliability, efficiency, and safety, as the current two-lane configuration is subject to {{a large proportion of}} heavy vehicles and severe peak hour congestion. The project also involves the realignment of ramps at Berrigan Drive and Armadale Road, construction of noise barriers and noise walls where required, and installation of components for intelligent transport systems – optic fibre communications, vehicle detection devices, and closed circuit cameras.|$|E
5|$|Armillary sphere, hydraulic-powered: Hipparchus (c. 190– c. 120 BC) {{credited}} the Ancient Greek mathematician, geographer, astronomer, {{and poet}} Eratosthenes (276–194 BC) {{as the first}} to invent the armillary sphere representing the celestial sphere. However, the Chinese astronomer Geng Shouchang of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) invented it separately in China in 52 BC, while the Han dynasty polymath Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) {{was the first to}} apply motive power to the rotating armillary sphere by a set of complex gears rotated by a waterwheel which in turn was powered by the constant pressure head of an inflow clepsydra clock, the latter of which he improved <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, {{the passing}} loop {{was used by}} one pair of {{passenger}} trains in the evening, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> down train (toward Amlwch) making seven down and six up trains per day. The railmotor train's services had grown to 24 single trips between Gaerwen/Holland Arms and Llangefni/Red Wharf Bay. The continuing shortages of World War I meant that in January 1917 many passenger services were to be cut to give more resources to the war effort. The railways were slow {{to recover from the}} wartime hardships, and in 1921 there were six passenger trains to and from Amlwch, and only 18 single trips by the motor train.|$|E

5|$|In January 2010, {{there was}} a full reading of the one-act version of the play. Despite an {{unfinished}} script and a performance by amateur actors, it evoked a strong response from the audience. Later that year, Stephen Waldschmidt, an artistic associate of Burnt Thicket Theatre, asked to read the script of She Has a Name, and later {{said he could not}} put it down. He was initially reluctant to attach himself to the play because of the immensity and ugliness of the issues therein, but he ultimately worked with Kooman to expand it into a full-length play <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> hour of material by the end of 2010. The result is a play that can be performed in 90 minutes but may last up to two hours. Burnt Thicket Theatre served as the play's initial production company.|$|E
5|$|Scattered {{around each}} level are gold rings. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> life. Rings {{act as a}} layer of {{protection}} against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, he will survive. However, all rings in his possession will be scattered; they flicker and disappear {{in a few seconds}} if not picked up again. If he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life. Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time, will cause Sonic to lose a life regardless of rings or other protection.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century station {{building}} {{is owned by}} NS Stations. It is of the type SS 3rd class, which was designed by Karel Hendrik van Brederode. SS 3rd class was chosen instead of the smaller SS 4th class because {{of the importance of}} Winschoten as a commercial center. Eight buildings of SS 3rd class were completed in the Netherlands between 1862 and 1865, of which four remain today. This building of 1865 has a median risalit and wings on both sides parallel to the railway. The facade on the city side and railway side are identical, except for a half round decoration on the city side. The doors and windows of the building have arched frames. In the 1904 expansion, an enclosed porch was added and the east wing was extended <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> waiting room.|$|E

5|$|The White Sox led {{for most}} of the season {{starting}} with a tie for first on May 17, held at least a share of the lead for 154 days, and never dropped more than a game behind the leader. The Twins spent much of the season in second place behind the White Sox, along with 54 days in the lead. Despite going 11–15 in September, the Twins took a half-game lead <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> innings win over the White Sox on September 25 that capped a three-game sweep of Chicago. The Twins maintained that lead through their final game, forcing Chicago to play a make-up on September 29 against the Tigers which had been rained out earlier that month. The White Sox won, 8–2, leaving the Sox and Twins tied atop the AL Central with 88–74 records, forcing a tie-breaker to decide the division. Tickets for the tie-breaker sold out within an hour {{of the end of the}} September 29 game.|$|E
5|$|The copious {{amounts of}} blood spilled {{in the fight}} scenes came from bags of fake blood {{strapped}} to the performers' bodies. Animal blood gathered from slaughterhouses was poured onto the floor to simulate puddles of human blood. Most of the times trick swords made from fiberglass were used when the scene called for a killing blow. Designed by Allder, these swords could also retract their blades, and several sprayed blood from their tips. Although the swords were intended to be safer alternatives to metal weapons, they could still be dangerous: {{in one of the}} fights, Bergman sparred <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> who failed to follow the choreography and sliced open her finger.|$|E
5|$|The final level {{takes place}} in Washington, D.C. again, where the two antagonists attempt to flee after {{escaping}} from prison. The player must destroy both Kilbaba and Ortega and stop four trucks carrying nuclear bombs from blowing up the White House. The PC version also extends the storyline <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> level set in Alaska, in which the player must wipe out the remainder of Ortega's forces {{under the command of}} a Russian defector named Ptofski, who has taken control of oil tankers and is threatening to destroy the ecosystem with crude oil if his demands are not met. Once all levels are complete, the ending sequence begins and depicts the protagonist and his co-pilot in an open-topped car in front of cheering crowds.|$|E
