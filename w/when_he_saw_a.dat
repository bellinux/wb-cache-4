In 1985, the Canadian historian Robin Yates visited the Buddhist cave temples <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> sculpture on the wall depicting a demon holding a hand-held bombard. The muzzle seems to have a blast and flames coming from it which some believe is proof of some type of super gun. Yates examined the cave and believed the drawings dated back to the late 12th century.|$|E

His release was eventually negotiated {{in return for a}} ransom (some of which was a loan from the Templars) and the surrender of the city of Damietta. A few years later, in 1252, Louis tried unsuccessfully to ally with the Egyptians, and then in 1253 he sought allies among both the Ismaili Assassins and the Mongols. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> letter from Hethum's brother, the Armenian noble Sempad, which spoke well of the Mongols, Louis dispatched the Franciscan William of Rubruck to the Mongol court. But the Mongol leader Möngke replied with only a letter via William in 1254, asking for the King's submission to Mongol authority.|$|E

5|$|Ra.One is a 2011 Indian superhero film {{directed}} by Anubhav Sinha, and starring Shah Rukh Khan, Arjun Rampal, Kareena Kapoor, Armaan Verma, Shahana Goswami and Tom Wu in pivotal roles.The script, written by Anubhav Sinha and Kanika Dhillon, originated {{as an idea}} that Anubhav Sinha got <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> television commercial, and which he subsequently expanded. The film follows Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game designer who creates a motion sensor-based game in which the antagonist (Ra.One) is {{more powerful than the}} protagonist (G.One). The former escapes from the game's virtual world and enters the real world; his aim is to kill Lucifer, the game ID of Shekhar's son and the only player to have challenged Ra.One's power. Relentlessly pursued, the family is forced to bring out G.One from the virtual world to defeat Ra.One and protect them.|$|E
5|$|While {{portraying the}} bonds between {{the members of}} Class Zero, and between them and their summoned monsters, along with the game's themes of death and war, Naora drew {{inspiration}} from <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> cat killed by a car surrounded by other cats. Nomura {{was in charge of}} choosing the voice cast, which featured several well-known voice actors. When listening to the samples and picking the actors, Nomura focused on whether they could successfully project the characters' personalities. The actors and actresses helped define the characters, adding individual touches during voice recording sessions. Sayoko Hoshino acted as the game's character texture artist. Originally, she was going to put in black voids where a female character's panties would have been due to hardware limitations. However the staff realized that the players would be looking at the backs of characters a lot, so Hoshino designed panties for each female character and worked with the staff to incorporate them into the character models.|$|E
5|$|During the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of South Africa during 1948–49, {{the first}} under apartheid, the BBC {{commentator}} John Arlott was horrified <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> black man assaulted for no reason. This {{prompted him to}} visit several townships where he found black people living in very poor conditions. He contrasted this unfavourably with the luxury of the homes where he was entertained by white families. Billy Griffith, one of the touring team, accompanied him on one visit to a township, and was similarly appalled, but did not speak out against it. Arlott later condemned apartheid, during a 1950 BBC broadcast, and refused to commentate during future tours to the country. His example {{was followed by the}} England batsman and clergyman David Sheppard, who declined to tour South Africa, refused to play the team in 1960, and spoke out publicly against the policies of the South African government despite efforts by the MCC to silence him. Otherwise, there was little protest in England against South African cricket during the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{first began}} {{plans for a}} sequel to his 1986 hit musical, The Phantom of the Opera, in 1990. Following a {{conversation}} with Maria Björnson, the designer of The Phantom of the Opera, Lloyd Webber decided that, were a sequel to come about, it would be set in New York City {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. One of his ideas was to have the Phantom live above ground in Manhattan's first penthouse, but he rejected this <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> TV documentary about the Coney Island fairground. Lloyd Webber began collaborating with author Frederick Forsyth on the project, but it soon fell apart as Lloyd Webber felt the ideas they were developing would be difficult to adapt for a stage musical. Forsyth went on to publish some of the ideas he had worked on with Lloyd Webber in 1999 as a novel entitled The Phantom of Manhattan.|$|E

O'Brien had previously pitched episodes where Lisa had a rival and where Marge gets {{a job at the}} power plant and Mr. Burns falls in love with her; both went well. James L.

500|$|Seydlitz's {{first months}} as a cornet were made {{difficult}} by the regimental colonel, who considered him a spy for the Margrave, and abused him by sending him on useless errands and generally {{making it clear}} that the cornet was no match for the colonel. Within a year of Seydlitz's commission, the old King Frederick William died and his son, Frederick II of Prussia, ascended to the throne. [...] Frederick claimed Silesia from the Habsburg's Maria Theresa, and made a broad appeal to arms. [...] The Margrave's regiment {{played an important role in}} the ensuing war, during which Seydlitz came to the notice of the King several times. Once, when Frederick asked the caliber of the artillery shelling the Prussian line, opinions were divided and vague. Seydlitz rode in front of the battery, halting in their line of fire. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> ball hit the ground, he picked it up, wrapped it in his handkerchief and presented it to the King.|$|E
500|$|Writer Darin Morgan was {{inspired}} to write the episode <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> cover of a magazine featuring insect like robots created by roboticist Rodney Brooks. Mass hysteria was also a key element to the episode, with many references to Orson Welles's famous radio play of War of the Worlds. Most notably, the episode's title is a reference to The War of the Worlds and the town this episode takes place in—Miller's Grove—is a play on Grover's Mill, the setting of Orson Welles's 1938 radio adaptation. Originally, a scene featuring the sheriff discussing a noted case of hysteria from the 1930s was planned {{to be included in}} the final episode, but was cut due to time. The episode, like Morgan's previous effort, the second season's [...] "Humbug," [...] used a great deal of humor, including an in-joke where Scully reads Breakfast at Tiffany's, referencing David Duchovny's Final Jeopardy! question when he appeared on Jeopardy!. The last part of the episode's title, coprophages, refers to a dung eater.|$|E
500|$|The Greco-Roman {{astronomer}} Ptolemy (90168) {{identified a}} place called Sabana in the general area in the second century, and the earliest written record of Singapore {{may be in a}} Chinese account from the third century, describing the island of Pu Luo Chung ( [...] ).

The Nagarakretagama, a Javanese epic poem written in 1365, referred to a settlement on the island called Tumasik (possibly meaning [...] "Sea Town"). The name Temasek is also given in Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals), which contains a tale of a prince of Srivijaya, Sri Tri Buana (also known as Sang Nila Utama), who landed on Temasek during the 13th century. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> strange beast said to be a lion, the prince took this as an auspicious sign and founded a settlement called Singapura, which means [...] "Lion City" [...] in Sanskrit.
