5000|$|Basically, {{the whole}} premise that never {{actually}} {{had the chance}} to come out was the idea that Dad was a demon, who made a deal with the Devil.

He was never fully human, either, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> can’t kill him... And this is the reason why Sam is special: Sam is part human, part demon.|$|E

5000|$|Some tax protesters {{have cited}} this {{case for the}} {{argument}} {{that it is possible}} to avoid paying taxes without punishment by using the kind of defense raised by Cheek about a good faith misunderstanding of the tax law itself. The Cheek defense is available, however, only in a criminal trial, and not as a method to avoid the payment of tax. [...] In addition, attorney Daniel B. Evans points out that the Cheek Defense is logically self-defeating: ...If you plan ahead to use it, then it is almost certain to fail, because your efforts to establish your “good faith belief” are going to be used by the government as evidence that you knew that what you were doing was wrong when you did it, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> worked to set up a defense in advance.|$|E
40|$|Business Process Management is {{essentially}} a particular technique for business change. Certainly, if you don’t intend {{to change the way}} your organization operates, then you have no need for BPM. On the other hand, if you do intend to make such changes, then you should consider BPM techniques and tools – <b>which</b> <b>is</b> probably <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> reading this column. As a consultant I often advise large-scale business change projects that have got themselves into trouble, or fear they are about to. More often than not, the root causes are mistakes and omissions made early in the project lifecycle. Most people appreciate that mistakes and omissions made early in the project lifecycle are the most expensive sort of mistakes and omissions. However, they are also by far the most common sort. One has to wonder- why do people not learn that a stitch in time saves nine? The answer, I believe, is that mainstream approaches to project and programme management still lack mature techniques and accompanying tools for understanding, preparing and managing the associated business changes. Further, I believe that mainstream BPM methods do not deliver enough in this respect, since they fail to take sufficient account of the human-to-human interactions that underpin and drive all business operations...|$|R
40|$|When I {{was in high}} school, I really didn 2 ̆ 7 t go in for reading. Until, that is, I somehow {{encountered}} Erich Maria Remarque 2 ̆ 7 s All Quiet on the Western Front. I remember {{hiding in}} the back of all my classes reading it while my teachers talked about something I know not what. I was hooked on World War I, and I 2 ̆ 7 m sure I 2 ̆ 7 m not alone. The Great War was such a strange and tragic thing. It seems to have been started for no good reason, been fought without reason, and ended unreasonably. It 2 ̆ 7 s just hard to make sense of. <b>Which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> [...] if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> as confused as I am [...] you should pick up Norman Stone 2 ̆ 7 s terrific World War One. A Short History (Basic Books, 2009). The book explains the inexplicable in the fewest words imaginable. More than that, it 2 ̆ 7 s wonderfully written. Stone has clearly thought long and hard about the war and he is full of pithy observations, sharp opinions, and harsh verdicts. No one really comes out unscathed, which, given the way the war was started, fought and ended, makes good sense indeed. If you don 2 ̆ 7 t know anything about World War One, you should read this book. There is no better introduction. If you know everything about World War One, you should also read this book. There is no more challenging book on the subject...|$|R
5000|$|... "This problem {{primarily}} {{concerns the}} flight of the golf ball, of course, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> I thought <b>you</b> as golf course architects {{would be interested in}} it essentially. It is something the USGA has been working on for a good many years. Mr. Fownes, who is President here (Pinehurst), was very active as chairman of this committee when he held that position prior to his service as President of the USGA, and he did a great deal of work on this whole problem of the golf ball. I've been very much interested in it since I've been Chairman of the committee. We feel that a golf course is designed for a certain type of shot to the green, and that as you increase the length of the tee shot, you throw the golf course all out of scale. Therefore, it spoils the pleasure of the play to have this continual increase in {{the flight of}} the ball. We feel that the question involves not only the ball but also the equipment of the game; that possibly the shaft {{had something to do with}} the increased length of the ball. We've done a lot of work in Chicago with our machine there in testing the ball. Since our tests first started back in 1942 we haven't observed much increase in the flight of the ball, it's been pretty constant. The manufacturers say pretty much the same thing: that they haven't changed the ball very much, and in their opinions it hasn't increased.|$|R
50|$|Exterior {{shutters}} were vital elements on {{homes in}} the colonies. The expense of the shutters and their associated hardware was easily justified. There were no organized police forces; each man's home was truly his own castle to defend. With stout shutters securely locked from within, {{the windows of the}} home offered no easy access to marauding Indians or urban burglars. <b>Which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> often see raised panel shutters {{on the ground floor of}} early homes and louvered above. The raised panels were much more secure against access from ground level and the louvered upstairs shutters were often later additions to the home. Exterior shutters also proved a first barrier against the elements - winter winds and summer sun alike. In the cities shutters also provided privacy screens between the residents and the considerable pedestrian traffic only feet away. Shutters were in constant use, opened and closed daily.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method to}} {{calculate}} the mean square of error when analyzing the variance of linear regression using a technique like that used in ANOVA (they are the same because ANOVA {{is a type of}} regression), the sum of squares of the residuals (aka sum of squares of the error) is divided by the degrees of freedom (where the degrees of freedom equals n − p − 1, where p is the number of parameters estimated in the model (one for each variables in the regression equation). One can then also calculate the mean square of the model by dividing the sum of squares of the model minus the degrees of freedom, which is just the number of parameters. Then the F value can be calculated by divided MS(model) by MS(error), and we can then determine significance (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> want the mean squares to begin with.).|$|E
50|$|The {{entire region}} has {{maintained}} its original natural character over the centuries, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> will find beech primeval forests, protected landscape areas or nature parks and reserves, interwoven with trails, {{right next to}} chateaux and town parks and groomed rural gardens. The gentle rolling hills interlaced with hiking trails, a dense network of cycle trails and routes leading along rivers are ideal for families with children, recreational tourists and seniors as well. Those who love excitement and sports will find plenty of adrenaline activities here. Romantics will find a corner for themselves {{not only in the}} higher parts of the mountains and dense forests, but also at meandering rivers winding through valleys, during boat rides on ponds and dams or at old castle ruins. And if you happen to get lost in mountain forests, maybe Princess Kačenka, ruler of the Eagle Mountains, will show you the right way. And in winter, Rampušák will help you out of an avalanche.|$|E

[...] "That interaction was vital. <b>Which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> get a lot of call and response on the record. Duke is a very quick guy. And very funny.
