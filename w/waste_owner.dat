40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent developments}} {{in the field of}} nuclear waste management in Canada with a focus on management of nuclear fuel waste. Of particular significance is the April 2001 tabling in the Canadian House of Commons of Bill C- 27, An Act respecting the long-term management of nuclear fuel waste. At the time of finalizing this paper (January 15, 2002), Bill C- 27 is in Third Reading in the House of Commons and is expected to move to the Senate in February. The Nuclear Fuel Waste Act is expected to come into force later in 2002. This Act requires the three nuclear utilities in Canada owning nuclear fuel waste to form a waste management organization and deposit funds into a segregated fund for nuclear fuel waste long-term management. The waste management organization is then required to perform a study of long-term management approaches for nuclear fuel waste and submit the study to the federal government within three years. The federal government will select an approach for implementation by the waste management organization. The paper discusses the activities that the nuclear fuel <b>waste</b> <b>owners</b> currently have underway to prepare for the formation of the waste management organization. As background, the paper reviews the status of interim storage of nuclear fuel waste in Canada, and describes previous initiatives related {{to the development of a}} national strategy for nuclear fuel waste long-term management...|$|R

The company says they treat about 100 different streams of <b>waste.</b> The <b>owner</b> of facility said that they never had a major problem such as this since the plant only takes non-hazardous waste. The capacity of the facility was increased to handle up to 100 gal or 140000 gal by 2014. The facility provides an environmentally safe and legal means of treating, disposing and recycling of contaminated but non-hazardous waste {{as an alternative to}} dumping untreated wastes into municipal sewer systems or into the environment. The plant uses centrifuges, electrocoagulation, carbon and micron filtration, ozone injection, dissolved air flotation, and chemical treatments. Treated waste water is sent through a pipeline to the Oxnard municipal treatment plant.|$|R

40|$|A 3 -Dimensional Geometric Modeler Using OpenGL David Phillip Cleveland Directed by Kai-Hsiung Chang The {{design of}} a Three-Dimensional Geometric Modeling {{application}} must be user friendly {{in addition to having}} useful features.

40|$|More than 80 % of {{international}} trade in goods by volume is carried by sea. The shipping industry constitutes {{a key element in}} the infrastructure of the world's social metabolism. Ocean-going ships are owned and used for their trade by developed countries but are often demolished, together with their toxic materials, in developing countries. Ship breaking is the process of dismantling an obsolete vessel's structure for scrapping or disposal. The Alang-Sosiya yard (India), one of the world largest shipbreaking yards, is studied here with particular attention to toxic <b>waste</b> management. Ship <b>owners</b> and ship breakers obtain large profits dumping the environmental costs on workers, local farmers and fishers. This unequal distribution of benefits and burdens, due to an international and national uneven distribution of power, has led to an ecological distribution conflict. The controversy at the Indian Supreme Court in 2006 over the dismantling of the ocean liner 'Blue Lady,' shows how the different languages of valuation expressed by different social groups clashed and how a language that expresses sustainability as monetary benefit at the national scale, dominated. Shipbreaking in the developing world is not just an externality but a successful case of cost shifting, or else, profit accumulation by contamination.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the knowledge, {{attitude}} and practices regarding biomedical <b>waste</b> management among <b>owners</b> of nursing homes / private hospitals. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study design conducted in the city of Lucknow for a period of 4 months between May-August, 2013. The owners of the private nursing homes / private hospitals (having bed> 50) of Lucknow city were interviewed. A total of 40 subjects were included in the study. Results: Majority (80 %) of the subjects were MD/MS in different disciplines of medicine and surgery. The duration of running of hospital was â‰¥ 10 among 57. 5 % of the subjects. About half (55 %) of the subjects received any training BMW management. There was a significant difference in the BMW knowledge and attitude scores for age greater than 40 years and less than 40 years of age (p< 0. 001). The knowledge and attitude score was higher who had any training on BMW management compared with those who did not had any training. Higher percentages of subjects (77. 5 %) were aware about HIV might transmit through BMW. Majority (90 %) felt that safe management of health care waste was an extra burden on work.

40|$|Superfund is {{the nation}} 2 Ì† 7 s program {{to clean up the}} most {{dangerous}} hazardous waste sites. The Superfund law mandates that parties responsible for hazardous waste sites (i. e., <b>waste</b> generators, site <b>owners,</b> site operators, and waste transporters) shall be financially liable for cleaning them. If responsible parties cannot be located, are unable to perform cleanups, or refuse to do so, EPA can conduct the cleanup action and seek recovery of associated costs from these delinquent parties. As the Superfund reauthorization effort ensues, it is clear that few unequivocally applaud past Superfund performance. Collectively, communities, industry, and government are critical about whether the Superfund program has actually achieved Congressional goals-speedy, effective, efficient, and permanent cleanups. Discontent and frustration is especially pronounced within communities of color. The 1986 Amendments authorized EPA to make grants of up to 50, 000 to citizens affected by an NPL site, which ostensibly enable community awareness and involvement in the remedy development, selection, and implementation process. Having experienced the most profound deficiencies of Superfund implementation, communities of color are uniquely positioned to offer meaningful suggestions for improving the program. This Essay focuses on several specific reforms which will provide immediate relief to communities in distress and will respond to the need for increased public participation in the Superfund process. These specific reforms involve the following areas: Native American Programs, Technical Assistance Grants, Community Working Groups, Health Assessments, Technologies Clearinghouse and Citizen Suits...|$|R

During his 15 years as manager of Charlton Athletic, Curbishley {{produced}} an established mid-table side. He continued {{in the same vein}} at West Ham and in his first season in charge, 2006-07, they finished 15th in the Premier League. He was also required to deal with the controversy caused under Pardew's managership by the signings of Argentine internationals Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez. He rarely used Mascherano who made only five league appearances. He also had a poor relationship with Tevez. West Ham struggled and were embroiled in problems with the FA over the legalities concerning the contracts of Mascherano and Tevez. Curbishley finally consistently picked Tevez at the start of 2008. His 26 games and 7 goals proved to be vital. West Ham maintained their Premier League status only {{on the last day of}} the season, with Tevez scoring the only goal at Old Trafford against Manchester United. Many, including Lord Griffiths, who ruled on the legality of Tevez's contract, thought maintaining their Premier League had been as much to do with the efforts of Tevez as the management skills of Curbishley. Tevez left the club in the summer and Curbishley produced what he was renowned for; a comfortable mid-table finish of tenth place with a degree of stability in defence due to the performances of Lucas Neil and Matthew Upson.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{interest}} of public sanitation {{is to maintain}} a hygienic and tidy city environment. The modern consumer society {{is based on a}} large production of goods and products with destruction of waste as a final step. The present sanitation system is a necessary link in the system serving the consumer society. It follows that the collection and destruction of household waste promotes the need for new products and as such leads to an increase in consumption. It is anticipated that this system will collapse in a long-sighted sustainable society. Future systems for the treatment of residual materials should be encompassed in closed cycles of materials in society and added to those providing waste generation. The present alternative for steering residual materials is source separation. That the Swedish population is prepared for an increased responsibility in recycling residual materials has been shown in studies in GÃ¶teborg, north west SkÃ¥ne and BorÃ¥s. However, strong motivation and a sufficiently comfortable collection system are necessary as shown by the significant correlation between ease of use and increased collection amount. Owner households successfully source separated paper, glass and biodegradable material without a need for help. However, source separation in apartments in BorÃ¥s was greatly improved by offering simple under-the-sink technology as an aid. This study showed that collected household <b>wastes</b> from <b>owner</b> households decreased from 14 kg to 4 kg per household and week (75 %) while in apartments the decrease was from 6. 3 to 2. 3 kg (65 %) after the commencement of source separation. Guidelines for the implementation of source separation are proposed. A full assessment of the success of source separation requires the application of several approaches to allow a holistic picture. Degree of recycling and purity are central approaches because they are comparable between experiments and areas involved. Absolute amounts measured as "Material Recovery Rate" are unique to each sampling area and difficult to compare. A holistic approach to the assessment of source separation will include investigations of availability to users, participation rate, resource conservation, environmental consequence analysis and environmental economics. Although good collection results are obtained it cannot be expected that source separation will be the panacea in the construction of a long term sustainable society. Source separation as a technology and a social movement is a necessity in the treatment of residuals and should be incorporated in a new resource-saving technology. However, source separation technology is constantly subject to incorporation in modern waste disposal. Recycling without a change in the system for production and consumption has no long-term effect on the use of resources or environmental protection. On the other hand, a combination of source separation with a new outlook for production and consumption can raise source separation to a key concept in a closed cycle society...|$|R

Making use of modern day Internet and computer technologies, we have come up with an online system useful in the field of construction. Our concept, Real Estate Monitoring System, enables any individual constructor to automate the manual logs maintained at a construction site. By this automation, the owner will be able {{to keep an eye on}} the daily consumption of different material, various transactions and the material ordered at the construction site. This system would, therefore, avoid the need of the owner to visit the construction site daily and thus save overall time. Many forms are provided to the supervisor to fill in the daily consumption. These forms include the daily material consumption form, material ordered form, order status form, and add employee form, etc. These forms are updated by the supervisor present at the construction site and the data entered is stored in the database. The owner, at home, logs into his account and views the data updated by the supervisor. The view provided to the owner is in the form of dynamic tables, i. e. the data being shown in the tables is altered as soon as it is changed by the supervisor. All that the owner needs to do is just refresh the page. Thus, the system provides an overall authenticity as the supervisor is ownerâ€™s one of trusted persons. Also, the time <b>wasted</b> by the <b>owner</b> in visiting the construction site everyday is saved and he can look forward to his other ongoing projects. The forms provided to the supervisor are simple and accept single values. Thus, avoiding the complexity of the html page and making the work much easier.

40|$|This report {{describes}} some of {{the multitude}} of legal devices used to control undesirable vegeta-tion, including both common law and statutory remedies. During {{the course of this}} discussion many of the land use problems caused by vegeta-tion are enumerated. Vegetation is ubiquitous; only in the most extreme environments is it lack-ing. The problems it can cause to land-owners are almost as varied as the number of plant species, and vary greatly with land use. Due to the breadth of this topic, certain areas will not be discussed because they have been thoroughly covered elsewhere. Some of these in-clude: the cultivation of controlled substances (1), problems concerning attractive nuisances (2) and interference with solar rights (3). Common Law Doctrines Common law doctrines associated with vegeta-tion control are at least as broad in their applica-bility as statutory remedies based on the police power, but are less commonly applied. The com-mon law doctrines which do have some applica-bility to cases regarding vegetation are waste law, nuisance law, and trespass law. Of these, waste law is the most limited in scope. The doctrine of <b>waste</b> allows the <b>owner</b> of the title of real property to have a cause of action re-questing damages and abrogation of tenancy in cases where the present possessor of that pro-perty allows it to become physically damaged (4). In England, waste doctrine developed prior to 1200 to protect title owners from the actions of tenants of estates created by the court and has been broadened over time to include other rela-tionships between title owner and possessor (5). Damages {{are most likely to be}} granted in cases of active waste, where a possessor or lessee ac-tively destroys the property of the title owner. In cases involving agricultural lands, the opinion of Hutton v. Warren 1 M&W 466 noted that active waste might be construed more broadly if there existed an implied contract from the custom of the country with regard to cultivated land being left to disrepair. There are a few United States cases which show that some states hold this custom, explicitly described in Anderson v. Hannon 24 P 228 (1890). One of the first is Clemence v. Steere...|$|R
