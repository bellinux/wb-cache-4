2500|$|Her friend's {{attitude}} immediately {{takes on}} a more threatening quality as a sudden lunar eclipse happens above them but before he can do anything he is confronted by Timbaland and SoShy's characters. [...] He tells them that this time he's brought a couple of friends, and the vampire and the cat man appear to back him up only for {{the three of them}} to be frightened away by much larger crowd that Timbaland summons. [...] The woman caught between the two sides looks down to see that her circular birthmark is glowing and looks like the eclipse, and the necklace worn by the vampire who <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in the club. [...] She quickly wakes up from the dream, only to see that the television is playing what it was {{at the start of the}} dream and the phone is ringing with her mother on the other end as the black cat comes in through the window.|$|E
60|$|Ashe <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with vacant eyes. He {{shook his}} head dumbly.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not take}} her hand, but <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> now, incredulously.|$|E
6000|$|EILEEN (bravely). I feel--fine. (Her eyes, as if {{looking for}} encouragement, seek Murray, who <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> worriedly.) ...|$|R
50|$|The episode {{starts with}} Bonnie (Kat Graham) in class {{when she sees}} Emily (Bianca Lawson) and she leaves the class to follow her. Emily leads her to an old burned down building. Bonnie wakes up in the class {{screaming}} and everyone <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She turns around and sees Emily sitting right {{next to her and}} Bonnie wakes up again, this time for real, in the woods.|$|R
60|$|She {{returned}} to her cottage. The sovereigns <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> from the looking-glass as she had left them. With a preoccupied countenance, and with tears in her eyes, she got a pair of scissors, and began mercilessly cutting off the long locks of her hair, arranging and tying them with their points all one way, as the barber had directed. Upon the pale scrubbed deal of the coffin-stool table they stretched like waving and ropy weeds over the washed gravel-bed of a clear stream.|$|R
60|$|I <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face. It seemed {{white and}} set in the dimness.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> passion when {{she broke off}} {{suddenly}} and ran away behind the stable.|$|E
60|$|I awoke with a {{start to}} the fact that I <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> A slight flush had crept into her pale cheeks.|$|E
60|$|I looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> rounded chin, the Jacobus chin; at the full, {{red lips}} pouting in the powdered, sallow face; {{at the firm}} {{modelling}} of the cheek, the grains of white in the hairs of the straight sombre eyebrows; at the long eyes, a narrowed gleam of liquid white and intense motionless black, with their gaze so empty of thought, and so absorbed in their fixity that she seemed to <b>be</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> own lonely image, in some far-off mirror hidden from my sight amongst the trees.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} head away, and looked out into the restaurant. It seemed {{incredible}} that all these people, placidly intent upon their food and their small talk, should not <b>be</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> wondering {{what she was going}} to say; nudging each other and speculating. Their detachment made her feel alone and helpless. She was nothing to them and they did not care what happened to her, just as she had been nothing to those frozen marshes down at Brookport. She was alone in an indifferent world, with her own problems to settle for herself.|$|R
5000|$|Gervais Miller from Lock and Key is {{mentioned}} as having once been Dave's only friend. He got his nickname [...] "Gerv the Perv" [...] from Riley because he <b>was</b> always <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> chest.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Nick had risen, and he, too, <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> How {{he managed to}} appear so well dressed was a puzzle to me.|$|E
60|$|She paused; and then, {{observing that}} Tottie <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> she advised {{her to make}} the most of her opportunity, and eat as much as possible.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Anne had become aware that Diana <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in {{precisely}} the same bewildered fashion as Priscilla had done. It was really too much.|$|E
60|$|Victoria became aware--for {{the first}} time that Hilary Vane's {{housekeeper}} had not moved; that Euphrasia Cotton <b>was</b> still <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in a most disconcerting manner, and was paying no attention whatever to Hilary.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, let's {{hope that}} they don't find out {{anything}} about it," [...] I replied, to change the subject. Then taking Roderick by the hand I led him to where Maqueda stood a yard or two apart, listening to our talk, but, of course, understanding very little of it, and introduced him to her, explaining in a few words the wonderful thing that had happened. She welcomed him very kindly, and congratulated me upon my son's escape. Meanwhile, Roderick had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with evident admiration. Now he turned {{to us and said}} in his quaint broken English: ...|$|R
6000|$|CHRIS--[Who has <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face admiringly, {{not hearing}} what she says--impulsively.] You know you vas awful pooty gel, Anna? Ay bet all men see {{you fall in}} love with you, py yiminy! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{friendly}} magician <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{with a pair}} {{of round}} eyes that in spite of their amazement looked kindly and understanding. They probably encouraged Malvina to complete the confession of her sad brief history.|$|E
60|$|She {{saw that}} a boy {{of four or five}} <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> from the hall, a boy in gingham shirt and faded {{corduroy}} trousers, but large-eyed, firm-mouthed, wide-browed. He vanished, then peeped in again, biting his knuckles, turning his shoulder toward her in shyness.|$|E
60|$|A girl in blue {{had risen}} from the nearest table, and <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in astonishment. Jill {{recognized}} her instantly. Those big, pathetic eyes, like a lost child's, were unmistakable. It was the parrot girl, the girl whom she and Freddie Rooke had found in the drawing-room at Ovingdon Square that afternoon when {{the foundations of the}} world had given way and chaos had begun.|$|E
6000|$|... "Capital!" [...] said Sir Mallaby. [...] "Old friends, eh? Miss Bennett," [...] {{he turned}} to Billie, who had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> wide-eyed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> late fianc√©, [...] "let me present my son, Sam. Sam, this is Miss Bennett." ...|$|R
5000|$|Miss Emily Sidley teaches third grade. On one {{particular}} day {{while she is}} teaching spelling, she gets the disconcerting feeling that one of <b>her</b> students <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> She turns around and notices that Robert, the quietest student, has his gaze fixed on her. During the following week, Miss Sidley eventually punishes Robert for her suspicions. Robert taunts her by asking her {{if she wants to}} see him [...] "change", which he does (whether it really happened or was a figment of her imagination is not exactly explained) and terrifies the teacher who runs screaming and is nearly run down by a bus.|$|R
50|$|The Siren is a {{painting}} by John William Waterhouse. The painting depicts a siren sitting {{at the edge of}} a cliff, lyre in hand, <b>staring</b> down <b>at</b> a shipwrecked sailor floating in water, who in turn <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... --Indeed you might, {{answered}} Heron. We saw her, Wallis, didn't we? And deucedly pretty she is too. And inquisitive! AND WHAT PART DOES STEPHEN TAKE, MR DEDALUS? AND WILL STEPHEN NOT SING, MR DEDALUS? Your governor <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{through that}} eyeglass of his {{for all he}} was worth so that I think the old man has found you out too. I wouldn't care a bit, by Jove. She's ripping, isn't she, Wallis? ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was dead}} silence {{as the young}} girl had {{finished}} speaking. Wessex <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and Mr. Thomas Norton assures us that he burst out laughing, a laugh which the Queen's printer stigmatizes as [...] "heartless and unworthy a high-born gentleman! for truly," [...] he continues, [...] "the Lady Ursula Glynde was moved by the spirit of God in thus making a tardy confession, and His Grace, methinks, should have shown a proper spirit of reverence before this manifestation of God." ...|$|E
60|$|She sighed with satisfaction, {{holding the}} paper tightly between her jewelled fingers; that talisman which perhaps would save her brother Armand's life. Sir Andrew <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> too dazed {{for the moment}} to realize what had {{actually}} happened; he had been taken so completely by surprise, that he seemed quite unable to grasp {{the fact that the}} slip of paper, which she held in her dainty hand, was one perhaps on which the life of his comrade might depend.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! I thought so," [...] cried Mrs. Brinkley. She {{looked up}} with {{whimsical}} {{pleasure in the}} uncertainty of an old gentleman who <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>her</b> through his glasses. [...] "Well," [...] {{she said with a}} pleasant sharpness, [...] "do you make me out?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} <b>at</b> him over <b>her</b> spectacles. He <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> back <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> unswerving. She met {{his eyes for}} a moment, then took off her glasses. He was white. The male was up in him, dominant. She {{did not want to see}} him too clearly.|$|R
6000|$|The girl came in, {{carrying}} a tiny bunch of lilies of the valley; <b>her</b> face fell <b>at</b> sight of Mr. Stone; she stood still, raising the lilies to her breast. Nothing {{could have been}} more striking than the change from her look of guttered expectancy to a sort of hard dismay. A spot of red came into both her cheeks. She gazed from Mr. Stone to Hilary and back again. Both <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> No one spoke. The little model's bosom began heaving as though she had been running; she said faintly: [...] "Look; I brought you this, Mr. Stone!" [...] and held out to him the bunch of lilies. But Mr. Stone made no sign. [...] "Don't you like them?" ...|$|R
60|$|But Michael {{knew nothing}} of this. And the big Persian knew of his {{existence}} before he did of hers. In fact, the first he knew was when she launched herself upon {{him out of the}} open wheel-house doorway. Even as he glimpsed this abrupt danger, and before he could know what it was, he leaped sideways and saved himself. From his point of view, the assault was unprovoked. He <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with bristling hair, recognizing her for what she was, a cat, when she sprang again, her tail {{the size of a large}} man's arm, all claws and spitting fury and vindictiveness.|$|E
60|$|Newly arrayed in {{the most}} {{becoming}} of grey furs, she met him at that hitherto fabled restaurant which in future days--she reflected--was to become so familiar--Delmonico's. Howard was awaiting her in the vestibule; {{and it was not}} without a little quiver of timidity and excitement and a consequent rise of colour that she followed the waiter to a table by the window. She felt as though the assembled fashionable world <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> but presently gathered courage enough to gaze at the costumes of the women and the faces of the men. Howard, with a sang froid of which she felt a little proud, ordered a meal for which he eventually paid a fraction over eight dollars. What would Aunt Mary have said to such extravagance? He produced a large bunch of violets.|$|E
60|$|He {{was less}} {{to her than}} the dust under her feet, and his protestations had not even the power to rouse her wrath. Indeed, all that worried her at this moment was vexation with herself for having troubled {{to listen to him}} at all: it had been worse than foolish to suppose that he had any news to impart which did not {{directly}} concern himself. So now, while he, utterly taken aback, <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> open-mouthed and bewildered, she turned away, cold and full of disdain, gathering her draperies round her, and started to walk slowly toward the stairs. Her clinging white skirt made a soft, swishing sound as it brushed the tiled floor, and she herself--with her slender figure, graceful neck and crown of golden curls, looked, as the gloom of evening wrapped her in, more like an intangible elf--an apparition--gliding through space, than just a scornful woman who had thought fit to reject the importunate addresses of an unwelcome suitor.|$|E
60|$|Kells stared <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{the evil}} and {{hardness}} of his passion corded in his face. And {{the shadows of}} comprehending thought in his strange eyes showed {{the other side of}} the man. He <b>was</b> still <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> while he reached to put aside the curtains; then he dropped his head and went out.|$|R
50|$|After the date, Qi Yue {{left for}} home. After {{she took her}} bath, she fainted and was saved by Ah Mon's father. He brings her to his house {{to take care of}} her while her mom was away on a trip. Ah Mon and Qi Yue meet again at his house. She knows from Yuan Yi that she has {{misunderstood}} Ah Mon again. Seeing Ah Mon has injured his hand, she offers to clean the wounds for him. Sitting on Ah Mon's bed and putting medicine on his hand, she realizes Ah Mon <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> intensely and this makes her heart pound. Qi Yue wakes up and finds herself sleeping on Ah Mon's bed. Apparently, both have fallen asleep and Ah Mon's father has carried her to his bed.|$|R
50|$|As a teenager, Dale {{witnesses}} {{the apparent}} {{murder of his}} mother, Eileen, by his meth-addicted father. When the police arrive, they confront and kill Dale's father. The officer who discovers Eileen runs {{from the house and}} vomits, but Dale re-enters the house and tells his mother that everything will be all right. Years later in Las Vegas, Dale moves next door to married couple Sarah and Josh, who introduce themselves by taking over cookies. Although disappointed that the cookies are not homemade, Dale accepts them anyway. Josh explains that he is a croupier and Sarah a graduate student who is working on her dissertation on the effects of pornography. When Sarah questions Dale as to why he <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> he says that she reminds him of someone, later revealed to be his mother.|$|R
