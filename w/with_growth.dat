This provided Mountfort and Luck ample opportunity to practice their trade. In 1855 they produced a preliminary design for the new Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings in timber. The buildings were constructed from 1857–59, but in a more limited form than the original design. As the Provincial Council gained new functions <b>with</b> <b>growth</b> in the population and economy of the province, the buildings were enlarged with a North wing in stone and an iron clock tower from 1859–60, and further enlarged with a stone council chamber and refreshment rooms in 1864–65.

The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and <b>with</b> <b>growth</b> under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008.

The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Ryan Schott {{and colleagues}} made a more {{comprehensive}} analysis of cranial dome ontogeny in S. validum. The {{study found that the}} parietosquamosal shelf conserved the arrangement of ornamentation throughout growth, and that vascularity of the frontoparietal domes decreased with size. It also found that dome shape and size was strongly correlated <b>with</b> <b>growth,</b> and that growth was allometric (in contrast to isometric) from flat to domed, supporting Ornatotholus as a juvenile Stegoceras. They also hypothesized that this model of dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental trajectory of pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's observation that the supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, there was still a high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless {{of the size of the}} frontoparietal, and this feature may therefore have been independent of ontogeny.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{was first}} {{detected}} in human organs and fetal tissues {{in the late}} 19th century. In humans there are no defined lithium deficiency diseases, but low lithium intakes from water supplies were associated with increased rates of suicides, homicides and the arrest rates for drug use and other crimes. The biochemical mechanisms of action of lithium appear to be multifactorial and are intercorrelated with the functions of several enzymes, hormones and vitamins, as well as <b>with</b> <b>growth</b> and transforming factors.

40|$|A {{model that}} couples Larkin's predator-prey model, Ivlev's feeding model, Ursin's growth {{equation}} and the exponential mortality model {{was applied for}} simulation of the responses of fish populations to exploitation. Simulations were done without food-limited <b>growth,</b> <b>with</b> food-limited <b>growth,</b> <b>with</b> food limited <b>growth</b> and size-specific mortality, and <b>with</b> food-limited <b>growth</b> and age at maturity a function of size. Without food-limited growth there was no compensation for exploitation and the population became extinct {{with an increase in}} mortality. <b>With</b> food-limited <b>growth</b> the population compensated for fishing mortality; as abundance decreased, size increased, and production of eggs by the population increased. With either mortality or age at maturity a function of size, compensation was much higher than <b>with</b> food-limited <b>growth</b> alone. Recruitment decreased with increase in exploitation. There was an association between numbers of spawners and recruits, but both the number of spawners and the number of recruits were determined by food limited growth. If age at maturity is a function of size, there are fluctuations in population abundance when fishing mortality is low, but not when fishing mortality is high...|$|R

40|$|This paper uncovers {{a series}} of {{empirical}} facts regarding the sources of U. S. urban growth in the 1880 s. We use a large theoretical literature to provide motivations {{for a number of}} potential sources of growth, particularly those based on geographical proximity externalities. These sources are characterised and linked to empirical proxies. Then we estimate the covariation of these empirical proxies <b>with</b> the <b>growth</b> rate in output, capital and labor respectively. We find that traditional (neoclassical), several geographic externality, and socio-political factors all covary significantly <b>with</b> aggregate <b>growth,</b> though in very specific ways. For example, the size of a city (a measure of the degree of urbanization) is uncorrelated <b>with</b> output <b>growth,</b> positively correlated <b>with</b> labor <b>growth,</b> and negatively correlated <b>with</b> capital <b>growth.</b> No one extant theory of growth accounts simultaneously for all the phenomena that we observe. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The X syndrome, {{related to}} {{coronary}} disease in adults, could be possibly programmed priory to delivery, in children <b>with</b> intrauterine <b>growth</b> retardation. Aim: To measure serum lipids in newborns with symmetrical or asymmetrical intrauterine growth retardation. Patients and methods: One hundred thirty five newborns <b>with</b> intrauterine <b>growth</b> retardation and 116 normal term newborns, with 38 to 41 gestational weeks, were studied. Total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apoproteins. A 1 and B were measured in imbilical cord blood samples. Results: No differences in total, HDL, LDL cholesterol, apoproteins A 1 and B were observed between the study groups. Triglycerides were higher in newborns <b>with</b> intrauterine <b>growth</b> retardation, compared to normal term newborns (45 ± 27 and 36 ± 19 mg/dl respectively, p< 0, 001).
