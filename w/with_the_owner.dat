5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1934, Brimsek was invited to the Detroit Red Wings {{training}} camp for a shot at playing in the National Hockey League (NHL). Jack Adams, the Red Wings' coach and manager, made a bad impression on Brimsek. He felt that Adams {{had a habit of}} favoritism. This led him to try out for another professional team, the Baltimore Orioles of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League (EAHL). Unfortunately for Brimsek, the Orioles decided to cut him. Disappointed, Brimsek hitchhiked back to Eveleth. On his way back home, he had a chance meeting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> of the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets, John H. Harris. The Yellow Jackets were in need for a goaltender and Harris proceeded to sign Brimsek to the team.

5|$|The 26-year-old FitzRoy had {{hopes of}} {{commanding}} a second expedition {{to continue the}} South American survey, but when he heard that the Lords of the Admiralty no longer supported this, he grew concerned about how to return the Fuegians who had been taught English {{with the idea that}} they could become missionaries. He made an agreement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> of a small merchant-vessel to take himself and five others back to South America, but a kind uncle heard of this and contacted the Admiralty. Soon afterwards FitzRoy heard that he was to be appointed commander of HMS Chanticleer to go to Tierra del Fuego, but due to her poor condition Beagle was substituted. On 27 June 1831 FitzRoy was commissioned as commander of the voyage, and Lieutenants John Clements Wickham and Bartholomew James Sulivan were appointed.|$|E
5|$|The AWS has {{a mind of}} its own {{at times}} and reaches peak {{performance}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> who is dedicated to teaching the dog just what is expected of it. The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{political}} discussion has been about building a stadium, beginning in the 1990s when a Maryland location was chosen for what is now FedExField. With the possibility of building a new stadium in the near future, both the previous and current mayors of the District of Columbia have stated that a name change {{must be part of}} the discussion, however the team rejects that possibiltiy. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has met <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> to discuss the building of a new stadium in Virginia. For many years, beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts, the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states. This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens. Several Maryland politicians have stated that the name should change, but the current governor opposes any change, also citing the desire to keep the stadium in Maryland. Virginia fans are now the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins, and the state and local governments have used economic incentives to encourage the team's relocation of its facilities there, and maintain that the name is entirely a business decision for the team to make. An agency of the commonwealth, the Virginia Lottery, is a sponsor of the team, and says it has never had any complaints.|$|E
