In July, Melody Maker referred to the album as [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "interesting", though NME wrote in October that there was [...] "not nearly enough variety to make it entertaining". It received radio plays from the BBC's more progressive disc-jockeys such as John Peel and Bob Harris. Drake was unhappy with the inlay sleeve, which printed songs in the wrong running order and reproduced verses omitted from the recorded versions. In an interview his sister Gabrielle said: [...] "He was very secretive. I knew he was making an album but I didn't know what stage of completion it was at until he <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> room and said, 'There you are.' He threw it onto the bed and walked out!" ...|$|E

In 1917 she became acquainted with a mother of newborn twins, {{one of whom was}} chronically ill. The child's parents were unable to get adequate treatment for their son's condition. Lois formed a close bond with the baby, who was named Clarence Ignatius Morrison, and offered to take him and help him find treatment. She and Marshall had been unable to have children, and when she brought the baby home, Marshall told that she could [...] "keep him, provided he did not squall". Marshall grew to love the boy and wrote that he [...] "never walked the streets of Washington with as sure a certainty as he <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> heart", and, as the boy grew older, that he was [...] "beautiful as an angel; brilliant beyond his years; lovable from every standpoint".|$|E

Being rather early, those men and boys who happened to have nothing particular to do, and were curious in foreigners, came (according to custom) round the carriage in which I sat; let down all the windows; thrust in their heads and shoulders; hooked themselves on conveniently, by their elbows; and fell to comparing notes on the subject of my personal appearance, with as much indifference as if I were a stuffed figure. I never gained so much uncompromising information with reference to my own nose and eyes, and various impressions wrought by my mouth and chin on different minds, and how my head looks when it is viewed from behind, as on these occasions. Some gentlemen were only satisfied by exercising their sense of touch; and the boys (who are surprisingly precocious in America) were seldom satisfied, even by that, but would return to the charge over and over again. Many a budding president has <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> room with his cap on his head and his hands in his pockets, and stared at me for two whole hours: occasionally refreshing himself with a tweak of his nose, or a draught from the water-jug; or by walking to the windows and inviting other boys in the street below, to come up and do likewise: crying, 'Here he is!' 'Come on!' 'Bring all your brothers!' with other hospitable entreaties of that nature.|$|E
