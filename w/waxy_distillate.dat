5000|$|Most {{petroleum}} waxes {{are derived}} from the by-products of lubricant oils. Specifically, Group I motor oils result in a <b>waxy</b> <b>distillate</b> formed during the separation and refining of crude oils. This by-product will typically have a 5-20% oil content. IGI maintains [...] "de-oiling" [...] refining facilities {{that are able to}} remove the oil and be left with a finished wax product. Trends in industries such as automotive have put increased demand on lubrication oils and thus a trend towards using Group II and III has been seen in recent years. These types of oils do not contain a waxy by-product and also are not as crude oil dependent as Group I oils. This has resulted in an overall decrease in the diversity of North American feedstocks suitable for the manufacture of petroleum waxes.|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} oxidation of petroleum <b>waxy</b> <b>distillate</b> (boiling range 400 - 440 °C at 760 nun Hg) using KMn 04 catalyst and air was studied in a batch reactor. The effect of reaction temperature (100 - 160 °C), {{air flow rate}} (0. 5 - 1. 5 L/min per 100 g wax) and catalyst weight (0. 4 - 0. 6 % by wt. of wax) on the acid number of the reaction mixture was studied. Monobasic acids with an average number of carbon atoms/molecule of C^. C^ could be obtained. The surface active properties of the soap solutions made from the obtained fatty acids (after separation from the reaction mixture, followed by purification) confirm that this soap can be successfully used as household soap. This will help to reduce the consumption of edible oils for soap making...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Light dewaxed oil was {{produced}} through dewaxing {{process of the}} light <b>waxy</b> <b>distillate</b> raffinate of crude oil from Western Desert of Egypt using methyl ethyl ketone/toluene mixed solvent. Hydrofinishing process {{was used to remove}} the non-hydrocarbon constituents and to improve the physicochemical properties of the produced oils such as color, viscosity index, inhibition responses, oxidation and thermal stability. The operating parameters which affected the quality of the hydrofinished oils were studied separately at different values that including reactor temperature, reactor pressure, liquid hourly space velocity and hydrogen to hydrocarbon ratio. The optimum operating conditions to be adopted for producing high quality automatic transmission fluid base oil were reactor temperature 290 oC, pressure 130 kg cm 2, liquid hourly space velocity 0. 4 h 1 and hydrogen/hydrocarbon ratio 800 Nm 3 M 3. The effect of changing hydrofinishing temperature and liquid hourly space velocity on the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) reactions as well as their thermodynamic parameters were estimated. Calculations of activation energy (Ea) and free energy of activation (∆G) indicated that HDS was easier to occur than HDN and these reactions are more faster at higher temperatures.

The effect of commercial and formulated additives {{on the quality of the}} hydrofinished oil was also studied. Automatic transmission fluid possessing the Dexron IID specification {{was produced}} by adding 7 wt% from Infenium T 442 additive or by adding 9 wt% from Lubrizol ® 6701 D additive to the hydrofinished light dewaxed oil. Oils with the same efficiency were also produced using a formulated additive containing 4 % viscosity index improver, 1. 5 % anti-oxidant and 1 % anti-wear. The effect of increasing Infenium T 442, Lubrizol R 6701 D and formulated additive percents on the protection efficiency of the automatic transmission fluid was studied through AC impedance technique. According to this technique, the effect of these additives on the corrosion rate of carbon steel coupons can be negligible. </font...|$|E
