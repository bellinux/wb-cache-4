Currently, surface landmarks are used for thoracic cavity registration; however, this approach is unreliable due to skin movement relative to the ribs. An alternative method for providing surgeons with image feedback {{in the operating room}} is to integrate images acquired during surgery with images acquired pre-operatively. This integration process is required to be automatic, fast, accurate and robust; however inter-modal image registration is difficult {{due to the lack of}} a direct relationship between the intensities of the two image sets. To address this problem, Computed Tomography (CT) was used to acquire pre-operative images and Ultrasound (US) was used to acquire peri-operative images. Since bone has a high electron density and is highly echogenic, the rib cage is visualized as a bright <b>white</b> <b>boundary</b> in both datasets. The proposed approach utilizes the ribs as the basis for an intensity-based registration method – mutual information. We validated this approach using a thorax phantom. Validation results demonstrate that this approach is accurate and shows little variation between operators. The fiducial registration error, the registration error between the US and CT images, was < 1. 5 mm. We propose this registration method as a basis for precise tracking of minimally invasive thoracic procedures. This method will permit the planning and guidance of image-guided minimally invasive procedures for the lungs, as well as for both catheter-based and direct trans-mural interventions within the beating heart...|$|E

Ainda assim, a abordagem do tema envolvendo personagens na infÃncia e/ou prÃ-adolescÃncia continua bastante rarefeita na criaÃÃo literÃria brasileira. ApÃs um levantamento do que jÃ se produziu em nossa literatura com a homoafetividade na infÃncia sendo diretamente ou mesmo sutilmente abordada nos textos, a partir da publicaÃÃo de O Ateneu, de Raul PompÃia, em 1888, selecionamos quatro narrativas por meio das quais analisamos como as personagens literÃrias em idade infantil vivem situaÃÃes de desejo homoafetivo: o prÃprio O Ateneu; CapitÃes da areia (1937), de Jorge Amado; Dona SinhÃ e o filho padre (1964), de Gilberto Freyre; e Limite branco (1970), de Caio Fernando Abreu. Verificamos as representaÃÃes de poder surgidas a partir de contextos em que a crianÃa se apresenta envolvida nesse tipo de relaÃÃo, seja nas interaÃÃes entre as personagens, adultos e crianÃas, ou de acordo com o contexto apresentado (famÃlia, escola, igreja, rua) e ainda no que toca Ã prÃpria linguagem literÃria utilizada pelos ficcionistas. Para subsidiar a anÃlise, trabalhamos os conceitos de infÃncia, sexualidade, homoafetividade, poder (segundo Michel Foucault), com base no aparato teÃrico a respeito das personagens literÃrias. The Brazilian {{production of}} homoaffective themes/issues in literature evolved significantly both in {{quantitative and qualitative}} terms throughout the twentieth century. Still, the approach to the subject involving characters in childhood and / or pre â adolescence is quite scarce in Brazilian literary creation. Based on a survey {{of what has been}} written in Brazilian literature regarding homoaffective relations in childhood addressed in the texts directly or in a subtle way, from the publication of O Ateneu (The Athenaeum), by Raul Pompeia, in 1888, four narratives were selected, through which we analyze how literary child characters face homoaffective desire: O Ateneu; CapitÃes da areia (Captains of the sands) (1937) by Jorge Amado, Dona SinhÃ e o filho padre (Mother and son) (1964), by Gilberto Freyre, and Limite branco (<b>White</b> <b>boundary)</b> (1970), by Caio Fernando Abreu. We analyzed the representations of power arising from contexts in which the child has engaged in this kind of relationship, the interactions between the characters, adults and children, in relation to the given context (family, school, church, street) and the literary language used by the authors. To complement this analysis, we dealt with the concepts of childhood, sexuality, homosexuality, power (according to Michel Foucault), based on the theoretical background and apparatus of the literary characters...|$|E

The label map visualizes the correspondence between the hemispheres regarding the asymmetry measure. I: corpus callosum, left side view. II: Top view. Asymmetry Measure by Backprojection The main problem in defining asymmetry measurements is to determine correspondence. Establishing correspondence between brain hemispheres is tackled by several groups (e. g. [4]), but is not well defined, since the brain is not strictly symmetric and depicts structures which appear only in one hemisphere. The approach chosen in our application is to project the distances back from the <b>white</b> matter <b>boundary</b> to the corpus callosum along optimal paths. An implicit correspondence is given at the corpus callosum, since every point belongs to both hemispheres. Measurements projected from both sides to a single point on the corpus callosum can therefore be compared directly for asymmetry. The correspondence can be visualized with the label map (Fig. 4) which represents the labels of closest seed points. Points at the <b>white</b> matter <b>boundary</b> with the same label project back to single points on the corpus callosum. Distance values collected at every point on the corpus callosum are averaged, resulting in a left and right callosal distance map. The asymmetry measure is calculated by applying a low-pass filter {{to the difference between}} the left and right callosal distance maps. The asymmetry measure can be visualized as a color-coded 3 D mesh (Fig. 6) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{automated}} {{estimation of}} cell division rate {{plays an important}} role in the evaluation of a gene function in high throughput biomedical research. Automatic segmentation and cell counting of phase contrast images, which are widely used in cell cultures when colorless cell specimen was observed with high magnifications, is a challengeable task because of low contrast boundary on membranes and similar intensities between cell inside areas and outside areas. In this paper we propose a fully automatic system for phase contrast cell image segmentation. Our system consists of three steps: cell detection, foreground segmentation and individual cell segmentation. Cell detection is done by AdaBoost algorithm, and the detected cells are used as seeds for cell segmentation. Boosting is an effective way to select discriminative features. Dark dots in the nuclei and <b>white</b> <b>boundaries</b> around the membranes are detected by the Mexican Hat Wavelet, and these features are selected by AdaBoost algorithm to generate a robust detector. The foreground segmentation is done by classifying intensities, gradients and rotation invariant local binary patterns (LBP) with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The rotation invariant LBP model provides a measure of local contrast besides gradients. The histograms of intensities, gradient magnitude and LBP are converted to feature vectors by taking different percentiles from accumulative densities. The sub-windows with feature vectors are classified by a RBF kernel SVM into foreground and background. Individual cell segmentation is done by watershed algorithm with detected cell centers as seeds. Over segmented areas without seeds are merged into neighboring regions. Our methods can get accurate segmentations on the phase contrast microscopy images of live cells, fulfill automatic cell counting and provide clues for cell morphologies and cell motion tracking. Our segmentation results are compared to manually-defined ground truth. Both recall and precision measures for segmentation accuracy are above 95 %...|$|R

In the present work we study in detail how effective the evaporation works at different distances from the white dwarf. A one-zone model was used as before, because the most important changes happen close to the inner edge of the disk. We discuss the link between the rotating accretion disk corona and the thermal boundary layer close to the white dwarf. The physics of the thermal layer has similarity with the layer {{at the bottom of the}} accretion disk corona, where the temperature rises from photospheric to coronal values.
