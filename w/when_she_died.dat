5|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>died,</b> Tubman {{was buried}} with semi-military honors at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn. The city commemorated {{her life with}} a plaque on the courthouse. Although it showed pride for her many achievements, its use of dialect ("I nebber run my train off de track"), {{apparently}} chosen for its authenticity, {{has been criticized for}} undermining her stature as an American patriot and dedicated humanitarian. Still, the dedication ceremony was a powerful tribute to her memory, and Booker T. Washington delivered the keynote address. The Harriet Tubman home was abandoned after 1920, but was later renovated by the AME Zion Church. Today, it welcomes visitors as a museum and education center.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{was born}} in England but was sent to Hanover in his {{adolescence}} for his education and military training.

Although his marriage in 1815 to the twice-widowed Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz met with the disapproval of his mother, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, it proved a happy one. By 1817, King George III had only one legitimate grandchild, Princess Charlotte of Wales, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>died</b> in childbirth, Ernest was the senior son to be both married and not estranged from his wife. This gave him some prospect of succeeding to the British throne. However, both of his unmarried older brothers quickly married, and King George's fourth son, Edward, Duke of Kent, fathered the eventual British monarch, Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation.

The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>died</b> and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
