5|$|According to the Augustan History, Odaenathus {{was assassinated}} by a cousin named Maeonius. In Augustan History, Odaenathus' son {{from his first}} wife was named Herodes and was crowned co-ruler by his father. The Augustan History claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a time {{because she did not}} accept her stepson as his father's heir (ahead of her own children). The Augustan History does not suggest that Zenobia <b>was</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the events leading to her husband's murder, and the crime is {{attributed}} to Maeonius' moral degeneration and jealousy. This account, according to historian Alaric Watson, can be dismissed as fictional. Although some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia <b>was</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the assassination due to political ambition and opposition to her husband's pro-Roman policy, she continued Odaenathus' policies during her first years on the throne.|$|E

5|$|After the war Alvarez <b>was</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> {{the design}} of a liquid {{hydrogen}} bubble chamber that allowed his team to take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He <b>was</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> a project to x-ray the Egyptian pyramids to search for unknown chambers.

40|$|Our {{work has}} {{suggested}} that a high-frequency event <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the initiation phase of malignant transformation in vitro; a later, mutationlike event appears to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the later stages of transformation. There may be no specific "target gene" which directly interacts with carcinogens. It is hypothesized that nonspecific types of DNA damage <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the induction of an ongoing process we know as carcinogenesis. Several genes could <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> maintaining this process. Our recent results suggest that c-myc and c-fos could <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> {{the early stages of}} carcinogenesis, as they are affected by anticarcinogenic protease inhibitors in a manner that corresponds {{to the way in which}} protease inhibitors suppress malignant transformation...|$|R

5|$|Barton's {{subsequent}} conviction, {{a four-month}} suspended sentence for the earlier assault on Ousmane Dabo at Manchester City, was handed out while serving this sentence. He returned to playing action on 30 August 2008, six {{days before his}} FA hearing, as a second-half substitute during Newcastle's 3–0 defeat to Arsenal. He came on to a chorus of boos from the Arsenal supporters. Shortly into this return match, Barton <b>was</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> an incident with Samir Nasri, putting in a strong tackle, for which the referee did not give a foul. The tackle, though hard, was legal. Minutes later, Nasri deliberately clipped Barton while tracking back, {{for which he was}} booked.
