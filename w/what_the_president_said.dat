[...] "In short," [...] Kuypers explained, [...] "if someone were relying only on the mainstream media for information, they would have no idea <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> actually <b>said.</b> It {{was as if the}} press were reporting on a different speech." [...] The study is essentially a [...] "comparative framing analysis." [...] Overall, Kuypers examined themes about 9-11 and the War on Terror that President Bush used and compared them to themes that the press used when reporting on what he said.|$|R

5000|$|Kuypers' third {{book was}} Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age. According to Kuypers, [...] "The idea {{the book was}} to look for themes about 9-11 and the War on Terror that the President used, and then look at what themes the press used when {{reporting}} on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>said.</b> After identifying themes, I determine how those themes are framed. Through this comparative analysis, we can detect differences in the frames presented to the American people, and determine the nature of any press bias." [...] Kuypers found that the news media echoed the president's themes and the framing of those themes immediately following 9/11. But just eight weeks later, the press had changed its manner of reporting, was actually framing Bush as an enemy of civil liberties, and was actively helping critics of the president.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} This Just In: What I Couldn't Tell You on TV, CBS News {{correspondent}} Bob Schieffer, who was {{serving as a}} reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram when Cronkite's editorial aired, acknowledged that Johnson did not see the original broadcast but also defended the allegation that Johnson had made the remark. According to Schieffer, Johnson's aide George Christian [...] "told me that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> apparently saw some clips of it the next day" [...] and that [...] "That's when he made the remark about Cronkite. But he knew then that it would take more than Americans were willing to give it." [...] When asked about the remark during a 1979 interview, Christian claimed he had no recollection about <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> had <b>said.</b> In his 1996 memoir A Reporter's Life, Cronkite claimed he was at first unsure about how much of an impact his editorial report had on Johnson's decision to drop his bid for re-election, and what eventually convinced him that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> had made <b>the</b> statement was Bill Moyers, fellow journalist and former aide to Johnson, telling him [...] "The <b>president</b> flipped off <b>the</b> set and said 'If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost Middle America.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|We {{would also}} {{do well to}} {{remember}} the sort of complexity and humility that Carter tried to inject into political rhetoric... Carter was unwilling to pander to <b>the</b> people... <b>What</b> Carter really did in the speech was profound. He warned Americans that the 1979 energy crisis - both a shortage of gas and higher prices - stemmed from the country's way of life. [...] "Too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption. Human identity is no longer defined by what one does but by <b>what</b> one owns", <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>said.</b> Consumerism provided people with false happiness, he suggested, but it also prevented Americans from re-examining their lives in order to confront the profound challenge the energy crisis elicited. Despite failures Carter left behind a way of talking about the country's promise and its need to confront what is undoubtedly one of its biggest challenges - to solve the energy crisis {{in a way that}} takes seriously both our limits and our greatness.|$|R

Talleyrand he come round to Hundred and Eighteen {{in a day or two}} to thank Toby for his kindness. I didn't mention the dice-playing, but I could see that Red Jacket's doings had made Talleyrand highly curious about Indians--though he would call him the Huron. Toby, as you may believe, was all holds full of knowledge concerning their manners and habits. He only needed a listener. The Brethren don't study Indians much till they join the Church, but Toby knew 'em wild. So evening after evening Talleyrand crossed his sound leg over his game one and Toby poured forth. Having been adopted into the Senecas I, naturally, kept still, but Toby 'ud call on me to back up some of his remarks, and by that means, and a habit he had of drawing you on in talk, Talleyrand saw I knew something of his noble savages too. Then he tried a trick. Coming back from an emigre party he turns into his little shop and puts it to me, laughing like, that I'd gone with the two chiefs on their visit to Big Hand. I hadn't told. Red Jacket hadn't told, and Toby, of course, didn't know. 'Twas just Talleyrand's guess. [...] "Now," [...] he says, [...] "my English and Red Jacket's French was so bad that I am not sure I got <b>the</b> rights of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> really <b>said</b> to <b>the</b> unsophisticated Huron.
