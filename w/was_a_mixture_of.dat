5|$|The {{recording}} of Wicked Lester's album, {{which began in}} November 1971 at Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village, took place over multiple sessions and was finished in July 1972. The album <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> original material and covers, showcasing the group's eclectic style. Three of the songs recorded for the Wicked Lester album would later resurface as Kiss songs, {{with varying degrees of}} similarity.|$|E
5|$|Although {{in places}} there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> {{different}} companies and platoons dug in together, the Australians were deployed with the 8th Battalion {{in the south}} still centred on Bolton's Ridge. North of them, covering the southern sector of 400 Plateau, were the mixed together 6th and 7th Battalions, both now commanded by Colonel Walter McNicoll of the 6th. North {{of them was the}} 5th Battalion, and the 10th Battalion covered the northern sector of 400 Plateau at Johnston's Jolly. But by now they were battalions in name only, having all taken heavy casualties; the commanders had little accurate knowledge of where their men were located.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century Conisbrough Castle {{was in a}} poor {{state of}} repair, and a royal survey carried out in 1537 and 1538 showed that the gates, bridge {{and parts of the}} walls had {{collapsed}} in a spectacular land slippage, and that one floor of the keep had also fallen in. The collapse of the walls was a consequence of the instability of the topsoil on top of the limestone spur, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and liable to crack.|$|E

5|$|The first intercollegiate {{football}} {{game was played}} on November 6, 1869, between the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, then known as the Rutgers Queensmen, and the New Jersey Tigers, now the Princeton Tigers. The game <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> rugby and soccer, with teams scoring by kicking {{the ball into the}} opponent's net. The game slowly developed, with many new and safer rules being added during the early 1870s. The number of schools participating in the sport also grew. However, even with the expansion, Princeton dominated the game, being declared the champion eight times in ten years. Yale was the only team which came close to Princeton, being awarded four championship designations during the same period.|$|E
5|$|The first {{policeman}} {{to arrive}} on the scene noticed wires running from the van's dashboard through a hole into the back and {{reported that he had}} found the bomb. Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb) and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> semtex, a military-grade plastic explosive, and ammonium nitrate fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components of what may have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate the bomb if it was tampered with.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long promulgated a {{new legal}} code {{to replace the}} system that had existed since the Hong Duc era of Lê Thánh Tông in the 15th century. Work started in 1811 under a group of {{scholars}} led by Nguyễn Văn Thành, and in 1815, the Bộ luật Gia Long (Gia Long Code) was issued. Although Gia Long claimed that his new system <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> the Le code and Qing Dynasty system of China, most scholars {{regard it as being}} a near complete copy of the Qing code. The code was later translated into French by Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre. It focused on strengthening the power and authority of the emperor, his mandarins, and the traditional family unit. In cases of serious crimes, particularly those against the state, collective punishment was meted out to the family of the convict, including the death penalty.|$|E

5|$|Unknown {{to either}} Gazan or Mortier, the Coalition had {{concentrated}} {{a force of}} approximately 24,000men (mostly Russians and a few Austrians) within a few kilometers of the French position at Dürenstein. In comparison, Gazan's division had only 6,000men. The Austro-Russian force <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> infantry, Jägers (frequently deployed as skirmishers), Russian musketeers and Russian and Austrian cavalry, accompanied by more than 68artillery pieces. The Russian cavalry, units of the greatly feared Cossacks, were well-suited for patrolling the river bank; indeed, on 9 November they had taken 40French soldiers as prisoners. Furthermore, reinforcements stood in Moravia, less than two weeks' march away. If {{the main body of}} the French army crossed the river, they would require time to prepare. Kutuzov, who had learned the military arts under the tutelage of the legendary Russian Generalissimo Suvorov, had overall command and would have ample warning of any large-scale French movement.|$|E
5|$|While the {{question}} of whether Fermi's experiment had produced element 93 was stalemated, two additional claims of the discovery of the element appeared, although unlike Fermi, they both claimed to have observed it in nature. The first of these claims was by Czech engineer Odolen Koblic in 1934 when he extracted a small amount of material from the wash water of heated pitchblende. He proposed the name bohemium for the element, but after being analyzed {{it turned out that the}} sample <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> tungsten and vanadium. The other claim, in 1938 by Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and French chemist Yvette Cauchois, claimed to have discovered the new element via spectroscopy in minerals. They named their element sequanium, but the claim was discounted because the prevailing theory at the time was that if it existed at all, element 93 would not exist naturally. However, as neptunium does in fact occur in nature in trace amounts, as demonstrated when it was found in uranium ore in 1952, it is possible that Hulubei and Cauchois did in fact observe neptunium.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, justice in Scotland <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> the royal and local, which was often unsystematic with {{overlapping}} jurisdictions, undertaken by clerical lawyers, laymen, amateurs and local leaders. Under James IV the legal {{functions of the}} council were rationalised, with a royal Court of Session meeting daily in Edinburgh to deal with civil cases. In 1514 the office of justice-general was created for the earl of Argyll (and held by his family until 1628). The study of law was popular in Scotland from the Middle Ages and many students travelled to Continental Europe to study canon law and civil law. In 1532 the Royal College of Justice was founded, leading to the training and professionalisation of an emerging group of career lawyers. The Court of Session placed increasing emphasis on its independence from influence, including from the king, and superior jurisdiction over local justice. Its judges were increasingly able to control entry to their own ranks. In 1605 the professionalisation of the bench led to entry requirements in Latin, law and a property qualification of £2,000, designed to limit the danger of bribery, helping to create an exclusive, wealthy and powerful and professional caste, who also now dominated government posts {{in a way that}} the clergy had done in the Middle Ages. In 1672 the High Court of Justiciary was founded from the College of Justice as a supreme court of appeal. The Act of Union in 1707 largely persevered the distinct Scottish legal system and its courts, separate from English jurisdiction.|$|E

The Act of Union in 1707 largely persevered the distinct Scottish legal system and its courts, separate from English jurisdiction. The major reform to Scottish law came as a result of the Heritable Jurisdictions Act 1747, which was part of the government reaction to the Jacobite rising of 1745 and which limited the powers of burgh courts, abolished hereditary offices and made the barony and regality courts obsolete, strengthening the reach of the central judicial courts.|$|E
5|$|Palmyra's society <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> the {{different}} peoples inhabiting the city, which {{is seen in}} Aramaic, Arabic and Amorite clan names. Palmyra was a tribal community but {{due to the lack}} of sources, an understanding of the nature of Palmyrene tribal structure is not possible. Thirty clans have been documented; five of which were identified as tribes (Phyle (φυλή)) comprising several sub-clans. By the time of Nero Palmyra had four tribes, each residing in an area of the city bearing its name. Three of the tribes were the Komare, Mattabol and Ma'zin; the fourth tribe is uncertain, but was probably the Mita. In time, the four tribes became highly civic and tribal lines blurred; by the second century clan identity lost its importance, and it disappeared during the third century. Even the four tribes ceased to be important by the third century as only one inscription mentions a tribe after the year 212; instead, aristocrats played the decisive role in the city's social organization. During the Umayyad period Palmyra was mainly inhabited by the Kalb tribe. Benjamin of Tudela recorded the existence of 2,000 Jews in the city during the twelfth century. Palmyra declined after its destruction by Timur in 1400, and was a village of 6,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the 20th century; although surrounded by Bedouin, the villagers preserved their dialect. Palmyra maintained the life of a small settlement until its relocation in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Until the film's production, many {{special effects}} in the film {{industry}} were achieved using miniature models, matte paintings, and on-set visual effectsalthough other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 storyboards for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors of the shots that would be practical and those which would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing the explanations of the storyboards, {{he did not know}} how to accomplish what he had seen. The result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer to guess which technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including cloth simulators to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would block the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation. Lucas also used CGI to correct the physical presence of actors in certain scenes. Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions, and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.|$|E
