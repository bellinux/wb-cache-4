5|$|When the {{producers}} knew Macfadyen would leave, {{the producers}} decided to introduce new cast members, {{one of which}} was Rupert Penry-Jones as Adam Carter, the new protagonist. Early on in the creation of Adam, the producers had an interest in casting Penry-Jones for the role; however, it took the actor three auditions until the producers finally decided to cast him. Unlike Tom, Adam would have a different character dynamic; he has an MI6 background, and is married. A change from the girlfriend/boyfriend storyline for Tom and Ellie Simm in the first series, the producers noted it is common for secret service officers to be in a relationship <b>with</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same field of work. This led to the introduction of Fiona Carter, portrayed by Olga Sosnovska. Sosnovska was previously approached to appear in the second series, but was unavailable. She later auditioned for Fiona, and was later told she won the part when she was in New York City. The actress was only given a brief on her character—a ball breaker, ultimate professional, cold and calculated—which did not give her much to work with. Sosnovska initially found Fiona irritating in the fourth episode, but later opened up to the character after her return in the seventh.|$|E

25|$|Justice Wilcox's {{judgment}} is noteworthy for several reasons. It highlights Perth's wealth of post-European settlement writings which provide {{an insight into}} Aboriginal life, including laws and customs, {{around the time of}} settlement in 1829 and also into the beginning of the last century. These documents enabled Justice Wilcox to find that laws and customs governing land throughout the whole Single Noongar Claim (taking in Perth, and many other towns in the greater South West) were those of a single community. The claimants shared a language and had extensive interaction <b>with</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> claim area.|$|E
25|$|Like {{almost all}} spiders, Steatoda nobilis is venomous, but its bite is almost {{exclusively}} of mild effect on humans, without the severe consequences {{that can occur}} with black widow spiders. Its bite is often alleged {{to be one of}} the medically significant for humans, even though the few recorded bites do not typically present long-lasting effects. The symptoms of a bite are typically similar to a bee or wasp sting. The bite of this spider, along <b>with</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Steatoda, can produce a set of symptoms known as steatodism. Symptoms of bites include intense pain radiating from the bite site, along with feverishness or general malaise. Male bites are less severe than that of the female.|$|E
25|$|In {{the recent}} decade's general elections, {{political}} commentators positioned D66 at {{the centre of}} the political spectrum and that most inclined to progressive reform. This offers the party a lot of possibilities for co-operation <b>with</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dutch political landscape. Historically, D66 has co-operated in cabinets with the Labour Party (PvdA). They were in four cabinets together (Den Uyl, Van Agt II, Kok I and Kok II); and they formed a shadow cabinet during the early seventies. The relations with the PvdA came under heavy tension three times: in 1981 when D66 decided to continue to govern with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), after the PvdA ministers had left the first Van Agt cabinet; in 1989 when PvdA formed a third Lubbers cabinet without D66; and 2003 when D66 joined the second Balkenende cabinet.|$|E

25|$|Species {{specific}} defense {{responses are}} created out of fear, and {{are essential for}} survival. Rats that lack the gene stathmin show no avoidance learning, {{or a lack of}} fear, and will often walk directly up to cats and be eaten. Animals use these SSDR to continue living, to help increase their chance of fitness, by surviving long enough to procreate. Humans and animals alike have created fear to know what should be avoided, and this fear can be learned through association <b>with</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community, or learned through personal experience with a creature, species, or situations that should be avoided. SSDRs are an evolutionary adaptation that has been seen in many species throughout the world including rats, chimpanzees, prairie dogs, and even humans, an adaptation created to help individual creatures survive in a hostile world.|$|E
25|$|On 27 January 1993 {{the county}} court in Požega filed an {{indictment}} against four Serbian paramilitaries, {{accusing them of}} taking a civilian to Bučje and torturing him, along <b>with</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> camp. In April, the four were convicted in absentia. All were sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. In 2009 the county state attorney officially requested that the men be re-tried. In the changed indictment, new evidence suggested that the four did indeed take an individual to Bučje, {{but they did not}} participate in the torture of prisoners and had no influence on how long they would be imprisoned. Also, the person they forced to Bučje was captured in his working place but {{was a member of the}} Ministry of the Interior reserve force. They were subsequently charged with armed mutiny against Croatia and were acquitted as part of a general amnesty.|$|E
25|$|For V. maculifrons {{workers to}} {{communicate}} <b>with</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nest about a potential predator, {{they have an}} alarm pheromone that stimulates defense. This pheromone {{is linked to the}} sting apparatus and prompts attraction and attack. When the alarm pheromone is expressed, wasps around the nest entrance are typically seen circling, outlining a zigzagging flight, and going directly towards the target. However, foragers that were not at the nest when the pheromone was expressed do not respond in a similar manner. The facultative social parasite of V. maculifrons, Vespula squamosa, responds to the alarm response of V. maculifrons, suggesting common chemistry between pheromones. Since V. squamosa is known to take over nests of V. maculifrons, selection for V. squamosa favors the ability to recognize and respond to alarm calls within the nest.|$|E
