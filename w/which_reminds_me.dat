There's {{something}} about her <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> a little of you," [...] and it did not seem to him peculiar that he had put it thus, instead of saying: [...] "There's something about you <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> a little of her." [...] Ah! And here she was! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, she is tall--very tall," [...] Ralph said, very gravely; [...] "but {{there is}} {{something}} about the expression of your eyes <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of Mrs. Klopstock.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Miriam, {{it began}} with a desire for a replica of this lamp, <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of a spot {{familiar}} to my childhood. Do you remember it? Now that I have found who is the lamp's maker----" ...|$|E
60|$|One day in {{returning}} from this spring by a circuitous path, I {{came upon a}} scene <b>which</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of Stonehenge and the architectural labours of the Druid.|$|R
6000|$|She {{acknowledged}} my compliment by a curtsey, <b>which</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> {{again of}} the village school. [...] "Thank you, young man," [...] she said smartly; [...] "I wonder who you are?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{jumped to}} the ground and gazed around. Opposite was the {{railroad}} station, true enough, and beyond blocks and blocks of tall business buildings, <b>which</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> strongly of New York.|$|R
60|$|DOONE. <b>Which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me.</b> My {{quarters}} leak like a sieve. I had fever {{last night}} from {{sleeping in a}} swamp. And {{the worst of it}} is, one can't do anything to a roof till the Rains are over.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] she admitted. [...] "I do like you. You seem {{to carry}} some quality with you which I do not understand. What is it, I wonder? It is {{something}} <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of your writing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rotten {{trick for}} a boy. When {{you get to}} my age you need it. Boys ought to be {{thinking}} about keeping themselves fit and being good at games. <b>Which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me.</b> Let's {{have a look at the}} wrist." ...|$|E
60|$|The wonder {{was that}} he had remembered me! I took his big, bony hand, <b>which</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of Judge Whipple's. Yes, it was just as if I had been with him always, and he were still the gaunt country lawyer.|$|R
60|$|There were {{loads of}} shiny reasons, <b>which</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> {{that we were}} at war and cleared for action, and that the {{interlude}} had been merely play. A companion rose alongside {{and wanted to know}} whether we had seen anything of her dummy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now," [...] said Oliver, looking round him; [...] "it {{strikes me}} that this is just the country for a {{landscape}} painter. There is nowhere else such fine cliff scenery, and the wild moors, <b>which</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> much of Scotland, are worthy of being sketched by an able brush." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'All {{the women}} in Simla are fools. She'll think I mean some one else. Now she's going out. What a {{thoroughly}} objectionable couple she and The Dancing Master make! <b>Which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me.</b> Do you suppose they'll ever dance together?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of Bishop Morehouse, whom I have {{neglected}} {{for many}} pages. But {{first let me}} tell of my marriage. In the play of events, my marriage sinks into insignificance, I know, so I shall barely mention it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't," [...] Saton {{continued}} quickly. [...] "I can't. That {{chapter of}} my life is buried. I cannot bear {{to think of it}} even now. I cannot bear to come in contact with anything <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Matthew Bellamy {{has said}} [...] "Bliss" [...] is his {{favourite}} song [...] "because it's {{got all these}} 80s arpeggios and keyboards on it <b>which</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> of some music I heard on some children's music programme when I was five. I think I ripped it off that. And that <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of when I was a bit simpler, {{a bit more of}} a pleasant state." ...|$|R
60|$|The great {{silence of}} the forest flowed in over us, as it were; {{for quite a while}} no one did or said anything. Then from somewhere down amidst the mosses I heard a thin voice, the sound of <b>which</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of air being {{squeezed}} out of an indiarubber cushion.|$|R
6000|$|For {{once the}} heart of her father {{did not respond to}} her feeling. He looked exultant, but with a grim masterfulness <b>which</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of the set look of his stern face as he had lain in the trance. He did not offer any {{consolation}} to his daughter in her sympathetic pain. He only said: ...|$|R
60|$|I've been {{interested}} in all I've heard to-day, especially in the romances recounted by Mrs. Thomas, <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> that I have a romance of my own in my autobiography, which I am building for the instruction of the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] {{declared}} the Fox-King, nodding approval. [...] "Be contented with your lot, whatever {{it happens to}} be, if you are wise. <b>Which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> {{that you have a}} new companion on this adventure--he looks very clever and bright." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No? Well, I declare! This is {{a glorious}} country; {{but not for}} such as you, dear, who love music and gaiety. I often fear you'll not be happy here, and then I long for the old home, <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of your mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{found her}} very {{attractive}} indeed," [...] Tavernake admitted, without hesitation. [...] "She had an air with her. She {{was quite different}} from all the women I have ever met at the boarding-house or anywhere else. She has a face <b>which</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> somehow of the Madonnas you took me {{to see in the}} National Gallery the other day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I read once," [...] she remarked, [...] "that {{people who}} live in a very small village for {{generation}} after generation grow to look like one another. In a certain way I cannot conceive two men more unlike, and yet at that moment there was something in your face <b>which</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of Mr. De la Borne." ...|$|R
25|$|The food (<b>which</b> was delicious) <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of home.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Copperfield,' said Mr. Micawber, 'this is luxurious. This {{is a way}} of life <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of {{the period}} when I was myself in a state of celibacy, and Mrs. Micawber had not yet been {{solicited}} to plight her faith at the Hymeneal altar.' ...|$|E
60|$|This {{took place}} while we lay in port, <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of the circumstance, that when {{punishment}} {{is about to}} be inflicted in harbour, all strangers are ordered ashore; and the sentries at the side have it in strict charge to waive off all boats drawing near.|$|E
60|$|<b>Which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me.</b> Technically I {{am not a}} passenger. The Elsinore has no licence {{to carry}} passengers, and I am down on the {{articles}} as third mate and am supposed to receive thirty-five dollars a month. Wada is down as cabin boy, although I paid a good price for his passage and he is my servant.|$|E
25|$|The food, <b>which</b> was delicious, <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of home.|$|R
60|$|As I sat down, and he {{preserved}} {{his attitude}} and bent his brows at his boots, I felt at a disadvantage, <b>which</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> {{of that old}} time when I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from him, and their expression {{was as if they}} were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Time {{enough to}} catch the last train to London. Don't raise objections! If I stay at this place, with {{associations}} {{in every part of}} it <b>which</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> of that unhappy man, I shall go mad! The shock I have suffered, the misery, the humiliation--I tell you it's more than I can bear. Stay here by yourself if you like; I mean to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we {{are only}} nice. One must specialise in these days. <b>Which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of the man I read of in some sacred book who was given a choice of what he most desired. And because he didn't ask for titles and honours and dignities, but only for immense wealth, these other things came to him also." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] {{said the}} sergeant; [...] "though {{most of the}} people talk French. This is the island called St. Loup, sir, an island in the Channel. We've been sent down {{specially}} from London, as you were such specially distinguished criminals, if you'll allow me to say so. <b>Which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> to warn you that anything you say may be used against you at your trial." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now goodbye, but send me {{the money}} for the cable when you write, and remember--Monty is a thief and Trent is the man to back, <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> that Trent repaid to Missionary Walsh all the money which Monty took, which it seems was left with Walsh by him for Monty's keep. But Monty does not know that, so you have the string to make him dance.|$|E
60|$|Through one {{of these}} window-places I saw at a little {{distance}} {{the slope of the}} forest-covered hill, <b>which</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of something to do with a child--for the life of me I could not remember what. As I lay wondering over the matter I heard a shuffling step which I recognized, and, turning, saw Hans twiddling a new hat made of straw in his fingers.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{military}} commander, Breckinridge was highly respected. Fellow Confederate George M. Edgar, describing Breckinridge's performance, wrote: General Breckinridge had {{few if any}} superiors {{on the field of}} battle. Besides being a man of wonderful courage, he had a keen eye to discern the strong and weak points of the enemy's position, skill in using his forces to the best advantage, and a celerity of movement <b>which</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of Jackson.|$|R
6000|$|It was the {{newspaper}} paragraph <b>which</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> that I {{had written about}} this same judge, giving my estimate of his character in my book, A Shepherd's Life, also that I was thinking about Park, the sound and fair and sensible judge, when I wrote [...] "An Old Thorn." [...] Here then, with apologies to the reader for quoting from my own book, I reproduce what I wrote in 1905.|$|R
