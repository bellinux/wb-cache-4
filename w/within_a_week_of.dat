Arsenal, as the {{previous}} season's losing finalists and league leaders, were clear favourites to win the match. On the day, five of the Arsenal first team were out with injury or flu and had their places taken by reserves. Arsenal lost 2â€“0 {{in one of the}} greatest FA Cup upsets. Chapman was enraged by the result, and showed his ruthlessness by selling one player, Tommy Black, who had conceded a penalty in the game, to Plymouth Argyle <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> the result; another, striker Charlie Walsh, was sold to Brentford a week later.|$|E

The risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma (image at right) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas. People with early seizures, those occurring <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> injury, have an increased risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (recurrent seizures occurring more than a week after the initial trauma). People may lose or experience altered vision, hearing, or smell.|$|E

Fleury was surprised that his story became the top-selling non-fiction book in Canada; without help, {{he and his wife were}} unable to keep up with the mail they were receiving. It is the second book about Fleury's life, following Fury, released in 1997, which did not discuss many of the problems he was facing at the time.|$|E

5|$|Radiotherapy is {{used when}} drug {{treatment}} is failing {{to control the}} pain of a growing tumor, such as in bone metastisis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses are adequate to produce analgesia, thought {{to be due to}} reduction in pressure or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals. Radiopharmaceuticals that target specific tumors have been used to treat the pain of metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> treatment and may last from two to four months.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of the six}} {{missing women}} and Sparks's brutal beating {{appeared}} prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. While pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, the paucity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> midterm or final exams; all {{of the victims were}} wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers gave Empire: Total War {{universal}} acclaim; several critics commended {{it as one}} of {{the foremost}} strategy titles of recent times. Praise was bestowed upon the extensive strategic breadth, accurate historical challenges and visual effects. The real-time land battles, with a far greater focus on gunpowder weaponry than earlier Total War titles, were considered successful. Criticisms focused on shortcomings with the game's artificial intelligence and on the real-time naval battles being difficult to control and co-ordinate. The game was a commercial success, topping sales charts <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> release; nevertheless, several Creative Assembly employees later commented on various issues caused by a perceived early release.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically decompress the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland. Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> the onset of symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} Cardiff Devils and the Newcastle Jesters in 2001 {{reduced the}} {{membership}} of the Superleague to seven; and when the Manchester Storm and the Scottish Eagles folded <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> one another {{at the beginning of the}} 2002â€“03 season, there were just five remaining teams. In December 2002, the Bracknell Bees announced their intention to resign from the league to join the BNL at the end of the season; and uncertainty surrounded the future of the London Knights and their London Arena home; which ultimately led to the Knights folding in 2003. Owing a large debt to Ice Hockey UK and facing the prospect of having only three members, the league placed itself into liquidation on 30 April 2003.|$|E
5|$|<b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>of</b> the {{beginning}} of construction, however, severe deficiencies were beginning to be revealed in the fort's location. Due to its site close to the Long Bridge, Runyon was overlooked by the ridge of the Arlington Heights, and an enemy force could shield itself with the heights and sneak up on the fort unopposed. To prevent this from happening, Barnard was forced to issue orders calling {{for the construction of}} a fort called Fort Albany atop the ridge. Nevertheless, work on Fort Runyon continued despite its less-than-optimal location.|$|E
