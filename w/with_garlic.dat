He thought that the menu was over complicated, and not all the elements of the dishes worked together.

25|$|The {{medicinal}} {{properties of}} chives {{are similar to}} those of garlic, but weaker; the faint effects in comparison <b>with</b> <b>garlic</b> are probably the main reason for their limited use as a medicinal herb. They also have mild stimulant, diuretic, and antiseptic properties. As chives are usually served in small amounts and never as the main dish, negative effects are rarely encountered, although digestive problems may occur following overconsumption.|$|E
25|$|In central Serbia, {{once the}} {{household}} members {{have gone to}} bed, an elderly woman of the family sticks a knife into the house door from the inside. Alternatively, she puts a hawthorn stake by the door, hanging a wreath of garlic on it. This is done as a protection against curses, witches, and demons. For the same reason, children are rubbed <b>with</b> <b>garlic</b> on the palms, armpits, and soles before going to bed. In some regions, the men keep watch in shifts by the fireplace during the night, to keep the fire burning.|$|E
25|$|Wine expert Karen MacNeil {{notes that}} most well made {{examples}} of Provençal wine have flavors and aromas {{that reflect the}} garrigue landscape of the region which includes wild lavender, rosemary and thyme. The rosés of the region are normally dry with zestiness derived from their acidity. The red and whites are characterized by their full bodies and intense aromatics. The nature and impression of the wines change significantly depending on whether they are consumed as an apéritif or paired with food, particularly the traditional flavors of Provençal cuisine. The rosé wine in particular is noted {{for its ability to}} pair well <b>with</b> <b>garlic</b> based dishes, such as aioli.|$|E

25|$|Another Shabbat dish is calf's foot jelly, called p'tsha or šaltiena in Lithuania and galarita, galer, galleh, or fisnoge in Poland. Beef or calf {{bones are}} put up to boil with water, seasonings, garlic and onions {{for a long}} time. It is then allowed to cool. The broth then jells into a {{semi-solid}} mass, which is served in cubes. Drelies, a similar dish originating in south Russia and Galicia is mixed with soft-boiled eggs and vinegar when removed from the oven, and served hot. In Romania it is called piftie, in Serbia pihtije; it is served cold, <b>with</b> <b>garlic,</b> hard boiled eggs and vinegar sauce or mustard creme and considered a traditional dish in the winter season.|$|E
25|$|Italian beef is {{made using}} cuts of beef from the sirloin rear or the top/bottom round wet-roasted in broth <b>with</b> <b>garlic,</b> oregano and spices until cooked throughout. The meat is roasted at medium heat (≤350°), which {{contributes}} to the sandwich’s famous ‘jus’ or gravy. This process can result {{in as much as}} a 45% reduction in yield. The beef is then cooled, sliced thin using a deli slicer, and then reintroduced to its reheated beef broth. The beef then sits in the broth, typically for hours. The inefficiency of this process, however, has started to concern many larger Italian beef producers and retailers. In response, some attempt to achieve higher yields by lowering the cooking temperature and placing the beef into food-grade polyester and nylon cook bags, which changes the outer appearance of the beef. Though this reduced time is sufficient for cooking the beef all the way through, it does not allow the jus to be harvested fully. Because traditional Italian beefs are dipped in the jus from their own roast, when this more efficient method is used, the sandwich’s potency is affected. Some companies even add MSG, phosphates and other additives in attempts to reach for higher yields.|$|E
500|$|In Polish cuisine, white borscht ( [...] , {{also known}} as [...] or , 'sour soup') is made from a {{fermented}} mixture of rye flour or oatmeal and water.

500|$|Spaghetti dishes also vary.

500|$|Former Nice {{mayor and}} {{cookbook}} author Jacques Médecin was a strict salad traditionalist. His 1972 cookbook Cuisine Nicoise: Recipes from a Mediterranean Kitchen {{called for the}} salad to be served in a wooden bowl rubbed <b>with</b> <b>garlic,</b> and excluded boiled vegetables: [...] "never, never, I beg you, include boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable in your salade niçoise." [...] Médecin wrote that the salad should be made [...] "predominately of tomatoes" [...] which should be [...] "salted three times and moistened with olive oil". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or canned tuna, [...] but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, green peppers, fava beans, spring onions, black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, Médecin believed that salade niçoise [...] "was {{a product of the}} sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi." [...] Médecin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad, [...] commenting, [...] "As the various ingredients that go into salade niçoise are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl." ...|$|E
