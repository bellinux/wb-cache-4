5|$|A mid-level ridge over Mexico {{caused the}} cyclone to track {{steadily}} northwestward. <b>With</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> temperatures and low vertical wind shear, the depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Ileana. Convection developed and organized into a central dense overcast, and with abundant low-level moisture, rapid deepening was expected. An eye {{formed in the}} center of the convection, and Ileana attained hurricane status late on August22. On August23, about 48hours after forming, Ileana reached major hurricane status and a peak intensity of 120mph (195km/h) about 60mi (100km) southeast of Socorro Island. It also attained an atmospheric pressure of 955mbar, as well as an eye diameter of 23mi (37km).|$|E
5|$|During October 7, <b>with</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> {{helping to}} fuel its intensification, Madeline quickly {{intensified}} into a Category 2 hurricane, and was upgraded {{to a major}} hurricane (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) early on October 8. Based on hurricane hunter reports, Madeline reached its peak sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a peak pressure of 940 millibars early on the 8th. This made Madeline a moderate Category 4 hurricane. Later that morning Madeline made landfall to the northwest of Zihuatanejo as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, before it rapidly dissipated over land.|$|E

5|$|Upon first being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the depression had a slightly elongated circulation. An anticyclone to its north was forecast to track westward, which would allow the depression to track west-northwestward and remain offshore; however, the NHC noted uncertainty in its motion. The cloud pattern gradually organized, <b>with</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> temperatures and lessening wind shear. At 1200UTC on June26, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status; upon doing so, the NHC named the storm Carlos. As it reached tropical storm intensity, Carlos began an erratic northward track toward the Mexican coast, {{under the influence of}} a trough. It quickly strengthened, developing a well-defined eye feature {{in the center of the}} convection. Based on the eye, it is estimated Carlos made landfall early on June27 with peak winds of 65mph (100km/h), about 60miles (95km) west of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, or about 150miles (245km/h) east-southeast of Acapulco, Guerrero.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} open waters, Glenda quickly intensified, and midday on 27 March the BoM upgraded it to {{tropical cyclone}} status, or the equivalence of a minimal hurricane. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC followed suit by upgrading it to cyclone status just 12hours after first warning on the storm. A wind gust of 113km/h (70mph) was reported on Adele Island as the cyclone passed nearby. The track turned south westward around a steering ridge over Australia, {{aided by a}} mid-latitude trough. By 27 March, Glenda had developed a banding eye, and subsequently began rapid deepening, <b>with</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> temperatures of over 30°C (86°F) and a very favourable upper-level environment. At 1200UTC on 28 March, the JTWC classified Glenda with peak winds of 260km/h (160mph) about 235km (145mi) west-north-west of Broome, or about 455km (280mi) north-north-east of Port Hedland; however, in a subsequent analysis, the JTWC lowered their intensity estimate to 220km/h (140mph). At {{the same time the}} BoM estimated the cyclone attained peak winds of 215km/h (135mph) with gusts to 300km/h (185mph), or a Category5 on the Australian cyclone scale. Its peak intensity of 910mbar was tied for the fifth most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian basin.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> {{temperatures}} of over 86°F (30°C) and low wind shear, {{the newly formed}} tropical depression was able to quickly intensify. It developed a well-defined center with concentrated deep convection. Continued organization prompted the NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Barbara at 0000UTC on May29. Post-analysis indicated that Barbara intensified into a tropical storm six hours earlier than originally assessed. Barbara began exhibiting an eye-like feature, and intensity estimates using the Dvorak Technique reached 40mph (65km/h). At this time, Barbara had begun to recurve to the northeast, within a gap of the subtropical ridge. By midnight, the eye-like feature developed into a central dense overcast (CDO), embedded within the deep convection. The rainbands of Barbara wrapped around much of the circulation, and radar imagery indicated the eyewall was consistently becoming better defined. Thereafter, the storm entered a phase of intensification as it began to accelerate towards the Chiapan coastline.|$|E

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> temperatures, {{the system}} {{strengthened}} {{and began to}} develop tropical characteristics. Subsequent {{to the development of}} banding features, convection contracted and deepened over the increasingly well-defined center, and is estimated it became a tropical storm by early on September 2 while located about 685 miles (1,100 km) north of the Hawaiian island of Kauai. The storm quickly developed a central dense overcast, and by 00:00 UTC on September 3 Dvorak classifications began on the cyclone. With water temperatures of over 82 °F (28 °C), it strengthened rapidly as a approaching cold front caused it to accelerate to the northeast. An eye became apparent on satellite imagery, and the storm intensified into a hurricane at 18:00 UTC on September 3, while located about 1,170 miles (1,885 km) south of Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve in Alaska. Upon becoming a hurricane, the cyclone was small, measuring about 85 miles (140 km) in diameter.|$|E

25|$|First {{one should}} rinse hands <b>with</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water,</b> keeping hands below wrists and forearms, to prevent {{contaminated}} water from {{moving from the}} hands to the wrists and arms. The warm water helps to open pores, which helps with the removal of microorganisms, without removing skin oils. One should use five milliliters of liquid soap, to completely cover the hands, and rub wet, soapy hands together, outside the running water, for at least 20 seconds. The most commonly missed areas are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers, and under fingernails. Artificial nails and chipped nail polish harbor microorganisms.|$|E

25|$|The {{ingredients}} to make dried pasta usually include water and semolina flour; egg for colour and richness (in {{some types of}} pasta), and possibly vegetable juice (such as spinach, beet, tomato, carrot), herbs or spices for colour and flavour. After mixing semolina flour <b>with</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> the dough is kneaded mechanically until it becomes firm and dry. If pasta is to be flavoured, eggs, vegetable juices, and herbs are added at this stage. The dough is then passed into the laminator to be flattened into sheets, then compressed by a vacuum mixer-machine to clear out air bubbles and excess water from the dough until the moisture content is reduced to 12%. Next, the dough is processed in a steamer to kill any bacteria it may contain.|$|E
