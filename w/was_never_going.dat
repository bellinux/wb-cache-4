5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} Commando Hunt campaigns was not to halt infiltration, but to {{make the}} North Vietnamese pay too heavy a price for their effort. Corollary to this was the {{destruction}} of as much of their logistical system as possible and to tie down as many PAVN forces in static security roles as possible. Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless Hanoi felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign's failure, however, was sown in its first operation. Despite the expenditure of {{an enormous amount of}} ordnance over five years, the level of that pressure <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be sufficient to deter Hanoi from its goal.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} {{steadily}} escalating development {{costs of the}} vehicle, Sinclair decided to raise capital by selling {{some of his own}} shares in Sinclair Research to fund a separate company that would focus on electric vehicles. A £12 million deal was reached in March 1983, of which £8.3 million was used to fund the establishment of the new Sinclair Vehicles company. Sinclair recruited Barrie Wills, a veteran former employee of the DeLorean Motor Company, to lead Sinclair Vehicles as its managing director. Although Wills initially expressed scepticism about the viability of an electric vehicle – his twenty-five years in the motor industry had convinced him that an electric car <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to happen – Sinclair managed to convince him that the project would work. In 1984, Sinclair Vehicles' new head office was established in Warwick in the West Midlands, an area with a long-established link with the motor industry.|$|E

Northamptonshire won the toss and batted, but 215 for 7 <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be enough on a fine Old Trafford pitch, where Lancashire's Mal Loye smashed 94 not out with ten fours and three sixes. There were good news for England fans as well - Test all-rounder Andrew Flintoff bowled 9 overs for Lancashire without complain from his recently operated ankle, taking the wicket of England prospect Bilal Shafayat in the process.|$|E

25|$|Public {{comments}} made by Phil Anselmo following the shooting suggested that he had considered reuniting with the band prior to Darrell's death. However, {{one year after the}} murder Vinnie stated in an interview that this reunion <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to happen. Comments about a potential one-off reunion concert often resurface periodically, with Zakk Wylde often being suggested as the stand-in replacement for Darrell. Vinnie, however, has been strictly resistant to the idea. Despite several overtures towards reconciliation by Anselmo towards Paul, the two men remain all but permanently estranged.|$|E
25|$|In early 2011, Vinnie Paz {{announced}} on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn {{is due to}} be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost seemed like it <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC Zilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released on April 22, 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze and Zilla. Their fifth studio album, Heavy Lies the Crown was released on October 21, 2014.|$|E
25|$|On the Eastern Front, the Cavalry Division {{was mostly}} {{deployed}} in the south. It saw little fighting, as the German army did not use cavalry frequently, and division was kept mainly in reserve. Richthofen’s brigade served near Pinsk in 1916, and the division would spend late 1915 to January 1917 on defensive duties in the Pripet Marshes. Richthofen was given command of the horse depot of the Brigade {{in the autumn of}} 1916 and was promoted to Squadron Commander, with 160 men under his command. This <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to garner him the level of fame his cousins, Lothar and Manfred, were now achieving in the Luftstreitkräfte (Imperial Air Service), and they personally encouraged him to transfer to the air service, which he finally did in June 1917.|$|E

25|$|The second {{match was}} a more even affair. It was held at Westpac Stadium, Wellington, on 24 January. New Zealand batted first and scored well in the early stages, but lost wickets at vital times, much of the damage being done by bowlers Andrew Bichel and Lance Klusener. Only Nathan Astle was able to produce a large score, {{finishing}} on 109. New Zealand were all out for 256, a respectable score, but less {{than they would have}} wanted on what was a good batting pitch. The total <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be enough, however, especially after Matthew Elliott and Nick Knight got the World XI off to a flying start. Elliott was particularly belligerent, his 57 runs including three sixes. Although the World XI lost several wickets, their batting continued at a fast pace, and they reached the required target in the 48th over for the loss of seven wickets.|$|E
25|$|England's first {{match against}} the unified Germany since 1938 was a {{friendly}} in 1991 at Wembley, which the Germans won 1–0. Five years later, at the 1996 European Championships, England played a unified German {{team for the}} first time in a competitive fixture, when they met in the semi-finals. Like the 1966 World Cup, the tournament was being held in England, and the semi-final was played at Wembley Stadium. England's fans and team were confident, particularly after wins in the group stage over Scotland (2–0) and the Netherlands (4–1) and their first ever penalty shoot-out victory, over Spain, in the quarter-finals. So vivid were the memories of 1966 for England fans that a media clamour ensued for England to wear red jerseys, instead of the unfamiliar-looking grey away kit that had been launched earlier that year (as England had not submitted details of any red kit to UEFA before the tournament, this <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be permitted, and England did wear grey).|$|E
25|$|Strong {{performances}} {{on the tour}} meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion. While still a teenager, he reached the semifinals of both the French Open and the US Open in 1988 and made the US Open semifinals in 1989. He began the 1990s {{with a series of}} near-misses. He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he was favored before losing in four sets to Andrés Gómez, which he attributes to worrying about his wig falling off. He reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open, defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the semifinals. His opponent in the final was Pete Sampras; a year earlier, Agassi had crushed Sampras, after which he told his coach that he felt bad for Sampras because he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to make it as a pro. Agassi lost the US Open final to Sampras in three sets. The rivalry between these two American players became the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest of the decade. Also in 1990, Agassi helped the United States win its first Davis Cup in 8 years and won his only Tennis Masters Cup, beating reigning Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg in the final.|$|E

500|$|Independence for East Timor, or even limited {{regional}} autonomy, <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to {{be allowed}} under Suharto's New Order. Notwithstanding Indonesian public opinion in the 1990s occasionally showing begrudging appreciation of the Timorese position, it was widely feared that an independent East Timor would destabilise Indonesian unity. The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, however, caused tremendous upheaval in Indonesia and led to Suharto's resignation in May 1998, ending his thirty-year presidency. Prabowo, by then {{in command of the}} powerful Indonesian Strategic Reserve, went into exile in Jordan and military operations in East Timor were costing the bankrupt Indonesian government a million dollars a day. The subsequent [...] "reformasi" [...] period of relative political openness and transition, included unprecedented debate about Indonesia's relationship with East Timor.|$|E
500|$|In January 1900, Southern Cross returned, {{picked up}} the shore party and, {{following}} the route which Ross had taken 60years previously, sailed southward to the Great Ice Barrier, which they discovered had retreated some [...] south {{since the days of}} Ross. A party consisting of Borchgrevink, William Colbeck and a Sami named Per Savio landed with sledges and dogs. This party ascended the Barrier and made the first sledge journey on the barrier surface; on 16 February 1900 they extended the Farthest South record to 78°50'S. On its return to England later in 1900, Borchgrevink's expedition was received without enthusiasm, despite its new southern record. Historian David Crane commented that if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer, his contribution to Antarctic knowledge might have been better received, but [...] "a Norwegian seaman/schoolmaster <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be taken seriously".|$|E

I let 50 years go by and see what's really relevant." [...] Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, and the Blue Sky Boys. She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, [...] "I've never tried to be traditional. It's been a springboard for me and I love it and revere it and would not be doing what I do without the music of the Monroe Brothers, the Stanley Brothers and the Carter Family. However, it was clear I <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> {{to be able to do}} exactly that; I'm a songwriter." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1978, Genesis began {{a period}} of {{inactivity}} as Collins's marriage was at risk of collapse after touring had made him frequently absent from his wife and children. Following a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and Smith, Collins went to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to try and rebuild the family. He explained: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to leave the band. It was just that if I {{was going to be}} living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] Banks and Rutherford decided to put Genesis on an extended break and make their respective debut solo albums, A Curious Feeling and Smallcreep's Day, at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after his attempt to save his marriage failed. With time to spare before working on a new Genesis album, Collins performed with Brand X and started writing his first solo album, Face Value, at his home in Shalford, Surrey.|$|E
500|$|Tauranac left Brabham {{early in}} the 1972 season after Ecclestone changed the way the company was {{organised}} without consulting him. Ecclestone has since said [...] "In retrospect, the relationship <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to work", noting that [...] " [...] both take the view: 'Please be reasonable, do it my way'". The highlights of an aimless year, during which the team ran three different models, were pole position for Argentinian driver Carlos Reutemann at his home race at Buenos Aires and {{a victory in the}} non-championship Interlagos Grand Prix. For the 1973 season, Ecclestone promoted the young South African engineer Gordon Murray to chief designer and moved Herbie Blash from the Formula Two programme to become the Formula One team manager. Both would remain with the team for the next 15 years. For 1973, Murray produced the triangular cross-section BT42, with which Reutemann scored two podium finishes and finished seventh in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E

Some state that he declared that no World Series games would ever again be played at Wrigley Field, while others believe that his ban was on the Cubs appearing in the World Series, making no mention of a specific venue. Sianis’s family claims that he dispatched a telegram to team owner Philip K.
