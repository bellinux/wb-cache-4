500|$|The season {{received}} average {{reviews from}} critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "The ratio of bad to good episodes was not too favorable in this season of Family Guy. Far too many episodes were either seriously lacking in humor or were just plain poorly written", but added, [...] "While much of the original appeal seems to have washed-off, {{there are still a}} few moments from this season that really stand out", listing [...] "Chick Cancer", [...] "Road to Rupert", [...] "Saving Private Brian", and [...] "No Meals on Wheels" [...] as the best episodes of the season. Haque also gave praise to [...] "Blind Ambition", [...] "No Chris Left Behind", [...] "Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey", and [...] "Meet the Quagmires". Manisha Kanetkar of Smart House, however, felt that the series saw [...] "no sign of tiring" [...] and had [...] "as many funny moments as ever." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com regarded [...] "Airport '07", [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", and [...] "Barely Legal" [...] as [...] "gem episodes." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume five DVD, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk said [...] "There are several points to criticize <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> set, including a series that's losing some of its steam and relying on comedic crutches and an oddly constructed episode structure, but in the end, the series is fun to watch, which is all you really ask for from a cartoon sitcom." [...] In a later review, Rizzo added [...] "Is Family Guy coasting on it's [...] past successes? It could be argued, as the series doesn't surprise or shock the way it once did, instead doing the things that have worked before and doing them more and larger. The DVD releases are predictable and consistent, with high quality and impressive rafts of bonus material, but if the show doesn't do it for you, that doesn't make much of a difference." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to a {{wide range}} of media {{coverage}} and large scale steroid scandals fans and experts have continued to bring the games integrity into question. Major League Baseball is a game of statistics. The entirety of a player's career is based upon the consistency and credibility of the numbers and accolades acquired during the period in which they played. [...] "Their real impact has been at the margins: There are certainly some scrubs who wouldn't be in the majors without the juice, and we have ample evidence that at the other end of the scale, drugs can take Hall of Famers and all-time greats and help them perform at historically unprecedented levels" [...] (La-Times). <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> topic generally there are two trains of thought. Many do not see the harm with this type of substance use because it makes the game more exciting and allows athletes to reach untested potentials. On the other side of the argument many fans and experts believe the game has lost its purity because of this drug use. More recently an issue has arose with high-caliber players who have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs are not being voted for on a hall of fame ballot. This fact has brought many to question the game's integrity. No matter the statistics and achievements produced by the certain player prior to drug use, a positive test for steroids has shown to discredit the athletes integrity and career entirely.|$|E

Of course, in the case of men of humbler degree, money is even harder to recover. I may add, that my own long experience as a magistrate goes to confirm this statement. It is extraordinary to what meanness, subterfuge, and even perjury, a man will sometimes resort, in order to avoid paying so little as 1s. 6d. a week towards the keep of his own child. Often the line of defence is a cruel attempt to blacken the character of the mother, even when the accuser well knows that there is not the slightest ground for the charge, and that he alone is responsible for the woman's fall.[5] Also, if the case is proved, and the order made, many such men will run away and hide themselves {{in another part of the}} country to escape the fulfilment of their just obligations.|$|E
