25|$|In {{differential}} geometry, the {{two principal}} curvatures {{at a given}} point of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator at the point. They measure how the surface bends by different amounts in different directions at that point. <b>We</b> <b>represent</b> the surface by the implicit function theorem as the graph of a function, f, of two variables, {{in such a way}} that the point p is a critical point, i.e., the gradient of f vanishes (this can always be attained by a suitable rigid motion). Then the Gaussian curvature of the surface at p is the determinant of the Hessian matrix of f (being the product of the eigenvalues of the Hessian). (Recall that the Hessian is the 2-by-2 matrix of second derivatives.) This definition allows one immediately to grasp the distinction between cup/cap versus saddle point.|$|E

He was open about his intention to adapt history for his own purposes, writing {{in the preface to}} his libretto that [...] "here <b>we</b> <b>represent</b> these actions differently." [...] Thus he gave his characters different attributes from those of their historical counterparts: Nerone's cruelty is downplayed; the wronged wife Ottavia is presented as a murderous plotter; Seneca, whose death in reality {{had nothing to do with}} Nerone's liaison with Poppea, appears as more noble and virtuous than he was; Poppea's motives are represented as based on genuine love as much as on a lust for power; the depiction of Lucano as a drunken carouser disguises the real life poet Lucan's status as a major Roman poet with marked anti-imperial and pro-republican tendencies.|$|E

2500|$|As to {{why and how}} a story, not data, should dictate choices, {{the answer}} is that it is the story which encodes the causal {{relationships}} among the variables. Once we explicate these relationships and represent them formally, we can test which partition gives the correct treatment preference. For example, if <b>we</b> <b>represent</b> causal relationships in a graph called [...] "causal diagram" [...] (see Bayesian networks), we can test whether nodes that represent the proposed partition intercept spurious paths in the diagram. This test, called [...] "back-door," [...] reduces Simpson's paradox to an exercise in graph theory.|$|E

Dee Davis, president of the Center for Rural Strategies, expressed his concern that the shows approach [...] "the thin line between an honest documentary and exploitative reality show". Animal Planet president Marjorie Kaplan insisted, [...] "We haven't received any negative response at all" [...] to the show. Commenting on {{the potential for the}} show to advance negative stereotypes of Southerners, Animal Planet executive Dawn Sinsel added, [...] "As with all shows that explore a subculture of America that people might not be familiar with, we're careful to make sure that <b>we</b> <b>represent</b> the talent in their true colors and not 'cover up' their natural character. Turtleman likes to catch all types of animals. We hope Ernie's carefree and loyal personality and love of animals will replace any stereotypes."

2500|$|Ellison, one of {{only two}} African-American state lawmakers at the time (the other being Rep. Neva Walker of District 61B), became the {{spokesman}} of the DFL group that filed with the Ethics Committee against Lindner. Besides Ellison the group consisted of Representatives Karen Clark, Frank Hornstein (whose mother is a Holocaust survivor), Margaret Anderson Kelliher, Neva Walker, Lyndon Carlson, Ron Latz, and House Minority Leader Matt Entenza. The complaint held “that when Lindner expressed his belief that homosexuals may not have been persecuted during the Nazi Holocaust, his conduct violated ‘accepted norms of House behavior’ and that his comments ‘bring the House into dishonor or disrepute.’” Ellison stated that they sought “censure of Lindner and his removal as chair of the Economic Development and Tourism Division of the House Commerce, Jobs, and Economic Development Policy Committee.” Ellison’s group exhibited letters from out-of-state residents who said they cancelled vacation plans in Minnesota after learning of Lindner's comments. Ellison stated “There’s a question mark hanging over the State Office Building. The question is ‘Do {{the people of the state}} of Minnesota and the legislators that represent them share the viewpoint that people who were victims of Nazi persecution were in fact not victims of Nazi persecution?’ Mr. Lindner has insulted not only the House but members of the community at large.” [...] The Session Weekly reported “‘The fact of the matter is his conduct calls for discipline,’ said Ellison, who added that a censure penalty does not prohibit Lindner from saying what he believes. ‘It would just be a denunciation, a condemnation, of what he said.’” Ellison told Minnesota Public Radio [...] "That question mark sitting over this building is whether <b>we</b> <b>represent</b> all the people of this state or not. And whether or not an elected official, a person who holds an election certificate can spout bigoted language, mean-spirited, untrue statements designed to injure members of the community and members of this body.
