500|$|Matters {{came to a}} {{head when}} Hill sent a {{telegram}} to fellow selector, Peter McAlister, urging the inclusion of the New South Wales all-rounder Charlie Macartney in the team for the Fourth Test in Melbourne. The reply from McAlister—a member of the Board of Control who still bore some animosity towards Hill from past comments—to Hill's request was [...] "...Still opposed to Macartney's inclusion. If Iredale (another selector) agrees <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> to Macartney's inclusion, I favour yourself standing down not Minnett." [...] Hill saw the offer to remove himself from the team as sore provocation and his team-mates scorned the suggestion. Australia lost the Third Test by seven wickets. [...] Macartney wrote later, [...] "Persistent ill-feeling seriously affected the morale of the side." [...] At a meeting held after the Test, the Board of Control rejected the players' petition and declared that the manager would be appointed by the Board alone.

The early part of the twentieth century was {{characterized}} by a series of false starts. In 1911, Arnold Harris Matthew (a former Roman Catholic priest, later consecrated an Old Catholic bishop), entered into union with the Oriental Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch under Metropolitan Gerasimos (Messarah) of Beirut and, in 1912, with the Eastern Orthodox Pope Photios of Alexandria.

[...] Both unions were contracted in quick succession and only lasted for an effective period of a few months. Though the union was protested by the Archbishop of Canterbury to Photios and the Patriarch of Antioch, Matthew's group claimed that communion was never formally broken off.|$|E
