25|$|Viscous Dampers {{have the}} benefit of being a {{supplemental}} damping system. They have an oval hysteretic loop and the damping is velocity dependent. While some minor maintenance is potentially required, viscous dampers generally {{do not need to be}} replaced after an earthquake.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in structure dynamic analysis. Transmission towers collapse a lot because of the effect <b>wind</b> <b>load,</b> so the design of transmission towers must consider precisely the influence of actual <b>wind</b> <b>load.</b> On the basis of analyzing the characteristics of <b>wind</b> <b>load,</b> an elaborated AR (Auto-Regressive) model based on linear filter method was developed to simulate the velocity of turbulent <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> for the transmission tower structures. Use Simiu spectrum in which turbulence changing along with height of tower to simulate the turbulent <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> of 500 KV cat-head transmission towers. The results show that the simulated spectrum and the objective spectrum of wind velocity agree well. The method provides useful references for anti-wind design of transmission tower structures...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the actual}} {{measurement}} data, probability models of horizontal <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> were ob-tained based on wind velocity statistic and power spectral density function of fluctuating wind ve-locity through stochastic sampling and using spectrum analysis method. Through the comparison of two models, probability models of horizontal <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> based on probability models of fluc-tuating wind velocity were obtained by revising the mean and variance of fluctuating wind veloci-ty. Results show that the variance takes lower value when the power spectral density function of fluctuating wind velocity is used to obtain the probability model of horizontal <b>wind</b> <b>load.</b> The qua-dratic term of fluctuating wind velocity takes a small contribution value in total <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> with almost no contribution to the model of horizontal <b>wind</b> <b>load.</b> It is convenient for practical engi-neering to obtain the models of horizontal <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> by using probability models of fluctuating wind velocity...|$|R
25|$|Resonant {{vibrational}} modes due to {{vertical loads}} (such as trains, traffic, pedestrians) and <b>wind</b> <b>loads</b> are well understood in bridge design. In {{the case of}} the Millennium Bridge, because the lateral motion caused the pedestrians loading the bridge to directly participate with the bridge, the vibrational modes had not been anticipated by the designers. The crucial point is that when the bridge lurches to one side, the pedestrians must adjust to keep from falling over, and they all do this at exactly the same time.|$|E
25|$|When the {{building}} was first constructed, it {{received a lot of}} mixed feedback. The most known criticism received was known as “Burnham’s Folly”. This criticism, focused on the structure of {{the building}}, was made {{on the grounds that the}} “combination of triangular shape and height would cause the building to fall down.” Critics believed that the building created a dangerous wind-tunnel at the intersection of the two streets, and could possibly knock the building down. Although the wind is strong at the intersection, the buildings structure was meant to accommodate four times the typical <b>wind</b> <b>loads</b> in order to stabilize and retain the building’s iconic triangular shape.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of loads that {{structure}} engineering must encounter in the design. First type of load is called Dead loads that consist of the weights of the various structural members and the weights of any objects that are permanently attached to the structure. For example, columns, beams, girders, the floor slab, roofing, walls, windows, plumbing, electrical fixtures, and other miscellaneous attachments. Second type of load is Live Loads which vary in their magnitude and location. There are many different types of live loads like building loads, highway bridge Loads, railroad bridge Loads, impact loads, <b>wind</b> <b>loads,</b> snow loads, earthquake loads, and other natural loads.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{computer}} simulation method of solving vehicle-bridge system vibration response considering <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> is presented based on mode integration theory. Vehicle model and fluctuating <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> model are established, corresponding vehicle stiffness and damping matrix is educed in the method. A practical cable-stayed bridge dynamic analysis is completed successfully by programming with fore mentioned method. <b>Wind</b> <b>load</b> {{have a great}} influence on bridge vibration acceleration under low wind velocity. Vehicle vertical dynamic response is influenced evidently by wind induced bridge vibration, its lateral response is controlled by <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> and bridge response. The effect on system dynamic response of <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> is remarkable. For other type large span bridges the method also can be referred and have important application value in interrelated research. The accuracy of calculation is high enough for practical purposes...|$|R
30|$|Regarding the <b>wind</b> <b>load,</b> {{the force}} on the bridge is {{calculated}} by multiplying the wind-induced pressure by its corresponding area that {{is affected by the}} water level. Once the water level is determined as described in “Water velocity and water surface level” section, the projected area of the <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> can be obtained. The <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> is a random variable because of the uncertainty in the water level.|$|R

25|$|Friction dampers {{tend to be}} {{available}} in two major types, linear and rotational and dissipate energy by heat. The damper operates {{on the principle of}} a coulomb damper. Depending on the design, friction dampers can experience stick-slip phenomenon and Cold welding. The main disadvantage being that friction surfaces can wear over time and for this reason they are not recommended for dissipating <b>wind</b> <b>loads.</b> When used in seismic applications wear is not a problem and there is no required maintenance. They have a rectangular hysteretic loop {{and as long as the}} building is sufficiently elastic they tend to settle back to their original positions after an earthquake.|$|E
25|$|Aerodynamics is {{important}} {{in a number of}} applications other than aerospace engineering. It is a significant factor in any type of vehicle design, including automobiles. It {{is important}} in the prediction of forces and moments acting on sailing vessels. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as hard drive heads. Structural engineers also use aerodynamics, and particularly aeroelasticity, to calculate <b>wind</b> <b>loads</b> in the design of large buildings and bridges. Urban aerodynamics seeks to help town planners and designers improve comfort in outdoor spaces, create urban microclimates and reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes the ways atmospheric circulation and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. The aerodynamics of internal passages {{is important in}} heating/ventilation, gas piping, and in automotive engines where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.|$|E
500|$|During {{construction}} {{the underground}} parking garage remained open. An additional challenge was designing the structure to facilitate interior access for ongoing maintenance and repairs, while accommodating {{two levels of}} underground parking underneath. The challenge was solved by combining a T-bar grid to absorb weight with about 150"outriggers", or [...] "tiebacks", inserted through the video wall to support the glass blocks and absorb <b>wind</b> <b>loads.</b> This design allows {{for the removal of}} individual glass blocks for cleaning or repair without disruption to the display. The filtered air inside the towers helps minimize the need for cleaning. [...] Crown Fountains design not only included interior access for technical repairs, but also incorporated exemplary, non-discriminatory, barrier-free accessibility, because its interactivity {{is not limited to the}} able-bodied.

By comparing the analysis results under three conditions, the following conclusion can be reached: the long-span structure is more resistant against mean <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> when the roof is open than when it is closed. There is no decrease in fluctuating <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> and in some wind directions; the fluctuating <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> will be even larger.

The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the exterior side and a channel welded to the core columns on the interior side. [...] The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with viscoelastic dampers, which helped {{reduce the amount of}} sway felt by building occupants.|$|E

500|$|The World Trade Center towers {{included}} many structural engineering innovations in skyscraper design and construction, which allowed the buildings to reach new heights {{and become the}} tallest in the world. Traditionally, skyscrapers used a skeleton of columns distributed throughout the interior to support building loads, with interior columns disrupting the floor space. The tube-frame concept, earlier introduced by Fazlur Khan, was a major innovation, allowing open floor plans and more space to rent. The buildings used high-strength, load-bearing perimeter steel columns called Vierendeel trusses that were spaced closely {{together to form a}} strong, rigid wall structure. There were 60 perimeter columns, narrowly spaced, {{on each side of the}} buildings. In all, the perimeter walls of the towers were [...] on each side, and the corners were beveled. [...] The perimeter columns were designed to provide support for virtually all lateral loads (such as <b>wind</b> <b>loads)</b> and to share the gravity loads with the core columns. Structural analysis of major portions of the World Trade Center were computed on an IBM 1620.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccording to “General {{code for}} design of highway bridges and culverts” (JTG D 60 - 2004), “Wind-resistent design {{specification}} for highway bridges” (JTG/T D 60 - 01 - 2004) and “Load code {{for the design}} of building structures” (GB 50009 - 2001), the transverse direction <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> of long span girder bridge with high pier is calculated. Comparison of the <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> results obtained by different codes is completed under the situation of different terrain, pier height and girder length of bridge. The results show the difference of the <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> given by the three different codes exists. The <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> results predicated by “General code for design of highway bridges and culverts” is the largest compare with the results gained by other two methods. The results predicated by “Wind-resistent design specification for highway bridges” is less than results predicated by General code. While, the results predicated by “Load code {{for the design of}} building structures” is the smallest. The <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> calculated according to “Load code for the design of building structures” mainly depends on the experience parameters of architectural construction with larger dimensions, which has a poor applicability to the bridge structure.

2500|$|Due to {{a design}} {{oversight}} and changes during construction, {{the building as}} initially completed was structurally unsound. For his original design, LeMessurier calculated wind load on the building when wind blew perpendicularly {{against the side of}} the building—wind from due north, east, south, or west—all that was required by New York building code. Such winds are normally the worst case, and a structural system capable of handling them can easily cope with wind from any other angle. Thus, the engineer did not specifically calculate the effects of diagonally-oriented [...] "quartering winds" [...] (northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest). In June 1978, prompted by discussion between a civil engineering student at Princeton University, Diane Hartley, and design engineer Joel Weinstein, LeMessurier recalculated the <b>wind</b> <b>loads</b> on the building, this time including quartering winds. This recalculation revealed that with a quartering wind, there was a 40% increase in <b>wind</b> <b>loads,</b> resulting in a 160% increase in the load at the chevron brace connection joints.|$|E
