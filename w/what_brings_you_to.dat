In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the unconscious.

2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going <b>to</b> feel like. <b>You</b> are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is <b>what</b> will <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that <b>you</b> want it <b>to</b> be like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. <b>You</b> have <b>to</b> train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|R

Sandwich's first personal tragedy was his wife's deteriorating health and eventual insanity. During his wife's decline, Sandwich started an affair with the talented opera singer Martha Ray. During their relationship, Ray bore him at least five and {{perhaps as many as}} nine children, including Basil Montagu (1770 [...] - [...] 1851), writer, jurist and philanthropist. Tragedy was to strike again in April 1779 when Ray was murdered in the foyer of the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden by a jealous suitor, James Hackman, Rector of Wiveton. Sandwich never recovered from his grief. The events surrounding Ray's murder were depicted in a popular novel Love and Madness (1780) by Herbert Croft.In a famous exchange with the actor Samuel Foote, Sandwich declared, [...] "Foote, I have often wondered <b>what</b> catastrophe would <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> your end; but I think, that you must either die of the pox, or the halter." [...] "My lord", replied Foote instantaneously, [...] "that will depend upon one of two contingencies; -- whether I embrace your lordship's mistress, or your lordship's principles."

[...] Barwis' background in neurophysiology and biomechanics helped him understand how the body responds and adapts to stimulus and assisted him in creating scientific, personalized and adaptive training cycles for his athletes. The Barwis Methods philosophy of strength and conditioning also incorporates a proper nutritional foundation and aspects of mental and emotional stimulation that generate specific hormonal responses to facilitate maximum performance and adaptations. “There’s no question,” Barwis said. “My job really is to invest in the lives of others and to figure out what they need - not just physically, but also mentally to get them where they need to be. That’s a big part. Getting yourself in the right mental mindset and putting yourself through things that people - and you - don’t think are possible allows <b>you</b> <b>to</b> get to a place before the season starts where you feel like it doesn’t matter <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> me.

Then finding whatever new and original beats and moments come out of that by working with the director and living the life of the character organically in the moment. As it’s scripted, this is what the character does - not me. That’s how I separate myself from that. I don’t use the Method. I’m not going into my own past to create a psychological condition that would drive me as an actor to create that moment. When you can embrace the life of the character and the environment and the scene that’s taking place, the rest happens naturally if your instrument is tuned............ learned from Manu was that it doesn’t matter what the project is.

The new exchange is the implementation of 2. 0 technology enabling greater reuse of content and user participation.
