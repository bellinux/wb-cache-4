5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also liked the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked that people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> that the player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E

500|$|In the Old Testament, {{there are}} two Hebrew words for meditation: hāgâ (...) , which means to sigh or murmur, but also to meditate, and sîḥâ (...) , which means to muse, or rehearse in one's mind. When the Hebrew Bible was {{translated}} into Greek, hāgâ became the Greek melete which emphasized meditation's movement in {{the depth of the}} human heart. Melete <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> that one should never let meditation be a formality. The Latin Bible then translated hāgâ/melete into meditatio.|$|E

This first became evident in 2004, when Dylan appeared in a TV advertisement for Victoria's Secret lingerie. Three years later, in October 2007, he participated in a multi-media campaign for the 2008 Cadillac Escalade. Then, in 2009, he gave the highest profile endorsement of his career, appearing with rapper will.i.am in a Pepsi ad that debuted during the telecast of Super Bowl XLIII. The ad, broadcast to a record audience of 98 million viewers, opened with Dylan singing the first verse of [...] "Forever Young" [...] followed by will.i.am doing a hip hop version of the song's third and final verse.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. James Poniewozik of Time magazine wrote that, Andy's Play' {{was the kind}} of strong, character driven episode I've missed from the show—not just good by later season standards but an actual good Office episode, period." [...] Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic wrote that the episode <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of [...] "what has always been great about this show". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that the episode [...] "worked largely because it embraced [...] idea" [...] that [...] "the bonds you form at work go deeper than carpet, and that if you work with people long enough they can feel like your family." [...] He ultimately concluded that the episode was one that [...] "makes me happy [...] I spent an evening in the company of these goofballs." ...|$|E
500|$|Dave Gray and Jeanne Shami, {{writing in}} the Modern Language Quarterly, argue {{that it was not}} just a work of {{political}} rhetoric but a work of political advice, aimed at Prince Charles, to whom it was dedicated. The political situation at the time was complex, as King James was ill and Charles attempting to gain control of the government. Gray and Shami highlight the noted line [...] "No man is an island"; while most interpret it spiritually, they argue that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> to the prince and his advisors that [...] "even private actions have public consequences". The veiled nature of the political references was deliberate; it allowed the work to be acceptable to the censors, but accessible to Charles and those close to him. In the event that they rejected the underlying message, it would also be accessible to other prominent and influential political figures.|$|E
500|$|Michael Hann of The Guardian said [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] was a cute pop song. Later, while {{reviewing}} the Wonder World Tour, he elaborated that the song <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> [...] "that manufactured pop {{need not be}} a bad thing – if the manufacturing is good enough". Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music said, [...] "Fortunately for Cyrus, [...] flee your brain cells within seconds of their final chords, which means you're more likely to remember the breezily brilliant hit 'Party in the U.S.A.'" [...] Mikael Wood of New York City's Time Out magazine described the song as a [...] "killer tune [...] which proves that Miley makes for a much better rapper than you might expect". Heather Phares of AllMusic selected the track as one of the EPs best, describing it as a frothy party anthem suitable for Cyrus' alias, Hannah Montana. > Review|first=Heather|last=Phares|work=Allmusic|accessdate=August 29, 2010}} ...|$|E

500|$|Eric Goldman, {{writing for}} IGN, graded the episode a 9.0 out of 10, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} “amazing”. His very positive review focused on the ambiguous nature of the main plot and the subplots of Dick and Logan. He praised {{the presence of the}} majority of the main cast members, also stating that Dick’s reaction to dealing with his brother was realistic for him and in character. The reviewer called the conclusion to the case-of-the-week a “fun and satisfying one” that highlighted the moral ambiguity of main characters, something “that the show had been lacking for a while.” He highlighted this ambiguity in both Weevil in Logan, elaborating that Logan attacking Piz showed an interesting side to his personality that had not been present all season. The reviewer also lauded the cliffhanger ending, stating, “it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of how exciting and intense this show can be at its best.” Television Without Pity did not grant the episode a rating but lauded the characterization of Weevil, stating, “This is the most consistently written character on the show, bar none.” ...|$|E
500|$|In 1969, the American Civil Liberties Union (representing three clergymen, an atheist, and {{a leader}} of the American Ethical Society), tried to block the {{construction}} of a nativity scene on The Ellipse in Washington, D.C. When the ACLU claimed the government sponsorship of a distinctly Christian symbol violated separation of church and state, the sponsors of the fifty-year-old Christmas celebration, Pageant of Peace, who had an exclusive permit from the Interior Department for all events on the Ellipse, responded that the nativity scene <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of America's spiritual heritage. The United States Court of Appeals ruled on December 12, 1969, that the crèche be allowed that year. The case continued until September 26, 1973, when the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and found the involvement of the Interior Department and the National Park Service in the Pageant of Peace amounted to government support for religion. The court opined that the nativity scene should be dropped from the pageant or the government end its participation in the event in order to avoid [...] "excessive entanglements" [...] between government and religion. In 1973, the nativity scene vanished.|$|E

In reaction to the event, a Bosnian student told {{members of the international}} press, [...] "I felt excluded from the world for so long. It's not only about U2. It's the feeling of being part of the world." [...] A local resident said that the concert was [...] "proof that we have peace here, that everything is OK". Fans from outside the former Yugoslavia described Sarajevo as [...] "an oasis of light" [...] in the midst of destroyed and fire-damaged buildings, and deserted villages. Despite the subpar performance, the Associated Press said, [...] "For two magical hours, the rock band U2 achieved what warriors, politicians and diplomats could not: They united Bosnia." [...] Andrew Mueller of The Independent wrote, [...] "For {{the first time since the}} start of the war in 1992, people more accustomed to seeing each other through the sights of a rifle were converging on the capital to listen to music together. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of prewar Sarajevo, home to some of old Yugoslavia's best rock bands." [...] Sacirbey stated that he was satisfied that the concert [...] "was held to promote a sense of normalcy, peace and reconciliation in Sarajevo and not to raise money." [...] He also expressed thanks on behalf of President Alija Izetbegović, who described the concert as a [...] "landmark event".|$|E

500|$|Æthelberht died in 616, during Laurence's tenure; his son Eadbald {{abandoned}} Christianity {{in favour}} of Anglo-Saxon paganism, forcing [...] many of the Gregorian missionaries to flee the pagan backlash that followed Æthelberht's death. Among them in Gaul were Mellitus, who was Bishop of London, and Justus, who was Bishop of Rochester. Remaining in Britain, Laurence succeeded in reconverting Eadbald to Christianity. Bede relates the story that Laurence had been prepared to give up when he was visited by St Peter in a dream or vision. St Peter chastised Laurence and whipped him, and the marks of the whipping remained after the vision or dream ended. Laurence then displayed them to Eadbald, and the king was converted on the spot. Bede, however, hints {{that it was the}} death of some {{of the leaders of the}} pagan party in battle that really persuaded Laurence to stay. According to Benedicta Ward, a historian of Christianity, Bede uses the story of the whipping as an example of how suffering <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of Christ's suffering for humans, and how that example could lead to conversion. Wright argues that another point Bede is making is that it is because of the intercession of St Peter [...] himself that the mission continued. David Farmer, in the Oxford Dictionary of Saints, suggests that the whipping story may have been a blending of the Quo Vadis story with some information given by Jerome in a letter.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the eclipse}} by International Modernism of turn-of-the 20th century vernacular-inspired British and American Arts and Crafts {{buildings}} and European [...] National Romanticism, an early {{work in the}} renewed defense of vernacular was Bernard Rudofsky's 1964 book , based on his MoMA exhibition. [...] The book <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of the legitimacy and [...] "hard-won knowledge" [...] inherent in vernacular buildings, from Polish salt-caves to gigantic Syrian water wheels to Moroccan desert fortresses, and was considered iconoclastic at the time. [...] Rudofsky was, however, very much a Romantic who viewed native populations in a historical bubble of contentment. [...] Rudofsky's book was also based largely on photographs and not on on-site study.|$|E

Troy helped promote the reissue; she referred to the relevance {{of some of the}} song lyrics in the 1990s, with regard to racial tensions within America, and recalled of the project's blending of musical genres and cultures: [...] "Doing that album <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> that 'soul' didn't have a color." ...|$|E
