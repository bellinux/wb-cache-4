5|$|About 10,000 years ago, malaria {{started having}} {{a major impact}} on human survival, coinciding with the start of {{agriculture}} in the Neolithic revolution. Consequences included natural selection for sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, elliptocytosis and loss of the Gerbich antigen (glycophorin C) and the Duffy antigen on the erythrocytes, because such blood disorders confer a selective advantage against malaria infection (balancing selection). The three major types of inherited genetic resistance (sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean world {{by the time of the}} Roman Empire, about 2000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologic records {{indicate}} that dogs <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Society Islands {{from the period}} of initial settlement {{up to the point}} of European contact. Modern digs in Tahiti and the other Society Islands have uncovered few surviving remains of the Tahitian Dog. In 1960, a few canine teeth were uncovered at Ana Paia shelter, on Mo'orea. In 1962, a complete skull, limbs, and vertebrae were discovered at a marae site on Mo'orea along with a jawbone at another site on the same island.|$|E
5|$|As a cardinal, Paul had {{previously}} maintained neutrality between {{the great powers}} of Spain and France that had dominated the previous conclave and <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current one as well. While {{he had been the}} papal envoy to Spain and was receiving a pension from them, he was largely low profile as a cardinal and perceived as neutral. At 52, Paul was young {{at the time of his}} election, and was anticipated to have a lengthy papacy, not requiring a third conclave soon.|$|E

5|$|At {{the appeal}} hearing at the {{regional}} court in Dresden, in the morning 1 July 2009, nine people <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> courtroom: three judges, the prosecutor, Wiens as the defendant, his court-appointed defence counsel, El-Sherbini as witness for the prosecution, and her husband and son as observers. No security personnel were present and no security searches of individuals and their possessions were carried out; this was a common procedure for cases without anticipated security concerns or detained persons present.|$|E
5|$|Brooks was {{assigned}} three prominent Minstrel attorneys, {{and after a}} year of sitting on the docket, at about 11 AM on April 15, 1874, Baxter's demurrer to Brook's complaint was suddenly called up. Neither of Baxter's lawyers <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> court room, and the demurrer had been submitted without their knowledge. Without giving Baxter any time to testify, Judge Whytock overruled the demurrer and awarded Brooks $2,000 in damages and the office of Governor of Arkansas. Neither Brooks nor the court notified the legislature or Governor Baxter. Judge Wytock then swore in Joseph Brooks as the new governor of Arkansas, despite having no authority to do so.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, No.6 Squadron escorted convoys off the Australian east coast and undertook training exercises with the Australian Army and RAN. The squadron's Ansons were replaced by twelve Mark I Lockheed Hudson light bombers during April and May 1940. These aircraft were much more capable than the Ansons, having a longer range, higher speed and greater bomb load. No.6 Squadron continued to be based at Richmond, though detachments were made to other airstrips along the east coast when the squadron escorted troop convoys. In August 1940 the squadron conducted long range patrols searching for German raiders which <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tasman Sea, but without success.|$|E

50|$|The trophozoites {{live within}} the gut lumen. They measure 200-300 µm × 40-70 µm. There are 30-40 grooves along the body. Four refringent rods <b>are</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mucron. A vacuole may also <b>be</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mucron.|$|R
5|$|Four of the {{officers}} were {{of the line and}} responsible for the handling of the vessel and operation of guns during battle, while the engineering officers were considered a class unto themselves. In Monitors turret, Greene and Stodder supervised loading and firing of the two 11-inch Dahlgrens. Each gun was crewed by eight men. Thus, during battle, at least 18 men <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> turret. In Worden's report of 27 January 1862 to Welles, he stated he believed 17 men and 2 officers would be the maximum number in the turret that allowed the crew to work without getting in each other's way.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, the Liberal {{opposition}} {{brought forward}} a non-binding motion for Canada to renew {{its commitment to}} the Kyoto Protocol. All Conservative MPs who <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House, including Baird, voted against the motion, which passed {{with the support of}} the three opposition parties. The following month, opposition members on a special Commons committee used their majority to bring forward sweeping changes to the government's Clean Air Act. Among other things, the revised act called for participation in international carbon markets and the fulfillment of Kyoto targets.|$|E
5|$|Indiana, a {{free state}} and the boyhood home of Abraham Lincoln, {{remained}} {{a member of the}} Union during the American Civil War. Indiana regiments were involved in all the major engagements of the war and almost all the engagements in the western theater. Hoosiers <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first and last battles of the war. During the war, Indiana provided 126 infantry regiments, 26 batteries of artillery, and 13 regiments of cavalry to the cause of the Union.|$|E

5|$|Jeffrey Henderson {{writes that}} women <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> theatre, citing Plato's Laws and Gorgias {{as saying that}} drama was {{addressed}} to men, women and children. Henderson also mentions later stories about Athenian theatre, such as the tale that Aeschylus' Eumenides had frightened women in the audience into miscarrying. Other evidence {{of the presence of}} women at the theatre in Athens includes the absence of surviving prohibitions against their attendance and the importance of women in Athenian rituals, especially those associated with Dionysus.|$|E
5|$|Neither Sigismund nor Maximilian <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth at that time. After {{receiving}} {{news of the}} election, both Sigismund and Maximilan made haste for Poland. Sigismund {{arrived at}} Danzig (Gdańsk) on 28 September and, after approximately two weeks, he had departed to Kraków, where he arrived on 9 December and was crowned on 27 December.|$|E
5|$|Of the two subfamilies, tyrannosaurines {{appear to}} have been more widespread. Albertosaurines are unknown in Asia, which was home to the tyrannosaurines, such as Tarbosaurus and Zhuchengtyrannus, and Qianzhousaurus and Alioramus of the Alioramini. Both the Tyrannosaurinae and Albertosaurinae subfamilies <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Campanian and early Maastrichtian stages of North America, with tyrannosaurines like Daspletosaurus ranging {{throughout}} the Western Interior, while the albertosaurines Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus are currently known only from the northwestern part of the continent.|$|E

5|$|Saya's {{battles with}} the Elder Bairns become {{increasingly}} desperate {{as they begin}} attacking during the day, and both Nene and Nono fall victim, leaving Saya deeply hurt. Shinichirō eventually learns of Saya's burden and offers to help, but is later killed himself. An attack on Saya's school results in everyone but Saya and Itsuki dying before Saya can kill the attacking Elder Bairn. Saya later realizes that only her class and their teacher Kanako <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school. Due to the blanks in her memory and comments from the Elder Bairns, she begins questioning her identity and mission.|$|E
5|$|Small sized {{pterosaur}} species apparently <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Csehbánya Formation, {{indicating a}} higher diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs than previously accounted for. The recent {{findings of a}} small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous might actually have simply been rarely preserved in the fossil record, helped {{by the fact that}} there is a strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity might actually had been much larger than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|The average {{purity of}} the silver items is 96%. The {{remainder}} of the metal {{is made up of}} copper and a small amount of zinc, with trace amounts of lead, gold, and bismuth present. The zinc is likely to have been present in a copper brass used to alloy the silver when the objects were made, and the lead, gold, and bismuth probably <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unrefined silver ore.|$|E

5|$|The {{multiplayer}} side of Mysteries of the Sith {{was received}} positively, {{but did not}} completely escape criticism. Emil Pagliarulo of The Adrenaline Vault questioned why certain features seemed to be missing from the multiplayer mode that <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> single-player mode. One such feature is the rancor which appears prominently in a single-player level but is not in any multiplayer maps.|$|E
5|$|The planets were {{originally}} {{thought to have}} formed in or near their current orbits. However, this view underwent radical change during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Currently, {{it is thought that}} the Solar System looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner Solar System, the outer Solar System was much more compact than it is now, and the Kuiper belt was much closer to the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of a final combined image at each wavelength was a complex process. Bright pixels caused by cosmic ray impacts during exposures were removed by comparing exposures of equal length taken one after the other, and identifying pixels that were affected by cosmic rays in one exposure but not the other. Trails of space debris and artificial satellites <b>were</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original images, and were carefully removed.|$|E
