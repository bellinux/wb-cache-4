500|$|Selman {{wanted to}} include {{things in the}} episode that [...] "only really hard-core foodies would have any idea <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about. This was like a love letter to foodie culture." [...] Food {{references}} featured in the episode include jokes about sriracha sauce and sous-vide cooking, referrals to chefs Wylie Dufresne, Frank Bruni, and Ruth Reichl, a mention of the soup phở from Vietnam and how to pronounce it correctly, and {{the inclusion of the}} El Chemistri owner who is based on the Spanish chef José Andrés (known for using molecular gastronomy). Selman has commented that food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy [...] "lends itself to comedy quite nicely. There’s a dish , for instance, called Regret. The waiter cries into your soup when he serves it. The human tear is the final ingredient." [...] The fictional character Swedish Chef is also seen in the episode, and the scene where the meth dealer is reminded of his childhood after eating the apple pie is a reference to the Pixar film Ratatouille, which was written and directed by former Simpsons consultant Brad Bird.|$|E
2500|$|Spooner {{said the}} series [...] "worked because {{it became a}} parody on itself, almost. You can only do that so long." [...] Overall he {{attributes}} {{the success of the}} show to its light approach. [...] "We spoofed everything, we took Mission: Impossible, Bad Day at Black Rock, High Noon, The Dirty Dozen, The Birds... we took them all. The film buffs used to love it. There were always lines in it that people knew <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "On--on everything. On <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about,--the {{carnival}} feeling, the levity, on the unbelief of the age. Isn't {{it because}} the control has been taken off?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "Oh, I forgot. And I don't know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about myself." [...] She falls limply {{back into}} her chair and closes her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|He {{filled his}} pipe {{and turned to}} Jim. [...] "Hope I didn't interrupt. I forget <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about. It looks as if you didn't like a waiter's job." ...|$|E

6000|$|... ‘Go!’ she said. ‘Go now at once. My {{brain is}} in a whirl. I scarce know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking.</b> Go; and good-night; and oh, may you come safe!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go!" [...] she said, [...] "Go now at once! My {{brain is}} in a whirl. I scarce know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking.</b> Go; and good-night; and oh, may you come safe!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] I answered. [...] "Let us {{go on with}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about. Tell me {{how long}} you stayed with Mrs. Clements in London, and how you came here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poet!" [...] she smiled. [...] "No, it isn't quite poinsetta. It's {{nearer the}} red-orange {{of a tree}} I {{remember}} one autumn, in the White Mountains, with the setting sun on it. But that wasn't <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about. Laurels! Your laurels." ...|$|E
60|$|Look at the {{influence}} of a mere play of physiognomy! If you remember <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about you will hardly believe that I caught myself grinning down at that demure little girl. I must say too that I felt more friendly to her at the moment than ever before.|$|E

6000|$|... "Let us {{get down}} {{first of all}} to bedrock and find out <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about," [...] Dick was prompt on the uptake. [...] "What is woman?" [...] he demanded {{with an air of}} earnestness.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is just <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about," [...] Charlie said, when Stanislas had {{repeated}} the captain's speech, [...] "and the danger seems {{too great to}} be risked. Think you, that when we get farther to the east, we shall {{be able to make}} our way more easily up into Livonia?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{want to know}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about," [...] said Mrs. Travers, {{altering}} slowly {{her position}} so as to confront d'Alcacer whose face was almost undistinguishable. [...] "Oh, well, then, we talked about opera, the realities and illusions of the stage, of dresses, of people's names, {{and things of that}} sort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in with me," [...] she begged. [...] "Somehow, I feel {{cold and}} lonely to-night. It hasn't {{anything}} to do with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about, but I feel as though something were going to happen, that something were coming out of the shadows, something that threatens either you or me. I'm silly, but come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I declare I {{never knew}} {{anything}} like you. What can it signify to you, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> of.

50|$|Some {{practitioners}} and portfolio managers seem to completely ignore or dismiss volatility forecasting models.

5000|$|Questions {{concerning}} {{politics are}} central on the Kammerbühne (chamber stage). There, The Stronghold of Europe is {{being looked at}} from various perspectives. A number of events and theatre layouts are concerned with questions such as: Who decides who is allowed to live here? <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about when <b>we</b> talk about Europe? Who belongs to Europe? ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{companion}} and I, having {{a discussion on}} some point of ancient history, were amused by the attitude which the Indian, who could not tell <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about, assumed. He constituted himself umpire, and, judging by our air and gesture, he very seriously remarked from time to time, [...] "You beat," [...] or [...] "He beat." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{latter part}} of this address was {{scarcely}} heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, {{and his eyes were}} directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, [...] "Sir William's interruption has made me forget <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> of." ...|$|E

[...] So much the father said at breakfast, hardly giving his mind to the matter discussed,--his mind being on other things. But when their breakfast was eaten, then it was {{necessary}} that he should begin. [...] "Silverbridge," [...] he said, [...] "I hope you have thought better of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about as to these coming elections." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{invocation}} {{of the notion}} of a “knowledge society ” has become ubiquitous. Among its many dangers is that it creates the illusion that <b>we</b> know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about when <b>we</b> talk about “knowledge”. This paper claims that, when it comes to knowledge, we do not know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about. More specifically, this paper argues that the contemporary discourse on knowledge, particularly in Europe and North America, suffers from three major deficits: Deficit No. 1 : It does not take a critical enough view of what “knowledge ” means, and of the fundamental changes that the concept of knowledge has undergone {{in the course of the}} 20 th century. Deficit No. 2 : It fails to address the political conditions and consequences of the production and use of knowledge – in other words, it is oblivious to the politics of knowledge...|$|R
5000|$|In 1952, Whyte {{coined the}} term [...] "Groupthink":Groupthink being a coinage - and, admittedly, a loaded one - a working {{definition}} <b>is</b> in order. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> not <b>talking</b> about mere instinctive conformity - it is, after all, a perennial failing of mankind. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about <b>is</b> a rationalized conformity - an open, articulate philosophy which holds that group values are not only expedient but right and good as well.|$|R
40|$|Extract] Despite {{international}} promulgation of the term, Australians don't usually {{refer to}} our own country as "down under". If however, {{you have no idea}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about, let us turn to Wikipedia, which states: "The term Down Under is a colloquialism referring to New Zealand and Australia. The term {{comes from the fact that}} this country is located in the southern hemisphere, below many other countries on the globe. ...|$|R

60|$|As a beginning, and {{in order}} that Archie and Harvey might {{understand}} the better why I had brought the Tory with me, Hiram insisted upon my telling once more {{the story of what}} had happened since I crept out through the tunnel, and this I did, speaking cautiously, as you can well fancy, for if peradventure Master Lord had heard the hum of our conversation he would have made it his business to learn <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{underline}} the fact that, in most contemporary philosophical debates (and somehow, issues in feminist theory are not an exception), a well-known term is playing an important role: experience. We need a cartography of the uses of experience, if we want to know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about and also if we intend to analyze and to rethink the last 25 years of ¿women studies¿, ¿gender studies¿ or ¿subaltern studies¿...|$|R
40|$|Almost all {{the discussions}} and {{recommendations}} {{on the subject}} matter of the topic of our paper are plagued by ambiguities, inconsistencies and uncertainties in the central concepts involved. Good policies and implementation measure for planning and managing the prevention and mitigation of natural disasters cannot follow from such a confused, unclear and problematical starting point. <b>We</b> need to <b>be</b> clear first about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> of before anyone can seriously advance conclusions and suggest means and ends which ought to be pursued...|$|R
