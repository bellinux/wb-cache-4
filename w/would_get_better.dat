25|$|On 21 May 2016, Jorge Vergara {{announced}} {{in an official}} press conference that the club was not renewing contract with Mexican Television giants Televisa, thus, ending a 22-year run with the broadcasting company. Vergara then announced the establishment of Chivas TV, the club's own channel for live games, interviews, and more. Chivas TV would have a rough start with many complaints from customers about a difficulty watching the live games, but the service <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> as the season progressed and allies such as Cinepolis Klic, Claro Video, and TDN joined the project and also broadcast the live games.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} to {{differentiate}} between negatives taken with the older complan lens and negatives taken with the later minox lens, MINOX introduced an edge code in the negative. Since the MINOX C (the first camera released with the new minox lens) every 8x11mm camera had a distinct edge code to identify the camera. The reason was that commercial processors used MINOX enlargers. As the minox lens replaced the complan, so the enlargers had to change lenses: MINOX II enlargers were curved negative track and complan lenses, MINOX III enlargers were straight negative track and minox lenses. Ironically, owners of Rigas and model II cameras <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> results from a MINOX III enlarger than a MINOX II enlarger.|$|E
25|$|In the Bullets' 1995–96 season Webber {{suffered}} a dislocated left shoulder in a preseason {{game against the}} Indiana Pacers on October 21, and opened the season on the injured list. He was activated on November 27, but strained his shoulder against the New York Knicks on December 29. After hoping the injury <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> with rest, Webber finally underwent surgery on Feb. 1 which sidelined him {{for the remainder of}} the season. The Bullets were 9–6 with Webber in the lineup as he averaged a team-high 23.7 points plus 7.6 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.80 steals in 37.2 minutes per game when he was able to play. Other players injured included Mark Price (who only played in 7 games) and Robert Pack (31 games played out of 82). Bright spots of the season included the selection of Rasheed Wallace in the 1995 NBA draft and the All-Star play of Howard. Howard averaged a career-best 22.1 ppg and 8.1 rpg and kept the Bullets slim playoff hopes alive until the end of the season. Center Gheorghe Mureșan was named Most Improved Player of The Year, averaging 14.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 2.3 blocks. The Bullets improved to 39–43 but just missed the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season.|$|E

25|$|After {{giving birth}} to their son, Ricky Williams, Isabella was {{convinced}} that her life <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>better.</b> Christine apparently didn't {{want anything to do}} with Paul, so Paul decided to marry and move away with Isabella. Paul's jealousy got the best of him, and he raped Christine, which Isabella later found out about and decided to dump Paul. Isabella was suspicious of a woman named Kelly Simmons that tried to investigate her, without realizing it was Christine in disguise. Paul decided to go back to Isabella and was even ready to move away with her. Christine found out about Michael's plot with Isabella and told everything to Paul. The couple reunited, and an unhappy Isabella decided to have her revenge. She made it seem like Christine had murdered her and, at the same time, she was plotting her next move. While everyone thought she was dead, Isabella confronted Christine in a bathtub after drugging her. Isabella was about to kill Christine when Paul arrived to stop her in time. Christine and Paul reunited but were unaware that Isabella was still alive. Michael came just in time to save Christine's and Paul's lives and Isabella was committed to a psychiatric hospital in Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Having started {{rigorous}} workouts in {{the final}} trimester of her pregnancy the year before to prepare {{for her role in}} A Few Good Men, Moore was physically fit for the photoshoot. Thus she appeared in additional nude photos within the magazine's cover story. Moore viewed the photos as a chance to show off the results of her workouts: [...] "I said I <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> with each baby and I have." [...] The weeklong effort also involved shots taken in Kauai, Hawaii that are included in Gair's second book, Body Painting. Moore felt she looked better on the cover at age 29 than she had in a bikini nine years earlier in Blame It on Rio.|$|E

500|$|Watts {{retained}} {{his spot}} {{the next week}} for the round nine match against [...] at TIO Stadium in Darwin, and kicked two early goals to help the club win by one point. He maintained his spot in the side {{for the remainder of}} the year, even after recording just three disposals against [...] in round eleven, with the club opting to give him game time and reiterate he was a long-term prospect who <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> with time. He played fifteen games in his second season, kicking ten goals, with former Essendon forward and three-time Coleman Medallist, Matthew Lloyd, stating Watts would be [...] "ecstatic" [...] with his season and he [...] "presented across half-forward so well and is building his body and engine to hold down that position for a sustained period for Melbourne". Shane Crawford, the 1999 Brownlow Medallist, noted he had improved that year and showed enough glimpses to predict he would be a top ten player in the competition in the next few years. A club post-season trip to China saw Watts play in an exhibition match against Brisbane known as the Shanghai Showdown; played at Jiangwan Stadium, Melbourne won the match by five points.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his first}} four days at home his {{appetite}} decreased and his cough worsened; this prompted {{his parents to}} send him to the doctor, who, at once, ordered bed rest. Inflammation was diagnosed, and as was the custom at that time, the doctor decided to perform bloodletting. The doctor cut Dominic's arm ten times in the space of four days and it is now considered that this probably hastened his death. In his biography, John Bosco records that Dominic was calm throughout the procedure. The doctor assured his parents that the danger had passed and now it only remained for him to recuperate. Dominic, however, was sure that his death was approaching, and asked that he be allowed to make his Confession and receive Communion. Though they thought it unnecessary, his parents sent for the parish priest who heard Dominic's confession and administered the Eucharist. After four days, despite the conviction of the doctor and his parents that he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>better,</b> Dominic asked that he be given the Anointing of the Sick in preparation for death. Again, his parents agreed, to please him. On March 9, he was given the papal blessing and he said the Confiteor. Don Bosco records that throughout these days, he stayed serene and calm. On the evening of March 9, 1857, after being visited by his parish priest, he asked his father to read him the prayers for the Exercise of a Happy Death from his book of devotions. Then he slept a while, and shortly awakened and said in a clear voice, ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1998 {{a wrestler}} in International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) began working as [...] "Mr. Niebla", even {{wearing the same}} style mask and trunks as the {{original}} Mr. Niebla. IWRG claimed that the original Mr. Niebla did not actually own {{the rights to the}} name but was given it by a trainer and that the IWRG had gotten permission from that same individual to use the Mr. Niebla name. When the original Mr. Niebla was injured CMLL brought in the second Mr. Niebla and had him work matches while the original was injured. When the original Mr. Niebla returned to the ring he immediately attacked the impostor. The storyline between the two Mr. Nieblas came to an end when the two met in a Luchas de apuestas, mask vs. mask match for the rights to the name. The original Mr. Niebla won, forcing the impostor to unmask and change his name to Mr. Mexico. Mr. Niebla continued to team with Shocker but the team were not able to win the Tag Team title back. On September 24, 1999, at the CMLL 66th Anniversary Show, the team of Nr. Niebla and Shocker faced Atlantis and Villaño III in a Relevos suicida match, a match where the losing team would fight each other for their mask. In the main event match of CMLL's 66th Anniversary show, Atlantis and Villaño III defeated the much less experienced team, afterwards Mr. Niebla defeated Shocker to unmask him. On March 30, 2001, Mr. Niebla teamed up with Olímpico and Safari to defeat Blue Panther, Fuerza Guerrera and El Signo to win the Mexican National Trios Championship. For the next 450 days the trios defended the title against Emilio Charles Jr., Bestia Salvaje and Scorpio Jr.; Satánico, Averno and Black Warrior; Los Boricuas (Gran Markus, Jr., Poder Boricua and Violencia) and Los Infernales (Satanico, Averno, Mephisto). Their second defense against Los Infernales was unsuccessful and on June 23, 2002, Mr. Niebla, Olímpico and Safair lost the Mexican National Trios Title. Only a week prior, on June 16, 2002, Mr. Niebla had teamed up with Atlantis and Black Warrior to regain the CMLL World Trios Title from Dr. Wagner, Jr. Blue Panther and Fuerza Guerrera. The team defended the titles into 2003, losing them to Dr. Wagner, Jr, Universo 2000 and Black Tiger III on March 31, 2003. The match against Wagner, Universo and Black Tiger III was part of a longer storyline between Mr. Niebla and Universo 2000. The two had clashed in 2002 over Universo 2000's CMLL World Heavyweight Championship but at the time Universo 2000 had kept the title. On April 18, 2003, Mr. Niebla defeated Universo 2000 to become the CMLL World Heavyweight Champion. Mr. Niebla would successfully turn back the challenges of Universo 2000, Apolo Dantés, Shocker, Rey Bucanero and Tinieblas, Jr. over the next 543 days. On October 12, 2004, Mr. Niebla lost the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship back to Universo 2000 and was unsuccessful in his attempt to regain it. In late 2006 or early 2007 Mr. Niebla left CMLL, he would later explain the decision to as a desire for him to not [...] "go backward" [...] down the rankings of the promotion and felt he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> opportunities elsewhere.|$|E
