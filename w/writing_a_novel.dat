5|$|Batman: The Ultimate Evil {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Andrew Vachss and {{published}} in 1995 by the Warner Aspect imprint of Warner Books. Vachss was an attorney specializing in child abuse cases, {{as well as a}} crime novelist best known for his series of books featuring the character Burke, a private investigator who also takes on child abuse cases. A representative from DC Comics approached Vachss about the possibility of <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> featuring Batman. Viewing {{this as an opportunity to}} reach a completely different audience, Vachss agreed and wrote a draft. He continued with his themes concerning child sexual abuse and explored the topic of child sex tourism. The publisher required Vachss to follow certain rules, like making a clear distinction between fiction and reality and prohibiting the Batman character from killing, cursing, or having sex.|$|E
5|$|Verne {{began playing}} {{with the idea of}} {{bringing}} a mixed selection of Voyages Extraordinaires characters together on a new adventure in early 1875, when he considered <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> in which Samuel Fergusson from Five Weeks in a Balloon, Pierre Aronnax from Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Phileas Fogg from Around the World in Eighty Days, Dr. Clawbonny from The Adventures of Captain Hatteras, and other characters would go around the world together in a heavier-than-air flying machine. Another novel featuring a similar trip around the world in a flying machine, Alphonse Brown's La Conquête de l'air, was published later that year, causing Verne to put the idea on hold. The idea, in highly modified form, finally reemerged five years later as Journey Through the Impossible.|$|E
5|$|Trevor Munson {{conceived}} {{the character of}} Mick Angel in 2004 and spent {{two and a half}} years <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> featuring the character. The story was adapted into a feature film script, and Bruce Willis was considered as a possibility for the lead role. The script was shown to Nina Tassler at CBS, who paired Munson with Ron Koslow, creator of Beauty and the Beast, to rewrite the script as a television series. The series was titled Twilight, and Koslow and Munson wrote the pilot, which Warner Bros. Television initially commissioned as a presentation lasting 14–20 minutes in January 2007. Joel Silver and Gerard Bocaccio were hired to be executive producers on the project under the former's production banner, Silver Pictures, in the same month. Alex O'Loughlin and Shannon Lucio were cast in the presentation, and Rod Holcomb was hired as director. The project was renamed Moonlight when picked up by CBS on May 14, 2007, prior the upfronts. David Greenwalt, creator of Miracles and co-creator of Angel, joined the staff in May 2007 as showrunner and executive producer alongside Silver. CBS had hired Greenwalt during the pilot process to restructure the original concept by Koslow and Munson, but health reasons forced Greenwalt to leave the series, and Chip Johannessen took over showrunner duties in August 2007.|$|E

Peckham was given an honorary {{doctorate}} degree by Olivet College in 1976. He continued his writing, turning out occasional historical articles. He also taught and attended a few classes at the local community college, and took up playing the bassoon in the community orchestra.

25|$|Although {{the revolt}} was a proscribed topic during Nicholas’ reign, Alexander Herzen placed the {{profiles}} of executed Decembrists {{on the cover}} of his radical periodical Polar Star. Alexander Pushkin addressed poems to his Decembrist friends, Nikolai Nekrasov wrote a long poem about the Decembrist wives, and Leo Tolstoy started <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> on that liberal movement, which would later evolve into War and Peace. In the Soviet era Yuri Shaporin produced an opera entitled Dekabristi (The Decembrists), about the revolt, with the libretto written by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy. It premiered at the Bolshoi Theatre on 23 June 1953.|$|E
25|$|After {{two years}} Honan {{transferred}} to the University of Chicago, from which he received his BA and, in 1951, his MA. He continued {{to work in a}} variety of jobs, including as a publisher in New York. There he met, and in 1952 married, a French Fulbright scholar, Jeannette nee Colin (died 2009), and the couple eventually had three children: Corinna, a writer and editor, and twins Matthew and Natasha. Honan was drafted into the US army {{at the end of the}} Korean War, but as a conscientious objector, he refused to fight. He was jailed briefly, but allowed to serve in a non-combat role in France. Upon discharge, under the GI Bill, he qualified for a grant to study anywhere he chose. He moved with his wife and baby daughter to England in 1956 to study at the University of London, gaining the degree of Ph.D, with a thesis on Robert Browning, in 1959 (which was published in 1961 as Browning's Characters), while also <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel,</b> two plays, poems, short stories and academic papers.|$|E

25|$|With the 1840 novels finished, Ainsworth {{began to}} write Old St. Paul's, A Tale of the Plague and the Fire. The work ran in The Sunday Times from 3 January 1841 to 26 December 1841, which was an {{achievement}} as {{he became one of}} the first writers to have a work appear in a national paper in such a form. His next works, Windsor Castle and The Miser's Daughter, appeared in 1842. The first mention of Windsor Castle comes in a letter to Crossley, 17 November 1841, in which Ainsworth admits to <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> about Windsor Castle and the events surrounding Henry VIII's first and second marriages. The Miser's Daughter was published first, starting with the creation of Ainsworth's Magazine, an independent project that Ainsworth started after leaving Bentley's Miscellany. To create the magazine, Ainsworth joined up with Cruikshank, who would serve as the illustrator. Cruikshank moved his efforts from his own magazine, The Omnibus, to the new magazine, and an advertisement for it appeared in December 1841, saying that the first issue would be published on 29 January 1842. The opening of the magazine was welcomed by contemporary members of the press, which only increased as the magazine proved to be successful. Ainsworth's Magazine marked the height of his career.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from his}} family and Gilder, likely {{the only person who}} knew that Hay was <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> was his friend Henry Adams. [...] In 1880, Adams had {{published}} , anonymously, and when Hay arrived in Britain in July 1882, he found speculation as to its authorship to be a popular pursuit. [...] Hay sent Adams a copy of a cheap British edition, telling him, [...] "I think of <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> in a hurry and printing it as by the author of Democracy." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarke first {{developed}} {{the idea for}} Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell while she was teaching in Bilbao: [...] "I {{had a kind of}} waking dream...about a man in 18th-century clothes in a place rather like Venice, talking to some English tourists. And I felt strongly that he had some sort of magical background– he'd been dabbling in magic, and something had gone badly wrong." [...] She had also recently reread J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and afterward was inspired to [...] " [...] <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> of magic and fantasy".|$|E

500|$|Ebner first {{considered}} <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> {{in which}} prehistoric characters have present-day knowledge and a modern language in 2006. [...] Believing that this topic would not suffice {{for a long}} novel, he initially did not pursue the idea. In February 2008 Ebner won the Wiener Werkstattpreis in the categories of short story and essayin addition to the prize money the organizer of the award, the Viennese publishing house FZA, offers to the winner to publish a 100-page book. Hence Ebner wrote and finalized his narrative within four months. The book {{was published in the}} October of the same year with the German title Hominide. The publisher introduced the work to the public with a public reading [...] in Vienna.|$|E
500|$|Anand then {{approached}} novelist Advaita Kala {{to develop}} the story into a feature-length script. Although a bit hesitant, she accepted the offer. Intrigued by {{the premise of the}} story, Kala started sketching the characters over the next few days, and began writing the script, which she found very different from writing novels. Anand helped her understand the process of writing screenplays and co-wrote with her. Kala wrote the first draft, approaching it like [...] writing a book, and sent it as chapters to Anand, saying: [...] "Writing a screenplay can also be a lonely process like <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel,</b> but along the way when others get involved, it becomes a fun collaborative effort." ...|$|E
500|$|Arne Glimcher, an {{art dealer}} based in New York City and {{a fan of}} mambo music, learned that Oscar Hijuelos was <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> {{relating}} to the subject. In 1988, Hijuelos sent Glimcher a manuscript of his novel The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love. Glimcher purchased the film rights before the novel was published one year later. He hired Cuban-born screenwriter Cynthia Cidre to write the script. Cidre spent {{a year and a}} half working on the screenplay, and after 24 drafts, she had stripped the story down to cover only half of Hijuelos's 407-page book. When asked about the modification of his novel in the film adaptation, Hijuelos said, [...] "My only concern was that the Cuban culture be treated with respect and the music be authentic and accurate to the period." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} 1925, Nella Larsen {{had decided that}} she wanted to be among the [...] "New Negro" [...] writers {{receiving}} considerable attention at the time. Initially writing short stories that were sold early in 1926 to a ladies magazine, she was rumored that year to be <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel.</b> In a letter to her friend, Carl Van Vechten, she acknowledges, [...] "it is the awful Truth. But, who knows if I'll get through with the damned thing. Certainly not I." [...] In April 1927, Larsen and her husband, Elmer Imes, moved from Jersey City, New Jersey to Harlem to be closer to the cultural phenomenon. The following year, Larsen published her first novel Quicksand with New York-based publisher Knopf, and its favorable critical reception encouraged her ambitions to become known as a novelist.|$|E
500|$|In 1926, Radclyffe Hall was at {{the height}} of her career. Her novel Adam's Breed, about the spiritual {{awakening}} of an Italian headwaiter, had become a bestseller; it would soon win the Prix Femina and the James Tait Black Prize. She had long thought of <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> about sexual inversion; now, she believed, her literary reputation would allow such a work to be given a hearing. Since she knew she was risking scandal and [...] "the shipwreck of her whole career", she sought and received the blessing of her partner, Una Troubridge, before she began work. Her goals were social and political; she wanted to end public silence about homosexuality and bring about [...] "a more tolerant understanding"– as well as to [...] "spur all classes of inverts to make good through hard work...and sober and useful living".|$|E
500|$|Gibson's early {{involvement}} with the film industry extended far {{beyond the confines of}} the Hollywood blockbuster system. At one point, he collaborated on a script with Kazakh director Rashid Nugmanov after an American producer had expressed an interest in a Soviet-American collaboration to star Soviet rock musician Viktor Tsoi. Despite being occupied with <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel,</b> Gibson was reluctant to abandon the [...] "wonderfully odd project" [...] which involved [...] "ritualistic gang-warfare in some sort of sideways-future Leningrad" [...] and sent Jack Womack to Russia in his stead. Rather than producing a motion picture, a prospect that ended with Tsoi's death in a car crash, Womack's experiences in Russia ultimately culminated in his novel Let's Put the Future Behind Us and informed much of the Russian content of Gibson's Pattern Recognition. A similar fate befell Gibson's collaboration with Japanese filmmaker Sogo Ishii in 1991, a film they planned on shooting in the Walled City of Kowloon until the city was demolished in 1993.|$|E
