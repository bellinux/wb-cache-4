5|$|Manchester has {{a notable}} {{place in the}} history of Marxism and left-wing politics; being the subject of Friedrich Engels' work The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester, and when Karl Marx visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library. The {{economics}} books Marx was reading at the time {{can be seen in the}} library, as can the <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{concluded}} that the severity of Frank's injuries and the numerous particulates found embedded in his body could only be attributed to his proximity to an explosion. Furthermore, the chemical compounds detected {{in the area around}} the explosion's point of origin were consistent with those generated by a dynamite explosion. The manganese dioxide samples collected from the seats near the focal point and from Frank's body indicated that a dry cell battery was located very near to the explosive. The CAB determined that, based on the blast pattern, a dynamite charge had been placed underneath the <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> of row 7.|$|E
5|$|The {{first was}} floor was {{accessed}} via the main staircase, {{situated in the}} east tower. The first room encountered was the great hall, which rose three floors. To the viewer's immediate left was a kitchen (with clerestory lighting), and further on to the left was a butlery and pantry with a garderobe. To the viewer's back right was a small passage containing a private staircase and {{the entrance to the}} oratory (its roof vaulted with an east window) in the east tower. The oratory was entered via a five-and-a-half high pointed-arch doorway and contained an altar and piscina, of which only an ornamental niche remains. There was a fireplace on the north wall of the great hall and behind the north wall was the great chamber containing a fireplace, garderobe and a <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> on the east wall. To the west of the hall {{was the head of the}} west window. The portcullis is believed to have been raised into the hall in front of this window.|$|E

25|$|Service-specific {{functional}} parameters – parameters {{that are}} essential to the respective service and that describe the important dimension(s) of the servicescape, the service output or the service outcome, e.g. whether the passenger sits in an aisle or <b>window</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two {{passengers}} in particular had fortunate escapes from certain death. George Collins, {{one of the}} five National Life employees who had boarded Flight 946, was assigned a <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> but instead switched seats with another passenger. That passenger died in the crash and Collins survived with severe injuries. Anne Foti was supposed to be on flight946, but instead made a last-minute flight cancellation at 12:00noon on Friday (several hours before the plane took off from Boston).|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim rings, rear seat armrests, and hydraulic <b>window,</b> <b>seat</b> and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the Futuramic 98. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for {{the first time}}.|$|E

50|$|<b>Window</b> <b>seats</b> {{are located}} {{at the sides of}} the aircraft, and usually next to a window, {{although}} some aircraft have seat rows where there is a <b>window</b> missing. <b>Window</b> <b>seats</b> are preferred by passengers who want to have a view, or a wall which they can lean against. Passengers in seats adjacent to the aisle have the advantage of being able to leave the seat without having to clamber over the other passengers, and having an aisle they can stretch their legs into. If a seat block has three or more seats, there will also be middle seats which are unpopular because the passenger is sandwiched between two other passengers without advantages of either <b>window</b> or aisle <b>seats.</b> Middle seats are typically booked last.|$|R
500|$|In the 13th-century Great Hall, {{the hall}} itself was also {{positioned}} {{on the first}} floor, originally fitted with a wooden floor supported by stone pillars in the basement, and a massive wooden roof. It was [...] across: this 2:1 ratio between length and width was typical for castle halls of this period. The hall was reached by a flight of stone steps at the west end, and lit by three tall, trefoiled windows, each originally with its own <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> and south-facing to receive the sunlight. Originally the hall had an open fire in the centre, which was normal for the 13th century, but the middle window {{was turned into a}} more modern fireplace around 1580.|$|E
500|$|As {{a further}} means of misdirection, the Turk {{came with a}} small wooden coffin-like box that the {{presenter}} would place {{on the top of}} the cabinet. While Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a later owner of the machine, did not use the box, Kempelen often peered into the box during play, suggesting that the box controlled some aspect of the machine. The box was believed by some to have supernatural power; Karl Gottlieb von Windisch wrote in his 1784 book Inanimate Reason that [...] "ne old lady, in particular, who had not forgotten the tales she had been told in her youth… went and hid herself in a <b>window</b> <b>seat,</b> as distant as she could from the evil spirit, which she firmly believed possessed the machine".|$|E
500|$|Her nanny, {{who called}} Elisabeth [...] "my baby," [...] woke Elisabeth {{in the middle}} of the night and settled her in a <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> of the nursery so that she might look out on the game spread out upon the grounds below. One morning, the eight-year-old awoke with a sore throat and pains in her chest, which the Russian Court doctor put down to too much {{excitement}} with her cousins the previous day. Her fever rose to 104 degrees. The imperial party didn't believe her illness was a serious one and went ahead with their plans for the day and attended the theater as planned. By the evening Elisabeth was in even more severe pain and had started gasping for breath. A specialist was summoned from Warsaw. The specialist gave her injections of caffeine and camphor to stimulate her slowing heart, but without success.|$|E
50|$|The Functionalist {{building}} was first completed in 1929, drawn by architect Lars Backer. The restaurant is built with flat roofs, large windows, a terrace and an arched entrance {{in a corner}} tower. The architect emphasized {{the maximum number of}} <b>window</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... {{reduction}} to {{the seat}} pitch in second class to 920mm. This allows the installation of 60 additional seats per trainset. Because the window arrangement was not changed, this resulted in some [...] "wall <b>window</b> seats": <b>Window</b> <b>seats</b> without <b>windows</b> next to them.|$|R

2500|$|Air {{sickness}} is {{a sensation}} which is induced by air travel. It {{is a specific}} form of motion sickness and is considered a normal response in healthy individuals. It {{is essentially the same}} as car sickness but occurs in an aeroplane. [...] However, some significant differences are that an aeroplane may bank and tilt sharply and due to the small window sizes, and unless the passenger is at a <b>window</b> <b>seat,</b> is likely to see only the stationary interior of the plane. Another factor is that while in flight, the view out of windows may be blocked by clouds, preventing a passenger at the window from seeing the moving ground or moving lower clouds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of fatalities aboard USAir 1493 occurred to those {{seated in the}} front of the plane, where the post-crash fire originated in the forward cargo hold, fed by a combination of fuel from the wreckage of SkyWest 5569 and gaseous oxygen from the 737's damaged crew oxygen system. Everyone seated in row 6 or forward was either killed or sustained major injuries, while everyone aft of row 17 escaped, some with minor injuries. [...] Only two passengers and one crew member managed to escape from the forward service (R1) door, while the main cabin (L1) door was inoperable due to damage. Only two passengers used the left over-wing exit before the fire became too intense outside the aircraft. The {{majority of}} the survivors exited via the right over-wing exit, with the rest of the surviving cabin occupants escaping through the rear service (R2) door. [...] The rear passenger (L2) door was briefly opened during the course of the accident, but was quickly closed due to the spreading fire on that side of the aircraft. [...] Multiple issues slowed the evacuation from the right over-wing door, including a passenger seated in the exit row who could not open the door, a brief scuffle between two men at the exit, and the seat back of the exit <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> being folded forward, partially obstructing the exit.|$|E

50|$|Ordinary-class cars (cars 1 to 8) have a {{seat pitch}} of 1040 mm, which is 60 mm larger than on the E2 series trains. Seating is {{arranged}} in 3+2 abreast configuration. AC power outlets are provided for <b>window</b> <b>seats</b> and rows of seats at car ends.|$|R
60|$|The rangers, with Yaqui and Thorne, {{stationed}} {{themselves at}} the several windows of the sitting-room. Rifles and smaller arms and boxes of shells littered the tables and <b>window</b> <b>seats.</b> No small force of besiegers could overcome a resistance such as Belding and his men were capable of making.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} four storeys high, with vaulted {{ceilings}} {{over the first}} and third storeys. The second floor was the living area, with fireplace, <b>window</b> <b>seats</b> and a slop stone (a channel through the thickness of a wall for the disposal of waste water). Above this was a bedroom and garderobe.|$|R

50|$|The castle was {{originally}} a four-storey rectangular tower, {{and parts of}} the original corbelling remain. There is a vaulted basement room, approached from the main entrance. The first-floor hall, which is also vaulted, is approached by a straight mural stair; it has stone <b>window</b> <b>seats</b> and once had a minstrels’ gallery. The original arched entrance is now walled up.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} chamber has a semicircular barrel vault, {{designed}} as a defence against the spread of fire. A number of beam sockets and projecting stone corbels in the walls show how the vault was erected. The presence of <b>window</b> <b>seats,</b> a fireplace, two cupboards and a latrine (in the east turret) suggest that the first floor chamber was the main living room in the castle. The second floor chamber lacks a fireplace, but does have <b>window</b> <b>seats</b> and a latrine in the east turret and {{could have been a}} sleeping area. Above this floor is the roof level with a wall-walk behind a parapet and higher corner turrets, now largely demolished. The castle had a pitched roof as a drawing from 1840 shows a gable wall in place which later collapsed. the timber roof of the castle would have been covered with slates, wooden shingles, stone slabs or thatch.|$|R
60|$|Down the {{corridor}} behind them a tall figure approached on silent, noiseless feet. At {{sight of the}} two at the <b>window</b> <b>seat</b> it halted. It was the king.|$|E

5000|$|Jude McCaffrey, Tony Furnell and bassist Ryan Lilley formed <b>Window</b> <b>Seats</b> in 2007. Writing and {{performing}} together, the band also recorded their music themselves.

The title track received support from UK radio stations during 2008 and 2009, including BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio Ulster.|$|R
50|$|The castle was {{a simple}} keep, about 50 ft high and roughly 40 ft long by 25 ft wide. The {{entrance}} {{was on the ground}} floor, giving access to the wheel-stair to the first floor hall in the north-west angle and to two cellars or stores on the ground floor. The hall on the first floor had a large fireplace and two <b>window</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ikarus {{provided}} body shells (without doors, <b>windows,</b> <b>seats,</b> engine) for Orion Bus Industries {{contracts to}} supply two of Canada's transit systems, the Toronto and Ottawa with articulated buses in late 1986-87. The Orion Ikarus buses {{were put on}} the fast track for retirement by the TTC due to structural corrosion problems. These problems were blamed on poor spot welds made during the manufacture of the bus.|$|R
