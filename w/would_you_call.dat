25|$|May 2002 {{also saw}} the revelation that the new public works minister, Don Boudria, had spent the weekend of March 16–17, 2002 at an estate owned by Claude Boulay, the {{president}} of Groupe Everest advertising firm that head received $55million in contracts from the public works ministry, apparently for free. Only after the story of Boudria's stay at the Boulay estate broke in May did Boulay cash an $800 cheque from Boudria that was dated March 16, 2002; many found this to be too convenient, and opposition critics suggested that the cheque had been post-dated to explain away what {{would otherwise have been}} a major ethical violation on the part of Boudria. Boudria was forced to resign on 26 May, to be replaced with Ralph Goodale. An additional scandal broke later in May 2002 when it was revealed that the Defence Minister Art Eggleton had rewarded a contract worth $36, 500 to research mental illness amongst former soldiers to his former lover Maggie Maier without tender {{while at the same time}} the Defence Ministry had already hired a team of experts to research the same subject. As Eggleton was a Paul Martin supporter, Chrétien promptly fired him on May 27, 2002, following a ruling from Howard Wilson that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules. Some such as the columnist Don Martin believed that Wilson's swift running against the Martinista Eggleton was suspicious with Martin writing Wilson had within a day ruled that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules while Martin wrote: “But what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> the prime minister’s chat with a Crown corporation banker to bail out a hotel linked to a golf course he may still have an interest in? Funny, ethics counsellor Howard Wilson was in a “see no evil” monkey mode on that score”.|$|E
2500|$|Even though Basayev had a $10 million bounty on his head, he gave an {{interview}} to Russian journalist Andrei Babitsky in which he described himself as [...] "a bad guy, a bandit, a terrorist ... but what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> them?", referring to his enemies. Basayev stated each Russian had to feel war's impact before the Chechen war would stop. Basayev asked [...] "Officially, over 40,000 of our children {{have been killed and}} tens of thousands mutilated. Is anyone saying anything about that? ... responsibility is with the whole Russian nation, which through its silent approval gives a 'yes'." [...] This interview was broadcast on U.S. television network ABC's Nightline program, to the protest of the Russian government; on 2 August 2005, Moscow banned journalists of the ABC network from working in Russia.|$|E
2500|$|O'Donnell {{condemned}} {{many of the}} Bush administration's policies, {{especially the}} war in Iraq and the resulting occupation. She also questioned the official explanation {{for the destruction of}} the World Trade Center, and stating in one episode, [...] "I do believe that it's {{the first time in history}} that fire has ever melted steel". She consistently mentioned recent military deaths and news about the war, and criticized the U.S. media for its lack of attention to these issues compared to media coverage throughout the world. This led to a series of heated exchanges with co-host Hasselbeck, as well as [...] "the most-discussed moment of her professional life." [...] On May 17, 2007, O'Donnell rhetorically asked, [...] "655,000 Iraqi civilians dead. Who are the terrorists? ... if you were in Iraq and another country, the United States, the richest in the world, invaded your country and killed 655,000 of your citizens, what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> us?" [...] Conservative commentators criticized O'Donnell's statements, saying that she was comparing American soldiers to terrorists. On May 23, 2007, a heated discussion ensued, in part, because of what O'Donnell perceived as Elisabeth Hasselbeck's unwillingness to defend O'Donnell from the criticisms; O'Donnell asked Hasselbeck, [...] "Do you believe I think our troops are terrorists?" [...] Hasselbeck answered in the negative but also stated [...] "Defend your own insinuations." [...] O'Donnell was hurt and felt Hasselbeck had betrayed her friendship: [...] "there's something about somebody being different on TV toward you than they are in the dressing room. It didn't really ring true for me." [...] O'Donnell stated that Republican pundits were mischaracterising her statements and the right-wing media would portray her as a bully, attacking [...] "innocent pure Christian Elisabeth" [...] whenever they disagreed. O'Donnell decided to leave the show that day, but afterwards stated that the reason was not the argument itself, but rather the fact that she saw on the studio monitor that the camera had shown a split screen, with her and Hasselbeck on either side. O'Donnell felt that the show's director and producer [...] "had to prepare that in advance [...] I felt there was setup egging me into that position. The executive producer and I did not gel." [...] O'Donnell and ABC agreed to cut short her contract agreement on May 25, 2007. ABC News reported that her arguments with Hasselbeck brought the show its best ratings ever.|$|E
