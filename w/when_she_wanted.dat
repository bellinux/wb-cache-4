500|$|Although Monroe's typecast screen persona as a dim-witted but sexually {{attractive}} blonde was {{a carefully}} crafted act, audiences and film critics believed {{it to be}} her real personality {{and that she was}} not acting in her comedies.

Critics found that the webs that they shot did not go where they wanted them to go, and {{multiple}} reviewers described navigation as [...] "trial and error". Reviewers also found {{that they could not}} always jump when they wanted to, and one reviewer found that power-ups failed to activate <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> them to. Reviewers also complained that it was extremely difficult to get enough stars to progress from one stage to the next, forcing players to replay the same levels over and over again.

Woodburne has revealed {{that there is no}} chance of Susan growing her long hair back. She said [...] "I could never grow it long again. I love the ease of having short hair. Back when it was long, I used to wash and dry my hair every morning at home before going into work. That added an extra half-hour to my day".

500|$|Victoria {{had long}} wished {{to have an}} {{imperial}} title, reflecting Britain's expanding domain. [...] She was irked when Czar Alexander II held a higher rank than her as an emperor, and was appalled that her daughter, the Prussian Crown Princess, would outrank her when her husband came to the throne. She also saw an imperial title as proclaiming Britain's increased stature in the world. The title [...] "Empress of India" [...] had been used informally with respect to Victoria {{for some time and}} she wished to have that title formally bestowed on her. The Queen prevailed upon Disraeli to introduce a Royal Titles Bill, and also told of her intent to open Parliament in person, which during this time she did only <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> something from legislators. Disraeli was cautious in response, as careful soundings of MPs brought a negative reaction, and declined to place such a proposal in the Queen's Speech.|$|E
500|$|Although the British Regency {{lasted only}} from 1811 to 1820, Heyer's romances were set between 1752 and 1825. As noted by {{literary}} critic Kay Mussell, the books revolved around a [...] "structured social ritual — the marriage market {{represented by the}} London season" [...] where [...] "all {{are in danger of}} ostracism for inappropriate behavior". Her Regency romances were inspired by the writings of Jane Austen, whose novels were set in the same era. Austen's works, however, were contemporary novels, describing the times in which she lived. According to Pamela Regis in her work A Natural History of the Romance Novel, because Heyer's stories took place amidst events that had occurred over 100years earlier, she had to include more detail on the period in order for her readers to understand it. While Austen could ignore the [...] "minutiae of dress and decor", Heyer included those details [...] "to invest the novels... with 'the tone of the time'". Later reviewers, such as Lillian Robinson, criticized Heyer's [...] "passion for the specific fact without concern for its significance", and Marghanita Laski pointed out that [...] "these aspects on which Heyer is so dependent for her creation of atmosphere are just those which Jane Austen... referred to only <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to show that a character was vulgar or ridiculous". Others, including A. S. Byatt, believe that Heyer's [...] "awareness of this atmosphere — both of the minute details of the social pursuits of her leisured classes and of the emotional structure behind the fiction it produced — is her greatest asset".|$|E

500|$|The {{video screens}} showed both live shoots and special footage {{directed}} by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video LED cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area. The gyrating wheel in which Spears opened {{the show was}} made by Branam Enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by Tait Towers. 171 white light [...] were provided by Spectra. The giant music box from which Spears emerged in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton. Confetti was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek. Pyrotechnics were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), there was a water screen {{in which it was}} poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. Cohen said, [...] "The water screen is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every system—electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, and I immediately looked at what they had in stock, which was a straight line. And I knew we didn't want a straight line. We wanted a circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not get wet and then walk through <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to. Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. But I kept saying that if you put them 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet." ...|$|E

Her estranged aunt and uncle, who at first were hoping she was still alive, eventually turned to online databases, to search through unidentified persons cases after their hope dwindled.

Because of her history of running away from home, her family made the assumption that she would [...] "contact them <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to," [...] as she had called her sister once after departing.

2500|$|In {{everyday}} interactions Genie became steadily {{more willing}} and able to speak during her stay with the Riglers, often spontaneously contributing to an ongoing discussion and sometimes doing so even if the conversation did not initially involve her and was not specifically about her.

Otherwise she normally went along with a topic somebody else raised, and when attempting to enter an ongoing conversation she would try to say something relevant. If she could not say something semantically related to a topic, she sometimes tried to join in using other means; Curtiss recalled one dinner conversation at the Riglers' home in 1972 in which several people used the word [...] "tenant", and in an effort to contribute Genie said the word [...] "ten" [...] and held up ten fingers.|$|E
