5|$|<b>Write</b> <b>Me</b> Back is the {{eleventh}} studio album by American R recording artist R. Kelly, released on June 25, 2012, by RCA Records. It was written and produced primarily by Kelly as the follow-up to his 2010 album Love Letter. He recorded <b>Write</b> <b>Me</b> Back at Sylvester Stone Studios and The Chocolate Factory in Chicago, and at MilkBoy The Studio in Philadelphia. It expands on its predecessor's traditional R aesthetic and incorporates musical influences such as Philadelphia soul and elements of Chicago stepping. Thematically, the album generally deals with love, its redemptive power, and its complications.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{supporting}} {{tour for}} Love Letter, Kelly underwent emergency throat surgery in July 2011 to drain an abscess on one of his tonsils. He recovered, and in August, announced that his next album will be called Black Panties, a sexually charged album in the same vein of his 1993 debut album, 12 Play. However, he deviated from that plan in January 2012 by announcing <b>Write</b> <b>Me</b> Back as his next album. He recorded the album at Sylvester Stone Studios and The Chocolate Factory in Chicago, and at MilkBoy The Studio in Philadelphia.|$|E
60|$|My friend Joe Bray, who publishes {{books in}} Chicago, also reacts peculiarly to my fish stories. He <b>writes</b> <b>me</b> a satiric, doubting letter--then shuts up {{his office and}} rushes for some river or lake. Will Dilg, the famous fly-caster, upon receipt of my communication, <b>wrote</b> <b>me</b> a nine-page prose-poem epic about the only fish in the world--black-bass. Professor Kellogg always falls ill and takes a vacation, during which he <b>writes</b> <b>me</b> that I have not mental {{capacity}} to appreciate my luck.|$|R

All right--but think of his innocent and pathetic candor in <b>writing</b> <b>me</b> something like this, a week later: ...|$|R

The album sold 24,600 copies in its second week on the chart, falling 14 spots to number 19. It {{ultimately}} charted for 17 weeks on the US Billboard 200. As of August 15, 2012, the album has sold 253,000 copies in the United States.|$|E

Signed to Curb Records in 1996, he charted his first single on the Billboard country chart in 1997, {{but did not}} release an album until 2003's Honesty, which {{included}} the number 4 hit [...] "Honesty (<b>Write</b> <b>Me</b> a List)".|$|E

500|$|The album debuted {{at number}} five on the US Billboard 200, selling 68,000 copies {{in its first}} week, and {{ultimately}} spent 17 weeks on the chart. It was promoted with three singles—"Share My Love", [...] "Feelin' Single" [...] and [...] "When a Man Lies". Upon its release, <b>Write</b> <b>Me</b> Back received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its music and Kelly's singing. As of August 15, 2012, it has sold 141,300 copies in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Jones had {{previously}} worked with Glee co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk on Nip/Tuck, {{and when she}} encountered Falchuk at a local supermarket she says she told him, <b>Write</b> <b>me</b> something', just joking, you know, but not really." [...] Still, she was shocked to hear from her agent two months later that Murphy had done so. She {{knew very little about}} the role initially: [...] "When I signed my contract, it didn't even have a character name—just two quotation marks." ...|$|E
500|$|Helped by the {{speculation}} surrounding Starr's collaborations {{with his former}} bandmates, and by the interest generated by the two Beatles compilations, Ringo was a commercial success, overshadowing Lennon's concurrently released Mind Games. Acknowledging Starr's achievement, Lennon sent him a telegram that read: [...] "Congratulations. How dare you? And please <b>write</b> <b>me</b> a hit song." [...] Lennon pushed for [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] to be issued as the third single off the album in the United States, but [...] "Oh My My", written by Starr and Vini Poncia, was chosen instead.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing Beresford's after action report, Wellington {{was unhappy}} with its despondent tone and commented to a staff officer [...] "This won't do. It will drive the people in England mad. <b>Write</b> <b>me</b> down a victory." [...] The report was duly rewritten, {{although}} Wellington privately acknowledged that another such battle would ruin his army. Soult, {{on the basis of}} higher allied casualties, also claimed [...] "a signal victory". He generously paid tribute to the steadfastness of the allied troops, writing [...] "There is no beating these troops, in spite of their generals. I always thought they were bad soldiers, now I am sure of it. I had turned their right, pierced their centre and everywhere victory was mine– but they {{did not know how to}} run!" ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Write</b> <b>Me</b> Back expands on its predecessor's {{traditional}} R aesthetic with 1970s influences, particularly Philadelphia {{soul and}} elements of Chicago stepping. Its title is {{a reference to}} that album's title. The music is also characterized by uptempo drum programming and smooth keyboard lines. Nitush Abebe of New York observes [...] "frictionless glide and delicacy, all the strings and horns caressing around the margins, of late-seventies Philly soul greats and Quincy Jones productions." [...] The album's primary subject matter is love, with exhortations about its redemptive power and its complications. Abebe writes of this theme, [...] "There's love as inspiration and redemption, love as strangled by manipulative men or undercommitted women, love as universal party, love as rotted from the inside by apathy or envy." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-2002, Rodney Atkins {{released}} his third single, [...] "Sing Along". Both {{it and its}} followup, [...] "My Old Man", peaked in the lower regions of the Top 40 on the country chart. He entered the Top 10 {{for the first time}} in late 2003-early 2004 with [...] "Honesty (<b>Write</b> <b>Me</b> a List)", which went on to peak at number 4 on the country charts and 57 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was the title track to his album Honesty, which was released by the end of 2003. [...] "Someone to Share It With" [...] and [...] "Monkey in the Middle" [...] (both also co-written by Gowan) were also issued as singles, with the former peaking at number 41 on the country charts. Atkins told the Associated Press that he chose to record [...] "Honesty" [...] because he and producer Ted Hewitt wanted a twelfth song for the album, and co-writer David Kent had recommended it to Hewitt.|$|E

500|$|In a mixed review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times {{dubbed the}} album Kelly's [...] "least ambitious" [...] {{and found it}} [...] "tepid" [...] by his standards, [...] "which is to say, {{completely}} technically accomplished, but lacking the snakelike vocal slither and moist subject matter that mark him at his most virtuosic." [...] Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson panned its music as [...] "this-porridge-is-just-right uptempo mush" [...] and questioned its genuineness, writing that [...] "even if the songs sound like the height of artifice ... there's little doubt [...] believes in his own hollow offerings." [...] Pitchfork Media's Jess Harvell observed [...] "a fine line between breezy and half-assed" [...] in the songwriting and criticized its [...] "cut-rate production choices" [...] behind [...] "Kelly's engaged vocal performances." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune called it [...] "a less-consistently strong sequel" [...] and stated, [...] "Listeners may find themselves toggling between questioning Kelly’s sincerity and admiring his facility as a producer and singer." [...] Spin ranked <b>Write</b> <b>Me</b> Back number 37 on their list of 2012's best albums.|$|E
500|$|<b>Write</b> <b>Me</b> Back {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 18 reviews. August Brown of the Los Angeles Times dubbed it [...] "the best grown-man dance {{record of the}} year" [...] and stated, [...] "the songwriting is, per usual {{at this point in}} his career, nimble and nicely matured. But the arrangements are the centerpiece here." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called its music [...] "virtuoso pastiche – but Kelly's Seventies are freakier than your dad's." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice viewed [...] "Clipped Wings" [...] as its strongest track and compared the album to Love Letter, stating [...] "it's slightly less drenched in retro tropes, but it's no less of an enjoyable listen." [...] Miles Marshall Lewis of Spin felt that [...] "the result distills the melodies and lyrical flair fans love without the NC-17 lines that often make Kelly NSFW." ...|$|E
500|$|David Giler {{performed}} a rewrite; Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins, friends of Spielberg, suggested the plot device of a kidnapped child. Spielberg {{then began to}} write the script. The song [...] "When You Wish upon a Star" [...] from Pinocchio influenced Spielberg's writing style. [...] "I hung my story on the mood the song created, the way it affected me personally." [...] Jerry Belson and Spielberg wrote the shooting script together. In the end, Spielberg was given solo writing credit. During pre-production, the title was changed from Kingdom Come to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. J. Allen Hynek, who worked with the United States Air Force on Project Blue Book, {{was hired as a}} scientific consultant. Hynek felt [...] "even though the film is fiction, it's based for the most part on the known facts of the UFO mystery, and it certainly catches the flavor of the phenomenon. Spielberg was under enormous pressure to make another blockbuster after Jaws, but he decided to make a UFO movie. He put his career on the line." [...] USAF and NASA declined to cooperate on the film. In fact, NASA reportedly sent a 20-page letter to Spielberg, telling him that releasing the film was dangerous. In an interview, he said: [...] "I really found my faith when I heard that the Government was opposed to the film. If NASA took the time to <b>write</b> <b>me</b> a 20-page letter, then I knew there must be something happening." ...|$|E

500|$|However, Mercury and {{his inner}} circle of colleagues and friends, whom he felt he could trust, {{continually}} denied the stories, even after one front-page article published on 29 April 1991, showed Mercury appearing very haggard in what was by then a rare public appearance. It {{has been suggested that}} he could have made a contribution to AIDS awareness by speaking earlier about his situation and his fight against the disease. Mercury kept his condition private to protect those closest to him, with Brian May confirming in a 1993 interview he had informed the band of his illness much earlier. Filmed in May 1991, the music video for [...] "These Are the Days of Our Lives" [...] features a very thin Mercury, in what are his final scenes in front of the camera. The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, {{for an hour or two}} at a time. May says of Mercury: [...] "He just kept saying. 'Write me more. <b>Write</b> <b>me</b> stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.' He had no fear, really." [...] Justin Shirley-Smith, the assistant engineer for those last sessions, states: [...] "This is hard to explain to people, but it wasn't sad, it was very happy. He [...] was one of the funniest people I ever encountered. I was laughing most of the time, with him. Freddie was saying [...] 'I'm not going to think about it, I'm going to do this.' ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 31, 2012, Kelly {{revealed}} {{in a radio}} interview that he's releasing a follow-up to the Love Letter album titled <b>Write</b> <b>Me</b> Back. The album {{is a mix of}} Kelly's previous albums; Love Letter, Happy People {{and a little bit of}} TP-2.Com. On February 1, 2012, Kelly released the first single, [...] "Share My Love", off <b>Write</b> <b>Me</b> Back, followed by [...] "Feelin' Single". The album will be released on June 26.|$|E
