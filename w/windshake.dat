40|$|We {{present in}} this paper an {{analysis}} of several tip-tilt on-sky data registered on adaptive optics systems installed on different telescopes (Gemini South, William Herschel Telescope, Large Binocular Telescope, Very Large Telescope, Subaru). Vibration peaks can be detected, and it is shown that their presence and location may vary, and that their origin {{is not always easy}} to determine. Mechanical solution that have been realized to mitigate vibrations are presented. Nevertheless, residual vibrations may still affect the instruments' performance, ranging from narrow high frequency vibration peaks to wide low frequency windshake-type perturbations. Power Spectral Densities (PSDs) of on-sky data are presented to evidence these features. When possible, indications are given regarding the gain in performance that could be achieved with adequate controllers accounting for vibration mitigation. Two examples of controller identification and design illustrate their ability to compensate for various types of disturbances (turbulence, <b>windshake,</b> vibration peaks, [...] .), showing a significant gain in performance. 9 2012 SPIE.

40|$|A {{study is}} made of a non [...] smooth matrix {{optimization}} problem arising in adaptive [...] optics, which involves the optimal real [...] time control of a very fast [...] acting deformable mirror designed to compensate for atmospheric turbulence and other image degradation factors, such as wind [...] induced telescope vibration (<b>windshake).</b> The surface shape of this mirror must change rapidly to correct for time [...] varying optical distortions caused by these sources of image degradation. One formulation of this problem yields a functional f(U) = P n i= 1 max j f(U T M j U) ii g over orthogonal matrices U, where U defines the basis of deformable mirror control modes to be used, and the collection of n Θ n symmetric matrices M j characterize adaptive [...] optics performance over multiple control bandwidths. Selecting the orthogonal matrix U which maximizes f(U) corresponds to defining a basis of deformable mirror control modes and their associated control bandwidths. We consider first the situation which ca [...] ...|$|E
