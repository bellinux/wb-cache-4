In Toy Story, for instance, when the toys were alone in their world, I wanted it to feel consistent to a safer world.

25|$|I've always {{believed}} that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E

Years later he recalled, [...] "That winter was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> started working out. I started running more. I decided I was really {{going to find out}} how good I can be." [...] During spring training, Dodger scout Kenny Myers discovered a hitch in Koufax's windup: he'd rear back so far that his vision was obstructed and he couldn't see the target.|$|E

I felt uncomfortable about having to smile in someone's face <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> didn't like them or even know them well enough to like them." [...] She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, [...] "For two or three years I was away from all social interaction. It was a very introspective time because I had to confront my fears and master every demonic thought about inferiority, about insecurity or the fear of being black, young and gifted in this western culture." [...] She went on to say that she had to fight to retain her identity, and was forced [...] "to deal with folks who weren't happy about that." ...|$|E

[...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's one of the reasons I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E

The first to respond to the demo tape was Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam Recordings. Rihanna auditioned for him and music mogul L.A. Reid in his office. Looking back on the audition and meeting Jay-Z, Rihanna explained in an interview how she felt before walking into the room, saying: [...] "That's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> got nervous..... I was like: 'Oh God, he's right there, I can't look, I can't look, I can't look!' I remember being extremely quiet. I was very shy. I was cold the entire time. I had butterflies. I'm sitting across from Jay-Z. Like, Jay-Zee. I was star-struck."

The critical consensus reads, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] is an enjoyable season finale that manages {{to deliver a}} few last minute scares as it ties up loose ends." [...] James Queally from The Star-Ledger commented about the season and its finale, [...] "After a wildly uneven first nine episodes... and two red-hot episodes {{leading up to the}} finale... "Afterbirth" [...] starts out flying high at the way too fast pace that has made American Horror Story an enjoyable ride these past two weeks. But somewhere in the final 30 minutes of this episode, [...] "Afterbirth" [...] turns into a wandering epilogue." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club stated, [...] "Part of the fun of those early episodes – even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> didn't like them – was that you never quite had a good sense of what the hell kind of show you were watching. The finale sticks us into {{what seems to be a}} pretty basic setup for season two." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Afterbirth" [...] "an exhilarating shocker." [...] Matt Fowler at IGN gave the episode a score eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He stated, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] was a very odd finale and I'm pretty sure that it was nothing like most of us thought it would be." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} quarterback Charlie Conerly emerged. Conerly was the team's {{starting}} quarterback from 1948 to 1960, {{and had a}} franchise-record string of 12 consecutive seasons in which he led the team in passing. A former US Marine, Conerly was renowned among his teammates for his toughness. [...] "There was a time my rookie year <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> saw it", recalled running back Frank Gifford. [...] "He broke his nose really badly, they literally called a timeout and then they called another one while they stopped the bleeding, they stuck stuff up there until it would stop bleeding. You {{try to get them}} to do that today. They'd be yelling, 'Get my agent!'". In 1951, the Giants finished 9–2–1, but their inability to beat division rival Cleveland cost them an opportunity to play in the Championship Game. Fullback Eddie Price led the league in rushing and set a league record for rushing attempts in a season, and defensive linemen Arnie Weinmeister and Al Derogatis, linebacker Jon Baker, and offensive tackle Tex Coulter all made the All-Pro team. The following year New York fell to 7–5, but Tunnell continued to impress. [...] "Tunnell returned interceptions, punts, and kickoffs with such electric flair that he actually outgained the league rushing leader in yards gained" [...] according to one publication. Tunnell amassed 924yards, while never lining up on offense, whereas the league rushing leader totalled 894. The Giants offense struggled in 1953, and they fell to a 3–9 record. Gifford was forced to play both ways due to a depleted roster, and in the second to last game of the season they lost 62–14 to division rival Cleveland.|$|E

2500|$|Through his teens, Hancock {{never had}} a jazz teacher, but {{developed}} his ear and sense of harmony. He was also influenced by records of the vocal group the Hi-Lo's.

It's not got any {{of the sort of}} creaky old rock'n'roll aspects to it and it still sounded like the Banshees, almost more so. That's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> began to become a fan of John McGeoch. It was an extra bonus for me that they'd got a great guitar player who had left another band and came in as a ringer and joined and not surprisingly, that to me was a very good scenario.

2500|$|John Williams {{composed}} {{and conducted}} the film's musical score, the second score composed {{the same year}} by Williams for Spielberg after The Adventures of Tintin. [...] Williams took inspiration by visiting a horse farm in California and observing horses and their behavior, elaborating that [...] "I got {{in the habit of}} watching the horses in the morning, and I began to see how they connect to each other and how they became curious about me. That's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> began to get the sense that horses are very special creatures. They have been magnificent and trusted friends {{for such a long time}} and have done so much for us with such grace." [...] Williams was also influenced by the geographic scope of the film's story. In regards to that approach, Williams stated; [...] "This was a very rich opportunity musically because it is both about humans and animals and it takes place in three different countries. It starts out in a more intimate way, on the farm with the bonding of Joey and Albert. Then, the eruption of war changes the scale, and the music does a 180-degree turn. From this bucolic, gentle, even sentimental music, you move into the music of battle surges and gripping struggles. It's a musical journey full of dimension and emotional content, and I tried also to create an atmosphere reflective of that period, which was lyrical, poetic and tragic." [...] The score was recorded by a 90-piece orchestra, with Williams comparing the recording sessions more to a concert piece rather than a traditional film score, as it relied more on the individual performance of the musicians.|$|E
