5|$|Prior to broadcast, series creator Shonda Rhimes did {{not release}} much {{information}} about the season premiere. However, it was revealed prior to broadcast {{that there would be}} a time jump in the episode. After it was announced that Dane would be departing shortly after the commencement of the ninth season, Dempsey uploaded a set picture on Twitter of Sloan in bad condition. Due to the unwanted release of spoilers, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) requested that he delete the photo, and it was subsequently removed. The cast and crew of Grey's Anatomy were being particularly quiet about the fate of Capshaw's character. This secrecy was compromised when McKidd posted a picture on his Twitter account of the editing room, in which there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Robbins alive on the screen.

25|$|Barr easily {{turned back}} token {{opposition}} in the Republican primary and again received financial support from the National Republican Campaign Committee in his general election campaign. When Chandler decided not to attend the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Barr charged {{that he was trying}} to avoid association with President Barack Obama, who was seeking a second term but who was unpopular with many voters in Kentucky. A spokesperson for Chandler maintained that Chandler had previous engagements in his home district that week, but that he supported Obama's reelection. Barr was chosen to give a brief address at the 2012 Republican National Convention, during which he decried Obama's perceived hostility toward the coal industry. Chandler campaign staffers criticized Barr's decision to attend the convention, stating that he should spend the time in his district, getting to know the people there better. They also mocked the fact that the backdrop for Barr's speech <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the city of Louisville, which is not in the 6th district; Barr's campaign countered that they had no part in choosing the backdrop.|$|E

25|$|Mrs Cecilia Dribelle (Carol MacReady) - The extravagantly dressed businesswoman {{from whom}} Bodger rents his flat in Series 6 and 7. She has a {{distinct}} dislike for animals (apart from cats) and forbids her tenants from keeping pets, resulting in Bodger having to constantly hide Badger whenever she visits. She dislikes Bodger intensely and tries everything she can think of to evict him, she also expressed a dislike for pop music in one episode. She is fond of cakes and biscuits, and likes to make lots of money from silly ideas. She is nicknamed 'Mrs Dribble' and 'Dribbly Bibbly' by Badger. She drives around {{in a car with}} the registration plate 'DRIB 1' and has a cat called Fluffykins. In her early episodes she is made aware of Badger's presence by her sidekick, Elton, but never actually sees him as Elton's plans to catch Badger always fail. She eventually decides that Elton is imagining Badger. However, she has spotted Badger herself on several occasions - in one episode she saw Badger when she got knocked out, mistakenly thinking that Badger was her pet cat Fluffykins. Another was when Fluffykins had disappeared and Badger was inside the cat box pretending to be Fluffykins. Another time was when Badger was hiding behind a picture frame which Mrs Dribelle thought <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a Badger. After spending the majority of Series 6 trying to find ways to evict Bodger, Mrs Dribelle later employs him as her handyman in Series 7. Later on she allowed her niece, Vicky, to stay in the first floor flat above Bodger's after she evicted Alec Smart. After Vicky left to go touring with a band, Mrs Dribelle temporarily moved into the vacant flat while her house was being decorated.|$|E

2500|$|Baker’s {{preliminary}} work for Minspeak included forty icons. The first <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> an ear, representing phatic exchanges (communication devoid of information exchange, i.e. “what’s up”). Other icons {{were selected to}} represent additional speech functions. [...] In 1981, Baker and one of this former students, Kenneth Smith, [...] implemented the first Minspeak program on an AIM 65 computer using a Votrax SC01 voice synthesizer. In December 1981, Baker teamed with Barry Romich and signed his first commercial agreement for Minspeak. This {{led to the development}} of the Minspeak program on Express III hardware in the summer of 1982. Minspeak was released to the public for commercial use at the American Speech-Language and Hearing Association (ASHA) Convention of 1983 in Cincinnati, Ohio. From that point forward, Minspeak evolved into a dynamic communication system, advancing its capabilities to serve a more diverse user population and to establish an efficient language approach to augmentative and alternative communication.|$|E
2500|$|During November 1994, after a {{long period}} of seclusion, Michael {{appeared}} at the first MTV Europe Music Awards show, where he gave a performance of a new song, [...] "Jesus to a Child". The song was a melancholy tribute to his lover, Anselmo Feleppa, who had died in March 1993. The song entered the UK singles chart at No. 1 and No. 7 on Billboard in the same month of release. It was Michael's longest UK Top 40 single, at almost seven minutes long. The exact identity of the song's subject — and the nature of Michael's relationship with Feleppa — was shrouded in innuendo and speculation, as Michael had not confirmed he was homosexual and did not do so until 1998. The video for [...] "Jesus to a Child" [...] <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> images recalling loss, pain and suffering. Michael consistently dedicated the song to Feleppa before performing it live.|$|E
2500|$|Reporters {{and journalists}} {{questioned}} {{the evidence and}} workings of the case. Even though the white prosecutor's office did follow all the laws and did not do anything illegal, [...] "the court empaneled a seriously prejudiced jury of white Southern Baptists". During the trial, the only real piece of evidence other than the falsified witness testimony by Hood and Washington <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a bottle that was presumed to be an unused firebomb. This bottle however was never actually placed into the evidence files of the case since it was mysteriously [...] "lost" [...] by the fire marshals, and that the [...] "original photograph was staged". Though {{there seemed to be}} very little evidence to support the prosecutor's claims, the jury returned a guilty verdict within one hour of the case's arguments ending. T.J. Reddy was sentenced to 20 years, James Grant got 25 years, and Charles Parker received 10 years (8).|$|E
