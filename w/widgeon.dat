5|$|In winter, the {{resident}} bird population is increased by visitors from north-east Europe, {{in particular the}} <b>widgeon</b> and Greenland white-fronted goose. Riverside mammals are seen frequently and otters, mink and fox are common. Trout and salmon are less common in the Shannon than they once were, however pike is still plentiful and attracts many anglers.|$|E
5|$|Lympne was {{the start}} and finish for several record attempts. Wing Commander E. R. Manning left for India in a Westland <b>Widgeon</b> in 1923, but only {{got as far as}} Baghdad. In 1930 the Fokker F VIIA (G-EBTS) The Spider flown by Charles Douglas Barnard and R F Little, with Mary Russell, Duchess of Bedford as passenger, left Lympne for Maitland Airport, Cape Town, which was reached in a record 100 hours. In 1931 C.W.A. Scott set a UK-Australia record in a DH.60 (G-ABHY). On the return he landed at Lympne in the {{aircraft}} which had been re-registered VH-UQA. Also in 1931 Glen Kitson and Owen Cathcart-Jones left Lympne bound for Cape Town in a Lockheed DL-1 Vega Special. Cape Town was reached in 6 days, 10 hours. On 31 October C. Arthur Butler flew from Lympne to Darwin in a Comper Swift (G-ABRE), beating C.W.A. Scott's record by 102 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Later that autumn, on 1 October 1969, <b>Widgeon</b> was {{decommissioned}} {{and placed}} in reserve; she got underway the next day for her new home port, San Diego. For the next three years, <b>Widgeon</b> operated as a Group II Naval Reserve training (NET) ship. She operated primarily in the San Diego area, but twice visited Ensenada, Mexico, once in 1972, and once in 1973. Struck from the Navy list on 2 July 1973, <b>Widgeon</b> was sold in January 1974.|$|E

5000|$|A company {{formed by}} Lt. Col. T.W. White {{expressed}} an interest in operating three <b>Widgeons</b> on routes from Townsville to Mackay; Adelaide to Port Lincoln; and Geelong to Launceston (all coastal towns); however this never eventuated.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>Widgeons</b> {{survive in}} private hands, {{in various states}} of {{restoration}} or storage. The aircraft continues to enjoy a considerable degree of popularity as a seaplane with many still being flown regularly, though rarely on the warbird circuit.|$|R
25|$|The airline Lufttransport {{was founded}} in 1946 with a base at Sørneset. It {{eventually}} operated a fleet of four aircraft, including a Grumman <b>Widgeon</b> and a Fairchild 24. The airline built a hangar at the airport. It started a scheduled service to Oslo Airport, Fornebu {{three times a week}} in 1948, with stopovers in Molde and Kristiansund using the <b>Widgeon.</b> It also made attempts to fly to Bergen and Trondheim. However, the company had difficulties making a profit and shut down in 1949. Ownership of the airport passed to Ålesund Bil og Flyservice.|$|E
25|$|Birdwatching author William J. Boyle {{reports that}} Swartswood {{is home to}} a {{surprising}} number of waterfowl species, including pied-billed grebe, wood duck, ring-necked duck, ruddy duck, American <b>widgeon,</b> gadwall, American coot and occasionally bald eagle.|$|E

50|$|Westland Aircraft {{decided to}} make a private venture {{improvement}} on the Westland WS-51 Dragonfly, which was a licensed Sikorsky design, helicopter by increasing the cabin capacity and replacing the Dragonfly's rotor head, blades and gearbox with the units used in the Westland Whirlwind. Three Dragonfly Series 1As were converted to WS-51 Series 2 <b>Widgeons,</b> and the first one flew on 23 August 1955.|$|R
25|$|<b>Widgeon</b> {{returned}} to Sasebo on 17 February 1967, worn and beaten from heavy seas, and was under repairs during March and April. On 1 May, a Navy P-3 Orion patrol plane, {{with a crew}} of 12 men on board, crashed in the Tsushima Strait off the southern coast of Korea. <b>Widgeon</b> headed for {{the scene of the}} crash, transiting the hazardous Hirado Strait for search and rescue (SAR) operations. She searched for two days and recovered numerous bits of debris but was unable to locate any survivors or the fuselage of the plane. The minesweeper ultimately {{returned to}} Sasebo on 5 May, to commence refresher training.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Widgeon</b> proved {{expensive}} {{compared to}} its competitors {{and a total}} of only 26 of all types, including the prototype, were built and sold before production was stopped in 1930 in order to allow Westland to concentrate on the Wapiti general-purpose military aircraft and the Wessex airliner.|$|E
25|$|A Westland <b>Widgeon,</b> a UK-built {{version of}} the Sikorsky S-51, appears in the 1971 British film When Eight Bells Toll, {{starring}} Anthony Hopkins, directed by Étienne Périer {{and based on the}} Alistair Maclean novel of the same name.

50|$|More than {{a hundred}} species of birds have been spotted at Lake Perris. Many are migratory, and stop at the park briefly during their travels, while others make their {{permanent}} residence here. Meadowlarks, loggerhead shrikes, roadrunners, California thrashers, quail, wrens, sparrows, hummingbirds, golden eagles, several varieties of hawks, ospreys, and even bald eagles may be seen. Many varieties of waterfowl use the lake including pintails, <b>widgeons,</b> teals, mallards, shovelers, various geese, and sometimes tundra swans and pelicans. black-necked stilts, avocets, killdeer, willets, kingfishers, egrets, and herons are attracted to the water’s edge.|$|R
50|$|This area {{is notable}} for its populations of Porcupine caribou, a {{subspecies}} of caribou {{named for the}} herd which roams the Porcupine River area and which along with two other large herds, the Central Arctic and the Western Arctic caribou herds, {{can be found in}} this ecoregion. Other mammals include large populations of bears, wolves and other predators while birds of the region include rock ptarmigan, lesser scaup, northern pintail duck, scoters, sandhill crane and <b>widgeons.</b> Finally the Porcupine River system is an important breeding ground for Chinook salmon.|$|R
25|$|The ship {{underwent}} further {{trials and}} alterations before she sailed to the Western Pacific Ocean (WestPac) on 1 October 1956. Proceeding in company with Mine Division (MinDiv) 95, <b>Widgeon</b> reported to Commander, Naval Forces, Far East (ComNavFE) for duty and {{was assigned to}} MinDiv 32, Mine Squadron 3, Mine Flotilla 1.|$|E
25|$|Following these repairs, the British Admiralty {{arranged}} with Smith {{to undertake a}} new series of trials for Archimedes at Dover. Captain Edward Chappell, RN, was appointed by the Admiralty to oversee the trials and write a report.

In addition to Bertie Wooster (Jeeves stories), Pongo Twistleton (Uncle Fred stories), Rupert Psmith (Psmith stories), and Freddie Threepwood (Blandings stories), prominent recurring drones include Bingo Little and Freddie <b>Widgeon,</b> plus Monty Bodkin, Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps, Tuppy Glossop, Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright, Archibald Mulliner, and the club millionaire Oofy Prosser.|$|E
50|$|When the Government nationalized all {{airlines}} to create NAC in 1947, the Electra service {{was replaced by}} de Havilland DH.89s. Once the new paved runway was created in 1956 along with a new substantial but temporary terminal, Douglas DC-3s began operating. Meanwhile, a local airline, Amphibian Airways had started the Stewart Island route in the early 1950s, using Grumman <b>Widgeons.</b> The amphibians also serviced isolated coastal lighthouses and their settlements. Stewart Island Air Services took over in the late 1970s, and was then taken over by Southern Air in 1981, which still provides the air service to Stewart Island as Stewart Island Flights.|$|R
60|$|To {{these may}} {{naturally}} be added the birds that enliven the waters. Wild-ducks in spring-time hatch their young in the islands, and upon reedy shores;--the sand-piper, flitting along the stony margins, by its restless note attracts {{the eye to}} motions as restless:--upon some jutting rock, or {{at the edge of}} a smooth meadow, the stately heron may be descried with folded wings, that might seem to have caught their delicate hue from the blue waters, by the side of which she watches for her sustenance. In winter, the lakes are sometimes resorted to by wild swans; and in that season habitually by <b>widgeons,</b> goldings, and other aquatic fowl of the smaller species. Let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolutions which these visitants sometimes perform, on a fine day towards the close of winter.|$|R
60|$|We {{had been}} about {{eighteen}} days here when our shallop returned, and we stayed a week more trafficking with the people; and I am persuaded, {{if we had been}} in the mind to have settled there and stayed till now, we should have been very welcome to the people. We saw neither horse or cow, mule, ass, dog, or cat, or any of our European animals, excepting that our men shot some wild ducks and <b>widgeons,</b> exactly the same which we see in England, and very fat and good, but much easier to shoot than in England, having never been acquainted with the flash and noise of guns as ours have been; we also found a sort of partridges in the country not much unlike our own, and a great many of the whistling plover, the same with ours.|$|R
25|$|Ready for sea on 15 December 1955, <b>Widgeon,</b> {{a unit of}} the Pacific Fleet Mine Force, sailed on 3 January 1956, for {{visits to}} San Francisco and Long Beach, California. The new {{minesweeper}} operated out of the latter port until 29 January, at which time she shifted to San Diego to undergo shakedown training. Upon completion of shakedown, the ship underwent a four-week availability at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard.|$|E
25|$|The {{repaired}} XR-1A {{was purchased}} by Helicopter Air Transport, which intended to operate it for commercial purposes {{as part of a}} fleet of 40 helicopters. The company had also developed a number of other concepts for helicopters, including the PL-11, an improved civilian version of the XR-1A; the PL-12, a four-passenger variant of the PL-11; and the PL-14, a twin-rotor helicopter based on a Grumman <b>Widgeon</b> fuselage. In addition, a design for a tiltrotor airliner was developed by the company.|$|E
25|$|The {{commercial}} break-through {{took place}} in 1957, when an agreement was reached with the Ministry of Social Affairs to carry out air ambulance services in the area between Sunnfjord and Nordmøre. For this they bought a Republic RC-3 Seabee. The company expanded rapidly, and by 1961 it was operating three Seabees, a Grumman G-44 <b>Widgeon</b> and the Fairchild PT-19 Cornell. From 1964 the company hired a scuba diver and placed him on standby. The service was provided to fishing vessels who could call in cases where they got {{a line in the}} propeller or other technical issues.|$|E
60|$|Every {{part of this}} {{beautiful}} scene teemed with living creatures of every sort and size, from the huge alligators that lay like stranded logs upon the mud-banks, basking in the sun, to the tiny plover that waded in cheerful activity among the sedges. There were tall reeds in many places, and among these were thousands of cranes, herons, flamingoes, {{and other members of}} that long-necked and long-legged family; some engaged in solemnly searching for food, while others, already gorged, stood gravely on one leg, as if that position assisted digestion, and watched with quiet satisfaction the proceedings of their companions. The glassy surface of the mirror was covered in places with a countless host of geese, <b>widgeons,</b> teals and other water-fowl either gambolling about in sport, or sleeping away a recent surfeit, and thousands of other small birds and beasts swarmed about everywhere, giving a sort of faint indication of the inconceivable numbers of the smaller creatures which were there, though not visible to the observer. But Tom's interest was chiefly centred on the huge animals--the crocodiles and hippopotami--which sprawled or floated about.|$|R
60|$|Of the {{feathered}} tribes {{there are}} the large and small grey Canada goose, the laughing goose (so called from the resemblance of its cry to laughter), and the wavie or white goose. The latter are not very numerous. There are great numbers of wild ducks, pintails, <b>widgeons,</b> divers, sawbills, black ducks, and teal; but the prince of ducks (the canvas-back) is not there. In spring and autumn the whole country becomes musical with the wild cries and shrill whistle of immense hosts of plover of all kinds--long legs, short legs, black legs, and yellow legs--sandpipers and snipe, which are assisted in their noisy concerts by myriads of frogs. The latter are really the best songsters in Hudson Bay [see note 2]. Bitterns are {{also found in the}} marshes; and sometimes, though rarely, a solitary crane finds its way to the coast. In the woods, and among the dry places around, there are a few grey grouse and wood partridges, a great many hawks, and owls of all sizes-- from the gigantic white owl, which measures five feet across the back and wings, to the small grey owl, not much bigger than a man's hand.|$|R
40|$|The North Gulf Coast - Prince William Sound {{region of}} Alaska, phytographically, {{lies at the}} {{northern}} limit of the Sitka Spruce-hemlock coastal/subalpine forests of the Pacific Coast; it includes approximately 178, 500 km 2 and a shoreline of approximately 8, 500 km. Fourteen habitats are utilized by birds: tundra; shrub thickets; hemlock-Sitka Spruce forests; bogs; mixed deciduous-spruce woodlands; marshes; lacustrine waters; fluviatile waters; cliffs, bluffs, and screes; moraines, alluvia, and barrier islands; beaches and tidal flats; rocky shores and reefs; inshore waters; and offshore waters. Two hundred nineteen species of birds have been recorded in the region, 111 of which are primarily water-related. Status, abundance, habitat, and seasonal occurrence {{are discussed in the}} annotated list of species. The geographic location and restrictive topography of the region make it a spectacular corridor for millions of migrating birds. In spring millions of Pintails, Dunlins, Western Sandpipers, and Northern Phalaropes move through the region, as do tens of thousands of Whistling Swans, Snow Geese, Knots, and Sanderlings. Fall concentrations of White-fronted Geese and Sandhill Cranes may exceed 100, 000 's. Species with notably large summering populations include Trumpeter Swans (several hundred breeding pairs), Bald Eagles (1, 800 - 2, 000 breeding pairs), Aleutian Terns (150 - 250 breeding pairs on Copper River Delta), Marbled Murrelets (probably millions), and Kittlitz's Murrelets (probably a few 100, 000 's). Significant range extensions reported include Yellow-billed Loons (fairly common in winter), Pink-footed and Pale-footed shearwaters, Brandt's Cormorants (breeding), Red-faced Cormorants (breeding), Steller's Eiders (winter), Bristle-thighed Curlews (migrant), Bar-tailed Godwits (migrant), Crested Auklets (winter), and northernmost wintering populations of waterfowl (Canada Geese, Gadwalls, Pintails, Green-winged Teals, American <b>Widgeons)</b> and shorebirds (Surfbirds, Black Trunstones, Dunlins, and Sanderlings). Some unexpected species reported include Skua, Anna's Hummingbird, Purple Marin, Yellowthroat, Common Grackle, and White-throated Sparrow...|$|R
