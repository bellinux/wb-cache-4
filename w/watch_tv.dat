5|$|The EyeTV W was {{introduced}} in November 2013. It is a small 44 gram device that receives free digital over-the-air television broadcasts and makes it available to portable devices through a wireless hot spot. A review in Macworld said it was portable, {{easy to use and}} had good battery life, but noted that users can't connect to other wi-fi networks and <b>watch</b> <b>TV</b> at the same time. It gave the product 4 out of 5 stars. An EyeTV Mobile device for iPads was announced at the 2011 International Franchise Conference as the first tuner for the new Freeview system in the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Sociological Research of TV Audience Behaviour Factors Determining The Time Spent <b>Watching</b> <b>TV</b> ABSTRACT The thesis {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of TV viewing and with TV audience behaviour research. The theoretical part demarcates <b>watching</b> <b>TV</b> within leisure activities and {{deals with the}} question of motivation for <b>watching</b> <b>TV</b> as well. It also mentions the approach of people who intentionally try to exclude TV from their life. The text does not omit even the important contemporary determinants of <b>watching</b> <b>TV</b> - Internet and digitization of TV broadcasting. Subsequently, the main methods of TV audience behaviour research in the Czech Republic are introduced. In the empirical part, the main factors that most affect the time spent <b>watching</b> <b>TV</b> are being identified - first through separate elementary analyses and afterwards through searching for a regression model that would best predict the time spent <b>watching</b> <b>TV</b> for individuals and groups based on their socio-demographic and other characteristics.

From its premier on January 21, 2008 to March 26, 2008 it was the second most <b>watched</b> <b>TV</b> show in Colombia just behind its leading: dramatic and suspense telenovela Pura Sangre (Pure Blood). After Pura Sangre's finale, El Último Matrimonio Feliz fell to the third position on most <b>watched</b> <b>TV</b> shows in Colombia, but instead became the most <b>watched</b> <b>TV</b> show on RCN prime time.|$|R
40|$|The paper studies a major human {{activity}} – that of <b>watching</b> <b>TV</b> - where many individuals have incomplete control over, and foresight into, their own behavior. As a consequence, they <b>watch</b> more <b>TV</b> than they consider optimal {{for themselves and}} their well-being is lower than what could be achieved. Mainly people with significant opportunity costs of time regret {{the amount of time spent}} <b>watching</b> <b>TV.</b> They report lower subjective well-being when <b>watching</b> <b>TV</b> for many hours. For others, there is no negative effect on life satisfaction from <b>watching</b> <b>TV.</b> Long hours spent in front of a TV are linked to higher material aspirations and anxiety and therewith lower life satisfaction.

25|$|In {{this case}} {{there are two}} pure Nash equilibria: either both swerve to the left, or both swerve to the right. In this example, it doesn't matter which side both players pick, {{as long as they}} both pick the same. Both {{solutions}} are Pareto efficient. This is not true for all coordination games, as the pure coordination game in Fig. 3 shows. Pure (or common interest) coordination is the game where the players both prefer the same Nash equilibrium outcome, here both players prefer partying over both staying at home to <b>watch</b> <b>TV.</b> The {Party, Party} outcome Pareto dominates the {Home, Home} outcome, just as both Pareto dominate the other two outcomes, {Party, Home} and {Home, Party}.|$|E
25|$|Peggy Fowler {{was born}} in Nampa, Idaho, on July 14, 1951. The {{daughter}} of a Quaker minister, {{she grew up in}} Oregon, first in Portland. Fowler was the youngest of five children in the family, with the next oldest nine years older than she was. Growing up in a religious household, she did not <b>watch</b> <b>TV</b> at home until around age 10, and did not attend a movie until reaching college. From the age of two until five she wore an eye patch over her right eye and is legally blind in one eye. While in fifth grade the family moved from Portland to Hillsboro, Oregon, a suburb to the west. In school she excelled in math and played the flute, while hoping to become a scientist.|$|E
25|$|Inmates {{who were}} in the SCU for {{disciplinary}} or administrative reasons would be confined to their cells for 23.5 hours per day. They would be given half an hour of exercise, which consisted of walking alone in the corridor between cells in the SCU. A rubber pad and blanket would be delivered in the evening and collected each morning. The inmates would not have any opportunity to see the outdoors. Inmates {{who were in}} the SCU for protective custody would be allowed to retain the rubber pad and blanket throughout the day, and would sometimes be permitted to exercise outdoors for half an hour per day. Inmates were not permitted to speak to one another, work, attend school, visit the library, <b>watch</b> <b>TV,</b> or engage in any other interactive activities.|$|E
40|$|Since <b>watching</b> <b>TV</b> {{represents}} a considerable constituent of children’s waking-life, TV content should hence have a great influence on dream content. The present study in children (N = 3167) clearly indicates that most children stated that <b>watching</b> <b>TV</b> affect their dreams. Whereas {{the amount of}} <b>TV</b> <b>watching</b> is weakly associated with nightmare frequency, the children who incorporate TV contents into their dreams have more nightmares. This is most likely explained by emotional intensity experienced while <b>watching</b> <b>TV</b> and/or personality traits. Carefully designed studies eliciting TV content, emotional response to <b>TV</b> <b>watching,</b> and personality traits are necessary {{to better understand the}} effect of TV consumption on dreaming...|$|R

25|$|Al Jazeera's {{availability}} (via satellite) {{throughout the}} Middle East changed the television {{landscape of the}} region. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to <b>watch</b> <b>TV</b> channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of freedom of speech on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program El-Itidjah el-Mouakass ("The Opposite Direction"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.|$|E

The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." [...] Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, [...] "They don’t sit and <b>watch</b> <b>TV</b> and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that – so I thought the technology was there.

500|$|British critic Leslie Halliwell {{states the}} film's {{influence}} as [...] "it {{led directly to}} all the kaleidoscopic swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties". In particular, the visuals and storyline are credited with inspiring The Monkees' television series. The [...] "Can't Buy Me Love" [...] segment borrowed stylistically from Richard Lester's earlier The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film, {{and it is this}} segment, in particular using the contemporary technique of cutting the images to the beat of the music, which has been cited as a precursor of modern music videos. Roger Ebert goes even further, crediting Lester for a more pervasive influence, even constructing [...] "a new grammar": [...] "he influenced many other films. Today when we <b>watch</b> <b>TV</b> and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night".

[...] Tracy McLoone of PopMatters reviewed, [...] "Kim Possible includes adult-friendly humor, in the event that parents feel the need to <b>watch</b> <b>tv</b> (sic) with their kids. But nobody in or watching the series will ever be offended or over-stimulated, or even surprised." [...] While accepting main character Kim as a positive role model and acknowledging that the series sometimes teaches [...] "good lessons", Besty Wallace of Common Sense Media expressed concern about the show's emphasis on action and violence, explaining, [...] "lessons may get muddled and nearly lost as the heroes shimmy up rope ladders dangling from helicopters and dodge spinning tops of doom. As long as you're not expecting too {{much in the way of}} educational value, you'll probably have plenty of fun with this one." [...] Writing for Bustle, Sarah Freymiller opined, [...] "Ultimately, Kim Possible was just a solid show. It didn't skimp on plot or dialogue in favor of Wile E. Coyote explosions, and its tongue-in-cheek humor allowed it to be self-aware and hip at the same time." [...] Conversely, Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection Among Girls author Lyn Mikel Brown was less receptive towards Kim herself, criticizing the show for promoting the beautiful and thin heroine as [...] "your basic average girl" [...] and apparent reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the fact that her [...] "biggest threat" [...] is Bonnie as opposed to evil. According to Brown, [...] "Being the kind of girl who's accepted or befriended by boys underscores a girl's power and sets her against other girls." ...|$|E

40|$|Adults with {{intellectual}} disabilities (ID) {{are more}} likely to lead sedentary lifestyles and have low levels of physical activity (LLPA). The present study investigated the prevalence of reported LLPA and time spent <b>watching</b> <b>TV</b> in adults with ID and identified the associated factors for these behaviors. The proxy informants of 1618 adults with ID completed the surveys regarding their health behaviors. Multiple logistic regressions were employed for LLPA and multiple linear regressions for time spent <b>watching</b> <b>TV.</b> About 60 % of adults with ID had LLPA and average time spent <b>watching</b> <b>TV</b> was 3. 4 h a day. Some characteristics and health and function variables were identified as associated factors. While engaging in community activities and involvement in Special Olympics were inversely associated with LLPA, they were not associated with time spent <b>watching</b> <b>TV.</b> Attending day/educational programs or being employed were associated with spending less time <b>watching</b> <b>TV.</b> Findings highlight differential factors associated with LLPA versus TV-watching behavior in adults with ID. Hence, a key strategy aimed at increasing physical activity includes promoting participation in social and community activities, while targeted activities for reducing sedentary behavior might focus on providing day programs or employment opportunities for adults with ID...|$|R
