5|$|An {{alternative}} proposal {{would keep the}} existing station open but with many services calling only at a new Westbrae Drive station. This proposal was backed in August 2001 by Charlie Gordon, then leader of Glasgow City Council, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> having a second station in Jordanhill would assist students at the nearby Jordanhill campus of the University of Strathclyde. The proposed new station would have been only roughly 500 yd (460 m) away.|$|E
5|$|As {{the series}} wound down, Telefe {{considered}} a theatrical version for the 2013 summer season. It {{would have been}} similar to a 2010 version by the producers of Valientes, but the cast had other commitments. Telefe then asked series creator Sebastian Ortega to make a film. Negotiations were confirmed by producer Pablo Culell, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> although Underground produces television series it can also produce stage plays and films.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{currently}} {{portrayed as}} an underachiever, Bart was actually very happy and looking forward {{about going to}} school. However, the boy's initial enthusiastic nature is crushed by an uncaring and bitter teacher <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{he would be a}} failure at life and never amount to anything. Deeply hurt by this comment, Bart then began the process of developing his path into the mischievous way of life.|$|E

50|$|Roland Scholten went 3 - 1 {{up against}} Alan Warriner <b>who</b> had <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he'd changed his darts three times since the world championships. Warriner took {{three on the}} trot to go ahead 4 - 3 before Scholten dug deep {{to take the next}} three legs. The match {{ultimately}} finished 8 - 6 to Scholten <b>who</b> <b>said</b> afterwards <b>that</b> he was happy with the way he was playing. Asked about the forthcoming semifinal, Scholten <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he would try to play to his ability and see what happened.|$|R

5|$|James Device {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murders by {{witchcraft}} of Anne Townley and John Duckworth. However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out in court. That, and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> she had seen her brother asking a black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the jury to find him guilty.|$|E
5|$|New {{legislation}} {{stopped the}} TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians {{as of the}} fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it would promote accountability in the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints were submitted anonymously.|$|E
5|$|The episode makes a {{reference}} to Blue Öyster Cult's hit song “(Don't Fear) The Reaper”, which also plays during the episode's end credits, and inspired {{the title of a}} later episode.

5|$|The {{release of}} a video-game Starpower: Beyoncé was {{cancelled}} after Beyoncé pulled out of a $100million with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development. It was {{settled out of court}} by her lawyers in June 2013 <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers. Beyoncé also has had deals with American Express, Nintendo DS and L'Oréal since the age of 18.|$|E
5|$|The theatre reputedly {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} under the Brars. In 1998, the Princess was called “an absolutely lousy advertisement for late 20th century privatization” by Magic Lantern Theatre’s Rick Ostapchuk, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the current owners had allowed the theatre to sink “with the velocity, {{if not the}} sanitized H20, of a waterslide”. By his count, 170 of the marquee’s 330 lights were burnt out, {{and he did not}} believe the interior had been regularly washed or maintained.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} 100% Love (2011), Sukumar {{began working}} on a psychological thriller with Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist because he felt that Mahesh had universal appeal. An incident in which a bus driver talked about a young boy <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> his parents were murdered on his bus became the story's base. Mahesh met Sukumar {{on the set of}} Businessman (2012) in Goa, and listened to the script for 25 minutes. Although Sukumar could not describe the story well in the noisy restaurant, Mahesh agreed to appear in the film within half an hour. Sukumar worked on 1:Nenokkadine script for two months, and considered it his dream project.|$|E

5|$|After the trial, Manoj and Babli, {{accompanied}} {{by a team of}} five police officers assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away. Suspecting foul play, Manoj and Babli did not continue toward Chandigarh, instead boarding a bus for Karnal. According to a statement filed by Chanderpati, later that day, around 3:40pm, she received a call from a Pipli telephone booth from Manoj, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the police had deserted them, and Babli's family members were trailing them, so they would try to take a bus to Delhi and call her back later. Babli asked for acceptance from Chanderpati, who replied affirmatively. That was the last time Manoj's family heard from the couple.|$|E
5|$|An {{aspect of}} Murder on the Orient Express which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. The voice acting in {{particular}} gained widespread positive reviews. GameSpot called the voice acting excellent, {{with the voice}} actors bringing the characters to life, thanks largely to David Suchet as Poirot. IGN also called the voice acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it was tense at moments, but probably could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised the game for providing realistic sound effects, such as noises coming from the Orient Express itself, and other environmental noises such as howling wind. IGN, in contrast, heavily criticized the game {{for a lack of}} background music, and simplistic and monotonous sound effects.|$|E
5|$|Doom was {{released}} to positive reception regarding the fast-paced gameplay, single-player campaign, visuals and soundtrack whereas criticism was predominantly toward the multiplayer mode. Many critics believed that Doom {{was a successful}} return to form for the series. Following the wide release, the game received scores of 85/100 for PC and PlayStation 4 and 87/100 for the Xbox One on Metacritic. The {{final version of the}} game received very positive reviews from users on Steam. It also received praise from other video game creators, including Cliff Bleszinski and Greg Kasavin, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the game answers questions that other modern shooters do not answer.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 April 2013, the Facebook and Twitter {{accounts}} of Valor por Tamaulipas were shut down unexpectedly and without any explanation. A new page with the same name was created by other administrators, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they did not know {{what had happened to the}} original administrator but that they wanted to continue his work nonetheless. This raised concerns about who was actually working behind the scenes to keep the page running. Another page run by other users and with a similar name, Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas ("Responsibility for Tamaulipas"), posted on their page that Valor por Tamaulipas had only closed temporarily in order to improve the page and protect the administrator. They advised online users to ignore websites that posed as the original page.|$|E
5|$|Just {{ahead of}} the opening match of the 2016–17 season, Ranieri cautioned against {{excessive}} hope of City retaining the title arguing that the other clubs now understood Leicester's break tactics. His principle objective, as last season, was to avoid relegation. He also warned against overconfidence against relegation favourites – by implication, their next opponents, newly promoted Hull City. His view on Leicester's chances were shared by Gary Lineker, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> N'Golo Kanté, who left the club during the summer to join Chelsea, had been Leicester's most important player and essential to Ranieri's system.|$|E
5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet {{in the hands of}} an inexperienced officer, and that most of the credit for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E

5|$|Leigh's family {{opposed the}} fictionalisation of her murder, though {{protests against the}} film were {{abandoned}} after it received financial backing from the New South Wales Film and Television Office. Blackrock was filmed {{over a period of}} two weeks at locations including Stockton, where Leigh was murdered, a decision that was opposed by local residents <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> memories of the murder were still fresh. While the film was never marketed as being based on a true story, numerous comparisons between the murder and the film were made, and many viewers believed it to be a factual account of the murder.|$|E
5|$|Much of Carter's {{inspiration}} for the episode came from reports of Phineas Gage, who underwent a personality change after a blasting accident drove an iron rod completely through his head (though the idea that Gage became violent, immoral, or a pathological liar, as Scully describes him, is without foundation). The aliens' use of a dental drill on Barry {{was inspired by a}} neighbour of Carter <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he was abducted and that the aliens drilled holes into his teeth – which a dentist analyzed and said could not be done with any equipment he knew.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May 2016, Kane {{opened a}} 2–1 {{friendly}} win over Turkey at the City of Manchester Stadium, but later missed a penalty. He {{was the first}} England player to fail to score from the penalty spot during a game since Frank Lampard in 2010, {{and the first to}} miss the target since Peter Crouch in 2006. At the European Championship in France that June, Kane was assigned to take corner kicks, a tactic which was criticised by pundits, but defended by Hodgson, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Kane was the best for the role.|$|E
