Participants in design coordination meetings typically use meeting tools such as agendas, CPM schedules, electronic whiteboards, 2 -, 3 -, or 4 -dimensional drawings, and large-scale physical mock-ups to identify and resolve problems. We introduce a methodology to capture <b>Work</b> <b>Structuring</b> issues that surface during design development. This methodology is to be used in conjunction with existing meeting tools to help all participants understand the <b>Work</b> <b>Structuring</b> direction, i. e., the project’s organizing principle.

An innovative approach to solve design – related problems is described as the integrated product- process design. As a foundation for a formal framework consisting of organizing principles and techniques, <b>Work</b> <b>Structuring</b> has been developed to guide efforts in the integration that enhances the development of operation and process design in alignment with product design. Vietnam construction projects are facing many delays, and cost overruns caused mostly by design related problems. A better design management that integrates product and process design could resolve these problems. A questionnaire survey and in – depth interviews were used to investigate the feasibility of applying <b>Work</b> <b>Structuring</b> to construction projects in Vietnam.

40|$|<b>Work</b> <b>structuring</b> means {{developing}} a project's process design {{while trying to}} align engineering design, supply chain, resource allocation, and assembly efforts. The goal of <b>work</b> <b>structuring</b> is to make work flow more reliable and quick while delivering value to the customer. Current <b>work</b> <b>structuring</b> practices are driven by contracts, the history of trades, and the traditions of craft. As a result, they rarely consider alternatives for making the construction process more efficient. To illustrate current practice and the opportunities provided by <b>work</b> <b>structuring,</b> this case study discusses the installation of metal door frames at a prison project. Because the project is a correctional facility, the door frame installation process involves a special grouting procedure which makes the installation process less routine. Those involved recognized {{the difficulty of the}} situation but better solutions were impeded by normal practice. This case study thus provided the opportunity to illustrate how one may come up with alternative ways to perform the work without being constrained by contractual agreements and trade boundaries. By doing so, we illustrate what <b>work</b> <b>structuring</b> means. Local and global fixes for the system comprising walls and doors are explored. In addition, we discuss the importance of dimensional tolerances in construction and how these affect the handoff of work chunks from one production unit to the next...|$|R

The five whys is a technique to elicit alternative ways of <b>structuring</b> <b>work</b> without being constrained by contractual agreements, traditions, or trade boundaries. We discuss the importance of dimensional tolerances in construction and how these affect the handoff of work from one group of workers to the next.

5000|$|From the 1970s forward, {{the global}} {{marketplace}} and {{the makeup of the}} labor force has had transformations by way of technological innovation, <b>work</b> <b>structure,</b> and new forms of controlling labor. [...] Because of changes in the wider labor market, women have joined the labor force in greater numbers and tended to remain a part of the force. Moreover, many male employees have often been moved to less desirable jobs, if not placed outside of the labor market entirely. Additionally, those characteristics commonly related to female employment such as temporary arrangements, low wages, and job instability have risen. Moreover, these patterns have increased vis-a-vis characteristics identified with male labor, such as unionization and job security.
