6000|$|Substitutes for Pots and Kettles.--It is {{possible}} to boil water over a slow fire in many kinds of vessels that would be destroyed by {{a greater degree of}} heat. In bark, <b>wooden,</b> <b>skin,</b> and even paper vessels, it is quite possible to boil water. The ruder tribes of the Indian Archipelago use a bamboo to boil their rice: [...] "The green cane resisting the fire sufficiently long for the cooking of one mass of rice." [...] (Crawfurd.) If, however, you have no vessel that you choose to expose to the risk of burning, you must heat stones and drop them into the water it contains; but sandstones, especially are apt to shiver and make grit. The Dacota Indians, and very probably other tribes also, used to boil animals in their own hide. The description runs thus: [...] "They stuck four stakes in the ground, and tied the four corners of the hide up to them, leaving a hollow in the middle; three or four gallons of water, and the meat cut up very fine, were then put in; three or four hot stones, each the size of a 6-lb. cannon-shot, cooked the whole into a good soup." [...] To a fastidious palate, the soot, dirt, and ashes that are usually mixed up with the soup, are objectionable; but these may be avoided by a careful cook, who dusts and wipes the stones before dropping them in. The specific heat of stone is much less than that of water, so that the heating power of a measure of stone is only about one-half of that of an equal measure of equally hot water.|$|E

50|$|It was a {{conventionally}} configured low-wing cantilever monoplane with tailwheel undercarriage. The {{main undercarriage}} units retracted into the engine nacelles. Construction was wooden throughout, with <b>wooden</b> <b>skinning</b> everywhere but the forward and upper fuselage sections, which were skinned in metal. As usually configured, the cabin seated six passengers with baggage compartments fore and aft, and a toilet aft.|$|R
50|$|The CAJO 59 was {{designed}} by Carl Johansen (hence the name) as a general purpose 3-4 seat amphibious flying boat. It was a high-gull winged twin-engine monoplane with a wooden structure, mostly <b>wooden</b> <b>skinned,</b> apart from glass fibre/foam sandwich panels in the fuselage and fabric covered control surfaces. The wings inboard of the engines were built around two spars and had high dihedral (8.8°), which raised the engines well above the water. Outboard of the engines the wings had a single spar and were without dihedral. They carried full span slotted flaps and ailerons which were lowered when the flaps were fully extended.|$|R

5000|$|Nearly {{three decades}} later, {{a more serious}} attempt at radar [...] "invisibility" [...] was tried with the Horten Ho 229 flying wing fighter-bomber, {{developed}} in Nazi Germany during {{the last years of}} World War II. In addition to the aircraft's shape, the majority of the Ho 229's <b>wooden</b> <b>skin</b> was bonded together using carbon-impregnated plywood resins designed with the purported intention of absorbing radar waves. Testing performed in early 2009 by the Northrop-Grumman Corporation established that this compound, along with the aircraft's shape, would have rendered the Ho 229 virtually invisible to the top-end HF-band, 20-30 MHz primary signals of Britain's Chain Home early warning radar, provided the aircraft was traveling at high speed (approximately 550 mph) at extremely low altitude - 50 - 100 ft.|$|E
5000|$|The Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre in Nouméa, New Caledonia (1991-98), {{is among}} the most unusual of Piano's works. A joint project between New Caledonia and the French government, it is {{designed}} to display the culture of the Kanak people. The project uses a combination of traditional and modern material; local wood, along with glass and aluminum. The complex is located on a narrow peninsula in a lagoon with prevailing winds. Piano designed a series of curved wooden screens, from 9 to 28 meters high, to protect the exposition structures, then three [...] "villages" [...] of structures; one for welcome and exhibitions space; one for an auditorium and media center; and one for service functions. The curving wooden pavilions, inspired in form by the local architecture, have a double <b>wooden</b> <b>skin</b> to protect against the weather, but also let in the sunlight. While it is devoted to the local culture, some of the buildings, particularly the towering reception center, with curving walls and wooden spires, are strikingly post-modern in form.|$|E
50|$|The Ivanhoe House is {{situated}} in the leafy green suburb of Ivanhoe, North East of Melbourne’s city centre.Its site overlooks Chelsworth Park to the south, and has no real street frontage to the North, as the land subdivision itself is a triple battle axe. The house is of a courtyard type, but can also {{be described as a}} ‘perimeter house’. Its main point of difference from a regular courtyard house is its elevated construction, informed by the raised floodplain levels of its Ivanhoe site. The form of the house is a roughly square plan, surrounding an internal courtyard which spans 2 levels. Planned around this courtyard, a string of rooms in a loop allows inhabitants to walk {{all the way around the}} house. There are no set corridors, and flexible walls create a flexibility of space.Construction incorporates a steel framed structure on stilts that is sometimes exposed within the villa, and a taught black <b>wooden</b> <b>skin,</b> as well as louvered windows and semi-timbered openings. Materiality mostly consists of timber, from indoor to outdoor, but different wood species and stains are used to differentiate space and program.|$|E
50|$|The {{hull of the}} Oakley {{class was}} {{constructed}} from two <b>wooden</b> <b>skins</b> {{with a layer of}} calico between. After several years {{it was found that the}} calico absorbed water which caused softening of the wood around the copper nails. This led to a series of surveys in the late 1980s and the withdrawal of some boats, or replanking of others. The skins were made from diagonally laid African Mahogany planks. The outer one was 0.375 in thick with the inner 0.25 in. The keel was iron and weighed 1.154 tons. The hull was divided into eleven watertight compartments. Two sizes were built. Most boats were 37 ft in length and 11 ft in beam. It displaced 12.05 tons when fully laden with crew and gear. Five larger boats were built that were 48 ft long and 14 ft wide.|$|R
50|$|In the Bronze and Iron Ages amphorae {{spread around}} the ancient Mediterranean world, {{being used by the}} ancient Greeks and Romans as the {{principal}} means for transporting and storing grapes, olive oil, wine, oil, olives, grain, fish, and other commodities. They were produced on an industrial scale until approximately the 7th century AD. <b>Wooden</b> and <b>skin</b> containers seem to have supplanted amphorae thereafter.|$|R
50|$|The Koolhoven F.K.48 was an {{airliner}} {{built in the}} Netherlands in 1934 for KLM. It was a conventional, semi-cantilever high-wing monoplane, powered by two engines mounted on the wing leading edges. The undercarriage was of fixed, tailskid type with divided main units. The fuselage was of welded steel tube construction, covered in fabric, which was oval in cross section at the nose, transitioning to a rectangular cross-section for the passenger cabin. The wings were <b>wooden</b> structures <b>skinned</b> in plywood.|$|R
5000|$|The Pylades is what {{is known}} as [...] "composite" [...] built. Soon after the {{building}} of ships with iron was commenced, this composite system of construction was adopted in the British merchant service, and some very fast and celebrated vessels were thus constructed. The iron framing, with <b>wooden</b> <b>skin</b> planking, admitted of considerable strength being obtained, and the possibility of sheathing the bottom with metal in order to avoid fouling, appeared to be another advantage in favor of the composite system. Soon, however, it was shown that the galvanic action set up between the copper on the [...] "yellow metal" [...] sheathing, and the iron frames tended to rapidly deteriorate the ironwork, and perhaps, sooner or later, hasten the loss of the vessel. So rapid, indeed, was this wasting of the frame found to be, that for some time past the composite system has been, so far as regards merchantmen, quite abandoned. Some ships, however, are still built [...] "composite" [...] for the Royal Navy, especially such craft as are intended for use on foreign stations, and whose duties would render frequent docking impossible. Such vessels are built with frames of steel, then sheathed with wood, and coppered.|$|E
50|$|The Kraft K-1 Super Fli is a single-seat sport {{aircraft}} {{that was designed}} in the United States in the early 1970s and marketed for homebuilding. It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional design with fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. The wings have a <b>wooden</b> structure, <b>skinned</b> in plywood, while the fuselage and empennage are built from steel tube, the fuselage skinned in aluminium and the tail in fabric. It has a very similar design to radio controlled craft.|$|R
2500|$|The Trainer was in most respects a {{conventional}} open cockpit two seater of its time. Its fuselage and wings were <b>wooden</b> structures <b>skinned</b> with plywood. [...] Only the control surfaces were fabric covered. [...] The wings were built around two box spars {{and consisted of}} a constant chord centre section, integral with the fuselage and carrying no dihedral, plus bolt-on outer panels with marked dihedral and slight taper on the trailing edge. The outer panels carried both ailerons and built-in leading edge slots with no moving parts.|$|R
50|$|The Gannet was a strut-braced, high-wing {{monoplane}} {{of conventional}} design, with twin engines mounted in nacelles on the wings. The undercarriage was of fixed, tailwheel configuration with divided main units. The wings were of <b>wooden</b> construction, <b>skinned</b> in plywood, and the fuselage was built from welded steel covered in fabric. The prototype Gannet underwent flight testing in October 1935, and {{was destroyed in}} a crash shortly thereafter. The pilot and passengers perished in the ensuing fire, but despite this, the Gannet entered series production.|$|R

50|$|When the {{temperature}} is high and the relative humidity is low, evaporation of water is rapid; soil dries, wet clothes hung on a line or rack dry quickly, and perspiration readily evaporates from the <b>skin.</b> <b>Wooden</b> furniture can shrink, causing the paint that covers these surfaces to fracture.|$|R
25|$|It is a {{conventional}} biplane design with slightly staggered wings of unequal span. The wings are of fully cantilever design {{and do not}} require the bracing wires commonly used on biplanes or even interplane struts; however, most builders brace the wings with I-struts {{and at least one}} pair of wires. The cockpit is open, and the undercarriage is of fixed, tailwheel type with divided main units. The wings and horizontal stabilizer are of <b>wooden</b> construction, <b>skinned</b> in plywood, while the fuselage and vertical stabilizer are of welded steel tube covered in fabric.|$|R
50|$|Powered by a {{water-cooled}} 490 kW (660 hp) BMW VIu 7.3Z V12 engine, the L 84 had a fabric-covered fuselage {{constructed of}} welded steel tubes, and <b>wooden</b> wings <b>skinned</b> with plywood. Its armament comprised three 7.92 mm (.312 in) machine guns, two in fixed forward-firing positions {{and the third}} ring-mounted in the aft cockpit. Only the first prototype was completed before Albatros became part of Focke-Wulf, and this was destroyed during flight testing. A second example was flown in February 1933 by Focke-Wulf under the designation L 84C, using a modified cooling system.|$|R
5000|$|The German {{air force}} {{carried out the}} first terror bombing raids, using Zeppelins to drop bombs on Britain. By {{the end of the}} war {{airplanes}} had become specialised into bombers, fighters, and surveillance aircraft.

50|$|The Koolhoven F.K.40 {{was a small}} {{airliner}} {{built in}} the Netherlands in 1928 for KLM. It was a conventional high-wing cantilever monoplane with enclosed seating {{for up to six}} passengers and powered by a single engine in the nose. The fuselage was of welded steel tube construction with a <b>wooden</b> wing <b>skinned</b> in plywood held in place by four bolts to facilitate removal. The cabin was spacious for an aircraft of its size, and was intended to be readily reconfigured for passengers, mail, or freight. Although up to six seats could be fitted, the only F.K.40 built flew with four.|$|R
50|$|The HE 5 {{built upon}} Heinkel's {{experiences}} of mixed construction as {{used on the}} H steel tube, and <b>wooden</b> wings largely <b>skinned</b> in alloy. The usual crew carried was just two, pilot and observer seated in tandem, open cockpits; however, some HE 5s also had a third cockpit {{which could be used}} to carry a trainee.|$|R
50|$|The L-17's {{fuselage}} was a plywood <b>skinned</b> <b>wooden</b> semi-monocoque, {{the cockpit}} seating two side-by-side {{under a single}} piece canopy. A 108 hp (80 kW) Lycoming O-235 flat four engine drove a two blade propeller. The fixed tricycle undercarriage had rearward sloping oleo legs mounted to the wings, giving a track of 2.40 m (7 ft 10 in).|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Hi 21 {{was largely}} a <b>wooden,</b> ply <b>skinned</b> monocoque but the forward part around the cockpit was steel tube framed to protect its occupants. They sat side-by side ahead of the leading edge under a multi-part glazed canopy which ended, slightly raised above the upper fuselage line, over the wing. The empennage was conventional, with a straight edged tailplane mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and carrying straight edged, rounded tipped and balanced elevators. A small, straight edged fin {{at the rear of the}} tailplane carried a balanced, rounded rudder which reached down to the keel and worked within an elevator cut-out.|$|R
2500|$|The {{boats were}} {{constructed}} with alloy framing and <b>wooden</b> decks and <b>skin.</b> [...] The exception was Dark Scout which had all aluminium decks, skins and frames.

25|$|The Sorrell family {{originated}} {{from the state}} of Oregon, which was the last state to ban homebuilt aircraft. Hobie Sorrell petitioned congress for experimental aircraft regulations, and his son Tim designed the Hiperbipe in a series of family designed homebuilt aircraft. The design is of mixed construction. The fuselage, tail, engine mount, landing gear mounts, interplane struts and flight controls are all built from welded 4130 steel. The wings are made from wood, with <b>wooden</b> stressed <b>skin.</b> The landing gear is sprung steel tube. The engine cowling and wheel pants are fibreglass. The whole airframe is covered in doped aircraft fabric, including the plywood-covered wings. The airfoil is a custom symmetrical design.|$|R
50|$|The Potez IX was {{an early}} {{airliner}} produced in France in the 1920s, a further development of the SEA IV that Henry Potez had co-designed during the First World War. The design mated an entirely new fuselage to the wing and tail structures of the earlier military aircraft. This fuselage was very deep, nearly filling the interplane gap, and carried within it a fully enclosed cabin with seating for four passengers. The nose area was carefully streamlined with curved aluminium, but {{other aspects of the}} construction were conventional for the day; <b>wooden</b> structures <b>skinned</b> in plywood (the passenger cabin) or fabric (the rest of the aircraft). The pilot sat in an open cockpit aft of the cabin.|$|R

5000|$|The forward {{fuselage}} had a <b>wooden</b> structure <b>skinned</b> with glass fibre. The cockpit, {{ahead of the}} wing, seated two side by side [...] Two 0.88 kN Microturbo TRS 18 engines were mounted behind the cockpit, fed {{from a pair of}} dorsal intakes immediately aft of the glazing and exhausting over the rear fuselage a little behind the wing trailing edge. This section of the fuselage and the empennage were constructed from glass-fibre sandwich. The Prometheus had a tall, straight edged fin with the narrow chord tailplane and single elevator on top in T-configuration. It landed on a retractable tricycle undercarriage. The mainwheels were sprung on rubber blocks and were fitted with brakes; the nosewheel had a oleo shock absorber.|$|R
50|$|The Régnier 12's wing was {{in three}} parts {{with a short}} span, {{rectangular}} plan centre section and almost triangular plan outer panels, strongly tapered with a tip angle of about 20°. The outer panels had a dihedral of 4.5°. The wing was built around two wooden box spars; its ribs were also <b>wooden</b> and the <b>skin</b> was birch plywood. Long ailerons filled much of the outer panels' trailing edges.|$|R
25|$|Its {{fuselage}} was {{a simple}} rectangular cross section <b>wooden</b> structure <b>skinned</b> with plywood. The single seat, open, unscreened cockpit was immediately below the leading edge. The landing skid was mounted {{on the front end}} of a curved, deep, covered frame on the fuselage underside, separating from it aft and rubber sprung well clear towards its end. The fuselage tapered rearwards, where there was a small tail bumper. The tail was {{different from that of the}} BS.16; although the same triangular tailplane and parallel chord, cropped tipped elevators were used, they were mounted on top of a low, straight edged fin. A new, large, balanced, angular rudder, hinged at the extreme tail extended down to the keel, operated in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|R
25|$|In 1936 Yakovlev {{designed}} a long-range sport aircraft, intended to perform record-breaking long-distance flights.
