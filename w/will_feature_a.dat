5|$|Xbox One X's {{design is}} a {{revision}} of the Xbox One S hardware, but further streamlined. It uses a system-on-chip (SoC) known as Scorpio Engine, which incorporates a 2.3GHz octa-core CPU, and a Radeon GPU with 40 Compute Units clocked at 1172MHz, generating 6 teraflops of graphical computing performance. It also includes 12GB of GDDR5 RAM, 9 GB of which is allocated to games. To assist in optimizing the new hardware to run existing games at 4K resolution, Microsoft developers used internal debugging software to collect GPU traces from major titles that did not run at full 1080p resolution on the original Xbox One. Scorpio Engine's CPU utilizes a custom platform designed to maintain compatibility with the Jaguar CPU of the original Xbox One, but with a 31% increase in performance; the custom platform is unrelated to AMD's current Ryzen architecture. The console <b>will</b> <b>feature</b> <b>a</b> vapor chamber method of cooling for the SoC, and motherboards will be tailored to the exact voltage needs of each individual Scorpio SoC to optimize their output and energy usage.
