60|$|She {{could have}} {{cried out in}} sheer delight at the wonder of that <b>whisper</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> It had been she who had changed the world for Kurt Dorn.|$|R
60|$|They {{were silent}} for several moments. He <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> so closely {{that through the}} {{darkness}} he could, see the fire in her eyes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, my {{particular}} medicine first off was to <b>whisper</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> that she'd {{never have to}} marry Jack Belllounds. An' after that I gave her daily doses of talk about you." ...|$|R
60|$|Elfride partly undressed {{herself and}} lay down, and soon became unconscious, though her sleep was light. How long she had lain, she knew not, when by slow degrees she became {{cognizant}} of a <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R

60|$|A monk! His {{own image}} started forth a profaner of the cloister, a heretic franciscan, willing and willing not to serve, {{spinning}} like Gherardino da Borgo San Donnino, a lithe web of sophistry and <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
60|$|The first {{sister and}} the second sister had white bread (and butter beside) and as much fresh milk as they could drink; but Christine had to eat cheese-parings and bread-crusts, and had hardly enough of them to keep Goodman Hunger from <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have other}} and less {{pleasant}} news to give you, Amenche," [...] Roger <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> [...] "Get {{rid of all}} these ladies. My news must be for you, only." ...|$|E

60|$|Weakly {{he reached}} up and {{put his hands on}} her shoulders. He <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> The tears came and lay wet upon her lashes as she undid the button at his throat.|$|E
50|$|Peter, Moses's son, and Henry {{practice}} their hunting together. Henry, now romantically interested in Lilly, asks Peter {{how he can}} impress her.

60|$|Laying Martha gently {{down on a}} doorstep, Sparks {{bent over}} her, and <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> She {{appeared}} to have swooned, but opened her eyes, and gazed earnestly {{in the face of}} her deliverer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Little child," [...] he <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> [...] "What does it matter? You did {{not really}} love him. He was all unworthy of you. Do not grieve, child. So, so, that is better." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{prepared}} to <b>whisper</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> then, {{with a sudden}} excess of caution, crossed the room swiftly, opened the door, and looked out.

60|$|Asti crept forward, and {{the glowing}} {{shape in the}} royal robe bent over her so that the light of it shone upon her face.

6000|$|... "Dear hostess," [...] he <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> [...] "this sort of {{conversation}} is scarcely respectful to the bishop, {{even though he}} be a relative. You can let your young protégé expound his marvelous views after dinner." ...|$|E

60|$|These words, {{which were}} spoken aloud, and boldly, at once {{recalled}} Julian to himself, who had hitherto stood, as it were, bewildered.

60|$|Moore, however, {{preferred}} lingering {{about where}} he was.
