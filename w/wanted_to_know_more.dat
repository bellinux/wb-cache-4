5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} the Hakka people first drew {{attention}} to Chinese and foreign scholars, missionaries, travellers and writers during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era {{in the middle of}} the nineteen century. Many <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about the Hakka people who had started the Taiping Rebellion which almost overthrew the Qing Dynasty. Ernest John Eitel, a prominent German missionary, was one of those who took a great interest in this area.|$|E
25|$|Feena is {{the princess}} of the Kingdom of Sphere {{on the moon and}} also the main female protagonist. In order to become more {{knowledgeable}} about Earth and be able to follow in her mother's footsteps, she comes to Earth in a homestay with the family of the primary secretary {{to the president of the}} United Nations, Sayaka Hozumi. Since she was very young, she has always <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about the Earth and some day she hopes to surpass her mother in trying to bridge the gap between the Earth and the Kingdom of Sphere. She is well educated in terms of literature and science and has great sword skills. However, she is somewhat naive in matters of the heart and has a tendency to jump into situations without thinking, (such as jumping into a river to save a drowning puppy, without knowing how to swim, and mistaking moths for aliens). Feena once came to Earth when she was a child, and met Tatsuya previously after her mother's death, in which Tatsuya tried to comfort her. She eventually falls in love with him and later marries him to finally bring peace between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E

500|$|Wilbert Ahern (Journal of American History) {{found the}} book's {{arguments}} convincing and [...] "gracefully written", but <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about Armstrong's background in financial administration, forming of {{ties with the}} Northern philanthropists, and successful students apart from Booker T. Washington. Jennings Wagoner (History of Education Quarterly) noted that Armstrong's intentions were portrayed as comparable to the leaders of George Fredrickson's Inner Civil War, who saw their work {{as an extension of}} that of the Founding Fathers. Wagoner wrote that Engs provided a [...] "well-grounded" [...] biography that handles Armstrong's [...] "complexities and contradictions" [...] with skillful use of the historiography and understanding of the era. Ahern emphasized the biography's [...] "balance" [...] in contrast to prior partisan writing on Armstrong. He noted Donald Spivey's Schooling for the New Slavery and Engs's first book, the 1979 Freedmen's First Generation, as examples of work that associates Armstrong with [...] "stifling ... African-American aspirations". Ahern also wrote that Engs's work affirms the then-controversial claim in James McPherson's 1975 The Abolitionist Legacy that Armstrong was [...] "fundamentally dedicated to the advancement of opportunity for African Americans" [...] and other races. Edna Green Medford (The North Carolina Historical Review) wrote that the book was particularly valuable to the historiography of industrial education.|$|E
500|$|Many {{ideas were}} {{suggested}} for {{the sequel to}} Friday the 13th, including making the title part of a serialized film series, where each succeeding film would be its own story and not related to any previous film under the Friday the 13th moniker. It was Phil Scuderi, one of the producers for the original film, which suggested bringing Jason back for the sequel. The director Steve Miner felt it was the obvious direction to take the series, as he felt the audience <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about the child who attacked Alice in the lake. Miner decided to pretend as if Alice {{did not see the}} [...] "real Jason" [...] in her dream, and Jason had survived his drowning as a boy and had grown up. After killing Jason in The Final Chapter, it was the director Joseph Zito's intention to leave the door open for the studio to make more films with Tommy Jarvis as the main antagonist. Screenwriter Barney Cohen felt Jarvis would become a substitute for Jason, but the idea was never fully developed in A New Beginning. Director and co-screenwriter Danny Steinmann disliked the idea of Jason not being the killer, but decided to use Tommy's fear of Jason as the primary story. This idea was immediately abandoned in Jason Lives, when A New Beginning did not spark the [...] "creative success" [...] the studio was looking for. Executive producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. wanted to bring Jason back, and he did not care how it was achieved. In yet another alteration of the series' continuity, Tom McLoughlin chose to ignore the idea that Jason had survived his drowning, instead presenting him as always having been some sort of supernatural force. Since A New Beginning, no sequel has attempted to replace Jason as the main antagonist. Miller, who has not seen any of the sequels, took issue with all of them because they made Jason the villain. Miller believes the best part of his screenplay was that it was about a mother avenging the senseless death of her son. Miller stated, [...] "Jason was dead from the very beginning; he was a victim, not a villain." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the war had}} {{finished}} and Sumich returned to Croatia he found a [...] "flourishing faith". [...] "They had broken free from communism and the church was free". [...] "Everyone had rosaries in their pockets." [...] Sumich found himself [...] "practising as a Catholic {{for the first time}} in my life, as distinct from just going to Sunday Mass. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about the Faith, because I'd just forgotten everything". His mother sent him a Catechism of the Catholic Church, which he [...] "sat down on a beach and read" [...] over one summer. [...] "It all made sense". He started going to frequent Confession and [...] "finding a sense of shame which probably hadn't existed before". At age 34, Sumich set aside a year, praying intensely, including the 15 prayers of St Bridget of Sweden and the Rosary. At this time, he was the coach of the Croatian rugby team. [...] "We would be playing at the Hong Kong Sevens and my rosary [...] would be in my pocket and I would finger it". [...] Sumich liked to challenge his players. [...] "I would say to them, 'strong moral life, strong character on the rugby field; weak moral life, and you are the first one to chuck the towel in when the going gets tough' [...] ". Returning to New Zealand, Sumich found local liturgies very different from what he had become used to in Croatia. But, in Auckland, he was introduced to the [...] "awe-inspiring" [...] Tridentine Mass celebrated by Denzil Meuli at Titirangi. Sumich [...] "felt God's call and sought an order using this rite". He was accepted by the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter and went to their formation house, [...] the International Seminary of St. Peter in Wigratzbad-Opfenbach, Bavaria, but he did most of his studies in Denton, Nebraska at Our Lady of Guadalupe Seminary [...] where he was ordained deacon in [...] March 2008.|$|E
