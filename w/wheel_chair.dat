Gerald notices this and knowing his brother, warns him to let the girl alone. Marja is infatuated with the well-dressed visitor and is easily influenced. She consents to a secret marriage and Claude returns to England, promising to come back and claim her. Some months later Gerald proposes marriage to the girl and she sobbingly tells him she has married Claude. Gerald remains silent and does not denounce his brother. Marja does not hear from Claude but Gerald receives a paper from London announcing the marriage of Claude to a society woman, and he is furious with rage. Marja, broken-hearted over the silence of Claude, attempts suicide by throwing herself from an eminence and is found by Gerald, a cripple for life.

40|$|Trajectory {{tracking}} of mobile <b>wheeled</b> <b>chairs</b> using internal shaft encoder and inertia measurement unit(IMU), exhibits several complications and accumulated {{errors in the}} tracking process due to wheel slippage, offset drift and integration approximations. These errors can be realized when comparing localization results from such sensors with a camera tracking system. In long trajectory tracking, such errors can accumulate and result in significant deviations which make data from these sensors unreliable for tracking. Meanwhile the utilization of an external camera tracking system {{is not always a}} feasible solution depending on the implementation environment. This paper presents a novel sensor fusion method that combines the measurements of internal sensors to accurately predict the location of the <b>wheeled</b> <b>chair</b> in an environment. The method introduces a new analogical OR gate structured with tuned parameters using multi-layer feedforward neural network denoted as "Neuro-Analogical Gate" (NAG). The resulting system minimize any deviation error caused by the sensors, thus accurately tracking the <b>wheeled</b> <b>chair</b> location without the requirement of an external camera tracking system. The fusion methodology has been tested with a prototype Mecanum wheel-based chair, and significant improvement over tracking response, error and performance has been observed...|$|R
