He appointed Millhouse his Attorney-General, and continued a raft of social reform that had begun under the previous Labor government. This was opposed by some conservatives within the party; lines began to be drawn, and factions began to appear. Hall commented in the party's newsletter that [...] "too many people see the LCL as a party tied to conservative traditions.

2500|$|Classical physics {{theories}} describe three physical dimensions: from {{a particular}} point in space, the basic directions in which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be {{expressed in terms of}} just these three. Moving down is the same as moving up a negative distance. Moving diagonally upward and forward is just as the name of the direction implies; i.e., moving in a linear combination of up and forward. In its simplest form: a line describes one dimension, a plane describes two dimensions, and a cube describes three dimensions. (See Space and Cartesian coordinate system.) ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{think about}} social {{transformation}} programmatically, one must first mark the direction one wants society to move in, and then identify {{the first steps}} with which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> in that direction. In this way we can formulate proposals at points along the trajectory, be they relatively close to how things are now or relatively far away. This provides a third way between revolution and reform. It is revolutionary reform, where one has a revolutionary vision, but acts on that vision in a sequence of piecemeal reforms. As Unger puts it, transformative politics is [...] "not about blueprints; it is about pathways. It is not architecture; it is music".|$|E

His interview with Obama was on the Senator's first day. Uninterested in Favreau's résumé, Obama instead questioned Favreau on what motivated him to work in politics, and what his theory of writing was. He described this theory to Obama as, [...] "A speech can broaden the circle of people who care about this stuff.

2500|$|Since O(4) acts on R4 by {{orthogonal}} transformations, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> the [...] "standard" [...] Clifford torus defined above {{to other}} equivalent tori via rigid rotations. [...] These are all called [...] "Clifford tori". The six-dimensional group O(4) acts transitively {{on the space}} of all such Clifford tori sitting inside the 3-sphere. [...] However, this action has a two-dimensional stabilizer (see group action) since rotation in the meridional and longitudinal directions of a torus preserves the torus (as opposed to moving it to a different torus). [...] Hence, there is actually a four-dimensional space of Clifford tori. In fact, there is a one-to-one correspondence between Clifford tori in the unit 3-sphere and pairs of polar great circles (i.e., great circles that are maximally separated). [...] Given a Clifford torus, the associated polar great circles are the core circles {{of each of the}} two complementary regions. Conversely, given any pair of polar great circles, the associated Clifford torus is the locus of points of the 3-sphere that are equidistant from the two circles.|$|E

When we watch movies, we fi nd ourselves identifying with the actors, sensing their joys, hopes, fears, and sorrows.
