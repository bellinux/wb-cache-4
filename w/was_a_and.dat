[...] "Thin books, in themselves, at first, but many of them, and with deliciously smooth covers of bright red or green. What fat black letters to begin with! [...] "A was an archer, and shot at a frog." [...] Of course he was. He was an apple-pie also, and there he is!

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 14th century, {{the castle}} {{consisted}} of a square keep, three round corner towers and one flanking tower. All the elements are connected by curtain walls with a covered round walk, and crenelated at the top. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>and</b> protective broad, deep moat surrounding the base, as well as a single drawbridge, the location of which is still visible on the southern face. In the 15th century, the Saint-Leger family added, on the east, north and west of the interior courtyard, a succession of buildings with splendid oak woodwork, supporting the corbelling of the round walk which was covered with flat Burgundian tiles. At {{the end of the}} 19th century, alterations concealed certain aspects of the mediaeval structure. For example the moat was filled in, the drawbridge and the large, protective, courtyard doors were removed, and a neo-Gothic building with machicolation inside the courtyard {{at the foot of the}} keep was constructed.|$|E
50|$|In his {{research}} into the name-letter effect, Belgian experimental psychologist Jozef Nuttin created a yoked control design in which two subjects evaluated the same letters, separately. Some of the letters belonged to one subject’s name, {{and some of the}} letters belonged to the other subject’s name, while some were random. Crucially, in the experimental design subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name. In this design any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether the letter occurred in their name. For example, for the fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs the first stimulus <b>was</b> <b>A</b> <b>and</b> U: the last letter in Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. Both subjects had to circle the letter they preferred. The next stimulus was M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. This was repeated for the remaining letters of her first name, and subsequently the letters of her last name, also in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. Oral instructions were given to feel a preference as fast as possible, without thinking. If the yoked subjects shared a letter, choosing it did not contribute to the measurement. Nuttin found that people significantly liked name letters more than non-name letters, without realising it.|$|E

30|$|We sprayed giberic acid on the A clones on 19 and 27 July 2005 to {{facilitate}} flowering.

Thus, the seed parent <b>was</b> <b>A,</b> <b>and</b> the candidate pollen parents were A in selfing and B, C and D in outcrossing. In May 2006, we sown seeds extracted from the friuts in pots with expanded vermiculites and began to incubate them at 20 / 25 °C air temperature and 75 % relative humidity with 15 -h light duration. On 28 August 2006, we transplanted 204 seedlings (progeny) raised from the seeds to the experimental field at intervals of 0.5 m in seven rows separated by 1.5 m.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{intermetallic}} compounds was prepared with the TiAI 3 structure or related structures. The layers ofthe tri-aluminides formed in diffusion couples do not grow according to the parabolic law. Most ofthe diffusion-grown layers show a weak texture. Generally, a fibre texture parallel to the direction of diffusion, consisting of two components has been found together or separately in the same layer. In NbAI 3, VAI 3 and TaAl 3 the nature cif the texture <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>and</b> a fibre texture. In TiAI 3 layers a fibre texture has been found together with an exceptional component, a [001]-fibre texture, probably related {{to the formation of}} a superstructure. In HfAI 3 -!ayers grown on a Hf substrate with a sheet texture, the texture in the HfAl 3 -layer was not rotationally symmetric around the direction of diffusion, but a related sheet texture developed. In the case of textureless Hf substrates the HfAI 31 ayers exhibit a [001]-fan texture. In VNi 3 - layers no texture was produced...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} to determine salbutamol in human plasma and urine using {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) with a coulometric electrode array system, based on the electrochemical behavior of salbutamol at graphite electrode. The mobile phase component A is 30 mM sodium dihydroxy phosphate– 30 mM triethylamine and is adjusted to pH 6. 0 with 20 % phosphate acid. The mobile phase component B is methanol. The optimized mobile phase composition <b>was</b> <b>A</b> <b>and</b> B {{in the proportion of}} 90 : 10 (v/v). Paracetamol is selected as the external standard. The human plasma and urine samples are pretreated using solid-phase extraction cartridges (Sep-Pak Silica), and the eluting solution is monitored by the coulometric electrode array system. The electrode potentials are set at 300, 400, 550, and 650 mV, respectively. Calibration curves show good linearity, and the recovery of salbutamol proves to be constant and unaffected by the concentration of the drug. This method, developed using HPLC–electrochemical detection, is reproducible and sensitive enough for the determination of salbutamol in human plasma and urine...|$|E
