40|$|ABSTRACT: Soils at {{critical}} state {{are like a}} visco-plastic fluids, which will flow for applied stresses greater than the {{critical state}} (CS) shear strength. Shear viscosity is a key parameter to understand the post-failure flow response of soils in geotechnical applications such as landslides, jacked piles and cone penetrometers. Viscosity of soil has been investigated for <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> greater than the liquid limit because at these <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> standard viscometers can be used. However, soils can reach CS for <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> in the plastic range and thereafter exhibit viscous behavior without further changes in <b>water</b> <b>contents.</b> There is no standard method to determine shear viscosity of clays at <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> lower that the liquid limit. A new analytical method is proposed to determine the viscous drag (force) on the penetrating cone in a fall cone test. Based on this analysis, {{it is possible to}} interpret the shear viscosity of clays with <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> less than the liquid limit from a penetration test. Time-penetration data from a fall cone test was used to determine the shear viscosity of clays with liquidity index less than 1. 5. The test results show that the shear viscosity decreases exponentially with an increase in liquidity index. ...|$|R

40|$|In the literature, {{contrasting}} {{effects of}} plant species richness {{on the soil}} water balance are reported. Our objective {{was to assess the}} effects of plant species and functional richness and functional identity on soil <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> and <b>water</b> fluxes in the experimental grassland of the Jena Experiment. The Jena Experiment comprises 86 plots on which plant species richness (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 60) and functional group composition (zero to four functional groups: legumes, grasses, tall herbs, and small herbs) were manipulated in a factorial design. We recorded meteorological data and soil <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> of the 0 · 0 – 0 · 3 and 0 · 3 – 0 · 7 [*]m soil layers and calculated actual evapotranspiration (ETa), downward flux (DF), and capillary rise with a soil water balance model for the period 2003 – 2007. Missing <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> were estimated with a Bayesian hierarchical model. Species richness decreased <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> in subsoil during wet soil conditions. Presence of tall herbs increased soil <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> in topsoil during dry conditions and decreased soil <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> in subsoil during wet conditions. Presence of grasses generally decreased <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> in topsoil, particularly during dry phases; increased ETa and decreased DF from topsoil; and decreased ETa from subsoil. Presence of legumes, in contrast, decreased ETa and increased DF from topsoil and increased ETa from subsoil. Species richness probably resulted in complementary water use. Specific functional groups likely affected the water balance via specific root traits (e. g. shallow dense roots of grasses and deep taproots of tall herbs) or specific shading intensity caused by functional group effects on vegetation cover.

40|$|The thermal conductivities of {{powdered}} and granular bentonite based needle punched geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) were investigated at different gravimetric <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> under 25, 50, 75, and 100 kPa vertical stresses. Both types of GCLs exhibited {{an increase in}} thermal conductivity with increasing vertical stress at all <b>water</b> <b>contents.</b> The effect of vertical stresses was more pronounced for the specimens hydrated at lower gravimetric <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> and this was attributed to their high initial volumetric air content. The variability of water distribution in partially hydrated GCLs {{has been identified as}} a factor that may affect their thermal conductivity. The forms of bentonites (i. e., powder or granular) affected their thermal conductivities; however, this effect was less apparent at higher gravimetric <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> due to the reduced air content and gel formation in the bentonites. Finally, the GCL thermal conductivity calculated from the measured thermal conductivities of its various constituents (i. e geotextile and bentonite) components differed from the measured values.

It was revealed that the nanostructure of the PEM was changed greatly with increasing the concentration of ferric ions. The diffusion coefficient of hydronium ions increases larger at higher <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> with increasing the concentration of ferric ions because of the lower concentration of cations. At higher <b>water</b> <b>contents,</b> the hydronium diffusion coefficient increases largely because ferric ions reduce the electrostatic interactions between hydronium ions and sulfonate groups.

40|$|A microwave-based, profile-type {{precipitation}} retrieval algorithm {{has been}} used to analyze high-resolution passsive microwave measurements over an ocean background, obtained by the Advanced Microwave Precipitation Radiometer (AMPR) flown on a NASA ER- 2 aircraft. The analysis is designed to first determine the improvements that can be gained by adding brightness temperature information from the AMPR low-frequency channel (10. 7 GHz) to a multispectral retrieval algorithm nominally run with satellite information at 19, 37, and 85 GHz. The impact of spatial resolution degradation of the high-resolution brightness temperature information on the retrieved rain/cloud liquid <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> and ice <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> is then quantified in order to assess the possible biases inherent to satellite-based retrieval. Careful inspection of the high-resolution aircraft dataset reveals five distinctive brightness temperature features associated with cloud structure and scattering effects that are not generally detectable in current passive microwave satellite measurements. Results suggest that the inclusion of 10. 7 -GHz information overcomes two basic problems associated with three-channel retrieval. Intercomparisons of retrievals carried out at high-resolution and then averaged to a characteristic satellite scale to the corresponding retrievals in which the brightness temperatures are first convolved down to the satellite scale suggest that with the addition of the 10. 7 -GHz channel, the rain liquid <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> will not be negatively impacted by special resolution degradation. That is not the case with the ice <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> as they appear ti be quite sensitive to the imposed scale, the implication being that as spatial resolution is reduced, ice <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> will become increasingly underestimated...|$|R

40|$|Advisors: James A. Walker. Committee members: Justin P. Dodd; Mark R. Frank. Pacaya Volcano is {{an active}} {{composite}} volcano located in southern Guatemala, about 30 km from the nation's capital, Guatemala City. This volcano has variable eruptive styles ranging from non-explosive to moderately explosive. Volcanic rocks from Pacaya are mostly basaltic to basaltic andesite and tend to be porphyritic, containing approximately 25 - 35 % crystals, dominantly plagioclase. Previous data from olivine-hosted melt inclusions in Pacaya's tephras suggest relatively low magmatic <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> for a subduction zone volcano, particularly compared to neighboring composite volcanoes along the Central American Volcanic Arc. The goal {{of this research was}} to use plagioclase phenocrysts in basaltic andesite lavas from Pacaya as a secondary method to verify the unusually low magmatic <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> reported previously. <b>Water</b> <b>contents</b> were estimated using a plagioclase-liquid hygrometer.

A population of main-belt comets discovered in 2006 has been also suggested as a possible source for Earth's water. In contrast, comets from the Kuiper belt or farther regions delivered not more than about 6% of Earth's water.
