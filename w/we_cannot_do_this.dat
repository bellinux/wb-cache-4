The trust confided to you will be one of watchfulness and labor; but we hope the glory of having contributed to the overthrow of the corrupt powers that now control our beloved country will be a sufficient reward for the time and labor you will devote to it. Our Whig brethren throughout the Union have met in convention, and after due deliberation and mutual concessions have elected candidates for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency not only worthy of our cause, but worthy of the support of every true patriot who would have our country redeemed, and her institutions honestly and faithfully administered. To overthrow the trained bands that are opposed to us whose salaried officers are ever on the watch, and whose misguided followers are ever ready to obey their smallest commands, every Whig must not only know his duty, but must firmly resolve, whatever of time and labor it may cost, boldly and faithfully to do it. Our intention is to organize the whole State, so that every Whig can be brought to the polls in the coming Presidential contest. <b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> however, without your co-operation; and as we do our duty, so we shall expect you to do yours.

(I pray the reader to observe that I have not made the smallest change, except this necessary expression of a reduction in diameter, in Fig. II. as it is applied in Fig. X., only I have not drawn the joints of the stones because these would confuse the outlines of the bases; and I have not represented the rounding of the shafts, because it does not bear at present on the argument.)

Thus the first objective {{of this paper is to}} improve existing nomenclature-based indexes of diversification in two ways: first, we identify functional businesses (whose presence in firms does not strictly correspond to diversification) and remove them from diversification indexes. Second, we incorporate a measure of product heterogeneity into our index of diversification in the following way: the more atypical the portfolio of businesses of a given firm is relatively to other firms in our database, the more diversified it is. Functional businesses being removed, firms on French territory are not very diversified and this low average level of diversification did not change significantly between 1993 and 2000, as some firms diversified whereas others got more focused. The weight of functional businesses in multiple-output production has grown during the nineties, all the more as firms became more diversified and/or more international.

60|$|And first, of the {{expression}} of supernatural influence on forms actually human, as of sibyl or prophet. It is evident that not only here is it unnecessary, {{but we are not}} altogether at liberty to trust for expression to the utmost ennobling of the human form: for <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>do</b> more than <b>this,</b> when that form is to be the actual representation, and not the recipient of divine presence. Hence, in order to retain the actual humanity definitely, we must leave upon it such signs of the operation of sin and the liability to death as are consistent with human ideality, and often more than these, definite signs of immediate and active evil, when the prophetic spirit is to be expressed in men such as were Saul and Balaam; neither may we ever, with just discrimination, touch the utmost limits of beauty in human form when inspiration is to be expressed, and not angelic or divine being; of which reserve and subjection the most instructive instances are found in the works of Angelico, who invariably uses inferior types for the features of humanity, even glorified, (excepting always the Madonna,) nor ever exerts his full power of beauty either in feature or expression, except in angels or in the Madonna or in Christ. Now {{the expression}} of spiritual influence without supreme elevation of the bodily type we have seen to be a work of imagination penetrative, and we found it accomplished by Michael Angelo; but I think by him only. I am aware of no one else who, to my mind, has expressed the inspiration of prophet or sibyl; this, however, I affirm not, but shall leave to the determination of the reader, as the principles at present to be noted refer entirely to that elevation of the creature form necessary when it is actually representative of a spiritual being.|$|R
40|$|Constant-work-space {{algorithms}} may {{use only}} constantly many cells of storage {{in addition to}} their input, which is provided as a read-only array. We show how to construct several geometric structures efficiently in the constant-work-space model. Traditional algorithms process the input into a suitable data structure (like a doubly-connected edge list) that allows efficient traversal of the structure at hand. In the constant-work-space setting, however, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> afford to <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> Instead, we provide operations that compute the desired features on the fly by accessing the input with no extra space. The whole geometric structure can be obtained by using these operations to enumerate all the features. Of course, we must pay for the space savings by slower running times. While the standard data structure allows us to implement traversal operations in constant time, our schemes typically take linear time to read the input data in each step. We begin with two simple problems: triangulating a planar point set and finding the trapezoidal decomposition of a simple polygon. In both cases adjacent features can be enumerated in linear time per step, resulting in total quadratic running time to output the whole structure. Actually, we show that the former result carries over to the Delaunay triangulation, and hence the Voronoi diagram. This also means that we can compute the largest empty circle of a planar point set in quadratic time and constant work-space. As another application, we demonstrate how to enumerate the features of an Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST) in quadratic time per step, so that the whole EMST can be found in cubic time using constant work-space. Finally, we describe how to compute a shortest geodesic path between two points in a simple polygon. Although the shortest path problem in general graphs is NL-complete (Jakoby and Tantau 2003), this constrained problem can be solved in quadratic time using only constant work-space. </p...|$|R
40|$|We use complex {{network theory}} {{to study the}} {{differences}} between the friendship concepts in elementary school and university students. Four friendship networks were identified from surveys. Three of these networks are from elementary schools; two are located in the rural area of Yucatán and the other is in the urban area of Mérida, Yucatán. We analyzed the structure and the communities of these friendship networks and found significant differences among those at the elementary schools compared with those at the university. In elementary schools, the students make friends mainly in the same classroom, but there are also links among different classrooms {{because of the presence of}} siblings and relatives in the schools. These kinds of links (sibling-friend or relative-friend) are called, in this work, "mixed links". The classification of the communities is based on their similarity with the classroom composition. If the community is composed principally of students in different classrooms, the community is classified as heterogeneous. These kinds of communities appear in the elementary school friendship networks mainly because of the presence of relatives and siblings. Once the links between siblings and relatives are removed, the communities resembled the classroom composition. On the other hand, the university students are more selective in choosing friends and therefore, even when they have friends in the same classroom, those communities are quite different to the classroom composition. Also, in the university network, we found heterogeneous communities even when the presence of sibling and relatives is negligible. These differences made up a topological structure quite different at different academic levels. We also found differences in the network characteristics. Once these differences are understood, the topological structure of the friendship network and the communities shaped in an elementary school could be predicted if we know the total number of students and the ties between siblings and relatives. However, at the university, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>do</b> the same. <b>This</b> discovery implies that friendship is a dynamic concept that produces several changes in the friendship network structure and the way that people make groups of friends; it provides the opportunity to give analytic support to observational studies.

At the university, many communities formed by students of the same gender were also found...|$|R

The result of this has been to alter the whole of the balance of naval strength in home waters. Formerly we were prepared to abandon the Eastern Mediterranean and dispatch a fleet to the Far East, relying on the French fleet in the Western Mediterranean to contain the Italian fleet. Now if we move the Mediterranean fleet to the Far East there is nothing to contain the Italian fleet, which will be free to operate in the Atlantic or reinforce the German fleet in home waters, using bases in north-west France.

Firstly, the letter from Richard Harbron poses the question; is radiobiology the forgotten science? He raises valid points about a failure to acknowledge the science of radiobiology and as a consequence its evidence base. Could it be however that we are witnessing the consequences of a general dumbing down of science education in general? While <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>do</b> much about <b>this,</b> the place of science education in radiography has to be paramount. An integrated approach to teaching where sciences are taught together with examination and treatment techniques rather than entities in their own right may be good in principle but does it detract from the importance of science? It???s not enough, for example, to say that some students find physics ???hard??? and it is more meaningful to integrate aspects of teaching if one of the outcomes is a diminished understanding of scientific principles that underpin radiography. It is the students who should be able to integrate the parts to make the whole otherwise we are in danger of promoting training at the expense of education. Without a sound science base we should not be surprised if some are prepared to accept a non-evidential practice base as Harbron points out. The easier path will not be to challenge practices but continue to use the impoverished approach of ???that is the way things have always been done???; hardly an approach to inspire confidence. While Harbron may be correct in his assumption that radiobiology is the forgotten science the more worrying danger is that some will never have the opportunity to grasp important principles in the first place. If radiobiology is not the most important topic it is certainly not the least important either...|$|R

6000|$|... § 12. <b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> {{more simply}} <b>do</b> <b>this</b> than by {{considering}} the proper collocation of the substantive and adjective. Is it better to place the adjective before the substantive, or the substantive before the adjective? Ought we to say with the French--un cheval noir; or to say as we do--a black horse? Probably, most persons of culture would decide that one order {{is as good as}} the other. Alive to the bias produced by habit, they would ascribe to that the preference they feel for our own form of expression. They would expect those educated {{in the use of the}} opposite form to have an equal preference for that. And thus they would conclude that neither of these instinctive judgments is of any worth. There is, however, a philosophical ground for deciding in favour of the English custom. If [...] "a horse black" [...] be the arrangement, immediately on the utterance of the word [...] "horse," [...] there arises, or tends to arise, in the mind, a picture answering to that word; and as there has, been nothing to indicate what kind of horse, any image of a horse suggests itself. Very likely, however, the image will be that of a brown horse, brown horses being the most familiar. The result is that when the word [...] "black" [...] is added, a check is given to the process of thought. Either the picture of a brown horse already present to the imagination has to be suppressed, and the picture of a black one summoned in its place; or else, if the picture of a brown horse be yet unformed, the tendency to form it has to be stopped. Whichever is the case, a certain amount of hindrance results. But if, on the other hand, [...] "a black horse" [...] be the expression used, no such mistake can be made. The word [...] "black," [...] indicating an abstract quality, arouses no definite idea. It simply prepares the mind for conceiving some object of that colour; and the attention is kept suspended until that object is known. If, then, by the precedence of the adjective, the idea is conveyed without liability to error, whereas the precedence of the substantive is apt to produce a misconception, it follows that the one gives the mind less trouble than the other, and is therefore more forcible.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} many weak moment asymptotics {{under the}} possibility of similar moments. The possibility of highly related moments arise when {{there are many of}} them. Knight and Fu (2000), designates the issue of similar regressors as the “nearly singular ” design in the least squares case. We consider specifically Jackknife Continuous Updating Estimator (JCUE) which is equivalent to Continuous Updating Estimator (CUE). In the nearly singular design, the sample variance converges to a singular limit term. However Knight and Fu (2000) assume that, on the nullspace of the limit term, the difference between the sample variance and the singular matrix converges in probability to a positive definite matrix when multiplied by an appropriate rate. We show that the nearly singular design affects the limit of the many weak moment asymptotics that is introduced by Newey and Windmeijer (2007). Even though, the estimator is still consistent, there is a different variance term in the asymptotically normal limit compared with Newey and Windmeijer (2007) case. This difference stems from the limit of the second order partial derivative of the objective function. In Newey and Windmeijer (2007), this limit converges to a “signal ” term. The bias term is zero since they are able to replace the sample variance with its limit counterpart. <b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> because of the nearly singular design, hence our limit involves the additional “bias ” term.

40|$|One {{important}} tool for forecasting {{in the field}} of applied economics has been largely overlooked—the identification and analysis of patterns of industrial behavior. The following paper shows how the method of detecting behavior patterns, and the factors which control them, can be utilized for analyzing the past economic performance of an industry and for predicting its likely performance in the future. This analysis has also revealed that when controlled by the same factors, different industries follow the same behavior pattern. This being so, it becomes possible to group industries together and reclassify them {{on the basis of their}} common major business characteristics. Of these, one of the most important is their mode of competition. This reclassification also enables us to know when we can transfer experience between industries (within the same group) and when <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> (between industries in different groups). At the present time, significant changes are occurring in the economic, organizational and technical climates. New economic goals appear necessary for Canada and these are suggested. These changes are altering the importance of the factors controlling industrial behavior. The nature of these changes is considered and applied to the case of the chemical industry in the next decade. The analysis suggests what new factors will control this industry, and the direction and nature of the likely changes in it. Given this, an estimate of the economic changes can be made. Analysis of behavior patterns is, therefore, a powerful and essential tool for estimating the future behavior of industries, and of groups of industries, in the economy...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} before Australia {{jumps into the}} golden age of gas as a way of combating climate change, it is {{essential}} to have a good understanding of the effect that this will have on emissions, which requires measuring the fugitive emissions that occur in the coal seam gas extraction process. With increasing awareness of the dangers of climate change, the world is hunting for other forms of power generation that produce lower emissions of greenhouse gas. While gas is not a zero emissions energy source, it has come to be seen by some as a 2 ̆ 7 bridging fuel 2 ̆ 7. In Australia an increasingly important source of gas has {{come in the form of}} coal seam gas (CSG). While a number of concerns have been raised about the environmental impacts of CSG, including the process of fracking, in Australia most of these concerns centre on water. These include contamination of ground water, disposal of produced water, reduced availability of water for other consumers and the creation of hazardous waste resulting from either treatment of produced water or drilling mud. There is also concern about the chemical cocktail that can be used in the fracking process. Most of the difficulties in confronting these concerns come from the lack of information that is available on the broader effects of CSG extraction. Very little measurement and research has been done in this area. While concerns about the effects of CSG on Australia 2 ̆ 7 s water supply are widespread in the community, the focus of this paper is on fugitive emissions produced during the CSG extraction process. Fugitive emissions occur when methane leaks during the extraction, processing and transportation of CSG. Leaking at the wellhead during extraction is the most significant source of fugitive emissions and is also the source for which the least amount of measurement has been done. The current default measurement technique for fugitive emissions at the wellhead is the same as that used for conventional natural gas, despite the fact that there is evidence to suggest that fugitive emissions from the extraction of CSG are significantly higher. While conventional natural gas, particularly offshore production, comes from large reservoirs and so has only a relatively small number of wellheads which are very large and closely monitored, CSG is extracted from many small reservoirs. This means that for any given quantity of gas there are many small wellheads, rather than a few large ones. It also means that each of the wellheads is monitored less closely. For every tonne of natural gas produced from CSG, there is potential for more leakage to occur from the wellhead when compared with each tonne of gas produced from a conventional natural gas well. Another reason why fugitive emissions from CSG would be expected to be significantly higher than conventional gas during extraction is that the amount of emissions that leak from the wellhead increases when fracking is used. Unlike conventional gas, fracking is likely to be used on 25 to 40 per cent of Australian CSG wells. The size of the underestimate in CSG fugitive emissions could be substantial. If we use the new United States Environmental Protection Agency estimate for fugitive emissions and apply it to a conservative estimate of Australian CSG production over the next three years then total fugitive emissions are expected to be 125 million tonnes of CO 2 e. This is twice the emissions that would be estimated if the current default factor is used. This is an underestimate of 62 million tonnes of CO 2 e over three years. The consequences of underestimating fugitive emissions from CSG are two-fold: it blunts the efficacy of the recently introduced carbon price, as firms will not be paying the tax on all of their emissions; it also prevents us from correctly calculating Australia 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to climate change. This underestimate may be inadvertently making it harder for the world to limit the warming effect of climate change below the environmental tipping point of two degrees. Under the carbon price, the underestimate also has a flow-on effect in terms of the size of the effective subsidy the government is giving to CSG companies. An extra 62 million tonnes of CO 2 e over three years is equivalent to giving CSG companies more than 1. 5 billion. This figure is likely to be an underestimate; the actual size of the subsidy is likely to be far higher. Before we jump into {{the golden age of}} gas as a way of combating climate change, it is essential that we have a good understanding of the effect that switching from coal to gas will have on our emissions. <b>We</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> until we can measure the fugitive emissions that occur in the coal seam gas extraction process. The solution is to undertake better measurement of fugitive emissions, particularly at the CSG wellhead. With better information from more accurate measurement, we can more accurately calculate fugitive emissions and therefore better measure the impact that CSG extraction is having on Australia 2 ̆ 7 s greenhouse gas emissions. Before the government approves more CSG production it would be prudent to allocate funding from the 200 million it has put aside from the Minerals Resource Rent Tax for scientific research on the effects of CSG extraction towards measuring fugitive emissions...|$|E
