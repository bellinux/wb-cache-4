To support health {{monitoring}} and life-long capability management for self-sustaining manufacturing systems, next generation machine components {{are expected to}} embed sensory capabilities combined with advanced ICT. The combination of sensory capabilities {{and the use of}} Object-Oriented Bayesian Networks (OOBNs) supports self-diagnosis at the component level enabling them to become self-aware and support self-healing production systems. This paper describes the use of a modular component-based modelling approach enabled by the use of OOBNs for health monitoring and root-cause analysis of manufacturing systems using a <b>welding</b> <b>controller</b> produced by Harms & Wende (HWH) as an example. The model is integrated into the control software of the <b>welding</b> <b>controller</b> and deployed as a SelComp using the SelSus Architecture for diagnosis and predictive maintenance. The SelComp provides diagnosis and condition monitoring capabilities at the component level while the SelSus Architecture provides these capabilities at a wider system level.

One {{of the most important}} module of the welding current waveform generator module, the welding waveform parameters are automatically generated by two way, one is the welding methods, the other is the welding parameters, then judge the input signal of the welding gun, when the gun is pressed, the corresponding waveform output; the welding current waveform output can be achieved using this software, is displayed on the welding current waveform generator...|$|E
40|$|Enhanced {{control of}} the {{short-circuit}} {{gas metal arc welding}} (GMAW) process can be achieved through the use of an advanced power source applying a controlled current waveform. By using a current waveform whose period is adapted to suit the requirements of the process, excellent welding performance can be achieved. When the current waveform is of fixed peak amplitude and shape, the control can be considered to be open-loop, as there is no active attempt to regulate a specific process parameter such as arc length, fusion area or dipping frequency. There is scope for more sophisticated {{control of the}} process. Using a typical open loop control strategy as a benchmark, an alternative closed loop control is evaluated here. The technique regulates the size of the droplet formed {{on the end of the}} electrode on a cycle-by-cycle basis. The instantaneous melting rate is modelled in a real-time <b>welding</b> <b>controller,</b> and the current waveform is adapted to achieve the desired droplet size, as determined from the time integral of the instantaneous melting rate...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{recommends}} a China business and equipment {{strategy for the}} Controls Conveyor Robotics Welding (CCRW) group at General Motors. The current strategy is to use globally common equipment through predetermined global suppliers. The GM facilities in China, which are jointly owned with non-GM entities, believe that a local sourcing strategy would reduce lead times, transportation costs and increase the level of nearby service and support. These factors are catalyst for GM to reevaluate the current global common strategy. This thesis will {{provide an overview of}} the CCRW organization and discuss how the sourcing strategy has evolved through globalization. Due to the large variety of production tooling, this thesis will narrow the focus to two case studies: the first being a Main Control Panel (MCP) and the second being a <b>weld</b> <b>controller.</b> These case studies are used as a method to determine {{the pros and cons of}} the current sourcing strategy, where the MCP is a highly integrated design maintained by CCRW HQ and the <b>weld</b> <b>controller</b> is a "blackbox" which CCRW defines the functional specifications and procures "off the shelf' from a predetermined global supplier. Through local China visits, literature review and preliminary cost assessments, it was determined that while local sourcing may be a viable option for both the MCP and <b>weld</b> <b>controller,</b> there is not enough determinate information to commit to a sourcing change in the case of the Main Control Panel. From onsite visits to potential MCP option suppliers in China, it appears that likely "local" arrangements exists, however, further company analysis and validation will need to be conducted to adopt the change. (cont.) As for the <b>weld</b> <b>controller,</b> the local product variation with the current global supplier (based locally) is recommended and was validated by CCRW weld engineers by the completion of this internship. I The term "Local" will be used throughout this thesis to refer to "China," meaning solutions that are derived from internal to China. by Natalie Chouinard. Thesis (S. M.)

During the first pulse, the electrode contact {{may not be able to}} make a good weld. The first pulse will soften the metal. During the pause between the two pulses, the electrodes will come closer and make better contact.|$|R
40|$|Modern <b>weld</b> <b>controllers</b> {{typically}} use {{current to}} control the weld process. SRS uses a legacy voltage control method. This task was undertaken {{to determine if the}} improvements in the weld control equipment could be implemented to provide improvements to the process control. The constant current mode of operation will reduce weld variability by about a factor of 4. The constant voltage welds were slightly hotter than the constant current welds of the same nominal current. The control mode did not appear to adversely affect the weld quality, but appropriate current ranges need to be established and a qualification methodology for both welding and shunt calibrations needs to be developed and documented...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to design a control architecture for control of the Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) process, and implement it in a prototype <b>welding</b> <b>controller,</b> to be delivered to NASA {{at the end of the}} research period. Specifically, some common problems, or potential problems, of the GTAW process were discussed with NASA and Rocketdyne personnel at the outset of the work, and the focus of the controller design was set on these specific items. The key issues addressed in the design of the delivered controller were: (i) enhanced control of the GTAW equipment parameters, and (ii) enhanced control of the Automatic Voltage Control (AVC) subsystem. These objectives were selected and approached with the welding tasks on the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) in mind. Fur-thermore, all work and equipment selection was tailored to be adaptable to Variable Polarity Plasma Arc Welding (VPPAW) control at a later time, if desired. The research consisted of (i) review and study of existing approaches to en-hanced arc welding control, (ii) research and conduction of experiments to examine the feasibility of possible solutions, and (iii) design and implementation of the selected techniques. Extensive research of existing methods for arc welding modeling and control was carried out, and some of the key findings are discussed in this report. Numer-ous simulations and experiments were carried out to determine which techniques were viable and which should be rejected in the final implementation. Selection of equipment and software items turned out to be less trivial than anticipated. A computer architecture based on the VME-bus, but using the Intel 80286 and 80386 processors, was finally selected. This approach combines the ro-bustness of the industrial VME-bus and the software sophistication, economics, and availability of the MS-DOS/WINDOWS environment. The main objective of the work, the design of a control system and its implementation in a process control computer, has been accomplished...|$|E
40|$|In-process {{ultrasonic}} sensing of welding allows {{detection of}} weld defects in real time. A noncontacting ultrasonic system {{is being developed}} to operate in a production environment. The principal components are a pulsed laser for ultrasound generation, an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) for ultrasound reception, and a PC-based data acquisition system which determine {{the quality of the}} weld on a pass-by-pass basis. The laser/EMAT system interrogates the area in the weld volume where defects are most likely to occur [5]. This area of interest is identified by computer calculations on a pass-by-pass basis using weld planning information provided by the off-line programmer. The absence of a signal above the threshold level in the computer-calculated time interval indicates a disruption of the sound path by a defect. The ultrasonic sensor system then provides an input signal to the <b>weld</b> <b>controller</b> about the defect condition...|$|R
40|$|The current {{development}} effort is a Phase 3 research study entitled "A Production Ready Automated Wire Delivery System", contract number NAS 8 - 39933, awarded to Nichols Research Corporation (NRC). The goals {{of this research}} study were to production harden the existing Automated Wire Delivery (AWDS) motion and sensor hardware and test the modified AWDS {{in a range of}} welding applications. In addition, the prototype AWDS controller would be moved to the VME bus platform by designing, fabricating and testing a single board VME bus AWDS controller. This effort was to provide an AWDS that could transition from the laboratory environment to production operations. The project was performed in two development steps. Step 1 modified and tested an improved MWG. Step 2 developed and tested the AWDS single board VME bus controller.

40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) has a 40 -plus year {{history of}} {{producing}} and processing tritium primarily {{for use in}} nuclear weapons. This gas is stored at high pressures in reservoirs that are manufactured and sealed {{through the use of}} special resistance welding processes. There is an interest in maintaining the quality and consistency of these welds to avoid leaks in the reservoirs. The reasons for this are the limited supply and high cost of producing tritium, the necessity of assuring nuclear safety and to promote weapon system reliability. Precisely machined 304 -L and 316 stainless steel components are the materials used in the fabrication of the reservoir. This presentation will include a survey of sensors for use in resistance welding processes. The results of the application of the analog laser position sensor will be presented along with data indicating how the displacement parameter defines the weld process.

40|$|The {{invention}} is a Weld Analysis and Control System {{developed for}} active weld system control through real time weld data acquisition. Closed-loop control {{is based on}} analysis of weld system parameters and weld geometry. The system is adapted for use with automated welding apparatus having a <b>weld</b> <b>controller</b> which is capable of active electronic control of all aspects of a welding operation. Enhanced graphics and data displays are provided for post-weld analysis. The system provides parameter acquisition, including seam location which is acquired for active torch cross-seam positioning. Torch stand-off is also monitored for control. Weld bead and parent surface geometrical parameters are acquired {{as an indication of}} weld quality. These parameters include mismatch, peaking, undercut, underfill, crown height, weld width, puddle diameter, and other measurable information about the weld puddle regions, such as puddle symmetry, etc. These parameters provide a basis for active control as well as post-weld quality analysis and verification.

40|$|Discrete part {{manufacturers}} using robotic {{arc welding}} cells often have several more geographically distributed plants than welding experts. This ratio {{often leads to}} costly downtimes due to both logistic and communication deficiencies between weld engineers and the production site. The ability for engineers to remotely access welding cells from their home office to {{anywhere in the world}} can yield several benefits. These include quicker response time to problems, improved weld quality, increased production line reliability, and reduced travel time for weld engineers. We describe the NIST testbed technology and infrastructure for remote manufacturing that has been applied and demonstrated on a robotic welding cell where valuable process data can be made available to remotely located engineers in real-time or near real-time. Remote access to cell information is made possible by open-architecture interfaces that tie the robot <b>controller,</b> <b>weld</b> <b>controller,</b> and cell <b>controller</b> together. The <b>welding</b> cell allows remote access through the internet via: an audio/video system for communicating with the operator, a pan/tilt/zoom camera inside the welding cell for viewing the cell in operation and inspecting parts after a weld, a real-time display for welding process data, a web-based graphic simulation of the robot arm driven by real-time motion commands, and an intelligent monitoring system with an internet accessible welding database. The cell incorporates multiple weld monitoring systems with data logging capability to capture process variables during a weld.

40|$|The goal of {{the project}} is to {{evaluate}} a new setup for the company Iberobot Svenska AB, using HMI and PLC, for resistance spot <b>welding</b> equipment <b>controller.</b> The purpose of the controller is to control the weld process; weld power and time. One of the question raised is if this setup {{could be used as}} an RWE controller and thereby be able to re-place an old proprietary controller called TEC 6000. A prototype is built compatible with current single phase RWE and literature study is conducted to answer this question.   The new setup is based on Beijer iX T 7 B Softmotion which includes an HMI and a PLC with EtherCAT support. EtherCAT input and output modules from Beckhoff are chosen because they can handle the speed required by the <b>weld</b> process. The <b>controller</b> is implemented using theory for RMS value, timing diagram and state diagram based on weld process. The prototype is revised three times. A zero crossing detector is implemented. A control element driver using opto-triac is implemented.

40|$|In this work, {{ultrasound}} {{is used as}} a non-destructive {{method of}} monitoring the welding process in real-time to detect expulsion events. During spot welding, a single element ultrasound transducer placed behind one of the welding electrodes operates in pulse-echo mode and probes the axial center of the welded zone. Acoustic reflections from the electrodes, plate interfaces and liquid metal weld nugget are recorded as A-scans. During welding, the A-Scan reflections change with time, since the material properties of steel (e. g. density and elasticity) change with temperature. Imaging successive A-scans in time forms an M-Scan image of the welding process from which the dynamic formation of the spot weld can be depicted and analyzed. This thesis focuses on taking a brand new approach to the problem of expulsion detection by identifying and characterizing expulsion events in M-scan data. Expulsion occurs when molten material is ejected from the welded zone as a result of overheating due to: poor electrical/thermal contact, coating thickness and/or excessive weld current. An expulsion can {{have a significant impact on}} the final yield strength of the weld, and thus the detection and characterization of expulsion events is significant to the quality assurance of resulting spot welds. The main contribution of this work was the discovery of M-scan features that provide a means of detecting, predicting and classifying the event. These include: 1) Detection by sudden phase delay change of the workpiece surface reflection. 2) Prediction by ultrasonically measuring the heating rate prior to expulsion. 3) Classification of the weld quality by ultrasonically measuring indentation in the heated workpiece. In addition, new methods for automatically detecting and measuring these features were developed that utilize a new efficient Hough transform variant proposed in this work. It was shown using both lab experiments and industrial data that not only does the automatic detection of these features provide a new and robust means of identifying expulsions in a wide range of welding setups, but this research can also be used in the future to provide real-time feedback to dynamic <b>weld</b> <b>controllers</b> and eliminate expulsions from occurring altogether...|$|R
40|$|Welding robots {{that use}} sensors to {{compensate}} for variations in their environment pose new requirements for programming systems and for controller architectures. Tracking sensors must be programmed with the geometry of the welds and the motions of the robot. The process monitoring system must be programmed with the required process tolerances {{and the type of}} <b>weld.</b> Finally, the <b>controller</b> must be programmed with the motion parameters, velocity and end-pose. Task planning for welding applications is the specification of the geometrical and the technological parameters that are necessary to the above subsystems. The architecture of the controller also must be process-related to allow the flow of planning information to the different subsystems and the necessary feedback to the planning level. Data from the sensors must be used with path data, process information and the geometry of the welds to adjust the process in real time.

30|$|In this paper, the {{efficiency}} of fractional models for thermal systems modeling is demonstrated through an application to transistor junction temperature estimation. Two fractional models are indeed used to represent the dynamic evolution of the junction temperature and of the dissipator temperature on which the transistor is mounted. These two models are then used to estimate a transistor junction temperature. Such a temperature diagnostic is really important on power electronic devices to optimize the heat management of IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor). This estimator provides information about junction temperature using a dynamic output feedback-based observer, with only {{a measure of the}} dissipator temperature. This limited number of required measures and the simple heat transfer fractional models obtained permit a simple and online implementation of the estimator. The estimator has been implemented and produces very accurate junction temperature estimation. Such an estimator should thus be used to monitor electronic systems such as motor <b>controller,</b> <b>welding,</b> DC/DC and AC/DC converters and to prevent damages in electronic systems on which the considered transistors (or similar components) are used.|$|R
40|$|Today {{spot welding}} {{is still the}} most applied joining {{technique}} in the automotive industry. But new developed materials require the adaption and enhancement of this technology for a robust joining process. Investigations were focused on weld-ability of high- and ultra high strength steels like HT 700 T (TRIP steel) or 22 MnB 5 (press hardening steel) by using a servo-mechanical drive for electrode force as well as power control instead of conventional <b>welding</b> current <b>controller.</b> The results of the experiments showed that the TRIP-steel as well as the press hardening steel can be safely welded with an electrode force of more than 5 kN and an welding current of about 8 kA. Best results were achieved with a process control using multiple current impulses. By using an after-heat impulse hardness of spot welds is decreased and the failure mode of the specimen during the chisel test could be improved. The course of hardness across the spot weld lens as well as inside of the base material is already on a high level but drops significantly steep inside of heat affected zone (HAZ). The advantage of the servo mechanical electrode drive is the backlash-free threaded spindle which leads to an increase of electrode force because of the thermal expansion of material during heating up to melting temperature. This effect improves the weldability of 22 MnB 5 and leads to an increase in tool-life time of the spot welding electrodes. The use of process control with controlled welding power in conjunction with a multi impulse process have favorable effects on the results of the tensile tests and ensures a robust welding process. It could be proven that, if the appropriate welding parameters are chosen, joining of HT 700 T as well as 22 MnB 5 by resistance spot welding is possible where the welded connections fulfill the requirements of quality in respect of lens diameter, connection strength and failure mode...|$|R
40|$|The Space Launch Initiative Program (SLI) in {{conjunction}} with the National Center for Advanced Manufacturing (NCAM) will demonstrate the ability to produce large-scale complex curvature hardware using the self-reacting friction stir welding process. This multi-phased risk reduction program includes friction stir welding process development and manufacture of a 22 -ft diameter quarter dome using a conventional tooling approach; it culminates in a 27. 5 -ft diameter quarter dome demonstration performed on a 5 -axis Universal Weld System. The design, fabrication, and installation of the Universal Weld System is made possible through a collaboration between the State of Louisiana, NASA, and the University of New Orleans. The Universal Weld System, manufactured by MTS Systems Corporation, will be installed at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and will be capable of manufacturing domes up to 30 ft in diameter. All welding will be accomplished using the Adaptable Adjustable Pin Tool (AdAPT) <b>weld</b> head and <b>controller</b> manufactured by MTS. Weld parameters will be developed for an aluminum alloy in gauges ranging from 0. 320 to 0. 400 in. thick. Weld quality will be verified through radiography, mechanical property testing at ambient and LN 2 temperatures, and metallurgical analysis. The AdAPT weld head will then be mounted on a 22 -ft diameter dome tool, which will be modified to include a welding track and drive system for moving the AdAPT weld head along the weld joint. This tool will then be used to manufacture a 22 -ft diameter dome of an aluminum alloy, with 0. 320 -in. constant thickness joints, consisting of three individual gore panels. Finally, the 27. 5 -ft diameter quarter dome will be welded on the Universal Weld System. The quarter dome will consist of three individual gore panels with weld lands tapering from 0. 320 to 0. 360 in. in thickness. With the demonstration of these welds, the ability to manufacture large diameter domes using the friction stir weld process {{in conjunction}} with a universal weld system provides a low risk approach to the fabrication of aluminum tanks for future launch vehicle applications...|$|R

Diplomska naloga obravnava nadzor in optimizacijo porabe električne energije varilne naprave, robota in mize – treh največjih porabnikov robotske varilne celice. V prvem delu so predstavljeni njeni porabniki: glavna stikalna omara, robotski krmilnik, robotski {{manipulator}}, miza ali pozicioner, vpenjalno-pozicionirno orodje, varilni sistem, čistilnik, dvoročni samostoječi pult in komandna plošča. Robotski krmilnik vodi mnogokratne naloge z možnostjo vodenja do osem robotov. V glavni stikalni omari se nahajajo vsi napajalni gradniki celice. Gibljivi strojni del celice sta robotski manipulator in miza z vpenjalno-pozicionirnim orodjem. Varilni sistem sestavljajo varilni izvor, povezni paket in varilna pištola. Čistilnik skrbi za čiščenje šobe varilne pištole. Dvoročni samostoječi pult in komandna plošča, na kateri so vsa glavna stikala, se uporabljata za upravljanje celice. Z meritvami parametrov robota, mize in varilne naprave smo izdelali dve preglednici nadzora porabe električne energije in dve predlogi HMI (human-machine interface). V njih se podatki sami preračunajo do porabe električne energije v kilovatnih urah in stroškov porabe v evrih za en, sto tisoč ter tri milijone zvarjenih kosov. V primerjavi varilna naprava porabi med tri do štirikrat več električne energije kot robot in miza skupaj, razmerje je odvisno predvsem od izbranega varilnega postopka. Porabo električne energije je možno najbolj optimizirati pri varilni napravi z dobro izbiro in nastavitvijo varilnega postopka z nanašanjem varilnega materiala s pulziranjem toka. Pri robotu in mizi je največji prihranek energije možen z izklopom servo regulacije motorjev robota, medtem ko robotska varilna celica v času odmorov za malico ne obratuje. Hardware producers {{strive to}} offer their customers a technologically perfected robotic cell. Two important factors that customers take into consideration are the overview of energy consumption and a possibility for optimization {{with regard to the}} energy cost savings. This thesis deals with the electricity consumption of a welding machine, robot and positioner, three main energy consumers of a robotic welding cell. The first part of the thesis describes the consumers of a robotic <b>welding</b> cell: robot <b>controller,</b> main switch cabinet, robot manipulator, positioner, clamping-positioning tool, welding system, cleaner, two-handed stand-alone counter and command panel. The robot controller performs multiple tasks and has the possibility to supervise up to eight robots. The power components are located in the main switching cabinet. The moving parts of the robotic welding cell are the robot manipulator and the positioner with the clamping-positioning tool. The welding system is composed of a welding source, a connecting package and a welding pistol. The cleaner carries out cleaning of the welding pistol 2 ̆ 7 s nozzle. The two-handed stand-alone counter and the command panel with all the main switches are used to operate the robotic welding cell. By measuring the parameters of the robot, the positioner and the welding source we compiled two tables showing electricity consumption and designed two HMI (human-machine interface). The tables automatically calculate the electricity consumption for one, 100, 000 and 3 million welded products in kilowatt hours and the costs in EUR. In comparison to the robot with the positioner, the welding source consumes three to four times more power, whereby the ratio mainly depends on the selected welding process. The electricity consumption of the welding tool can be best optimized by good setting and choosing the right welding process. With regard to the robot and the positioner, the most electricity can be saved by deactivating the servo regulation of the robot motors during the lunch time, when the robotic welding cell is not in operation...|$|R
