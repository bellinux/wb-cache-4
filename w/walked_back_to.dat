As Seedman <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his car, dodging bricks dropped from nearby roofs, he decided to retire, which he did, two weeks later.

25|$|Vaughn {{landed at}} Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Air Base under {{the pretext of}} needing to refuel the aircraft. After landing, Vaughn <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the cabin {{to speak with the}} hijacker again. Binh, highly agitated, {{threatened}} to detonate his bomb unless the aircraft immediately departed for Hanoi. Claiming to have trouble understanding Binh's speech, Vaughn encouraged Binh to lean closer. When he did so, Vaughn restrained Binh in a choke hold and he and two passengers knocked the package from Binh's hand and pinned him to the floor. Vaughn signalled the retired police officer, who shot Binh five times, killing him. Vaughn then carried Binh's body to the rear exit of the aircraft and threw it onto the tarmac.|$|E

25|$|However, the Thai {{artillery}} strongpoint at Ban Na {{had come}} under siege {{during the opening}} of Campaign 74B. Now the 165th Regiment from the 312th Division joined the attack. However, weather {{was not the only}} hindrance to close air support for the Thais; U.S. tactical air was also being diverted to bomb North Vietnam. Instead, BC 605 and BC 606 were tasked with seizing Hill 1663, four kilometers southwest of Ban Na. On 29 March, they lined up on the landing zone for insertion into a landing zone at the foot of Hill 1663.

25|$|The 1965 Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway {{was one of}} {{the wildest}} races in NASCAR history. Rookie driver Buren Skeen died after two cars ran into the side of his car in the early laps. Sam McQuagg was leading the race, when Cale Yarborough tried to muscle past McQuagg for the lead. Yarborough flew over the guardrail, rolled around six times, and ended {{up at the end of}} the parking lot by a light post. Yarborough waved to the crowd as he <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the pits. A video clip of the wreck was used on ABC's Wide World of Sports for several years. With 44 laps left, Fred Lorenzen and Darel Dieringer were {{fighting}} for the lead far ahead of Jarrett. Lorenzen's motor expired, and even before he could get into the pits Dieringer's motor started smoking too. Dieringer continued at a slower pace to finish third. The race was won by Ned Jarrett by 14 laps and 2 car lengths or 19.25 miles, which is the farthest margin of victory in NASCAR history (in terms of miles).|$|E
25|$|Geelong met North Melbourne in the Preliminary Final in a match {{which proved}} even more nailbiting than their match with Footscray 2 weeks prior. North Melbourne started well, but Geelong {{dominated}} {{the second and}} third quarters to lead by six goals in the third quarter. A fine feat given that Geelong's target all season, Gary Ablett was being beaten by North Melbourne's full back, Mick Martyn. However, North Melbourne came back strongly in the last quarter and took the lead late in the match. However, Geelong scored a behind to level the scores. With 25seconds left and a boundary throw-in, the ball came to ground and Martyn cleared, only for the ball to be marked by Leigh Colbert. Colbert then kicked long, where ruckman John Barnes dropped the mark, allowing Leigh Tudor, a former North Melbourne player to swoop, and kick the ball over Martyn's head to land in the hand of Gary Ablett. As Ablett <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> take his kick, the siren went, and Ablett kicked the winning goal, propelling Geelong to its third Grand Final in seven years.|$|E

25|$|Pietersen {{played in}} the first Test against India {{and in the first}} innings, he made 37 but not without controversy. He edged the ball behind of Zaheer Khan to Dhoni. He walked, but after seeing replays on the screen, he <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the middle and the {{decision}} was overturned. Ironically, he was out shortly afterwards caught Dhoni, bowled Khan. In the second innings he was top scorer with a knock of 134 to set up a potential England victory. Pietersen described this as his best century, in very testing conditions. In the second test, he was twice lbw to RP Singh for 13 and 19 in a defeat which subsequently cost them the series. After making 41 in the first innings, Pietersen scored his 10th Test century in the third and final Test at the Oval, helping England to draw the game with 101. In the one-day series that followed, he struggled at the start with a top score of 33 not out in the first five matches of the series. He scored two half-centuries in the final matches including 71 not out in the final match at Lord's, hitting the winning runs to give England the series.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, as the overcast skies {{cleared and}} sun came out {{late on the}} first afternoon.

500|$|During a 1990 on-field brawl, West {{attempted}} {{to break up}} the fight by throwing Phillies pitcher Dennis Cook to the ground. The matter ultimately was handled among West, NL President Bill White, then-Commissioner Fay Vincent and the umpires union. West said White supported his actions in the brawl, but White quickly issued a statement saying he had prohibited West from making further physical contact with players. White was reported to have nearly resigned due to lack of support from Vincent, but the NL president remained in his post after receiving support from league owners. West met more controversy the next year when Chicago Cubs outfielder Andre Dawson bumped him after a called third strike during a game at Wrigley Field. After Dawson was ejected from the game, he <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the dugout and tossed 14 bats onto the field. Chicago fans threw debris onto the field, causing a delay in the game.

500|$|In contrast, Australia batted {{much more}} fluently as the {{overcast}} skies cleared {{and the sun}} came out. Australia had reached 100 at 17:30 with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The score had reached 117 before Barnes was removed by Hollies for 61. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00, late on the first day. As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level, the innings {{would be his last}} at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers before shaking Bradman's hand. With 6996 Test career runs, he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket. [...] Bradman took guard and played the first ball from Hollies from the back foot.

Bradman appeared stunned by what had happened and slowly turned around and <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the pavilion, receiving another large round of applause.

500|$|The next bout was the [...] "Family Feud" [...] {{match that}} saw the Hart {{brothers}} (Bret, Owen, Bruce, and Keith) facing Shawn Michaels and His Knights. The knights wore masks to hide their identities, {{but it has been}} revealed that Jeff Gaylord was the Black Knight, Greg Valentine was the Blue Knight, and Barry Horowitz was the Red Knight. Ray Combs, then host of Family Feud, told jokes to insult Shawn Michaels prior to the bout and later served as guest commentator for the match. Michaels began the match by wrestling Bruce Hart. Although Michaels was able to go on the offensive against the Hart brothers, the knights were unable to achieve much success against the Harts. At one point, all four wrestlers brawled in the ring, but Owen was able to eliminate the Black Knight after performing a missile dropkick. Michaels and the knights regained control of the match, but Bret turned things around by eliminating the Red Knight via submission to the Sharpshooter. Bret sustained a kayfabe injury after being thrown out of the ring and sat out of the match for a few minutes. Meanwhile, Michaels provoked Stu Hart into punching him. Inside the ring, Owen forced the Blue Knight to submit to the Sharpshooter, which left Michaels by himself. While Bret was standing on the ring apron, however, Owen ran in to him and got distracted. This allowed Michaels to pin Owen and eliminate him from the match. Bret dominated the rest of the match against Michaels until Michaels <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the locker room. As a result, Michaels was counted out, and the Harts won the match. After the match, Owen returned to the ring and yelled at Bret, blaming Bret for causing him to be eliminated from the match.|$|E

500|$|Oxbow drew post {{position}} {{five for}} the Haskell, carried the highest weight at 122 pounds, {{and was the}} second favorite in the race behind Verrazano. [...] Leading for {{the early part of}} the race, Oxbow was challenged for the lead by Verrazano at the three-quarter-mile marker, then weakened and finished fourth, earning another $60,000. Stevens felt something was wrong with Oxbow at the half-mile pole, later saying the horse [...] "didn’t feel like he did in any of the Triple Crown races", and Lukas stated the jockey [...] "kind of held" [...] Oxbow from that point on. Oxbow was pulled up soon after crossing the finish line, then his rider jumped off and removed the saddle when Oxbow failed to jog sound on the track. [...] The horse <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the barn without obvious sign of injury, and radiographs of his right front ankle revealed no fracture, but he did have a soft tissue injury to the area, described as a [...] "sprain". Of Oxbow's overall health, Lukas commented, [...] "he had a pretty set of X-rays. It's amazing. For a horse with that many , they were really clean." [...] Nonetheless, as a result of the soft tissue injury, Oxbow was taken out of races for the duration of the summer, and after three weeks of hand-walking at Saratoga was shipped home to Calumet in mid-August, with an announcement that he was not anticipated to run again in 2013. Lukas said: [...] "He's been a warrior and a hell of a nice horse for us and I don't want to do anything to jeopardize his future down the line." [...] On October 25, 2013, Calumet Farm announced the decision to retire Oxbow. Combined with his winnings in his two-year-old season, his lifetime race earnings were $1,243,500.

500|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, as the overcast skies {{cleared and}} sun came out. The debutant Watkins sent down four overs for 19 runs with his bruised shoulder {{and did not}} bowl again. He was in much pain and his limp bowling did little to trouble the Australian openers. Morris and Barnes batted comfortably and passed England's first innings total by themselves, taking {{less than an hour}} to push the Australians into the lead. O'Reilly felt the Australian openers wanted to prove [...] "the pitch itself had nothing whatever to do with the English batting debacle". Australia reached 100 at 17:30 with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The only chance came when Barnes powerfully square cut Bedser low to point, where Young spilled the catch. When Young came on to bowl, his finger spin was expected to trouble the batsmen on a rain-affected surface, but he delivered little variation in pace and trajectory and Barnes in particular hit him repeatedly through the off side field. The score had reached 117 after only 126 minutes, when Barnes was caught behind from Hollies for 61. The right-handed Australian opener stumbled forward to a fast-turning leg break that caught his outside edge. He had overbalanced and would have been stumped if he had failed to make contact with the leather. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00, late on the first day. As Bradman had already announced the tour would be his last at international level, the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat; Yardley led the Englishmen and the crowd in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers, before shaking Bradman's hand. With 6,996 Test career runs, Bradman needed only four runs to average exactly 100 in Test cricket. Bradman took guard and played the first ball from Hollies, a leg break, from the back foot. The leg spinner pitched the next ball up, bowling Bradman for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad as the Australian skipper leaned forward. Bradman appeared stunned by what had happened and slowly turned around and <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the pavilion, receiving another large round of applause. It was claimed by many, including Hollies, that Bradman became emotional and had tears in his eyes at the ovation given to him by the crowd and the English players, and that this hampered his ability to see and hit the ball. Bradman admitted to being moved by the applause, but always denied shedding tears, saying [...] "to suggest I got out, as some people did, because I had tears in my eyes while I was looking at the bowler was quite untrue. Eric Hollies deceived me and he deserves full credit." ...|$|E
