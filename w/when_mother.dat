40|$|Patterns of {{conflict}} amongst {{a mother and}} two young children were recorded for 55 families in the US. The mother was well in 19 families, depressed in 20, and had bipolar illness in 16. Sibling conflict occurred least often <b>when</b> the <b>mother</b> had bipolar illness. Mother-child conflict occurred most often when the elder child was male, but depressed mothers were likely to quarrel with their elder daughters. Mothers allied with elder rather than younger children, but depressed mothers were especially likely to uphold the rights of protesters. Compensatory influence was noted across relationships, so that children whose actions were protested by mothers {{were less likely to}} object to the behaviour of their siblings. In general, <b>when</b> <b>mothers</b> were well, families experienced frequent, but mild conflict; <b>when</b> <b>mothers</b> had bipolar illness, the relationship between the mother and the elder son was especially fraught; and <b>when</b> <b>mothers</b> were depressed, conflicts were more likely to escalate and to occur between mothers and daughters...|$|R

When their ruse is uncovered, the mourning Nikolas, Bobby, and Stefan turn against the family.

A fearful Laura takes her mother and Lulu to Switzerland, under the guise of getting better care for Lesley.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of St. Peter's led to federal {{approval for a}} post office at the mission in 1885. After arriving in Montana, Mother Amadeus asked Bishop Brondel to give her control over the Ursulines, but he declined to do so. Amadeus repeatedly asked Mother Stanislaus, head of the Toledo chapterhouse (and who exercised authority over the Ursulines at St. Peter's), for more sisters {{to help with the}} work in Montana. Her requests were denied. She appealed to Richard Gilmour, Bishop of Cleveland, Ohio. <b>When</b> <b>Mother</b> Stanislaus complained, Mother Amadeus denied she was making an end-run around the chapterhouse, claiming instead that she was acting under instruction from Bishop Brondel. In February 1886, Bishop Gilmour ordered the Ursulines in Toledo to stop talking about how much they wished to teach in Montana, and ordered the St. Peter's Ursulines separated from the Toledo chapter.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{discouraged}} in {{her efforts}} to follow the instruction she had received in her visions, Alacoque was eventually able to convince her superior, Mother de Saumaise, of the authenticity of her visions. She was unable, however, to convince a group of theologians {{of the validity of}} her apparitions, nor was she any more successful with many of the members of her own community, and suffered greatly at their hands. She eventually received the support of St. Claude de la Colombière, S.J., the community's confessor for a time, who declared that the visions were genuine. In 1683, opposition in the community ended <b>when</b> <b>Mother</b> Melin was elected Superior and named Margaret Mary her assistant. She later became Novice Mistress, and saw the monastery observe the Feast of the Sacred Heart privately, beginning in 1686. Two years later, a chapel was built at Paray-le-Monial to honor the Sacred Heart.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} predictors and moderators {{of outcome}} of behavioral parent training (BPT) as adjunct to ongoing routine clinical care (RCC), versus RCC alone.  Methods We randomly assigned 94 referred children (4 - 12 years) with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to BPT plus RCC or RCC alone. Outcome {{was based on}} parent-reported behavioral problems and ADHD symptoms. Predictor/moderator variables included children's IQ, age, and comorbidity profile, and maternal ADHD, depression, and parenting self-efficacy.  Results Superior BPT treatment effects on behavioral problems and ADHD symptoms were present in children with no or single-type comorbidity—anxiety/depression or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) /conduct disorder (CD) —and <b>when</b> <b>mothers</b> had high parenting self-efficacy, but absent in children with broad comorbidity (anxiety/depression and ODD/CD) and <b>when</b> <b>mothers</b> had low parenting self-efficacy.

25|$|Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter {{them in the}} {{upcoming}} Salzburg Festival but the suggestion is immediately rejected by the Captain as he does not allow his children to sing in public. He does agree, however, to organize a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional Ländler folk dance, he cuts in and partners with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, <b>when</b> <b>Mother</b> Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her {{to return to the}} villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed, and after breaking off his engagement the Captain marries Maria.|$|E

After their separation, her mother traveled the country to pursue acting jobs and Robbins was raised in Bethesda, Maryland, for six years by her aunt, Virginia Luckett, and uncle, Audley Gailbraith.

2500|$|Illness {{affected}} the Ursulines, too. In April 1885, Mother Amadeus fell ill with pneumonia. As her condition worsened, word reached the Ursuline convent in Toledo. Mary Fields, an African American ex-slave who had formerly been {{employed by the}} Dunne family as a servant, worked at the convent. <b>When</b> <b>Mother</b> Stanislaus journeyed to Montana to nurse Mother Amadeus, Fields accompanied her. Amadeus recovered, and Fields decided to stay in Montana. For the next eight years, she helped the sisters with farming, constructing buildings, running the laundry, and driving the freight wagon to nearby Cascade. Known as [...] "Stagecoach Mary," [...] she cursed, smoked cigars, drank liquor, carried a loaded firearm, and fought anyone who gave her the slightest insult. In 1894 Bishop Brondel demanded that Fields leave the mission after she fought a duel in Helena {{with a man who}} insulted her. Estranged from the church by Brondel's decision, Fields moved to nearby Cascade. Mother Amadeus provided her with funds to open a restaurant. When the restaurant later failed, Mother Amadeus helped Fields win a job as a mail carrier.|$|E

Emma convinces Elsa that it is too risky to blast through.
