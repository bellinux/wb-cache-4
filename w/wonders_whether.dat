In the aftermath, Blaine <b>wonders</b> <b>whether</b> he might be bisexual, and goes {{on a date with}} Rachel. When she kisses him again while they are both sober, he concludes that he is indeed gay, which relieves Kurt.|$|E
5|$|On a {{cold day}} the fictional 304th New York Regiment awaits battle beside a river. Eighteen-year-old Private Henry Fleming, remembering his romantic reasons for enlisting {{as well as}} his mother's {{resulting}} protests, <b>wonders</b> <b>whether</b> he will remain brave in the face of fear, or turn and run. He is comforted by one of his friends from home, Jim Conklin, who admits that he would run from battle if his fellow soldiers also fled. During the regiment's first battle, Confederate soldiers charge, but are repelled. The enemy quickly regroups and attacks again, this time forcing some of the unprepared Union soldiers to flee. Fearing the battle is a lost cause, Henry deserts his regiment. It is not until after he reaches the rear of the army that he overhears a general announcing the Union's victory.|$|E
5|$|Similarly he is irreligious, {{his work}} making him {{aware of the}} {{fragility}} of life and consciousness's reliance on the functioning brain. His morality is nuanced, weighing both sides of an issue. When leaving the confrontation with Baxter, he questions his use of his medical knowledge, {{even though it was}} in self-defense, and with genuine Hippocratic feeling. While shopping for his fish supper, he cites scientific research that shows greater consciousness in fish, and <b>wonders</b> <b>whether</b> he should stop eating them. As a sign of his rationalism, he appreciates the brutality of Saddam Hussein's rule as described by the Iraqi professor whom Perowne treated, at the same time taking seriously his children's concerns about the war.|$|E

5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his {{cake and eat it}} with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also <b>wonders</b> <b>whether</b> the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E

He <b>wonders</b> <b>whether</b> Yuzu had turned against him, {{as he was}} the one who first left the group of five friends, as a {{preemptive}} strike because she could not bear the thought that its members would inevitably drift apart anyway. Against Kuro's advice, he decides to press Sara on whether she is seeing someone else. Sara says she will need three days to reply. After a late-night confession of love by phone-call, the novel ends with Tsukuru still waiting.|$|E

When {{they arrive at}} the seed village, Doro tells Anyanwu that she is to marry Isaac, bear his children {{and the children of}} whomever else Doro chooses. Anyanwu eventually agrees once Isaac convinces her that she could be the only one to get through to Doro.|$|E

25|$|Alone, Vladimir is {{encountered}} by (apparently) the same boy from yesterday, though Vladimir <b>wonders</b> <b>whether</b> {{he might be}} the other boy's brother. This time, Vladimir begins consciously realising the circular nature of his experiences: he even predicts exactly what the boy will say, involving the same speech about Godot not arriving today but surely tomorrow. Vladimir seems to reach a moment of revelation before furiously chasing the boy away, demanding that he be recognised the next time they meet. Estragon awakes and pulls his boots off again. He and Vladimir consider hanging themselves once more, but when they test the strength of Estragon's belt (hoping {{to use it as a}} noose), it breaks and Estragon's trousers fall down. They resolve tomorrow to bring a more suitable piece of rope and, if Godot fails to arrive, to commit suicide at last. Again, they decide to clear out for the night, but, again, neither of them makes any attempt to move.|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} Light is {{different}} to his manga counterpart {{in the fact}} that he never loses sight of his goal to make the world better for the innocent. Unlike Light Yagami, Light Turner never kills any police officers and never truly lets the power of the Death Note overtake him. Instead, his ruthless qualities are transferred to Mia, who uses the notebook in secret to kill police and innocents that are trying to find Light and, by association, herself. In the end, she writes Light's name in the notebook to make him transfer ownership of the notebook to her, showing her true nature and calling the death note her notebook. However, Light creates a plan that will result in his survival and her death if she attempts to take the notebook, which she does despite how much he tries to convince her to let it go and be with him instead, having truly fallen in love with Mia by writing her name in it as well. In the end, through using two criminals that he controlled using the Death Note, Light manages to trick the police into believing that he wasn't Kira with the exception of his father, who worked out the truth after finding newspaper articles about his mother's murder. The film ends with his father asking Light, in response to what he said, if he was truly {{the lesser of two evils}} when compared to Mia while L finds a page of the death note, and <b>wonders</b> <b>whether</b> to write Light's name.|$|E

Emboldened nevertheless, Will gives the glee club an assignment: find the perfect song for him to use to propose to Emma.|$|E

500|$|Fox {{emphasized}} the horror aspect of [...] "Shadows" [...] {{by using the}} tagline [...] "Don't watch it alone" [...] when advertising the episode. During the episode, Mulder jokes that Elvis was the only man ever to have successfully faked his own death. The joke would eventually become {{the first of many}} similar Elvis jokes littered throughout most of the series. When Mulder <b>wonders</b> <b>whether</b> or not {{it could have been a}} poltergeist, Scully mocks him by replying [...] "they're here". This is a tagline and famous quote from the film Poltergeist.|$|E
500|$|Russell <b>wonders</b> <b>whether</b> {{some other}} basis for ethics {{can be found}} besides {{positive}} morality. Russell associates positive morality with conservatism, and understands {{it as a way}} of acting which stifles the spirit of peace and fails to curb strife. (Russell 1938:197) Meanwhile, personal morality is the ultimate source of positive morality, and is more grounded in the intellect. (Russell 1938:198–199) However, personal morality is so deeply connected with the desires of individuals that, if it were left to be the sole guide to moral conduct, it would lead to the social chaos of the [...] "anarchic rebel". (Russell 1938:206) ...|$|E
500|$|Jacqui faces more horror from Danny {{when she}} is {{threatened}} at knife point to strip for him, scared for her life she complies. Speaking of Jacqui's sudden change of heart, Cooper states: [...] "He pulls out a knife. That changes the situation - the dynamic changes immediately. He could do something really horrible to her - it's not necessarily about killing someone, he could slash her face or anything. In a situation like that, your mind plays tricks as you wonder what someone could do to you." [...] Cooper has spoken of her feelings of responsibility to portray it correctly and stated [...] "I wanted to show how horrendous it was for Jacqui. She <b>wonders</b> <b>whether</b> she could die like this - all to protect her family…" ...|$|E
2500|$|Russell {{resolves}} {{the problem}} of ambiguity in propositional attitude reports in a similar manner. He refers to an example similar to Frege's puzzle about identity: [...] " [...] <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> Scott {{is the author of}} Waverley." [...] In this case, it is obvious that King George is not <b>wondering</b> <b>whether</b> Scott is identical to Scott. Russell rejects Frege's solution of distinguishing between sense and reference. Quantificational descriptions are sufficient for him to handle the de dicto / de re ambiguities. So, for example, in the general case, the sentence [...] "George IV <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> Scott is Sir Walter" [...] can be interpreted as: ...|$|R

500|$|Will asks Emma's parents (Don Most and Valerie Mahaffey) {{for their}} blessing to marry her, but they refuse as they doubt Emma could handle {{marriage}} and having children. Unaware of that discussion, Emma later asks Will about their progress toward marriage, {{and he also}} <b>wonders</b> <b>whether</b> she could cope with a family given her obsessive–compulsive disorder. Though distraught, Emma tells Will that her disease {{is a part of}} her: he must decide whether they should stay together. Will, realizing that he loves Emma regardless, stages a spectacular marriage proposal—aided by the glee club and synchronized swim team, who sing and perform a water ballet to [...] "We Found Love"—which Emma tearfully accepts. Later, Finn surprises Rachel with a proposal of marriage, complete with an engagement ring, which leaves her speechless.|$|E

500|$|In 1992, {{attorney}} Gregory Reed {{bought the}} original manuscripts of The Autobiography of MalcolmX for $100,000 at {{the sale of}} the Haley Estate. The manuscripts included three [...] "missing chapters", titled [...] "The Negro", [...] "The End of Christianity", and [...] "Twenty Million Black Muslims", that were omitted from the original text. In a 1964 letter to his publisher, Haley had described these chapters as, [...] "the most [...] material of the book, some of it rather lava-like". Marable writes that the missing chapters were [...] "dictated and written" [...] during MalcolmX's final months in the Nation of Islam. In them, Marable says, MalcolmX proposed the establishment of a union of African American civic and political organizations. Marable <b>wonders</b> <b>whether</b> this project might have led some within the Nation of Islam and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to try to silence MalcolmX. In April 2010, the New York Post reported that the missing chapters would be published with a foreword by MalcolmX's daughter Ilyasah Shabazz.|$|E
