25|$|A {{few blocks}} away, the Asch Building {{at the corner}} of Washington Place and Greene Street was ablaze. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the scene, the police had thrown up a cordon around the area and the firemen were helplessly {{fighting}} the blaze. The eighth, ninth, and tenth stories of the building were now an enormous roaring cornice of flames.|$|E

50|$|Intermysticism interspirituality is {{the deepest}} {{expression}} of the religious dimension of human life. It is the actual religion of {{each one of us}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> the point of spiritual maturity.|$|R

30|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> {{the next}} vision time step k+ 2 N_v, {{now we have}} y_t(k+ 2 N_v)=p^s(k+N_v) and can compute the Kalman filter gain for the time step k+N_v, i.e. L_t(k+N_v) using Eq. (21). Now, we are back to step 1) so can repeat the process.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{we were in}} sore plight <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Rouen, but {{the duke}} saw that we were {{provided}} with clothes and with horses for our journey here." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> my uncle's home I {{found that}} he had been brought in but ten minutes before. The entire {{household}} was in a great state of alarm in consequence.|$|E
6000|$|Moving forward, {{the crowd}} opened to him, and still shouting, yelling and gesticulating, {{allowed him to}} go through. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the gate of his palace, {{he turned to me}} and said,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, sir," [...] was {{the answer}} of the passenger. [...] "But the cook {{said it was the}} best he had. He said we might go to the captain or to anybody we please. He is going to leave the boat <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> Tampa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} it every other night," [...] he said. [...] "By resting every {{alternate}} night, and by snatching {{a couple of}} hours' sleep before going on duty, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of a}} day's march in good time, I can manage very well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> the halting-place to {{hand over}} the command of my {{detachment}} to the corporal, and for you to let me go away on my own affairs. I want you also to allow your head man, Kreta, and five of his men, leave of absence." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{some places}} {{the roads were}} {{extremely}} precipitous; and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> {{the foot of a}} large hill we used generally to get out and walk, preferring this to being dragged slowly up by the jaded horses.|$|E
60|$|We took a hansom at {{the corner}} of the street, and, sure enough, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the hotel Mr. Halliday's motor-car was waiting outside. We went at once into the office, where my {{companion}} was quite at home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you suppose}} we don't {{interest}} ourselves about the Derby in New York? Why, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Queenstown I was {{leaning over the}} taffrail so that I might ask the first man on board the tender whether the Prime Minister had won." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was nearly}} noon <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> {{what is known}} as the Wood Yard, where General Winder had encamped and thrown up some slight entrenchments, and where Commodore Barney was to have joined him; but now the place was deserted, save for one man whom I remembered having seen on our fleet.|$|E
60|$|It {{was twenty}} minutes to eight <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Mellborough, and, {{as we had}} not sent word on, there was no {{carriage}} to meet us, nor, as it happened, any spare vehicle. After a brief word or two with the stationmaster, we decided to walk down into the town and order a fly.|$|E
6000|$|... “No, shipmate; on the contrary, it is {{the easiest}} thing in life: the only awkward point {{is the sort of}} usage which our unhappy limbs may receive <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> the bottom, and what sort of {{travelling}} trim we shall be in afterwards. But follow me now, and I will show you the only chance we have.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} him to go, sheik.

6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he said, [...] "you will {{understand}} that thoroughly <b>when</b> <b>we</b> reach that point. It {{is one of the}} steps in my method. Other things lead up to it.

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the {{railroad}} station we {{were met by}} Mr. Enderton, who showed a moderate degree of pleasure at seeing us and an immoderate amount of annoyance, exhibited principally to me, in being obliged to give up to the women of our party the large room he had occupied in the only lodging-house in the little settlement.|$|E
60|$|Everything {{had been}} {{prepared}} for it overnight; and, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the house, a good breakfast was spread by Shorty: and old Tonoi was bustling about like an innkeeper. Several of his men, also, were in attendance to accompany us with calabashes of food; and, in case we met with any success, to officiate as bearers of burdens on our return.|$|E
60|$|We {{marched to}} Meung without halting. There we carried the bridge by assault, {{and left a}} force to hold it, {{the rest of the}} army marching away next morning toward Beaugency, where the lion Talbot, the terror of the French, was in command. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> that place, the English retired into the castle and we sat down in the {{abandoned}} town.|$|E
6000|$|... “Then we can’t {{possibly}} {{speak about}} it now,” said Sir Lulworth; “no one could talk seriously during a borshch. A beautifully constructed borshch, such {{as you are}} going to experience presently, ought not only to banish conversation but almost to annihilate thought. Later on, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> the second stage of olives, I shall be quite ready to discuss that new book on Borrow, or, if you prefer it, the present situation in the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg. But I absolutely decline to talk anything approaching business till we have finished with the bird.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will give}} Luigi no intimation of our coming," [...] Mr. Bundercombe {{suggested}} with relish. [...] "We shall be in no hurry; {{so we can}} order our dinner <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> there. <b>At</b> eight o'clock?" ...|$|R

[56] The third kind of ornament, the Renaissance, is that {{in which}} [...] the {{inferior}} detail becomes principal, the executor of every minor [...] portion being required to exhibit skill and possess knowledge as [...] great as that which is possessed by {{the master of the}} design; and in [...] the endeavor to endow him with this skill and knowledge, his own [...] original power is overwhelmed, and the whole building becomes a [...] wearisome exhibition of well-educated imbecility.

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> {{the citadel}} next morning, {{we found that}} a change had been made. The chapel had been found too small.

The number of judges was increased to sixty-two--one ignorant girl against such odds, and none to help her.|$|E
60|$|It {{was not yet}} dark <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> our {{destination}} without having seen man or woman on the road, all of which caused me yet more anxiety, for I failed to understand why it was that on this day when the curious people of Virginia should have been going to and fro to see the king's soldiers, none save ourselves were abroad.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, friend," [...] said a quiet voice.

60|$|I was in {{good shape}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> finally <b>at</b> the village, because of having {{remained}} at the steering paddle; but the other fellows were well-nigh exhausted, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> ran {{the bow of the}} canoe up on the shore, not one of them made a move toward changing his position.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} upset twice {{in one day}} {{on the brink of}} very deep ravines," [...] he was telling Mrs. Gould in an undertone. [...] "And <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> here <b>at</b> last I don't know what we should have done without your hospitality. What an out-of-the-way place Sulaco is!--and for a harbour, too!

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> walked forward again, {{we passed}} through a thick {{plantation}} of young firs; and then, the sounds behind us became slowly and solemnly deadened the further <b>we</b> went on. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> had <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the extremity {{of the line of}} trees, they ceased softly and suddenly. It was like a change in a dream.|$|R
