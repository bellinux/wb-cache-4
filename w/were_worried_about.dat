5|$|In the Russian Revolution of 1917 the Bolshevik party, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian monarchy and instituted Marxism-Leninism. Many Americans <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the revolution's ideas infiltrating the United States, a {{phenomenon}} later named the Red Scare of 1919-20.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{were more}} open to negotiating.

There was also concern about the effect of Jewish immigration to the UK or US.|$|E
5|$|As Ironside was a {{marginal}} operation, and they <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> exposing agents as false, the Twenty Committee {{for the most}} part utilised less important agents and added words of caution to the messages they sent, reducing the impact of the story. Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it was beyond air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.|$|E

5|$|In time, the {{ineffectiveness}} of the CIP {{began to}} concern the Eisenhower administration, who <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> {{the lack of}} industrialization. The corruption that permeated the initiative remained a problem. The rural peasants of Vietnam, who comprised more than 80% of the population, were unaffected by the aid package except for the resentment that it instilled in them when they observed the relative affluence of their city counterparts compared to their own impoverished state. However, the program was credited with transforming the textile industry, as 25,000 sewing machines were imported {{in the first year}} of its operation.|$|E
5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or because they did not see any commercial potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, even though they had not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1950, in {{the middle}} of a holiday in Italy, Pontecorvo {{abruptly}} flew from Rome for Stockholm with his wife and three sons without informing friends or relatives. On 2 September he was helped by Soviet agents to enter the Soviet Union from Finland. His abrupt disappearance caused much concern to many of the western intelligence services, especially those of Britain, Canada and the United States, that <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the escape of atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, and of Finland and Sweden, through which Pontecorvo and Marianne had been allowed to travel without valid passports and visas.|$|E

5|$|Smetona and Voldemaras, both {{representing}} the Lithuanian National Union, invited the Christian Democrats {{to join them}} in forming a new government that would restore some degree of constitutional legitimacy. The party agreed reluctantly; they <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> their prestige. Looking toward the near future, the Christian Democrats reasoned that they could easily win any upcoming Seimas elections, regaining power by constitutional means and avoiding direct association with the coup. In keeping with this strategy, they allowed members of the Lithuanian National Union {{to take over the}} most prominent posts.|$|E
5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but they <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the lip sync and {{did not think it}} would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E
5|$|John Bevan {{had asked}} Newman Smith {{to retain the}} threat of a US {{invasion}} force beyond 28 June when the initial deception was supposed to have ended. Agent Rudloff sent messages on 10, 12 and 18 July referring to the Ironside force. In mid-July, the Allies began Operation Ferdinand, a cover deception for Operation Dragoon, the August 1944 invasion of southern France. The Ironside story was considered as an option in support of Ferdinand, but Noel Wild and Ops (B), the SHAEF deception planners <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the impact of a theoretical US invasion force on the continuing Fortitude deception. It was decided that a new story would be presented to the Germans, suggesting that the Allies intended to bolster French resistance in the south of the country. The operation went largely unnoticed and German interest in the Bordeaux region dissipated.|$|E

5|$|The Saint Paul City Council {{decided in}} late 1974 to support I-35E, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} influence of proponents. R.I.P. 35E proposed an alternative to the original plan, and convinced the city council to go along with it. The plan included a four-lane boulevard upgrade of Pleasant Avenue (the street chosen for the I-35E alignment), with another route such as Shepard Road or the nearby Lafayette Freeway forming part of I-35E. The group opposed any direct connection of this parkway to I-94 near the State Capitol, where I-35E and I-94 were to merge. The EIS was completed in early 1975, identifying noise pollution, air pollution, vibrations, and slope stability as the main concerns. In addition to the nearby location of historic districts, hospitals <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the effects of vibrations on sensitive operations; the MHD solved this problem while the report was being developed. The EIS identified the primary benefit of completing I-35E as connecting downtown Saint Paul to the Interstate Highway System, and determined that the original Pleasant Avenue corridor was the best choice, but with minor changes such as lowering the freeway below Grand Avenue and Ramsey Street.|$|E

As preparations get underway for the April 2009 parliamentary elections with 44 parties – six local, 38 national – in contention, the mil­itary <b>is</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> Partai Aceh, the GAM party, winning control of local legislatures and challenging Jakarta’s authority. Partai Aceh <b>is</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> overt or covert interference from Jakarta, and smaller parties <b>are</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> intimidation by Partai Aceh. Election officials are concerned a dispute between Jakarta and Aceh over candidate requirements could delay the polls, and other struggles with the central government are brewing. Everyone <b>is</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the health of Governor Irwandi Yusuf, a GAM leader with unparalleled ability to manage competing demands in post-conflict Aceh, who suffered a sudden illness – officially undisclosed but widely reported as a slight stroke – in August...|$|R

25|$|The {{date and}} {{location}} of Robinson's second marriage, to Fanny Clay, or even the year they met, is uncertain because the couple gave different dates and locations in interviews, possibly because they <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> unfavorable publicity about the marriage occurring so soon after Robinson's divorce. Robinson's biographer estimates that they met in late 1920 and were married in early 1922.|$|E

25|$|The West Indies Federation had {{an unusually}} weak federal structure. For instance, its provinces were not {{contained}} in a single customs union. Thus, each province functioned as a separate economy, complete with tariffs, largely because the smaller provinces were afraid of being overwhelmed by the large islands' economies. Also, complete freedom of movement within the Federation was not implemented, as the larger provinces <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> mass migration from the smaller islands. In this sense, the current European Union {{can be said to}} have implemented a more unified economic space than the West Indian attempt.|$|E

According to Parker himself, he did attempt to talk to his client about the matter, but Presley simply told him to stay out of his personal life.|$|E
