40|$|<b>Youth</b> <b>with</b> an Autism Spectrum Disorder {{can also}} have an other {{clinical}} disorder, for example a depression. This depression could be a multiple disability for this <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> autism. The <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> an Autism Spectrum Disorder and depression can have more limits in daily functioning, in comparison to <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> only an Autism Spectrum Disorder. It’s important to know at which aspects in daily functioning the <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> both disorders have the greatest limits. Because if these aspects are known, the youth can be supported at these aspects. This results in the following question: In which degree do Dutch children and youth from 4 to 18 years with an Autism Spectrum Disorder and an depression have limits in their adaptive skills? The level of the <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> both disorders are compared <b>with</b> the <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> autism, the <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> a depression and <b>with</b> the <b>youth</b> without psychopathology on four adaptive skills; contact with other children; contact with parents, adults and authority; school, work and future and the adaptive skill autonomy. This research with 635 participants shows that there’s a difference between <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> both disorders and <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> an Autism Spectrum Disorder on the adaptive skill autonomy. <b>Youth</b> <b>with</b> both disorders and <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> only a depression differ on the adaptive skill contact with other children. These results indicate that <b>youth</b> <b>with</b> both disorders mainly have a multiple disability at the adaptive skill autonomy. <b>Youth</b> <b>with</b> both disorders need support to improve their level of this adaptive skill...|$|R

Towards {{the end of the}} season Liverpool supporters were involved in a sporting disaster at Hillsborough, where 96 of the club's supporters lost their lives as a result of overcrowding during a match against Nottingham Forest on 15 April.

5|$|At {{a meeting}} with church and cathedral officials, held on 11 June, reporters noted that three people had been shot within {{the city in the}} {{previous}} 72 hours. The attendees produced a letter by the Very Reverend Rogers Govender, on behalf of the Dean and Canons of Manchester Cathedral to Sony. It stated that they were currently seeking the advice of lawyers in the matter, and reserved their legal position in relation to the same. It demanded a substantial donation for the cathedral's work <b>with</b> <b>youth</b> in resisting the culture of gun crime and other forms of violence in our society. It further demanded the immediate withdrawal of the game, and that Sony not re-issue it without removing the section of the game containing the Cathedral interior. Govender described the use of images of the cathedral as virtual desecration. The letter stressed that they were in consultation with their lawyers and urged Sony to contact them so there can be a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the matter. Govender told reporters that the church officials had only been told of the content on 8 June 2007, and, after watching footage of gameplay posted on YouTube, said they were dismayed beyond belief and were shocked to see a place of worship being presented to youths as a place where guns may be fired, and that every year, they invite hundreds of teenagers to see the Cathedral and appreciate it as an alternative to violence. They added that it was a shame to have a game like this undermining such important work. They also sought that Sony apologise unreservedly.|$|E
