500|$|Following the Master of Reality {{world tour}} in 1972, Black Sabbath took its first break in three years. As Ward explained: [...] "The band started to become very {{fatigued}} and very tired. We'd {{been on the}} road non-stop, year in and year out, constantly touring and recording. I think Master of Reality was kind of like the end of an era, the first three albums, and <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> our time with the next album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Westbrook {{has said}} that the cast and crew became like a second family to her, with the roles in the soap {{mirroring}} their relationships off-screen. In her autobiography she comments, [...] "Sid [...] and I became very close [...] we were as thick as thieves. When we weren't shooting together we'd hang out [...] Once Sid and I got so bored hanging around on set that <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the milk float for a spin around Albert Square, but Sid drove it too fast and turned it over [...] we couldn't stop laughing, but the producers didn't seem to share our amusement. We were seriously told off that day." [...] She has described other actors like Michelle Gayle, Letitia Dean, Adam Woodyatt and Nick Berry like brothers and sisters, and has said she was very close to older cast members such as June Brown, Wendy Richard, Mike Reid and Gillian Taylforth. She has also revealed that her off-screen relationship with actors McFadden and Kemp mirrored her character's on-screen one: [...] "In the soap they were my older brothers, always looking out for me, making sure I didn't get into trouble, and off set they were exactly the same." ...|$|E

6000|$|Strange mind of man! that, {{with our}} species upon {{the edge of}} {{extermination}} or appalling degradation, with no clear prospect before us but {{the chance of a}} horrible death, we could sit following the chance of this painted pasteboard, and playing the [...] "joker" [...] with vivid delight.

60|$|We were land owners now, duly seized and possessed, {{and within}} the {{protection}} of the law. Therefore <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up our residence on our own domain and enjoy that large sense of independence which only such an experience can bring. Late the next afternoon, after a good long rest, we sailed away from the Brigade camp with all the provisions and cooking utensils we could carry off--borrow is the more accurate word --and just as the night was falling we beached the boat at our own landing.|$|E
60|$|An {{examination}} {{disclosed that}} five of our erstwhile opponents were {{dead and the}} sixth, the Neanderthal man, was but slightly wounded, a bullet having glanced from his thick skull, stunning him. <b>We</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him with us to camp, and by means of belts we managed to secure {{his hands behind his}} back and place a leash around his neck before he regained consciousness. We then retraced our steps for our meat being convinced by our own experience that those aboard the U-33 had been able to frighten off this party with a single shell--but when we came to where we had left the deer it had disappeared.|$|E
30|$|Generally, {{there exists}} a {{challenge}} brought by the clustering algorithm, which {{is related to the}} number of cluster members. As we know, the scale of a cluster will be too large to maintain and update when there are many nodes in this cluster, which may result in a heavy load on the cluster head and worse communication quality. To deal with it, <b>we</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account the communication load on each cluster head, which is represented by the number of members in this cluster, for the purpose of the load balancing and well-performed clustering scheme that is suitable for the high node density scenario.|$|R
30|$|Convolutional neural {{networks}} {{have been widely}} adopted in solving problems in computer vision. Rather than focusing on proposing new network architectures, <b>we</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{a closer look at}} the miss-classified instances in order to gain a better understanding towards deep learning. Specifically, we firstly propose the back-tracking process that enables us to trace the activated pixels from the feature maps. We then propose the feature-tracking algorithm to visualize the facial features that lead to the miss-classifications. For the facial recognition, the activations of the common pixels are decisive for the result of classification. For the emotion recognition, the activations of the unique pixels indeed determine the result of classification.|$|R
50|$|On Remembrance Day 2016, ABC News (Australia) made a {{breaking}} news {{story that the}} New South Wales Branch of the RSL was at risk of losing its charity status {{as a result of}} the payment scandal.

60|$|As we {{drew near}} Civita Vecchia the sea widened on our view, wild with a wind {{that seemed to}} have been blowing ever since the stormy evening in 1865 when, after looking at the tossing ships in the harbor, <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the {{diligence}} for Leghorn, rather than the little steamer we had meant to take. From our pleasant train we now patronized Civita Vecchia with a recognition of its picturesqueness, unvexed by the choice that then insisted on itself, though the harbor was as full of shipping as of old. There was time to run out {{for a cup of coffee}} at the station buffet, where there had been neither station nor buffet in our young time: but doubtless then as now there had been the lonely graveyard outside the town, with its sea-beaten, seaward wall. We buried there the last of our Roman holidays under a sky that had changed from blue to gray since our journey began, and mournfully set out faces northward in the malarial Maremma.|$|E
6000|$|An {{incident}} {{of the great}} midsummer heat, was an excursion down the Thames which took us far from the society atmosphere so relaxing to the moral fibre of the mere witness of the London season. The change was not to the cooler air which had been imagined, but it immersed us for {{the space of the}} boat's voyage to and from Greenwich among those social inferiors who are probably the moral betters of their superiors, but whose company does not always seem the spiritual baptism it doubtless is. Our fellow-passengers were distinctly of the classes which are lower as well as middle, and the sole worldly advantage they had of us was that they were going where they wished, and we were going where we must. We had started for Richmond, but as there proved to be no boat for Richmond, <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the boat which was for Greenwich, and consoled ourselves with visions of whitebait, in memory and honor of many parliamentary and literary feasts which that fish has furnished. A whitebait dinner, what would not one suffer of human contiguity for it, even though it could be only a whitebait lunch, owing to the early hour? ...|$|E

40|$|Today the {{humanities}} occupy a small {{corner of the}} law school curriculum. Might they instead become a more vibrant partner in legal education? Might law and humanities scholarship escape the pages of law reviews and teach us something important about how to read and understand the law? Despite the long theoretical dominance of legal realism in scholarly circles, much of legal education as we know it has remained mired in Langdell 2 ̆ 7 s formalist vision of the law—a vision of a narrow, abstract, impersonal system bereft of human meaning and value. But we can do better. We can approach law, and teach our students to approach law, not as a set of rules but as a form of life. If <b>we</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up this life-giving journey, it is {{the humanities}} that can show us the way...|$|R

Likewise, for proactive health care such as nutrition or fitness, or to find fellow-sufferers for post diagnosis support, we turn to online resources. There is a potential disconnect between points at which professional and lay eHealth data and resources intersect for preventative or proactive health care.
