Early on, the research was concentrated on whether or not (PAWS) composting could actually dispose of animal tissue. Once that was determined, researchers began looking at optimization of the process (bulking material, type of system, etc.), destruction of pathogens and disease control, environmental impacts, and economics. Evaluation of the effectiveness of static pile composting to inactivate disease causing organisms in carcasses requires identification of those organisms and analysis of their sensitivity to inactivation by heating or composting’s athermic properties. Pathogen and disease control are essential during emergency disposal, but it is impossible to test for all pathogens/diseases that may occur. This literature review discusses composting process, feedstocks pathogens/diseases and environmental effects that have been studied. Research indicates that the use of composting as one means of disposal during emergencies is not only effective in deactivating pathogens, but also limits the risk of groundwater and air pollution contamination. On-farm composting also reduces the potential for farm-to farm-disease transmission and decreases transportation costs and tipping fees associated with off-site disposal.

40|$|Each year, {{millions}} {{of tons of}} agricultural residues uch as wheat straw are produced worldwide. In this paper, we describe ongoing efforts to solve technological, infrastructural, and economic challenges to using this straw for bioenergy and bioproducts. Among these challenges, silica in straw forms a low-melting point eutectic with potassium, causing excessive slagging deposits in boilers. The presence of chlorine causes corrosion beneath the slag deposits on boiler tubes. Silica fouls kilns and fines slow paper machines, limiting the usefulness of straw in linerboard production. Poor resin bonding to the waxy outer cuticle of the straw, poor resin penetration, and high resin consumption due to fines limit the use of straw for straw-thermoplastic composites and for straw particleboard. Poor cellulase penetration limits the use of straw for production of fuels (ethanol) and chemicals. Straw consists principally of stems, leaves, sheaths, nodes, awns, and chaff. Not all of these parts of straw residue are equally valuable. Leaves and sheaths are higher in silica, while chaff, leaves and nodes comprise the source of most of the fines. The predominantly fibrous straw stem, high in cellulose, is of greater value for bioenergy, biofuels, and bioproducts. Our approach to reducing silica content is to selectively harvest he straw stems using an in-field physical separation, leaving the remaining components in the field to build soil organic matter and contribute soil nutrients.

40|$|Methane (CH 4) and {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 O) are {{included}} in the six greenhouse gases listed in the Kyoto protocol that require emission reduction. To meet reduced emission targets, governments need to first quantify their contribution to global warming. Composting has been identified as an important source of CH 4 and N 2 O. With increasing divergence of biodegradable waste from landfill into the composting sector, it is important to quantify emissions of CH 4 and N 2 O from all forms of composting and from all stages. This study focuses on the final phase of a two stage composting process and compares the generation and emission of CH 4 and N 2 O associated with two differing composting methods: mechanically turned windrow and vermicomposting. The first stage was in-vessel pre-treatment. Source-segregated household waste was first pre-composted for seven days using an in-vessel system. The second stage of composting involved forming half of the pre-composted material into a windrow and applying half to vermicomposting beds. The duration of this stage was 85 days and CH 4 and N 2 O emissions were monitored throughout for both systems. Waste samples were regularly subjected to respirometry analysis and both processes were found to be equally effective at stabilising the organic matter content. The mechanically turned <b>windrow</b> <b>system</b> was characterised by emissions of CH 4 and to a much lesser extent N 2 O. However, the vermicomposting system emitted significant fluxes of N 2 O and only trace amounts of CH 4. In-vessel pre-treatment removed considerable amounts of available C and N prior to the second stage of composting. This had the effect of reducing emissions of CH 4 and N 2 O from the second stage compared to emissions from fresh waste found in other studies. The characteristics of each of the two composting processes are discussed in detail. Very different mechanisms for emission of CH 4 and N 2 O are proposed for each system. For the <b>windrow</b> <b>system,</b> development of anaerobic zones were thought to be responsible for CH 4 release. High N 2 O emission rates from vermicomposting were ascribed to strongly nitrifying conditions in the processing beds combined with the presence of de-nitrifying bacteria within the worm gut...|$|E

Changes in temperature followed a similar path for both mixtures, however the thermophilic phase was longer in the aerated static pile (25 days) than in the windrow (10 days). This fact caused differences in both organic matter degradation, weight losses (21 % for static pile and 10 % for windrow) and gas losses during the process. Nevertheless, the composts obtained by the two systems had a high fertilizer nutrient value (18. 2 g kg- 1 N; 3. 1 g kg- 1 P; 13. 6 g kg- 1 K, C/N 16. 1 for compost obtained in static pile and 20. 6 g kg- 1 N; 13. 7 g kg- 1 P; 13. 1 g kg- 1 K; C/N 18 for compost obtained in windrow).

30|$|Waste load size {{influences}} the temperature development during a composting process (Cayuela et al. 2006). It affects {{the achievement of}} the thermophilic phase where it is an essential stage for sanitation and killing all pathogens. Small heap sizes may not produce enough heat to reach the thermophilic phase, while too large heap sizes may prevent air passage into the centre which will paralyse the composting process (Cayuela et al. 2006). The <b>windrow</b> <b>system</b> requires a large heap to achieve the thermophilic stage. This fact is supported by Cekmecelioglu et al. (2005) who performed a composting process using about 11 -m long, 2.5 -m wide and 1.2 -m high heap using conventional layering and mixing methods. Elsewhere, Sellami et al. (2008) have developed cone-shaped heap of 2 -m high with a 3 -m wide base for co-composting of exhausted olive cake, poultry manure and sesame bark. The other composting method using the in-vessel system requires a closed container, which is also known as a reactor to perform the composting process in small volume. This system can be placed inside or outside the building, as long as the substrates are protected from environmental effects and the process is under controlled conditions. Ishii and Takii (2003) found that smaller stacks are better for food-waste composting. A smaller scale of food waste progresses faster as food waste contains much more easily degradable compounds, and it takes a shorter time to turn into compost.|$|E

These wastes originate from the maintenance of green areas in the cities and the municipalities and from the separatelly collected biodegradable waste from the citizens. There is also possible to process other biodegradable materials whose origin may be in other technologies of waste management at the composting plant.

The simulated results were in reasonably good agreement with the experimental results. The MC and temperature of model simulation were found to be matched with those of experiment, but limited for rapidly degradable substrates.

Static pile and turned windrow technologies were investigated on a commercial scale with the composting of nearly 1, 000 tons of material. The major difference between the technologies is the amount of energy and labor required. Static pile systems require less energy but more time than <b>windrow</b> turned <b>systems.</b> There was no process advantage found for passively aerated static piles over static piles but costs of passive aeration for pipes and labor was higher than for static piles. Machine turned windrows completed active temperature production within 100 days while portions of both the static and passively aerated piles continued to actively compost past 300 days. Process operational costs and compost quality were similar among the compost methods studied. Production operational cost is driven by the cost of compost ingredients and accounted for 60 to 70 percent of the cost in the pilot study. Ingredients were poultry litter, wood chips and sawdust. Screened compost was produced at an operational cost of $ 30 while unscreened compost could be produced for $ 20 per ton of compost. A production scheme where poultry litter is static pile composted on farms for later transport to regional processing centers appears feasible.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. The {{landfilling}} of Municipal Solid Waste poses {{a threat}} to the environment in the form of landfill emissions. These emissions are a result of the biochemical breakdown of the waste in the anaerobic landfill environment. A solution to this problem has been found {{in the form of the}} mechanical-biological treatment of waste. This technology involves mechanical and biological processing of the waste before it is placed in the landfill. The pretreatment accelerates the degradation of the waste resulting in the landfilling of a more biologically stable product, resulting in a reduction of the emission potential of the landfill. This research aims at investigating the applicability and efficiency of a passively ventilated MBT <b>windrow</b> <b>system</b> under a sub-tropical climate. The research was conducted in two stages: the first stage focused on the implementation and analysis of the Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) process with aerobic windrows, employing the Dome Aeration Technology (OAT) (Mollekopf et al. 2002). Three OAT windrows were constructed at the Bisasar Road Landfill in Durban in order to study the efficiency of the process after different composting timeframes (8 and 20 weeks). The study proved that the use of the OAT technology is a viable option. The second stage was the analysis of this treated waste in an anaerobic environment, in order to simulate landfill conditions and, thus gain insight into the effect of MBP on landfill emissions. Six Iysimeters and 5 columns as well as numerous eluate tests were conducted in order to study the "post-Iandfilled" behaviour of the waste and the effect that waste treatment, composting time and screening have on liquid and gaseous emissions. A basic cost estimate using the Clean Development Mechanism for financial assistance was conducted. The results of this research were then utilised to make recommendations on sustainable waste disposal options. The findings of the research were that although the MBT did not reduce emission levels sufficiently to allow for a 40 year landfill aftercare period, the benefit over the landfilling of untreated waste is significant...|$|E
40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{has become a}} major problem in every country in terms of public health and {{environmental}} damage. As a developing country, Sri Lanka too faces the same challenge not only by public health and environmental damage, but also in finding an affordable yet effective technology, which is socially and economically acceptable. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is qualitatively heterogeneous. Therefore, it is difficult to find a unique solution for proper treatment. I. e. The solution is always an integrated one, which consists of sorting, biological/thermal/chemical treatment, recycling and land filling. However quantification and characterization of solid waste in a given area are important factors prior to selecting suitable technology. Therefore, it is required to find waste quantity, composition, density, moisture content, annual rate of waste generation and calorific value of waste etc in a given area. In Sri Lanka, moisture content and organic fraction are reasonably high and lack of high thermal value materials in solid waste stream, have lead to an overall low calorific value of MSW. The general practice for handling the MSW is low rate compo sting systems. Most have been failed due to poor process management, lack of knowledge of proper operation (feedstock formulation, process control, end point indicators), poor product quality, long lead-time, weaker community participation and lack of public awareness. In all systems existing at present bad odor and leachate are unsolved issues. These systems have largely been controlled by default rather than by design. Thus, losing the public confidence on composting is inevitable. Properly engineered composting systems require to monitor and control of key parameters such as aeration, C/N ratio of feedstock, pile temperature, moisture content and particle size. The broad objectives of the research were, a detailed review of solid waste management practices in Sri Lanka and process of compo sting, Identification of composting strategies & evaluation of systems, and design of a high rate in-vessel composting system. During the design, it was considered to maintain the optimum environmental conditions for higher rate of decomposition by microbial activities, aeration demands, and required moisture content throughout the process. The main component of the model is a rotating drum reactor, which is operated under the thermophilic temperature conditions. The rate of decomposition at thermophilic temperatures is much higher (low residence time) than the mesophilic temperatures. A shredder could be used for size reduction of incoming feed {{in order to determine the}} optimum particle size. As source separation is very poor in Sri Lanka, this research addresses the possibility of using a semi-mechanized waste segregation device at the secondary stage. Special care was taken to control the odor and leachate of the system. On the other hand, the confidence on. low rate windrow / static pile compo sting among the people have been lost due to the process mismanagement. Therefore, the design offers to have an energy optimized semi mechanized system in which minimum labor contact with the waste occurs. The reactor is operated by a feedback control system, in which real-time monitoring of critical parameters are done. Based on the existing value and the set point (optimum value for each parameter: moisture and aeration), the control action is taken. Further, intermittent rotation of the reactor facilitates the proper temperature distribution inside, particle size reduction and uniform porosity throughout the mixture while reducing the energy consumption faced by the continuous operated system. Sensor setup at different heights of the reactor monitors the temperature and moisture content along the axis of the system. It has been observed that moisture is the limiting factor, when the temperature feedback control system is used in the composting. However, real-time monitoring of the moisture content avoids this difficulty. Further, weak pathogen inactivation is a major drawback found in most of the manually turned systems. Intermittent rotation and temperature feedback control system ensure the proper temperature distribution across the reactor and mixes the matrix properly in order to subject to uniform temperature throughout the mass. The modular basis helps for easy movement and it consumes less space compared to the <b>windrow</b> <b>system.</b> According to the national database on solid waste in Sri Lanka, 88 % of Local Authorities collects less than 10 Tons per day. This shows the possibility of use of modular units in areas, where space is limited. Close monitoring of the critical parameters of the system helps to maintain optimal decomposition rates while ensuring consisted product quality during the decomposition. Since organic farming is a growing area in export-oriented agriculture (Tea, vegetables) in our country, this research helps to produce a good soil conditioner (with consistent finished product) using MSW while solving a major environmental problem. Tea plantation companies put special attention to identify the requirements of quality standards for the production of famous 'Ceylon Tea'. Hence as a part of this work, analysis of the critical parameters of the compost, manufactured by different organizations in the country that use solid waste as the substrate was carried out. It is important to match compo sting quality and the particular plantation requirement to develop a sustainable market for the compost produced using MSW. This has been particularly lacking in the Sri Lankan market with the compost producer hoping to realize a good price for anything that is produced; an expectation that had not been realized...|$|E
40|$|Composting {{animal manure}} has the {{potential}} to reduce emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4) from agriculture. Agriculture has been recognized as a major contributor of greenhouse gases, releasing an estimated 81 % and 70 % of the anthropogenic emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4), respectively. A significant amount of methane is emitted during the storage of liquid manure, whereas nitrous oxide is emitted from the storage of manure and from soil following manure or fertilizer application. Composting animal manure can reduce GHG emissions in two ways; by reducing nitrous oxide and methane emissions during manure storage and application, and by reducing the amount of manufactured fertilizers and the GHG associated with their production and use. We will present information of GHG emissions and potentials for reduction based on available data, and on specific composting experiments. Nitrous oxide and methane emissions were monitored on an enclosed composting system processing liquid hog manure. Measurements indicated that total GHG emissions during composting were 24 % of the Tier 2 IPCC estimates for traditional liquid hog manure management on that farm. Previous research has also indicated little nitrous oxide emission following application of composted manure to soil. The method of composting has a large impact on GHG emissions, where GHG emissions are higher from outdoor <b>windrow</b> composting <b>systems</b> than from controlled aerated systems. Further research is required to assess the whole manure management system, but composting appears to have great potential to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture.

40|$|The {{combination}} of increasing quantities of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and increased legislation for {{the disposal of}} this type of waste have created a need to develop different disposal or treatment routes for waste. Approximately 60 % of MSW by mass is biodegradable and many disposal routes for this waste allow energy recovery. However the waste hierarchy presented in the National Waste Strategy for Wales emphasises the importance of materials recovery over energy recovery. It has been shown {{that the only way to}} achieve these targets is through the recovery of catering waste, which requires an in-vessel composting facility. In order to gain an insight into the aeration requirements for in-vessel composting, calculations were performed to ascertain the required airflow for the supply of oxygen, the removal of excess moisture and the removal of excess heat. It was found that approximately 450 kJ are released for each mole of oxygen utilised whilst 500 kJ are released per mole of carbon dioxide evolved. It was found that the air requirement for removal of heat from the process was approximately 100 times greater than the air required to supply oxygen to the system. In order to determine the power of aeration equipment required for composting facilities a static pressure test rig was constructed. From the results gained a model relating the static pressure to the bulk density of compost was developed. Initially a <b>windrow</b> composting <b>system</b> processing green waste at the Carmarthenshire Environmental Resources Trust (CERT) composting facility was studied. A canopy system was developed to monitor the respiration rate of this system and allow comparison between different feedstocks and control strategies. For a green waste only windrow the highest recorded respiration rate was 38 gC 02 kgVS" 1 day" 1. The respiration rate was observed to reduce with temperature above 55 C. In addition to the green waste windrows a temperature managed windrow and a windrow constructed from a mixture of green waste and chicken litter were also tested. The final series of trials involved the testing of the ability of a containerised composting system to meet the Animal By-Products Regulations. The vessel was fed various mixtures of green waste and factory waste. Airflow and insulation within the vessel were analysed and a composting rate of over 45 gC 02 kgVS' 1 day 1 was achieved. If this had been sustained then the vessel may have met the Animal By-Products Regulations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: {{the use of}} {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) compost in agriculture as a soil conditioner is increasing day by day because of its positive effects on biological, physical, and chemical soil properties. However, some of the composts because of contamination with heavy metals and other impurities can have deleterious effects on groundwater quality, agricultural environment, food chain, plant growth and activity of soil microorganisms. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to investigate the physical and chemical properties, fertilizing potential and heavy metal polluting potential of two types {{of municipal}} solid waste composts with processing time between 4 to 8 years (type A) and between 1 to 4 years (type B) produced in Sanandaj city with the aim of using it as an organic fertilizer. Materials and Methods: Sanadaj city, the center of Kurdistan province, with a population of about 335, 000 is located in the west of Iran. The current solid waste generation from the city is about 320 t/day, which are not separated at source of generation. About 200 t of the total produced wastes are composted using an open <b>windrows</b> <b>system</b> at the Sanandaj MSW Composting Plant, which is located in 10 km of Sanadaj-Kamiaran road and the rest are disposed at the landfill site. The compost manufactured by the composting plant has been collected around it in two different locations. The first belonges to the product of 2004 - 2008 (type A) and the second belonges to the product of 2009 - 2013 (type B). Till now, due to lack of quality information associated with these products, they have remained unused. Therefore, in this study, we sampled 3 samples composed of six subsamples (each containing 2 kg) from the products in March 2013. The samples were analyzed to determine the physical properties (including undesirable impurities, initial moisture content, particle size distribution, particle density, bulk density (ρb), porosity, and maximum water holding capacity), and the chemical properties (including organic carbon, ash content, pH and salinity) and total amounts of N, P, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Mn, Fe, Cr, Zn, Pb, Ni and Cd using standard methods. Results and Discussion: The results showed that bulk density, ash content, and the amounts of elements based on the dry weight of compost increased with composting time, however particle size decreased. It is well known that dry bulk density increased with composting time as ash content increased and particle size decreased by decomposition, turning and screening. The decreases of particle size with composting time cause an enrichment of metals based on the dry weight of compost. It is likely due to solubilization of metals in waste by organic acid produced during the microbial decomposition of organic matter and their subsequent adsorption on finer particles due to the higher surface area and the higher ion exchangeable capacity. The evaluation of the fertilizing potential of the surveyed composts by comparing their properties with different standard sets showed that the both composts under test in this study were failed to meet the standard permissible limits with regard to glass content (on average, 21. 7 times over the permissible limit), gravel content (on average, 1. 4 times over the permissible limit), lead content (on average, 1. 6 times over the permissible limit), and salinity content (on average, 1. 4 times over the permissible limit). Furthermore, compost type B also failed to meet the standard permissible limits with regard to initial moisture content (on average, 1. 4 times over the permissible limit) and ρb (0. 2 gcm- 3, less than permissible limit) for agricultural purposes. The results showed that excessive amount of glass impurity bigger than 2 mm, salinity and lead contents are the major problems {{in the use of the}} composts for agricultural purposes. It should be noted that according to the maximum permissible limit of lead (150 - 300 mg kg- 1) for compost C 1 quality class described by Australian standard; both the composts can be used as fertilizers or soil amendments. In order to eliminate glass impurity, remediation approaches such as fine milling and pelleting is needed to disguise the residual glasses and render it as relatively harmless. A feasible approach to eliminate these problems is probably physical fractionation of the studied composts. It allows us to assess the distribution of nutrients and contaminants values in the different physical fractions of the composts, which is useful to detect and to eliminate of the particle sizes which are the responsible for these impurities. Conclusion: The assessment of MSW-based compost for use in agricultural soil as fertilizer or conditioner is a sustainable recycling practice owing to its nutrient content and its positive effects on soil physico-chemical properties. Thus, we evaluated the fertilizing potential of two MSW composts produced in Sanandaj city for agricultural purposes. Altogether, the results of the study showed that excessive amount of glass impurity bigger than 2 mm and salinity were the major problems in the use of the composts for agricultural purpose. As a result, the quality of the surveyed composts was not suitable for agricultural purposes without appropriate remediation of these restrictions...|$|R
40|$|The {{organic waste}} {{disposal}} under anaerobic conditions emits Methane, which causes increased global warming. This study {{attempts to find}} the emission factor in <b>windrow</b> waste composting <b>systems</b> from two sizes of gathered organic waste piles. Designed to compare two groups of composting piles, one pile consisted of 500 kilograms of waste originating from local authorities while the other amounted to 250 kilograms of waste collected from households. With six piles of each type, aeration was done by manual turning and emissions were sampled in closed flux chambers and analyzed by gas chromatographs. A control experiment, modeling landfill sites, {{was set up in}} a one x one x one meter hole. Results from the experiment showed that emission ratios from the 500 kg was 1. 3613 x 10 - 3 g CO 2 -eq kg - 1 wet waste, and 1. 3427 x 10 - 3 g CO 2 -eq kg - 1 wet waste from the 250 kg experiment. The 500 kg experiment decreased emissions by 0. 059185 g CO 2 -eq kg - 1 wet waste and the 250 kg experiment, emissions decreased by 0. 059206 g CO 2 -eq kg - 1 wet waste when compared to the control group. In summary, pile size has no effect on emission ratios. Statistical testing found no significance difference between emissions from the 500 kg compared with the 250 kg. This study tells us that massive landfill or waste composting is difference effect. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT Volume- 5, Issue- 4, Sep-Nov 2016, Page: 44 - 55 </p...|$|R
40|$|In Lithuania, {{as well as}} {{in other}} European {{countries}} one of the main underlying objectives of biodegradable waste (BDW) management is source of all types separation from the generated BDW and its separate treatment. During last years the number of food processing companies, which either treat BDW at (near) the source of generation or produce new surplus value products, experienced a significant growth. The most widely applied BDW treatment methods are biological, which include fermentation and / or aerobic treatment processes and resulting in biogas and compost production. In this paper main attention is allocated to the aerobic food BDW treatment processes. It is really important to select and implement proper treatment technologies, to maintain optimal parameters of a technological process, thus avoiding the increase of the impact to environment and human health due to formation of air emissions, GHG’s, fetid odors and microbiological contamination. The objective of the Master project is to assess possibilities to reduce environmental impact of aerobic treatment BDW in food industry and to offer recommendations relevant to this industry. Object –aerobic treatment processesof BDW at food processing companies, incl. animal by-products (ABPs) This paper presents analysis of the following BDW treatment in food industry: -	vegetable origin (food residues of sugar, oil, beer, juices, alcohol, confectionary and etc. processing companies); -	animal origin (food residues of meat, fish, milk processing companies) (ABPs); -	BDW, generated in catering companies (ABPs); -	Degistates produced from different food BDW, incl. ABPs The final project presents an in-depth analysis of the scientific and technical literature. Chemical and physical characteristics of food waste, incl. ABPs, from food processing companies optimal for compost production were defined. Environmental as well as other legal requirements for both food BDW aerobic treatment and high value compost production, widely used and newest technologies for BDW aerobic treatment were analysed. This paper presents the methodology, which can be applied to evaluate the impact on air quality and climate change. Presented methodology integrates 3 methods : -	estimation of air pollutants emission factors (kg tonne- 1 of BDW); -	preparation of mass and energy balance -	and comparative analysis. The methodology integrates both direct and indirect impact of air emissions (caused by the the additional usage of energy or due to the excess alternative energy production) on air quality, and climate change due to GHG emissions from various stationary and mobile sources within BDW aerobical treatment companies. Emissions’factors (EF) for the evaluation of air pollution and GHGs emissions in all processes were defined using 3 methods presented in EEA/CORINAIR, 2016 [8]; IPCC Guidelines, 2006 [9] and obtained using the results measurements made at Lithuanian BDW treatment companies as well as results of analysis of scientific and technical literature. It was evaluated that open aerobic treatment of digestate has the biggest impact on air quality (up to 0. 749 kg tonne- 1 of BDW), meanwhile the lowest impact is observed during BDW treatment in closed intensive systems at (near) the source of generation (for example: usage of Oklin technology) or during centralized composting, where aerated <b>windrow</b> cover <b>systems,</b> tunnels, boxes or containers with bio-filters are used. In this case, the amount of pollutants, which influence the eutrophication and tropospheric ozone formation processes is estimated to be < 0. 11 kg tonne- 1 of BDW and ≤ 0, 07 kg tonne- 1 of BDW respectively. It was estimated that the biggest impact on climate change due to GHGs emissions have open composting systems (up to 242. 5 kg CO 2 eqv. tonne- 1 of BDW). The lowest impact on a global warming is observed in companies, where the technology of BDW fermentation is applied due to excess alternative energy production (up to 63. 5 kg CO 2 eqv. tonne- 1 of BDW), also in companies, where BDW treatment in closed intensive systems is used (up to 77 kg CO 2 ekv. tonne- 1 of BDW). This paper presents recommendations for food processing companies as well as catering companies how to reduce the environmental impact from air emissions and GHGs during food BDW treatment and production of new surplus value products. Integrated waste management view is applied in recommendations, starting with the elimination of food waste using Cleaner production preventional methods; minimization of BDWs, using proper treatment at (near) the source of generation and production of new higher value-added products, and finishing with proper separation and transfer to waste management companies, which apply the principles of industrial symbiosis in order to transform waste into new products...|$|R
