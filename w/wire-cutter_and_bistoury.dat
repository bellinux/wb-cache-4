5000|$|In 1952 {{there were}} no public {{footpaths}} shown across Thorne Moors on the map then published by West Riding County Council. Public rights of way were governed by regulations and laws, for the interpretation of which a knowledge of Latin, Middle English and Law French was required. While employed as an engineer's fitter, he taught himself these languages and legalese to challenge in Court {{what he saw as}} an illegal enclosure of Thorne Moors. As part of this process of legal challenge he regularly walked the traditional footpaths there, breaking through or removing barriers and confronting the landowners on their own land. He wrote daily protest letters to the authorities. He is said, by Catherine Caufield, to have carried weaponry, including a revolver, swordstick, machete, <b>wire-cutters</b> <b>and</b> his own calling cards to be defiantly left after removing footpath-barriers. He is quoted as saying, [...] "What do you think I use them for, picking my bloody nose?" [...] when asked whether he had fired the gun. The footpaths were reinstated on large-scale maps.|$|R
40|$|EnThe {{increasing}} use {{of laser}} in oral surgery has led to undoubted operative advantages and {{a better quality of}} the outpatient operation compered with electro- <b>and</b> coldblade <b>bistoury.</b> Dental laser allows to obtain a more precise incision, a better recovery, bleeding reduction, shorter working times, post-operative edema reduction, lack of pain, wound sterility and a more aesthetic cicatricial process. It produces also a biostimulation of those cells involved in the recovery process reducing so the recovery times. It has a decontaminating effect of the germs present in the root channels, of parodontis and of the lesions caused by virus, bacteria or mushrooms...|$|R
50|$|The H&K G3 rifle uses {{two types}} of bayonets, both of which mount above the G3s barrel. The first is the {{standard}} G3 bayonet which has a blade similar to the American M7. The second is an EICKHORN KCB-70 type multi-purpose knife bayonet, featuring a clip-point with saw-back, a <b>wire-cutter</b> scabbard <b>and</b> a distinctive squared handgrip. For the H&K G36 there was little use of modified AKM type II blade bayonets from stocks of the former Nationale Volksarmee (National People's Army) of East Germany. The original muzzle-ring was cut away and a new, large diameter muzzle ring welded in place. The original leather belt hanger {{was replaced by a}} complex web and plastic belt hanger designed to fit the West German load bearing equipment.|$|R
25|$|The {{fuselage}} joint at {{the rear}} end of the main section could be broken on landing to facilitate in the rapid unloading of troops and equipment, for which ramps were provided. Initially the tail was severed by detonating a ring of Cordtex around the rear fuselage. But this {{was thought to be}} hazardous, especially if detonated prematurely by enemy fire. In early 1944, a method of detaching the tail was devised that used eight quick-release bolts, <b>and</b> <b>wire-cutters</b> to sever the control cables.|$|R
50|$|The current British L3A1 socket bayonet {{is based}} on the FN FAL Type C socket bayonet with a clip-point blade. It has a hollow handle that fits over the SA80/L85 rifles muzzle and slots that lined up with those on the flash eliminator. The blade is offset {{to the side of the}} handle to allow the bullet to pass beside the blade. It can also be used as a {{multi-purpose}} knife <b>and</b> <b>wire-cutter</b> when combined with its scabbard. The scabbard also has a sharpening stone and folding saw blade.|$|R
5000|$|Financial Times on 31 August 2014 {{wrote that}} the demonstrators armed with wooden clubs <b>and</b> <b>wire-cutters</b> tried to storm the {{official}} residence of Nawaz Sharif. The paper further went on to write that the at least three people were reported killed and hundreds injured in the clashes when police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and wielding batons. The paper claimed that the Pakistan’s army generals are suspected by many elected politicians of having encouraged Khan’s and Qadri’s protests {{so that they can}} exert greater influence over Sharif’s government or depose him.|$|R
50|$|The M16 is 44.25 inches (1124mm) {{long with}} an M7 bayonet attached. The M7 bayonet {{is based on}} earlier designs such as the M4, M5, & M6 bayonets, {{all of which are}} direct {{descendants}} of the M3 Fighting Knife and have spear-point blade with a half sharpened secondary edge. The newer M9 bayonet has a clip-point blade with saw teeth along the spine, and {{can be used as a}} multi-purpose knife <b>and</b> <b>wire-cutter</b> when combined with its scabbard. The current USMC OKC-3S bayonet bears a resemblance to the Marines' iconic Ka-Bar fighting knife with serrations near the handle.|$|R
60|$|In {{addition}} to these powders, the traveller will want Warburg's fever-drops; glycerine or cold cream; mustard-paper for blistering; heartburn lozenges; lint; a small roll of diachylon; lunar-caustic, in a proper holder, to touch old sores with, and for snake-bites; a scalpel <b>and</b> a blunt-pointed <b>bistoury,</b> with which to open abcesses (the blades of these should be waxed, {{to keep them from}} rust); a good pair of forceps, to pull out thorns; a couple of needles, to sew up gashes; waxed thread, or better, silver wire. A mild effervescing aperient, like Moxon's is very convenient. Seidlitz-powders are perhaps a little too strong for frequent use in a tropical climate.|$|R
50|$|The American M16 rifle {{used the}} M7 bayonet {{which is based}} on earlier designs such as the M4, M5 and M6 models, all of which are direct {{descendants}} of the M3 Fighting Knife and have a spear-point blade with a half sharpened secondary edge. The newer M9 has a clip-point blade with saw-teeth along the spine, and {{can be used as a}} multi-purpose knife <b>and</b> <b>wire-cutter</b> when combined with its scabbard. It can even be used by troops to cut their way free through the relatively thin metal skin of a crashed helicopter or airplane. The current USMC OKC-3S bayonet bears a resemblance to the Marines' iconic Ka-Bar fighting knife with serrations near the handle.|$|R
50|$|It was {{considered}} to be sturdy and very manoeuvrable for a glider. The design of the Horsa adopted a high-wing cantilever monoplane configuration, being equipped with wooden wings and a wooden semi-monocoque fuselage. The fuselage was built in three sections bolted together, the front section held the pilot's compartment and main freight loading door, the middle section was accommodation for troops or freight, the rear section supported the tail unit. The fuselage joint at the rear end of the main section could be broken on landing to facilitate in the rapid unloading of troops and equipment, for which ramps were provided. The detachable tail was an afterthought developed during early 1944, and involved the use of eight quick-release bolts <b>and</b> <b>wire-cutters</b> to rapidly detach both the tail unit and its control cables.|$|R
2500|$|The {{artillery}} of II Corps began {{a destructive}} and wire-cutting bombardment on 14 February, {{using the new}} fuze 106 against the German wire, which proved an effective <b>wire-cutter,</b> although fog <b>and</b> mist made aiming and observation of the results difficult. At zero hour, four siege groups were to begin a bombardment of rear lines and machine-gun nests and four counter-battery groups were to neutralise German artillery within range of the attack. Artillery tactics {{were based on the}} experience of 1916, with a creeping barrage fired by half of the 18-pounders, beginning [...] in front of the infantry and moving at [...] in three minutes. Other 18-pounders searched and swept the area from the German trenches to [...] further back in succession, as the British infantry reached and attacked them. The rest of the 18-pounders fired standing barrages on each line of trenches, until the creeping barrage arrived then lifted with it. A protective barrage was then formed beyond the objective, according to the barrage timetable.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{starting}} by suitable superpositions of equal-frequency Bessel beams, {{we develop}} a theoretical and experimental methodology to obtain localized stationary wave fields (with high transverse localization) whose longitudinal intensity pattern can approximately assume any desired shape within a chosen interval 0 <= z <= L of the propagation axis z. Their intensity envelope remains static, i. e., with velocity nu = 0, {{so we have}} named "frozen waves" (FWs) these new solutions to the wave equations (and, in particular, to the Maxwell equation). Inside the envelope of a FW, only the carrier wave propagates. The longitudinal shape, within the interval 0 <= z <= L, can be chosen {{in such a way}} that no nonnegligible field exists outside the predetermined region (consisting, e. g., in one or more high-intensity peaks). Our solutions are notable also for the different and interesting applications they can have-especially in electromagnetism and acoustics-such as optical tweezers, atom guides, optical or acoustic <b>bistouries,</b> <b>and</b> various important medical apparatuses.

Other 18-pounders searched and swept the area from the German trenches to 250 yd further back in succession, as the British infantry reached and attacked them.

5000|$|The AK is 40.15 inches (1020mm) {{long with}} an AKM type bayonet attached. The AK-47 has an {{adequate}} but unremarkable bayonet. However, the AKM Type I bayonet (introduced in 1959) was a revolutionary design. It has a Bowie style (clip-point) blade with sawteeth along the spine, {{and can be}} used as a multi-purpose knife <b>and</b> <b>wire-cutter</b> when combined with its steel scabbard. This design was copied by other Nations and formed the basis of the US M9 bayonet. The AK-74 bayonet (introduced in 1983) represents a further refinement of the AKM bayonet. [...] "It introduced a radical blade cross-section, that has a flat milled on one side near the edge and a corresponding flat milled on the opposite side near the false edge. The blade has a new spear point and an improved one-piece molded plastic grip making it a more effective fighting knife. It also has saw-teeth on the false edge and the usual hole for use as a wire-cutter. Some Chinese AK type rifles such as the Type 56 include an integral folding spike bayonet, similar to the SKS rifle.|$|R

The wire cutting versions of the AK bayonets each have an electrically insulated handle and an electrically insulated part of the scabbard, so it can be used to cut an electrified wire.|$|R
6000|$|It was a {{large and}} lofty room in which the young baronet found himself. The carpet was so soft and thick that his feet made no sound as he walked across it. The two gas jets were turned only half-way up, and the dim light with the faint {{aromatic}} smell which filled the air had a vaguely religious suggestion. He {{sat down in a}} shining leather armchair by the smouldering fire and looked gloomily about him. Two sides of the room were taken up with books, fat and sombre, with broad gold lettering upon their backs. Beside him was the high, old-fashioned mantelpiece of white marble--the top of it strewed with cotton wadding and bandages, graduated measures, and little bottles. There was one with a broad neck just above him containing bluestone, and another narrower one with what looked like the ruins of a broken pipestem and [...] "Caustic" [...] outside upon a red label. Thermometers, hypodermic syringes <b>bistouries</b> <b>and</b> spatulas were scattered about both on the mantelpiece and on the central table {{on either side of the}} sloping desk. On the same table, to the right, stood copies of the five books which Dr. Horace Selby had written upon the subject with which his name is peculiarly associated, while on the left, on the top of a red medical directory, lay a huge glass model of a human eye the size of a turnip, which opened down the centre to expose the lens and double chamber within.|$|R
