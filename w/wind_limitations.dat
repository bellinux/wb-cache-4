A low-order panel method called PMARC (Panel Method Ames Research Center) was used to obtain various aerodynamic parameters and to evaluate the longitudinal and directional stability {{and control of the}} vehicle. In addition, a drag analysis of the vehicle was performed using techniques described in Fluid Dynamic Drag by Hoerner. Drag reduction methods were also investigated. The neutral point of the large tail PIONEER was calculated to be at 74 % of the mean aerodynamic chord (MAC). The small tail neutral point was calculated to be at the 51 %MAC position. Cross <b>wind</b> <b>limitations</b> were obtained for PIONEER. The maximum sideslip angles due to cross wind were determined to be 8. 5 ° and 18 °. For an approach speed of 65 knots, cross wind limits were calculated to be ten knots and 22 knots for the single rudder and du al rudder cases, respectively. Drag polars were plotted for PIONEER. It was determined that drag on the vehicle could be reduced by 29 % using simple and cost effective modifications to the vehicle. Follow-on analysis of PIONEER through the Naval Postgraduate School UAV Flight Test Research Program and through full­ scale wind tunnel testing at the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex were also discussed.

This is currently provided by the Navy's PIPS model which is based on Hibler's (1979) sea ice model which combines the thermodynamic ice heat budget with a dynamic ice model sensitive to the effects of ice thickness and ice strength. The PIPS model simultaneously solves a system of four equations of ice momentum balance, ice rheology, ice thickness, and ice strength. In order to test the performance of Hibler's formulation, another version of it, developed by Lemke et al., (1990), was adapted to the Arctic Ocean. The model was initialized and run using 1986 forcing data and its performance evaluated using Arctic buoy drift data. Results indicate that the model ice drift is principally driven by wind forcing, that its response to changes in weather is rapid and essentially correct, and that it performs better at high wind speeds than at low <b>wind</b> speeds. <b>Limitations</b> to its accuracy were chiefly the result of limits to the precision and resolution of the input data provided to run the model, especially near the ice margins.

Showing great promise is a little-known species of acacia, which can be used in hedge-row-intercropping and in a variety of soil improvement and <b>wind</b> damage <b>limitation</b> measures. Acacia baileyana, or Coo-tamandra wattle as it is known in its native Australia, has many beneficial properties. It is fast growing yet has hard wood; it resprouts after cutting; its leaves are good for fodder and its flowers attract bees. Being leguminous, it improves soil fertility. Its roots not only break up hard clay soils, thus increasing aeration and drainage but, as a result, make essential nutrients more easily available. When interplanted among citrus trees, the acacias also act as a windbreak, reducing wind damage. Coupled with soil improvement, this substantially increases citrus yields. Another little-known acacia found in Costa Rica, A. angustissima, has similar growth habits and properties. Although neither species grows into large trees, they are extremely valuable for use in hedgerow-intercropping systems. They can also be used as pioneer species for rejuvenating degraded land or as a nurse crop for other tree species. A better-known acacia, A. mangium was introduced in Panama not only to help rejuvenate nutrient-poor soils, but also to halt the spread of Imperata cylindrica, a tenacious and noxious weedy grass. Because of its quick growth, A. mangium was able to shade out the weedy grass.

40|$|Square {{lighting}} poles {{with sharp}} or round corners {{have been observed}} to exhibit large amplitude oscillations with a frequency that is near that of their first mode. This frequency is one order of magnitude {{lower than that of}} the vortex shedding frequency for the observed wind speeds. As such, lock-in resonance between the vortex shedding and the poles motions has been ruled out as the cause of these oscillations. In this work, numerical simulations of flows over square cylinders with different aspect ratios and cross-sectional shapes have been carried out to explore and quantify low-frequency variations of the aerodynamic forces and their sources. The results show that low-frequency components are a basic aspect of the flow over finite length cylinders and are associated with the three-dimensional flow characteristics near the free end of the cylinder.

Chemical monolayers have had highly variable success in reducing evaporation rates due breakup and transport by wind-wave action. The effect of wind-wave stretching action on monolayers has not been quantified in the literature. The project aim {{was to develop a}} preliminary Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to determine the average instantaneous shear stresses under wind-wave loadings corresponding to observed monolayer performance limits. Wind speeds of 0. 89 m/s and 7. 33 m/s are considered representative of the lower and upper limits of degraded monolayer performance. ANSYS Fluent was used to develop a preliminary model, comprising a horizontal tank 15 m long by 0. 85 m high with water occupying the bottom half. A constant uniform velocity wind profile was applied to the air inlet for up to five increments of the residence time of three wind speeds, 0. 89 m/s, 4. 11 m/s and 7. 33 m/s. The volume of fluid method was used to capture the movement of the air/water interface. Velocity gradients were extracted from the flow fields and following a one-way analysis of variance test, the average instantaneous shear stresses were determined to be of 0 Pa, 0. 00046 Pa and 0. 00058 Pa for the increasing wind speeds. These results agree with the expectation that the instantaneous shear stress would increase with increasing <b>wind</b> speed. Significant <b>limitations</b> for the preliminary model include insufficient run time and a lack of average instantaneous shear stress validation. Although this study was limited in scope, there is significant potential for model development which will assist in understanding how monolayers are affected by wind waves, and estimating and improving the operational performance of monolayers in reducing evaporation rates from open water reservoirs. ...|$|R

This paper was part of the International Congress and Exposition, Detroit, Michigan, February 23 th- 26 th 1998. The principal development tool for the vehicle aerodynamicist continues to be the full-scale wind tunnel. It is expected that this will continue for many years {{in the absence of a}} reliable alternative. As a true simulation of conditions on the road, the conventional full-scale <b>wind</b> tunnel has <b>limitations.</b> For example, the ground is fixed relative to the vehicle, allowing an unrepresentative boundary layer to develop, and the wheels of the test vehicle do not rotate. These limitations are known to influence measured aerodynamic data. In order to improve the representation of road conditions in the wind tunnel, most of the techniques used have attempted to control the ground plane boundary layer. Only at model scale has the introduction of a moving ground plane and rotating wheels been widely adopted. The Pininfarina full-scale wind tunnel now incorporates the Ground Effect Simulation System which allows testing with a moving belt and rotating wheels. A major feature of this facility is that test vehicles can be easily installed with only minor modifications. This paper compares aerodynamic drag measurements for a large saloon, in various configurations, obtained both in the wind tunnel and on the road. The wind tunnel results are presented for various ground simulations. These are: moving belt with rotating wheels and stationary belt with fixed wheels at Pininfarina, and the conventional fixed ground in the MIRA full-scale wind tunnel. The on-road data is derived from coastdown tests...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{investigations}} undertaken into the reliability, availability {{and maintenance of}} offshore wind farms when considering different maintenance strategies, an understanding of which is fundamental when considering the technical and economical viability of existing and future offshore wind farms. A comprehensive literature review has been undertaken {{in the areas of}} offshore wind farm maintenance strategies, offshore wind turbine reliability and accessibility issues, and CO 2 emissions associated with maintenance expeditions for offshore <b>wind</b> farms. The <b>limitations</b> and disadvantages of current maintenance practices are identified and a planned intervention maintenance policy is proposed and examined in detail. To help design a planned intervention maintenance policy, the offshore wind farm parameters that affect its technical and economical viability have been identified, which become the foundation for developing computer based models using Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the maintenance practices of the planned intervention maintenance policy. Different scenarios of the proposed solution are investigated to help quantify the technical and economical benefits over the current maintenance practises, in terms of wind farm availability, cumulative energy output, production cost of energy and CO 2 emissions. The research on the reliability of offshore wind turbines has shown that the power converter system is a critical item that suffers from high failure rates. This thesis reports upon the investigation of a hot standby redundancy on the wind turbine power converter system. A redundancy model is deployed to simulate the planned intervention maintenance policy for different offshore wind farm case studies in order to establish the effects of the hot standby redundancy on the offshore wind turbine operational performance. The novel contribution of this work is claimed to be in the development of dedicated models for the reliability, availability and maintenance of offshore wind farms, which should lead in establishing a technical and economic benchmark for the parameters affecting offshore wind farms...|$|R
40|$|CFD {{and wind}} tunnel {{simulations}} are complementary {{due to their}} inherent <b>limitations.</b> <b>Wind</b> tunnel tests apply to any hypothesis, but are limited by the tunnel wall interference/blockage, the model details, and even the distortion of the model. CFD are not limited {{in any of these}} ways, but limited in speed and memory and the lack of determinate set of equations. Theoretically, CFD can provide an assessment of any problem in fluid dynamics (Direct Numerical Simulation), but the requirements of speed and memory are far from being met presently, or even in the foreseeable future. Of necessity, present CFD applications, however, employ a turbulence model, which limits its application due to the problems in accuracy and reliability. Given the power of CFD however, the work contained herein makes use of the advantages of CFD and also the wind tunnel, to form a powerful facility for aerodynamic test, i. e., CFD was used to complement and enhance the wind tunnel test, so producing an integrated test facility. A very important aspect in this work is that CFD was used to investigate the blockage correction for wind tunnel tests. By using CFD, the blockage correction could be made directly, in terms of representing the test model and tunnel walls in high fidelity. Meanwhile, the effect of support system on the test model was also investigated by CFD. The numerical results showed significant effect of the strut on the test model in the Argyll Wind Tunnel (Glasgow University), and an interesting result showed that different positions of support system had different effects. This research aimed to utilise CFD to support wind tunnel testing, and its ultimate purpose is to form a powerful facility for aerodynamic test by combining CFD and wind tunnel. The contributions are summarised as follows: The calibrations of wind tunnel by CFD simulations; A proposed improvement for moving belt system by CFD tools; Blockage correction of wind tunnel by CFD method; and The confirmation of CFD results by wind tunnel model test...|$|R
40|$|Time-dependent variational data {{assimilation}} {{allows the}} possibility of extracting wind information from observations of long-lived trace gases. Since trace gas observations are not available at sufficient resolution for deriving feature-track winds, they must be combined with model background information to produce an analysis. If done with time-dependent variational assimilation, wind information may be extracted via the adjoint of the linearized tracer continuity equation. This paper presents idealized experiments that illustrate the mechanics of tracer-wind extraction and demonstrate some {{of the limitations of}} this procedure. We first examine tracer-wind extraction using a simple one-dimensional advection equation. The analytic solution for a single trace gas observation is discussed along with numerical solutions for multiple observations. The limitations of tracer-wind extraction are then explored using highly idealized ozone experiments performed with a development version of the Navy Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM) in which stratospheric globally-distributed hourly stratospheric ozone profiles are assimilated in a single 6 -h update cycle in January 2009. Starting with perfect background ozone conditions, but imperfect dynamical conditions, ozone errors develop over the 6 -h background window. Wind increments are introduced in the analysis {{in order to reduce the}} differences between background ozone and ozone observations. For "perfect" observations (unbiased and no random error), this results in root mean square (RMS) vector wind error reductions of up to &sim; 3 m s&minus; 1 in the winter hemisphere and tropics. Wind extraction is more difficult in the summer hemisphere due to weak ozone gradients and smaller background <b>wind</b> errors. The <b>limitations</b> of <b>wind</b> extraction are also explored for observations with imposed random errors and for limited sampling patterns. As expected, the amount of wind information extracted degrades as observation errors or data voids increase. In the case of poorly specified observation error covariances, assimilation of ozone data with imposed errors may result in erroneous wind increments, since the assimilation is constrained too tightly to the noisy observations...|$|R
40|$|The Brewer–Dobson {{circulation}} (mainly meridional circulation) is {{very important}} for stratospheric ozone dynamics and thus for the overall state of the stratosphere. There are some indications that the meridional circulation in the stratosphere could be longitudinally dependent, which would {{have an impact on the}} ozone distribution. Therefore, we analyse here the meridional component of the stratospheric wind at northern middle latitudes to study its longitudinal dependence. The analysis is based on the NCEP/NCAR- 1 (National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research), MERRA (Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis) and ERA-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis Interim) reanalysis data. The well-developed two-core structure of strong but opposite meridional winds, one in each hemisphere at 10 hPa at higher northern middle latitudes, and a less pronounced five-core structure at 100 hPa are identified. In the central areas of the two-core structure the meridional and zonal wind magnitudes are comparable. The two-core structure at 10 hPa is almost identical for all three different reanalysis data sets in spite of the different time periods covered. The two-core structure is not associated with tides. However, the two-core structure at the 10 hPa level is related to the Aleutian pressure high at 10 hPa. Zonal wind, temperature and the ozone mixing ratio at 10 hPa also exhibit the effect of the Aleutian high, which thus affects all parameters of the Northern Hemisphere middle stratosphere. Long-term trends in the meridional wind in the "core" areas are significant at the 99 % level. Trends of meridional winds are negative during the period of ozone depletion development (1970 – 1995), while they are positive after the ozone trend turnaround (1996 – 2012). Meridional wind trends are independent of the sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) occurrence and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) phase. The influence of the 11 -year solar cycle on stratospheric winds has been identified only during the west phase of QBO. The well-developed two-core structure in the meridional <b>wind</b> illustrates the <b>limitations</b> of application of the zonal mean concept in studying stratospheric circulation...|$|R
