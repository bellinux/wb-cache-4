25|$|In early January 1945, as PC-1264 {{and other}} escort ships were sailing with a convoy to Key West, the command vessel {{received}} a radio message from Eastern Sea Frontier headquarters detaching {{three of the}} ships, including PC-1264, and ordering their return to New York. While PC-1264 would escort one more convoy during the war, her primary mission now was anti-submarine duty. The capture of German spies landed by U-1230 during November 1944, and the statement {{by one of the}} spies that the Germans were preparing to launch V-1 and V-2 rockets by submarines against major U.S. ports, forced the U.S. Navy to respond by increasing its active anti-submarine forces. The PC-1264 <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> increase and began patrolling areas from Long Island south to Cape Charles, the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E

25|$|Most likely, the Arabian {{physicians}} became {{familiar with}} the Graeco-Roman and late Hellenistic medicine through direct contact with physicians who were practicing in the newly conquered regions rather than by reading the original or translated works. The translation of {{the capital of the}} emerging Islamic world to Damascus may have facilitated this contact, as Syrian medicine <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> ancient tradition. The names of two Christian physicians are known: Ibn Aṯāl worked at the court of Muawiyah I, the founder of the Umayyad dynasty. The caliph abused his knowledge in order to get rid of some of his enemies by way of poisoning. Likewise, Abu l-Ḥakam, who was responsible for the preparation of drugs, was employed by Muawiah. His son, grandson, and great-grandson were also serving the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphate.|$|E
25|$|During {{his playing}} days, Shahid {{was known for}} his running ability, {{dribbling}} of the ball and push which was as fast as a hard hit. His attacking partnership on the field with Zafar Iqbal was well known."Zafar at left-out and Shahid at right-in positions penetrated the best of the defences around the world with their superb understanding and passing of the ball. Zafar also pointed that Shahid was instrumental in the V. Baskaran-led India winning the gold medal at the 1980 Olympics Games. “Shahid played a crucial role for India in that Olympics, otherwise we would have been difficulty,” Zafar, who <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> team, pointed."He was awarded the 'Best Forward player' at the 1980 Champions Trophy in Karachi. He {{was a member of the}} team that won the gold at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, silver at the 1982 Asian Games and bronze at the 1986 Asian Games. He also played in the World Cup in Mumbai (then Bombay) in 1981–82, the Los Angeles Olympic Games in 1984 and the Seoul Games in 1988.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, the United States, {{having failed}} to obtain from Colombia the right to build a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, which <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> country, sent {{warships}} in support of Panamanian independence from Colombia. This being achieved, the new nation of Panama ceded to the Americans the rights they wanted in the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty. Over time, though, {{the existence of the}} Canal Zone, a political exclave of the United States that cut Panama geographically in half and had its own courts, police, and civil government, became a cause of conflict between the two countries. Demonstrations occurred {{at the opening of the}} Thatcher Ferry Bridge, now known as the Bridge of the Americas, in 1962 and serious rioting occurred in January 1964. This led to the United States easing its controls in the Zone. For example, Panamanian flags were allowed to be flown alongside American ones. After extensive negotiations, the Canal Zone ceased to exist on October 1, 1979, in compliance with provisions of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties.|$|E

25|$|One {{potential}} {{motive for}} the novel, {{or at least one}} political inspiration, was Behn's view that Surinam was a fruitful and potentially wealthy settlement that needed only a true noble to lead it. Like others sent to investigate the colony, she felt that Charles was not properly informed of the place's potential. When Charles gave up Surinam in 1667 with the Treaty of Breda, Behn was dismayed. This dismay is enacted in the novel in a graphic fashion: if the English, with their aristocracy, mismanaged the colony and the slaves by having an insufficiently noble ruler there, then the democratic and mercantile Dutch would be far worse. Accordingly, the passionate misrule of Byam is replaced by the efficient and immoral management of the Dutch. Charles had a strategy for a united North American presence, however, and his gaining of New Amsterdam for Surinam <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> larger vision. Neither Charles II nor Aphra Behn could have known how correct Charles's bargain was, but Oroonoko {{can be seen as a}} royalist's demurral.|$|E
25|$|Farrar, Haussler, and Hushovd drew {{frequent}} mention as pre-race favorites and contenders at {{events like}} Dwars door Vlaanderen, E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke, and Gent–Wevelgem. While {{the team had}} solid high placings at each of these races, they missed out on winning any of them. At Dwars door Vlaanderen, two riders finished ahead of the fast-charging reduced peloton to decide the race themselves. Nick Nuyens and Geraint Thomas had no measurable time gap over the field, but held on for first and second places. Farrar won the sprint from the 30-man peloton, {{but it was not}} for the victory, instead merely to round out the podium in third place. Fabian Cancellara took a dominant win at the E3, finishing a minute clear of the next group on the road. Vanmarcke <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> second group, narrowly missing out in the sprint for the remaining podium places to take fourth overall. Farrar was again third at Gent–Wevelgem, finishing behind Tom Boonen and Daniele Bennati in a hectic reduced sprint. In April, Hesjedal took fourth behind Samuel Sánchez at the GP Miguel Indurain.|$|E

40|$|Theorising {{the interplay}} of {{structure}} and agency is the quintessential focus of sociological endeavour. This paper aims to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> continuing endeavour, arguing for a stratified social ontology, where structure and agency are held to be irreducible {{to each other and}} causally efficacious, yet necessarily interdependent. It thus aims not to <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> on-going journey in search of the 'ontological holy grail'. Instead, it offers a way of linking structure and agency which enables the practical education researcher concretely to examine their relative interplay over time. The methodological key to teasing out their relative interplay is held to be analytical dualism. It will be argued that such a methodological device if precluded by Giddens' structuration theory...|$|R
500|$|It also {{revealed}} that a mixtape, titled Welcome to the New Administration, was available for download for free on the FriendsOrEnemies website. The mixtape contained several snippets of new Fall Out Boy tracks, {{as well as new}} music from other bands such as Gym Class Heroes, Cobra Starship, and Panic! at the Disco. However none of the titles were confirmed for Folie à Deux. It also featured a song titled [...] "America's Sweethearts" [...] which was eventually confirmed for the album but with an alternate spelling, [...] "America's Suitehearts". The band confirmed that it intended to release the mixtape in conjunction with the [...] "Citizens" [...] campaign, and felt that it was relevant to not only the themes of the album, but the 2008 election as well. Wentz explained [...] "The whole campaign is part of the record and people can call it whatever they want, but the mixtape <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> campaign, and we'll see what happens from here...In creating this autocratic organization, we created a democratic campaign, because people have made it go the direction they wanted it to go." ...|$|E
500|$|Having caught Kern and Feillu on the road, {{the group}} lost {{ground to the}} peloton and with Wiggins later joining up with the group, Evans' efforts were in vain; with the group now back {{together}} as a whole, their efforts {{went back to the}} original break. Kern was part of another six-rider wave that went clear on the descent from the Col de Richemond, with the highest-placed rider being ninth-placed Luis León Sánchez of [...] [...] took up station {{on the front of the}} main field, not allowing Sánchez to gain too much ground. The gap peaked out at around the 30-second mark and with nobody looking to help Sánchez with the pace-making in the group, they sat up and allowed to be reabsorbed into the peloton. 's Arthur Vichot attacked out of the lead group with around [...] to go, and soloed away from his breakaway companions to take the victory by 26 seconds from the rest of the group. The peloton crossed the line around one minute down on Vichot, with Wiggins maintaining his 38-second overall lead as he <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> group.|$|E
500|$|The {{strike was}} the harbinger of the 1995 {{season for the}} Yankees. Although the Red Sox jumped out to a fast start and {{finished}} the season in first place, the Yankees were not serious contenders for the division title. With the Yankees clinching the inaugural American League Wild Card {{on the last day}} of the season, the Yankees and Red Sox reached the post-season in the same season for the first time. Before the postseason began, Mattingly contemplated about the first-ever playoff series in the rivalry, saying, [...] "That would be pretty cool. It wouldn't hurt the rivalry any. There'd be a few deaths...just kidding". Both teams lost in separate ALDS series, with the Red Sox being swept by the Cleveland Indians and the Yankees losing in five games to the Seattle Mariners. For the Yankees, the loss led to another post-strike fallout: both Showalter and general manager Gene Michael were fired as a result of the loss. Similarly, the firing of Michael as Yankees manager and the loss in the 1981 World Series were fallouts from the strike that year. In fact, the 1981 strike was antecedence to the Yankees' demise and downfall of the 1980s and 1990s and the strike in 1994 <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> demise.|$|E

500|$|U2 {{first visited}} Australia and New Zealand in 1984 to open The Unforgettable Fire Tour. After a 24-hour flight into Auckland, lead singer Bono {{was unable to}} adjust to the time {{difference}} between New Zealand and Europe. He left his hotel room during the night and met some people who showed him around the city. Greg Carroll <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> group: he had met U2's production manager Steve Iredale and been offered a job helping the band for their upcoming concert on account of Greg's experience with local rock bands. They ended up taking Bono up One Tree Hill (Maungakiekie), one of the highest – and more spiritually significant to Māori people – of Auckland's largest volcanoes. Greg worked as a stage hand gently stopping people getting on stage, and was described as [...] "this very helpful fellah running around the place". U2's manager Paul McGuinness thought Carroll was so helpful that he should accompany the band {{for the remainder of the}} tour. The group helped him obtain a passport, and he subsequently joined them on the road in Australia and the United States as their assistant. He became very close friends with Bono and his wife Ali Hewson, and following the conclusion of the tour, he worked for U2 in Dublin.|$|E
500|$|A {{primary reason}} {{the product was}} brought back was because of a new {{approach}} the company was taking regarding new and limited time offering (LTO) products. [...] Instead of putting out large numbers of products that may only appeal to a small audience, it would only add a smaller amount of products that have broader market appeal. Along with its BK Chicken Fries product, the Big King <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> goal, with the reintroduction utilizing a three prong approach: its stated intention to introduce products to those that will have most impact, a bid to appeal to Millennials utilizing social media focused campaigns, and to utilize a former product from its portfolio that the company probably should have thought about before discontinuing. The idea of reintroducing older, possibly discontinued products is appealing to companies such as Burger King and McDonald's because it is operationally easier than launching a completely new product. In many cases the reintroduction allows these companies to utilize older advertising along with its existing supply chain which is already established to deliver the product ingredients while catering to the public's feelings of nostalgia for these products. The limited-time offers allow chains to bring [...] "new" [...] products to the menu without adding permanent complexity to their kitchen operations. The Chicken Big King was introduced because of an increased spike in demand for chicken-based products, coupled {{with the success of}} the Big King's reintroduction.|$|E
