5|$|HHT is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} by definition. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, {{which means that}} an affected person carries one abnormal gene with a 50% chance of passing this gene to offspring.

It seems that carrying two abnormal copies of the gene is not compatible <b>with</b> <b>life,</b> and hence no homozygotes have been described.|$|E

30|$|An {{adjusted}} {{model was}} achieved for satisfaction <b>with</b> family <b>life</b> [F(4)[*]=[*] 16.497, p[*]≤[*]. 05], and the variance {{explained by the}} final model was of 4.6  %. Considering satisfaction <b>with</b> family <b>life,</b> {{there is no significant}} impact of gender and a low impact of FAS. The higher association is with age (older adolescents feeling worst <b>with</b> family <b>life)</b> and having a CC that affects school participation makes adolescents feel worst <b>with</b> family <b>life,</b> <b>with</b> a much higher impact than merely considering having or not a CC. With a much lower impact, having a higher FAS makes adolescents feel more satisfaction <b>with</b> family <b>life.</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{her return}} to London in early 1937, {{recognising}} {{that she was not}} going to be a success on the stage David abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career. Later in the year she took a post as a junior assistant at the fashion house of Worth, where smart young women from upper class backgrounds were sought after as recruits. She found the subservience of retail work irksome, and resigned in early 1938. Over the next few months she spent time holidaying in the south of France and on Corsica, where she was greatly taken with the outgoing nature of the people she stayed with and the simple excellence of their food. After returning to London, and disenchanted <b>with</b> <b>life</b> there, she joined Cowan in buying a boat, just big enough to suffice, with the intention of sailing it to Greece. They crossed the Channel in July 1939 and navigated the boat through the canal system of France to the Mediterranean coast.|$|E

5|$|All kanyas lack {{mothers in}} their life. Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Sita and Draupadi have supernatural births, while Kunti is adopted at birth and {{separated}} from a mother. Though all of kanyas {{are described as}} mothers, except Kunti, no kanya's motherhood is emphasized in their tales. Another common element {{is the theme of}} loss in their legends. Ahalya is cursed and abandoned by her family. Tara loses her husband, Draupadi her sons and Mandodari her husband, sons and kin in war. Each of them suffers a tragedy and used by men, but battles on <b>with</b> <b>life</b> and society. They are considered by Mr Pradip Bhattacharya as victims of patriarchal myth-making, however orthodox Hindus usually oppose such theoretical speculation and consider such speculation distorting the message. A free-spirited Ahalya is punished for her adultery. Druapadi, who challenges and mocks even her husbands, has her dignity repeatedly violated by men.|$|E
