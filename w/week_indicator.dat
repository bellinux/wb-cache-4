40|$|In aquaculture, acute infections {{may result}} in fish mortality, {{but in many cases}} the chronic effects of infections are not readily detected, and {{may result in}} a {{decrease}} in fish growth. Ligictaluridus floridanus is a gill monogenean parasite prevalent on channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) farms in Northeastern Mexico. In order to assess and evaluate the impact of the chronic infection with this monogenean, 400 six-month-old catfish fingerlings from a hatchery, with a fork length of 10 – 15 cm were used in this study. Catfish naturally infected with L. floridanus (parasite abundance was 18) were divided in two groups of 200 fish. One group was treated with formalin, and infection was eliminated during a week, while the other group was not treated, and was used as a control. In total, 111 fish of each group were selected, placed into aquaria, and observed for 12 <b>weeks.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of growth such as fork length, mean weight, condition index, specific growth rate, feed conversion index and feed consumed were assessed. Significant differences (P < 0. 05) between the treated group and control were found in the mean weight (127. 85 g and 107. 63 g) and specific growth rate (1. 79 and 1. 58), respectively.

40|$|Background: Health {{professionals}} {{have a role}} to play in the promotion of physical activity in order to prevent the ever-increasing burden of diseases associated with physical inactivity. Determination of the level of physical activity amongst health professionals managing patients presenting with various lifestyle-related conditions is most pertinent. Object: The purpose of the present study was to ascertain the level of physical activity of health professionals at Estcourt Hospital in KwaZulu-Natal Province. Method: A cross-sectional survey of 109 health professionals was conducted over a period of three consecutive weeks in 2012. The Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) and other related data such as socio-demographic characteristics was used to collect data. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics to determine relationships between variables. An analysis guide was used to determine the level of physical activity with reference to the GPAQ guidelines recommended by the Word Health Organization using the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) -minutes per <b>week</b> <b>indicators.</b> Results: The overall level of physical activity was: 31 % of participants were high, with METminutes/week ≥ 3000; 29 % were moderate, with MET-minutes/week ≥ 600; and 40 % were low, with MET-minutes/week < 600. Although black women predominantly reported low levels of physical activity, age was found to be significantly related to the level of physical activity (p = 0. 000, r = - 0. 637).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify parameters among saquinavir pharmacokinetics, patients' demographics or comedications, to be addressed for improved personalized therapy. The presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA at therapy week 48 (principal target parameter), CD 4 cell count at week 48, infections and side effects during 48 <b>weeks,</b> <b>indicators</b> of liver toxicity and lipid abnormalities at week 48, and a 12 -h saquinavir plasma concentration-versus-time profile were assessed in 56 patients receiving saquinavir-ritonavir (1, 000 and 100 mg, respectively) twice daily (44 therapy-naïve and 12 antiretrovirally pretreated patients) for association with saquinavir plasma concentrations, demographics, baseline values of target parameters, and coadministered antiretrovirals. Antiretroviral failure was observed in 8 of the 56 patients in whom HIV- 1 RNA was detectable at week 48. This therapeutic failure was not associated with individual saquinavir pharmacokinetics. More likely, therapeutic failure was related to incidences interfering with antiretroviral therapy, causing therapy interruptions or incompliance. Weak associations were, however, seen between high maximum saquinavir plasma concentrations and both CD 4 counts of ≥ 200 cells μl− 1 at week 48 (P = 0. 014) and constitutional side effects during 48 weeks (P = 0. 002). However, patients with high CD 4 counts and constitutional side effects were not identical (P = 0. 53). Saquinavir therapeutic drug monitoring in patients infected with protease inhibitor-susceptible HIV- 1 taking saquinavir-ritonavir (1, 000 and 100 mg, respectively) is not demanded for improving the antiretroviral effect.

40|$|Enteric dysbiosis {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Detailed characterization of the alterations in the gut microbiome is needed for understanding their pathogenic role in ALD and developing effective therapeutic approaches using probiotic supplementation. Mice were fed liquid Lieber-DeCarli diet without or with alcohol (5 % v/v) for 6 weeks. A subset of mice were administered the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) from 6 to 8 <b>weeks.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of intestinal permeability, hepatic steatosis, inflammation and injury were evaluated. Metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome was performed by analyzing the fecal DNA by amplification of the V 3 -V 5 regions of the 16 S rRNA gene and large-scale parallel pyrosequencing on the 454 FLX Titanium platform. Chronic ethanol feeding caused a decline in the abundance of both Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes phyla, with a proportional increase in the gram negative Proteobacteria and gram positive Actinobacteria phyla; the bacterial genera that showed the biggest expansion were the gram negative alkaline tolerant Alcaligenes and gram positive Corynebacterium. Commensurate with the qualitative and quantitative alterations in the microbiome, ethanol caused an increase in plasma endotoxin, fecal pH, hepatic inflammation and injury. Notably, the ethanol-induced pathogenic changes in the microbiome and the liver were prevented by LGG supplementation. Overall, significant alterations in the gut microbiome over time occur in response to chronic alcohol exposure and correspond to increases in intestinal barrier dysfunction and development of ALD. Moreover, the altered bacterial communities of the gut may serve as significant therapeutic target for the prevention/treatment of chronic alcohol intake induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and liver disease...|$|R

The aim to investigate content and balance of trace elements (Fe, Cu, Co, Zn, Mg, Mn) in placenta in different terms of gestation. Materials and methods. We studied content and balance of essential trace elements (Fe, Cu, Co, Zn, Mg, Mn) in placenta of 52 women which born babies in different terms of gestation. The content of micronutrients studied using atomic absorption spectrophotometer C- 115 MI. Results. We established average content and ratio of essential trace elements in placenta of women which born babies on 24 - 28, 29 - 31, 32 - 36 and 37 - 41 week of gestation. Conclusions. Intensive processes of accumulation and transport of essential trace elements took place in placenta during gestation. It was noted that the content of Fe, Cu and Zn was increased during gestation process and reached maximum level on 29 - 31 week of gestation. Mn content reached maximum level on 32 - 36 <b>weeks.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of Co in placenta gradually increased from 24 - 28 week of gestation and Mg level by contrast reduced. In addition, we investigated the ratio of essential trace elements in placenta, which showed that in pairs Fe/Co, Cu/Co, Zn/Mn and Mg/Mn we observed a significant decreasing of indicators (p< 0. 05) from 24 to 36 week of gestation, and in pairs Fe/Mg, Cu/Zn, Cu/Mg and Co/Mg - significant increasing of indicators during gestational process. Also we found a positive correlation between Cu and Mn (rxy= 0. 5732, p< 0. 05) at 24 - 28 weeks of gestation, Mg and Mn (rxy= 0. 5855, p< 0. 05) on 32 - 36 weeks, Mg and Mn on 29 - 31 weeks (rxy= 0. 8272, p< 0. 01) and Zn and Mn on 32 - 36 week of gestation (rxy= 0. 8097, p< 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Several {{recent studies}} have {{reported}} associations between short term changes in air pollution and respiratory hospital admissions. This relationship was examined in two cities with substantially different levels of sulphur dioxide (SO 2) but similar levels of airborne particles {{in an attempt to}} separate the effects of the two pollutants. Significant differences in weather between the two cities allowed the evaluation of that potential confounder also. METHODS [...] Daily counts of admissions to all hospitals for respiratory disease (ICD 9 460 - 519) were constructed for persons aged 65 years and older in two cities - New Haven, Connecticut and Tacoma, Washington. Each city was analysed separately. Average daily concentrations of SO 2, inhalable particles (PM 10), and ozone were computed from all monitors in each city, and daily average temperature and humidity were obtained from the US weather service. Daily respiratory admission counts were regressed on temperature, humidity, day of the <b>week</b> <b>indicators,</b> and air pollution. A 19 day weighted moving regression filter was used to remove all seasonal and subseasonal patterns from the data. Possible U-shaped dependence of admissions on temperature was dealt with using indicator variables for eight categories each of temperature and humidity. Each pollutant was first examined individually and then multiple pollutant models were fitted. RESULTS [...] All three pollutants were associated with respiratory hospital admissions of the elderly. The PM 10 associations were little changed by control for either ozone or SO 2. The ozone association was likewise independent of the other pollutants. The SO 2 association was substantially attenuated by control for ozone in both cities, and by control for PM 10 in Tacoma. The magnitude of the effect was small (relative risk 1. 06 in New Haven and 1. 10 in Tacoma for a 50 micrograms/m 3 increase in PM 10, for example) but, given the ubiquitous exposure, this has some public health significance. CONCLUSIONS [...] Air pollution concentrations within current guidelines were associated with increased respiratory hospital admissions of the elderly. The strongest evidence for an independent association was for PM 10, followed by ozone. These results are consistent with other studies and suggest that lowering air pollution concentrations would have some impact on public health...|$|R

The community-based longitudinal Asymptomatic Polyvascular Abnormalities Community Study (APAC) included a sub-population of the Kailuan study {{which consisted of}} 101, 510 employees and retirees of a coal mining industry. Based on the Chinese National Census 2010 and excluding individuals with history of cerebrovascular ischemic events, 4004 individuals were included into the APAC. All participants underwent a detailed clinical examination including blood laboratory tests and carotid artery duplex ultrasound examination. The cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) was estimated using the formula: CSFP[mmHg] = 0. 44 xBody Mass Index[kg/m 2]+ 0. 16 xDiastolic Blood Pressure[mmHg]- 0. 18 x Age[Years]- 1. 91. In multivariable analysis (goodness of fit r 2 : 0. 12), thicker retinal arteries were associated with a thinner common carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) (P = 0. 002; standardized regression coefficient beta:- 0. 06; non-standardized regression coefficient B:- 6. 92; 95 % confidence interval (CI) :- 11. 2,- 2. 61) after adjusting for thicker retinal nerve fiber layer (P< 0. 001;beta: 0. 18;B: 0. 35; 95 %CI: 0. 28, 0. 42), lower diastolic blood pressure (P< 0. 001;beta:- 0. 16;B:- 0. 17; 95 %CI:- 0. 21,- 0. 3), younger age (P< 0. 001;beta:- 0. 08; B:- 0. 16; 95 %;CI:- 0. 25,- 0. 08), and less abdominal circumference (P = 0. 003;beta:- 0. 06;B:- 0. 11; 95 %CI:- 0. 18,- 0. 03). Thicker retinal vein diameter was associated (r = 0. 40) with higher estimated CSFP (P< 0. 001;beta: 0. 09;B: 0. 78; 95 %CI: 0. 47, 1. 08) after adjusting for wider retinal arteries (P< 0. 001;beta: 0. 27;B: 0. 36; 95 %CI: 0. 31, 0. 41), thicker retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (P = 0. 03;beta: 0. 22;B: 0. 56; 95 %CI: 0. 46, 0. 65) and male gender (P< 0. 001;beta:- 0. 08;B:- 3. 98; 95 %CI:- 5. 88, 2. 09).

Against the background of the fairness of differences in income level between GPs the question is posed to what extent differences in list size reflect differences in workload and to what extent differences in patient characteristics influence workload. Both list size and practice composition relate to the demand led character of general practice. Data collected in the National Study of Morbidity and Interventions in General Practice are used. Central to this study is a three month recording of all contacts of 161 general practitioners (and their locums, assistant GPs and trainees) in the Netherlands. For each practice a patient register has been made to relate contacts to the practice population. The participating GPs kept a detailed diary covering 24 hr a day during one <b>week.</b> As <b>indicators</b> of workload several contact rates, hours worked in practice per week (in direct patient care and in other activities) and average length of office consultations are used. Demand related characteristics have the strongest relation to the number of hours worked by GPs, particularly the number of hours spent in patient-related activities. Rates of contacts, with the exception of the office contact rate, are not related to list size, but mainly to practice composition. The average length of consultations is negatively related to list size and some characteristics of the practice population. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

Sony defended the game's sales, stating the abundance of other released titles at Christmas was a factor. A representative from SCEE said [...] "In other times of the year it would be a clear number one, so you have to put the chart in context." [...] Due to the game's last-minute recall and subsequent delay, LittleBigPlanet was released mid-week and as a result, its first <b>week</b> performance <b>indicators</b> are based on four days instead of the usual seven. This has also been suggested as a contributing factor. Many supporters of the game have suggested that a lack of advertising has let it down although advertising campaigns were launched in North America and Europe which helped to boost the game's sales in the run up to Christmas. After the launch of the UK-based advertising campaign and a decrease in price, LittleBigPlanet sales increased by 58 percent and raised it from 32 to 16 in the videogame charts by mid-December and had sold over 300,000 units by the beginning of February 2009.

Methods In this study, 16 skilled female gymnasts (mean age of 9. 62 ± 1. 45 years) were randomly categorized to two general warm-up with no stretching (NS, n= 8) and general warm-up plus static stretching (SS, n= 8) groups. The warm-up protocol included a 10 -minute jogging, and the Static Stretch (SS) protocol included stretching programs on the different parts of body during four weeks, three times a week. The stretched body parts were the hamstrings, the gluteus, the quadriceps and hip flexors, and the lower back and shoulder. Each body part was stretched two times to the point of slightly painful yet tolerable muscle discomfort, for the duration of 15 seconds. Before and after acute protocol and also after four <b>weeks,</b> the <b>indicators</b> of the equilibrium of anterior-posterior and internal-external pressure fluctuations range, and track length of the anterior-posterior and internal-external pressure center were evaluated by a force plate in four static and dynamic unilateral and bilateral standing positions. Results Results of this study showed that static stretching has a significant effect on decreasing in the performance of balance during vault activity in the chronic compared to acute phase (P = 0. 001). The results also revealed that there was no significant difference in static and dynamic balance with bilateral standing in the NS group in the acute phase compared to the chronic phase (P ≥ 0. 05). However, dynamic balance during unilateral standing in the SW group was significantly decreased after four weeks (P = 0. 001). Conclusions The results may indicate that long duration static stretch exercises can improve static balance during bilateral and unilateral standing in gymnast athletes, yet on the other hand, long duration static stretch exercises may disturb the function of the dynamic balance and so may cause sport injuries in athletics...|$|R
40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) mycelia {{are dependent}} on contact with plant roots for spore formation. In this study, earthworms and collembolans were regarded as potential dispersal vectors of AM fungal spores and hyphae, and we determined how they influenced the extension of AM fungi from host plant roots. Plantago lanceolata seedlings were grown in a mesh bag with an AM inoculurn of dried soil and root pieces from a set-aside agricultural field. The bag {{was placed in a}} growth box that was filled with a mixture of irradiated soil and sand, into which fungal hyphae could grow while roots were retained by the mesh. Three treatments with 15 replicates each were established with an addition of either Lumbricus rubellus, Folsomia candida or no soil fauna into the root-free soil. Five replicates of each treatment were harvested after 6, 10 and 15 weeks. The extension of the AM fungi was determined by measuring PLFA 16 : 1 w 5 and NLFA 16 : 1 w 5 as signature compounds of AM fungal biomass, spore production and mycorrhizal inoculum potential on P lanceolata seedlings. After 10 <b>weeks,</b> all <b>indicators</b> of AM fungal growth showed that the fungi had extended into the whole growth box. Plant shoot biomass of the host plants was greater in the presence of earthworms than other treatments, and the contents of PLFA 16 : 1 w 5 were greater in the earthworm than in the collembolan treatment. The reduced amount of PLFA 18 : 2 w 6, 9 in the collembolan treatment relative to other treatments suggests that saprophytic fungi provided a food source for the collembolans. Spore production and mycorrhizal inoculurn potential were not affected by the presence of soil fauna. We conclude that the biomass of AM fungi was stimulated by earthworms, but that fungal dispersal over 20 cm was not influenced. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Communicating {{building}} {{energy performance}} to building users {{has been identified}} as a significant opportunity to support behaviour change. This research pursues the concept of continuous, automated feedback designed to support motivated building users to learn how their behaviour impacts building energy performance. Automated energy consumption data collection presents an opportunity to develop approaches for continuous feedback systems. However, energy performance is a complex notion and consumption data alone are not suitable to convey performance. In order to be of use, performance indicators designed specifically for providing feedback to building users must reflect changes in user behaviour which may be small relative to total consumption. A new building energy performance indicator is proposed based on the concept of continuous improvement. The indicator combines the benefits of historic and normative feedback by producing a normalised index of improvement or deterioration over time. The indicator is also well suited to communicating building energy performance in a user-friendly way. The indicator is based on a predictive consumption model fitted to data for a rolling baseline period. The scale of the indicator is defined in terms of the variation in baseline model residuals. This allows for a direct comparison between buildings on the basis of improvement or deterioration from the baseline performance. A direct comparison can be made even between very different buildings. A case study of five university buildings is presented. Consumption is predicted at half-hourly resolution using a variation of a standard variable degree day model. The indicator is calculated for each half hour beyond the initial 365 -day baseline period on a rolling basis with a new baseline model being calculated each <b>week.</b> The <b>indicator</b> reflects even small changes to regular consumption patterns, both persistent and transient. Persistent changes are absorbed into the rolling baseline model after a few months. Critically the indicator is sensitive enough to detect small changes in consumption patterns and can be compared between buildings. As a feedback tool the indicator has the benefit of having a common scale and being comparable across buildings...|$|R
40|$|The distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) is {{commonly}} affected in rheumatoid arthritis and {{is associated with}} significant functional morbidity. The aim of our study is to review our results with matched hemi-resection interposition arthroplasty in patients with DRUJ arthritis. This was a retrospective study of 39 patients with 51 wrists that were treated at Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong from 1989 to 2007. All patients underwent matched hemi-resection interposition arthroplasty and dorsal wrist synovectomy. Long arm hinged elbow brace was used for three weeks followed by intensive rehabilitation up to twelve <b>weeks.</b> The <b>indicators</b> of outcome included range of motion assessment, pain, wrist stiffness, grip of strength and need for revision assessed during follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed with student t-test. The average age of patients was 50. 5 years (25 to 77 years) {{and there was a}} 35 : 4 female to male ratio. The average follow up was 4. 5 years ranging from 1 to 18 years. Associated extensor tendon ruptures were found in 31. 4 % patients. The average increase in supination was from 73 degrees preoperatively to 81 degrees at long term follow up (p = 0. 10 at 1 year and 0. 13 at long term follow-up). The average increase in pronation was from 68 degrees preoperatively to 74 degrees on long term follow up (p = 0. 57 at 1 year and 0. 02 at long term follow-up). There was evidence of painless, relatively stiff but functional wrist in 37. 25 % of patients. There was an increase in grip strength from an average of 6. 1 kilogram force preoperatively to an average of 11. 5 kilogram force at follow-up (p = 0. 004 at 1 year and 0. 15 at long term follow-up). Complete relief of ulnar sided pain was seen in 43 wrists (84 %), partial relief was seen in 7 wrists (13. 7 %) and no relief was found in one wrist (1. 9 %). DRUJ arthroplasty is a rewarding procedure and most of the patients obtain pain free movement. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, {{the game}} entered the ELSPA video game charts at number four, then fell to number 19 {{in its second}} week of sale. By 29 November 2008, the game was at number 32 and had sold between 100,000 and 200,000 copies in the UK. In the US, the game sold 356,000 units during October and November placing it fourth amongst all PlayStation 3 {{software}} sales for that period. It entered October's all-platform video game chart at number eight before {{falling out of the}} top 20 by the end of November. Sony defended the game's sales, stating the abundance of other released titles at Christmas was a factor. A representative from SCEE said [...] "In other times of the year it would be a clear number one, so you have to put the chart in context." [...] Due to the game's last-minute recall and subsequent delay, LittleBigPlanet was released mid-week and as a result, its first <b>week</b> performance <b>indicators</b> are based on four days instead of the usual seven. This has also been suggested as a contributing factor. Many supporters of the game have suggested that a lack of advertising has let it down although advertising campaigns were launched in North America and Europe which helped to boost the game's sales in the run up to Christmas. After the launch of the UK-based advertising campaign and a decrease in price, LittleBigPlanet sales increased by 58 percent and raised it from 32 to 16 in the videogame charts by mid-December and had sold over 300,000 units by the beginning of February 2009. In January 2009, Sony announced that the game had sold 611,000 units in North America up to the end of December 2008 and that there were 1.3 million unique users playing LittleBigPlanet. As of March 2010, the game has sold over 3 million copies worldwide. SCEE President Andrew House announced at Gamescom 2010 that the game has now sold over 4.5 million worldwide.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{determine}} the effect of a daily intake of three grams of cinnamon over eight <b>weeks</b> on glycemic <b>indicators,</b> advanced glycation end products, and antioxidant status in patients with type 2 diabetes. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial study, 44 patients with type 2 diabetes, aged 57 ± 8 years, were randomly assigned to take either a three g/day cinnamon supplement (n = 22) or a placebo (n = 22) for eight weeks. We measured the fasting blood glucose, insulin, hemoglobinbA 1 c, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), carboxymethyl lysine, total antioxidant capacity, and malondialdehyde levels at the beginning and the end of the study. Thirty-nine patients (20 in the intervention group and 19 in the control group) completed the study. After an eight-week intervention, changes in the level of fasting blood glucose, insulin, hemoglobinbA 1 c, HOMA-IR, carboxymethyl lysine, total antioxidant capacity, and malondialdehyde were not significant in either group, nor were any significant differences between groups observed in these glycemic and inflammatory indicators at the end of the intervention.

40|$|The {{frequency}} of plasmids in chemically stressed bacterial populations was investigated by individually adding various concentration of kanamycin, ampicillin, and mercuric chloride to soil samples. Viable bacterial populations were enumerated, soil respiration was monitored {{for up to}} 6 <b>weeks</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of physiological stress, and bacterial isolates from stressed and control soils were screened {{for the presence of}} plasmids. Low levels of the chemical stress factors did not for the most part significantly alter population viability, soil respiration, or plasmid frequency. Exposure to high stress levels of mercury and ampicillin, however, resulted in altered numbers of viable organisms, soil respiration, and plasmid frequency. Plasmid frequency increased in response to ampicillin exposure but was not significantly changed after exposure to kanamycin. In mercuric chloride-stressed soils, there was a decrease in plasmid frequency despite an increase in overall mercury resistance of the isolates, suggesting that mercury resistance in these populations is largely, if not completely, chromosome encoded. Chemical stress did not cause an increase in plasmid-mediated multiple resistance. A genetic response (change in plasmid frequency) was not found unless a physiological (phenotypic) response (change in viable cells and respiratory activity) was also observed. The results indicate that a change in plasmid frequency is dependent on both the amount and type of chemical stress...|$|R
40|$|Many popular {{childcare}} books recommend feeding {{babies to}} a schedule, but no large-scale study has ever {{examined the effects}} of schedule-feeding. Here, we examine the relationship between feeding infants to a schedule and two sets of outcomes: mothers’ wellbeing, and children’s longer-term cognitive and academic development. Methods: We used a sample of 10 [*] 419 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a cohort study of children born in the 1990 s in Bristol, UK. Outcomes were compared by whether babies were fed to a schedule at 4 <b>weeks.</b> Maternal wellbeing <b>indicators</b> include measures of sleep sufficiency, maternal confidence and depression, collected when babies were between 8 weeks and 33 months. Children’s outcomes were measured by standardized tests at ages 5, 7, 11 and 14, and by IQ tests at age 8. Results: Mothers who fed to a schedule scored more favourably on all wellbeing measures except depression. However, schedule-fed babies went on to do less well academically than their demand-fed counterparts. After controlling {{for a wide range of}} confounders, schedule-fed babies performed around 17 % of a standard deviation below demand-fed babies in standardized tests at all ages, and 4 points lower in IQ tests at age 8 years. Conclusions: Feeding infants to a schedule is associated with higher levels of maternal wellbeing, but with poorer cognitive and academic outcomes for children...|$|R
40|$|Whereas a {{large number}} of {{empirical}} studies have been devoted to analyzing consumer demand for dietary energy (or dietary quantity), much less {{attention has been paid to}} the demand for dietary quality, an equally important aspect of food security. To address this gap in the literature, this paper uses data from a nationally representative household expenditure survey conducted in Bangladesh in 2000 on the food acquisition behavior of 7, 440 households over a two <b>week</b> period. Two <b>indicators</b> of dietary quality are employed: household protein availability and household diet diversity. Using two-stage least squares regression to correct for the endogeneity of income, we find significant roles of income, education, gender of household head, and prices of key foods. The determination of dietary quality in the country has a strong gender dimension. While male education plays a positive role, female education is found to have a substantially stronger influence. Further, female household headship is associated with lower dietary quality than male headship. Given the crucial roles of income and education in increasing access to a high quality diet, the results call for the continued implementation of well targeted poverty reduction and education programs. Promoting female education and addressing the unique constraints faced by female headed households with respect to diet quality could be a significant policy instrument for government and non-government organizations in addressing food insecurity in Bangladesh.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} and evaluate therapeutic effects of transplantation of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells {{in conjunction with}} cord blood mononuclear cells for late thoracic spinal cord injury. Methods Data from 27 patients with late thoracic spinal cord injury who received transplantation of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in conjunction with cord blood mononuclear cells in Neurosurgery Department of 463 rd Hospital of PLA between July 2006 and July 2008 were collected and analyzed. The full treatment course consisted of 4 consecutive injections at one <b>week</b> apart. <b>Indicators</b> for evaluation followed that of the American Spiral Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) grade, ASIA motor and sensory scores, ASIA visual analog score, and the Ashworth score. The follow-up period was 6 months. Evaluations were made 6 weeks and 6 months after the treatment. Results Improvement from AIS A to AIS B was found in 4 patients. In one patient, improvement from AIS A to AIS C and in one patient from AIS B to AIS C was found 6 weeks after the treatment. The AIS improvement rate was 22. 2 %. In one patient improvement from AIS A to AIS B was found after 6 months. The overall AIS improvement rate was 25. 9 %. ASIA baseline motor scores of lower extremties were 0. 5 ± 1. 5, 1. 7 ± 2. 9, 3. 1 ± 3. 6 before the treatment, 6 weeks and 6 months after the treatment, respectively, and showed a statistically significant improvement (P < 0. 05). ASIA sensory scores including light touch and pinprick were 66. 6 ± 13. 7 and 67. 0 ± 13. 6 respectively before treatment, and they became 68. 8 ± 14. 4, 68. 4 ± 14. 7 and 70. 5 ± 14. 4, 70. 2 ± 14. 4 six weeks and {{six months after the}} treatment.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the clinical effect of 24 -week tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) sequential therapy in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with suboptimal serological response to 48 -week pegylated interferon-α- 2 a (Peg-IFN-α- 2 a) monotherapy. MethodsA total of 21 patients {{who did not}} achieve HBeAg seroconversion after the 48 -week Peg-IFN-α- 2 a monotherapy at a dose of 180 μg/week were enrolled. Among these patients, 11 were given TDF 300 mg/d in addition, the withdrawal of Peg-IFN-α- 2 a after 12 weeks, and TDF monotherapy for 12 weeks; 10 were given sequential adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) monotherapy at a dose of 10 mg/d for 24 <b>weeks.</b> The <b>indicators</b> including HBV DNA, liver and renal function, and HBV serological markers were measured at weeks 12 and 24 of treatment, and the clinical outcome was compared between the two groups. The independent samples t-test was used for comparison of normally distributed continuous data between groups and the paired t-test was used for comparison of normally distributed continuous data within one group; the Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of non-normally distributed continuous data between groups. The Fisher's exact test was used for comparison of categorical data. ResultsAt weeks 12 and 24 of treatment, {{there were no significant}} differences in HBsAg and HBeAg levels between groups (both P＞ 0. 05). At week 24 of treatment, there was no significant difference in HBeAg seroconversion rate between the TDF group and the ADV group ［ 18. 2 % (2 / 11) vs 10. 0 % (1 / 10), P＞ 0. 05 ］. At weeks 12 and 24 of treatment, the TDF group had significant reductions in HBeAg compared with baseline (1. 75 ± 0. 59 log 10 S/CO、 1. 61 ± 0. 70 log 10 S/CO vs 1. 86 ± 0. 58 log 10 S/CO, P= 0. 017 and 0. 027). At week 24 of treatment, the TDF group had a significantly lower alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level than the ADV group ［ 21. 0 (15. 0 - 27. 0) U/L vs 33. 0 (21. 5 - 63. 5) U/L, P= 0. 046 ］. There were no significant differences in estimated glomerular filtration rate at weeks 12 and 24 of treatment between the two groups (both P＞ 0. 05). ConclusionAs for CHB patients with suboptimal serological response to 48 -week Peg-IFN-α- 2 a monotherapy, addition of TDF for 12 weeks and then TDF monotherapy for 12 weeks helps to achieve greater reductions in serum ALT and HBeAg levels compared with sequential ADV therapy...|$|R
40|$|Aim: to {{investigate}} the dynamics of restoration of the amplitude of motion in the ankle joint, {{the quality of life}} and to assess the effects of the breakdown of the Achilles tendon. Material: patients (n= 59, of which n= 30 – the main group and n= 29 – the control group) were examined at 4, 8 and 16 <b>weeks</b> after surgery. <b>Indicators</b> registered with the help of: goniometry; the Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score; the scale of an assessment of consequences and results of Leppilahti implications. Results: the decrease of the total amplitude of the motion in the ankle joint takes place due to the deficiency of the amplitude of the dorsal flexion. At {{the end of the study}} the dorsal flexion rates were significantly better among the patients of main group. In particular, its deficit was 3. 2 ± 1. 85 ° in the main group and 6. 8 ± 2. 06 ° in the control group. The final total score Me (25; 75) was also better according to the questionnaire of the Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score: 82 (78; 84) points against 74 (72; 77) points (p < 0. 01). An assessment of consequences according to the Leppilahti score was 83. 8 ± 8. 58 points in the main group and 70. 7 ± 10. 58 points in the control group (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: means of physical rehabilitation help recover the amplitude of movement in the ankle joint, improve the quality of life and the effects after the rupture of the Achilles tendon.

40|$|AbstractDiabetes is {{the fourth}} major {{cause of death in}} Taiwan. High blood glucose can lead to macrovascular {{diseases}}, small vessel diseases (retinopathy, kidney disease), and neuropathy. This study aimed to investigate whether Monascus-fermented products (ANKASCIN 568 plus) can regulate blood glucose and blood lipids. This study enrolled 39 patients with a fasting blood glucose level between 100  mg/dL and 180  mg/dL, and a glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) level of < 9 %. All patients were randomly divided into placebo (n= 20) and experimental (n= 19) groups. Each patient received two placebo capsules (maltodextrin) or ANKASCIN 568 plus capsules daily for 12 weeks. The patients were screened during follow-up 4 weeks after the administration of sample or placebo had been discontinued. Blood and urine samples were collected at the initial, 6 th week, 12 th week, and 16 th <b>week.</b> The anthropometric <b>indicators</b> of blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose level, postprandial plasma glucose level, insulin level, insulin resistance, blood lipid changes, and liver, kidney, and thyroid function indices were measured. After 6 weeks, changes in fasting blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and total cholesterol (TC) levels showed that ANKASCIN 568 plus had a more favorable effect than the placebo. Compared to baseline, a statistically significant decrease of 8. 5 %, 10. 3 %, and 7. 5 % was observed in fasting blood glucose, LDL-C and, TC levels, respectively (p< 0. 05 for all pairs). Therefore, ANKASCIN 568 plus produced by Monascus purpureus NTU 568 fermentation may be a potentially useful agent for the regulation of blood glucose and blood lipids and for treatment of coronary artery diseases...|$|R
