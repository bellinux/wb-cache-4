5|$|Of these precepts, Mahavira is most {{remembered in}} the Indian traditions for his teachings of ahimsa (non-injury) {{as the supreme}} ethical and moral virtue. Mahavira taught that the {{doctrine}} of non-injury must cover all living beings, and causing injury to any being in any form creates bad karma which affects one's rebirth and future <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> suffering. According to Mahatma Gandhi, Mahāvīra was the greatest authority on Ahimsa.|$|E

It is unclear if and how health <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> levels of vacationers change prior to vacation and what potential determinants are. Our research questions were: (1) How do health <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> change before vacation? (2) Which factors (i. e., vacation anticipation, pre-vacation workload, and homeload) {{are associated with}} health <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> changes before vacation? (3) Are associations between pre-vacation work- and home-load <b>and</b> health <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> changes before vacation different for men and women? In a longitudinal study, 96 Dutch workers reported their health <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> in the two weeks prior to their winter sports vacation. Health <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> decreased significantly from two weeks to one week prior to vacation. Anticipation did not affect health <b>and</b> <b>well-being,</b> whereas pre-vacation workload lowered health <b>and</b> <b>well-being.</b> Pre-vacation homeload was also associated with a decline in pre-vacation health <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> but only for women...|$|R

5|$|If handled {{correctly}} {{early in}} life, guinea pigs become amenable to {{being picked up}} and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself. Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle {{in response to the}} rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored. In Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> forbidden by law.|$|E

However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> poorer sibling relationships as adults.|$|E

5|$|The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) was {{introduced}} in 1995 in the Human Development Report written by the United Nations Development Program in order to add a gender-sensitive dimension to the Human Development Index.

However, feminist economists do not universally agree {{on the use of}} the GDI and some offer improvements to it.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{marriage}} in the Bahá'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity {{between a man and}} a woman and to provide a stable and loving environment for the rearing of children. The Bahá'í teachings on marriage call it a fortress for <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> salvation and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of human society. Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required chastity outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other. Interracial marriage is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{are often}} planted in town environments {{where they are}} known as street trees or amenity trees.

In London for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street trees and to have an increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to one tree for every resident.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of his reign, Jogaila was preoccupied with unrest in the Lithuanian Rus' lands. In 1377–78, Andrei of Polotsk, the eldest son of Algirdas, {{challenged}} Jogaila's authority and sought to become Grand Duke. In 1380, Andrei and another brother, Dmitry, sided with Prince Dmitri of Moscow against Jogaila's alliance with emir Mamai, de facto khan of the Golden Horde. Jogaila failed to support Mamai, lingering {{in the vicinity of the}} battlefield, which led to Mamai's army's significant defeat at the hands of Prince Dmitri in the Battle of Kulikovo. The Muscovites' Pyrrhic victory over the Golden Horde, in the long term, signified, however, the beginning of a slow climb to power by the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which became within a century the most serious rival and threat to the integrity, <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> survival of Lithuania. However, in 1380 Muscovy was greatly weakened by tremendous losses suffered during the battle and thus, in the same year, Jogaila was free to begin a struggle for supremacy with Kęstutis.|$|E

5|$|In the Ramayana, Sita has {{few other}} rakshasi benefactors besides Trijata. When Hanuman – the monkey-general of Rama who was tasked to find Sita – meets her in Lanka, {{she tells him}} that the wife of Vibhishana (the brother of Ravana who sides with Rama in the war) sent her {{daughter}} Kala (in other recensions of the Ramayana, known as Nanda or Anala) to proclaim Ravana's intention to not surrender Sita to Rama, despite {{the advice of the}} wise minister Avindhya and Vibhisana. Another friend, Sarama, consoles Sita when Ravana shows Sita an illusory severed head of Rama. She also informs her of Rama's <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> his entry in Lanka with his army. In some versions of the Ramayana, an interpolated canto mentions how Sarama also tells Sita of the burning of Lanka by Hanuman after his meeting with Sita. Ravana's wife Mandodari is described to have rescued Sita in some versions, when Ravana tries to kill Sita. In later Rama-centric literature, Sarama was identified as Vibishana's wife, while Trijata was regarded as his daughter.|$|E
5|$|Tyler was a slaveholder, at {{one point}} keeping forty slaves at Greenway. Although he {{regarded}} slavery as an evil, and {{did not attempt to}} justify it, he never freed any of his slaves. Tyler considered slavery a part of states’ rights, and therefore the federal government lacked the authority to abolish it. The living conditions of his slaves are not well documented, but historians surmise that he cared for their <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> abstained from physical violence against them.In December 1841, Tyler was attacked by abolitionist publisher Joshua Leavitt, with the unsubstantiated allegation that Tyler had fathered several sons with his slaves, and later sold them. A number of African American families today maintain a belief in their descent from Tyler, but {{there is no evidence of}} such genealogy.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{and many}} {{concerned}} reformers had been attempting {{to improve the}} housing of the working classes since the early 1830s. When Hill began her work, the model dwelling movement had been in existence for twenty years, royal and select committees had sat to examine the problems of urban <b>well-being,</b> <b>and</b> {{the first of many}} tranches of legislation aimed at improving working class housing had been passed. From Hill's point of view these had all failed the poorest members of the working class, the unskilled labourers. She found that their landlords routinely ignored their obligations towards their tenants, and that the tenants were too ignorant and oppressed to better themselves. She tried to find new homes for her charges, but there was a severe shortage of available property, and Hill decided that her only solution was to become a landlord herself. John Ruskin, who was interested in the co-operative guild, knew Hill from her work as his copyist and was impressed by her. As an aesthete and a humanitarian he was affronted by the brutal ugliness of the slums. In 1865, having inherited a substantial sum of money from his father, he acquired for £750 the leases of three cottages of six rooms each in Paradise Place, Marylebone.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} colors {{used in the}} film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and unlikeness to each other. Color differentiation can be traced {{as far back as}} Nemo's childhood, where three girls sit on a bench. They are his possible future wives: Jeanne, Elise, and Anna; one in yellow, the other in blue, and the third in a red dress. In his life with Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, themes associated with the color blue. Choosing Jeanne, Nemo seeks material <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> independence: yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this. The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world. White contains all colors of the visible spectrum; this supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. By the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor). This way we can see that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started, the point at which everything is possible.|$|E
