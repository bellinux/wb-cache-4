Additional tools include fry baskets, which are used to contain foods in a deep fryer and to strain foods when removed from the oil, and cooking thermometers, used to gauge oil temperature.

500|$|Fixation / Kill-green: Kill-green or shāqīng (殺青) {{is done to}} {{stop the}} tea leaf {{oxidation}} at a desired level. This process is accomplished by moderately heating tea leaves, thus deactivating their oxidative enzymes and removing unwanted scents in the leaves, without damaging the flavour of the tea. Traditionally, the tea leaves are panned in a <b>wok</b> <b>or</b> steamed, but with advancements in technology, kill-green is sometimes done by baking or [...] "panning" [...] in a rolling drum. In some white teas and some black teas such as CTC blacks, kill-green is done simultaneously with drying.|$|E

50|$|Pan frying, sautéing and stir-frying involve cooking {{foods in}} {{a thin layer of}} fat on a hot surface, such as a frying pan, griddle, <b>wok,</b> <b>or</b> sauteuse.

50|$|Cooked rice is {{the primary}} ingredient, with myriad of {{additional}} ingredients (sometimes and/or preferably, leftovers), such as vegetables, eggs, meat (chicken, beef, pork), preserved meat (bacon, ham, sausage), seafood (fish, shrimp, crab), mushrooms, among others. Aromatics such as onions, shallots, scallions, and garlic are often added for extra flavor.

5000|$|The average Chinese home uses some {{variation}} of the rectangular-bladed knife, usually around 18 cm to 28 cm (7-11 inches) in length. Traditional knives had a simply-forged, carbon steel blade with a long, ground bevel, but the typical Chinese chef's knife is now a stamped blade. The traditional handle is a full-length tang that is only about 1 or 2 cm wide, which is passed through a metal cap, then {{through the center of}} a round, wood dowel, then bent over and hammered into the end of the handle to retain it. Newer models, particularly those made in Japan or Germany, have full-width tangs and riveted or injection-molded handles, but these handles generally retain something of the traditional, round cross-section. The wide blade of Caidao keeps the cook's fingers well off the cutting surface and the round handle gives a nice [...] "pivot point" [...] for the cutting stroke. The blade has a curvature or rocker along its edge that is generally uniform, improving the knife's ability to chop and mince meats and vegetables. The broad rectangular blade also serves to scoop up chopped food for transport to the <b>wok</b> <b>or</b> bowl. Although it may seem unwieldy, skilled practitioners worldwide may be observed using this style of knife for everything — even carving and fine work normally accomplished with a paring knife.|$|E
5000|$|Stick handles are long, made of steel, and {{are usually}} welded or riveted to the <b>wok</b> basin, <b>or</b> are an actual direct {{extension}} of the metal of the basin. Stick handles are popular in northern China, where food in the wok is frequently turned with a tossing motion of the arm and wrist when stir-frying food. [...] The classic stick handle is made of hollow hammered steel, but other materials may be used, including wood or plastic-covered hand grips. [...] Because of their popularity in northern China, stick-handled woks are {{often referred to as}} [...] "pao woks" [...] or [...] "Peking pans". Stick handles are normally not found on cast iron woks since the wok is either too heavy for the handle or the metal is too thin to handle the tensile stress exerted by the handle. [...] Larger-diameter woks with stick-type handles frequently incorporate a [...] "helper" [...] handle consisting of a loop {{on the opposite side of}} the wok, which aids in handling.|$|R
