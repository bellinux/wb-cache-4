500|$|Manson {{stated that}} {{eliminating}} the corporate pressure and indifference, {{as well as}} the band having a relaxed approach to the making of the record was pivotal for a healthy regroup, writing and recording process. [...] "We didn't put any pressure on ourselves to finish an album... We just took our time and got together in two-week blocks of time - any longer than that I'm sure we would have started getting on each others' nerves.

As a result, I think everybody really enjoyed our time together and really plugged in", she remarked. Never much enjoying being in a studio, Manson relished the record-making process this time around.|$|E

500|$|... "Saddlesore Galactica" [...] {{was written}} by Tim Long and {{directed}} by Lance Kramer {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). The title is a reference to the science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica. The idea of Duncan originally being a diving horse was inspired by an actual diving horse that used to jump into a pool at Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century; a postcard showing this horse was used as a reference by the animators for the scenes featuring the diving. When the animation process began, Kramer drew instructions to his animators on how horses move when they run and how their ankles work. He has said that because Duncan was a large part of the story, [...] "we wanted him to have somewhat of a personality. So <b>when</b> <b>everybody</b> knew how to draw the horse and we got that out of the way, they could animate the horse acting." [...] Voice artist Jim Cummings provided the animal sounds made by Duncan in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Windsor's final episode on 10 September 2010 did not {{end with}} the usual EastEnders theme tune. Instead the {{occasionally}} used [...] "Julia's Theme", a piano version of the theme, was reworked specially for the broadcast, and given the name [...] "Peggy's Theme". The theme {{was created by the}} original theme tune composer, Simon May, who was reportedly thrilled to write the theme tune for Windsor. He added more piano to the theme and gave it a [...] "more melancholy feel". May composed the theme not knowing what would happen on screen, but when Kirkwood brought a rough edit of the episode, May noted that the music fitted perfectly first time, saying it was [...] "remarkable and very moving." [...] The theme features as the lead track on the album The Simon May Collection and was also released as an EP available to download immediately after the episode. He revealed: [...] "All the actors and crew had made a really special couple of shows. My main purpose was to bring something to the table, and I didn't {{think it would be a}} single. [...] But <b>when</b> <b>everybody</b> heard the track they said 'you've got to release that as the single because it's something special'." ...|$|E
500|$|After the song's release, critics heavily {{compared}} its {{lyrics to}} Eminem, and suggested Carey alluded {{to him and}} his 'obsession' with her. [...] "Obsessed" [...] never mentions the rapper's name, although reviewers felt it to be very obvious. The song begins with [...] "I was like, 'Why are you so obsessed with me?'", before the music begins. This line references the 2004 film Mean Girls. As the first verse begins, Carey describes the tracks' subjects constant lies: [...] "All up in the blogs sayin' we met at a bar / When I don't even, know who you are / Sayin' you up in my house sayin' you up in my car / When you in L.A. and I'm at Jermaine's". Additionally, the song suggests the stalker is under the influence of drugs: It must be the weed, it must be the E / 'Cause you be poppin', heard you get it poppin'." [...] During the chorus, Carey confronts her stalker, asking: Why are you so obsessed with me / Boy I wanna know / Lying that you're sexing me / <b>When</b> <b>everybody</b> knows/ It's clear that you're upset with me / Oh, Oh, Oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress / last man on the earth still couldn't get this." [...] During the song's second verse, critics complimented Carey's lyrics, highlighting phrases such as: You're a mom & pop, I'm a corporation / I'm the press conference, you're a conversation", [...] "suggesting the rapper isn't a worthy suitor".|$|E

In July 2010, she placed Miles second on her list of best soap characters. She spoke about how [...] "ridiculous storylines" [...] {{turn out to}} be great onscreen and referred to Miles's visions of Rabbit, which she went on to praise. She said [...] "Miles's grief, his visions of Rabbit and his torment at everyone telling him she wasn't real were devastating to watch, and this was a really interesting avenue to take one of the soap's best-loved characters down that could have spectacularly backfired, but instead, had people bawling their eyes out." [...] Holy Soap have said that Miles's most memorable moment is [...] "When he found student Trey trying to kiss Kirsty, Miles pushed him and found his job as a teacher in jeopardy".
