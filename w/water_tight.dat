5|$|Over the {{following}} century the neglect continued until some basic external renovation work was undertaken between 1965 and 1971, making the structure wind and <b>water</b> <b>tight,</b> although it remained unoccupied. The castle was again abandoned and left unmaintained. The {{condition of the}} building further declined, becoming derelict. It was in a ruinous state when marketed for sale in April 2013 {{after the death of}} Count Robin Mirrlees, who had owned it for about fifty years. At the end of that year it was purchased by the former model Olga Roh, who said she intended to restore it.

25|$|Barrett {{was talking}} to the second engineer, Mr. Hesketh, when the red light and bells came on {{signalling}} the order to stop the engines. He shouted to the men in the boiler room to shut the dampers, the doors to the furnaces and to shut off the wind for the fires. Then he felt a crash and water came pouring in on him from a large tear in the ship's starboard side. Barrett made his way through the <b>water</b> <b>tight</b> door into boiler room 5. He was ordered to go back into boiler room 6, but there was 8 feet of water there. As some of the engineers attended the pumps, the engine room rang for all the stokers to go up on deck. Barrett was ordered to stay behind by an engineer, Mr. Harvey, in boiler room 5 to get some lamps, draw fires, and lift the manhole plate until water started to rush in.|$|E
25|$|Throughout history other wood types, {{including}} chestnut, pine, redwood, and acacia, {{have been}} used in crafting winemaking vessels, particularly large fermentation vats. However none of these wood types possess the compatibility with wine that oak has demonstrated in combining its <b>water</b> <b>tight,</b> yet slightly porous, storage capabilities with the unique flavor and texture characteristic that it can impart to the wine that it is in contact with. Chestnut is very high in tannins and is too porous as a storage barrel and must be coated with paraffin to prevent excessive wine loss through evaporation. Redwood is too rigid to bend into the smaller barrel shapes and imparts an unpleasant flavor. Acacia imparts a yellow tint to the wine. Other hardwoods like apple and cherry wood have an off putting smell. Austrian winemakers have a history of using acacia barrels. Historically, chestnut was used by Beaujolais, Italian and Portuguese wine makers. Some Rhône winemakers still use paraffin coated chestnut barrels but the coating minimizes any effect from the wood making its function similar to a neutral concrete vessel. In Chile there are traditions for using barrels made of rauli wood but it is beginning to fall out of favor due to the musky scent it imparts on wine.|$|E
25|$|Evacuation aids (suppositories or enemas) e.g. {{glycerine}} or bisacodyl suppositories may be prescribed. People {{may have}} poor resting {{tone of the}} anal canal, and consequently {{may not be able}} to retain an enema, in which case transanal irrigation (retrograde anal irrigation) may be a better option, as this equipment utilizes an inflatable catheter to prevent loss of the irrigation tip and to provide a <b>water</b> <b>tight</b> seal during irrigation. A volume of lukewarm water is gently pumped into the colon via the anus. People can be taught how to perform this treatment in their own homes, but it does require special equipment. If the irrigation is efficient, stool will not reach the rectum again for up to 48 hours. By regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation, controlled bowel function is often re-established to a high degree in patients with bowel incontinence and/or constipation. This enables control over the time and place of evacuation and development of a consistent bowel routine. However, persistent leaking of residual irrigation fluid during the day may occur and make this option unhelpful, particularly in persons with obstructed defecation syndrome who may have incomplete evacuation of any rectal contents. Consequently, the best time to carry out the irrigation is typically in the evening, allowing any residual liquid to be passed the next morning before leaving the home. Complications such as electrolyte imbalance and perforation are rare. The effect of transanal irrigation varies considerably. Some individuals experience complete control of incontinence, and other report little or no benefit. It has been suggested that if appropriate, people be offered home retrograde anal irrigation.|$|E
30|$|Intricate {{relationships}} between gas and <b>water</b> in <b>tight</b> sandstone gas reservoirs {{are attributed to}} the fact that the relationship between gas and water is not controlled by structural contours, and thus no unified gas–water interface or even gas–water inversion processes are present (where gas accumulates below water, rather than above it as usual). The Upper Paleozoic tight gas reservoirs, for instance, show complicated gas–water relationships with the presence of <b>water</b> during <b>tight</b> gas operation, no clear regional gas–water inversion processes or apparent edge or bottom water features. Furthermore, gas–water relationship complications are related to highly heterogeneous and well-developed micro-nano pores in tight sandstone reservoirs and show an affinity with gas charging and migration processes. Buoyancy no longer acts as the driving force for natural gas migration and accumulation. Gas rarely migrates long distances within tight sandstone reservoirs and accumulates over short migration distances, typically resulting in poor gas–water differentiation, tangled distribution, and a large number of small water bodies.|$|R

40|$|Some tight {{sandstone}} gas reservoirs contain mobile water, and {{the mobile}} water generally {{has a significant}} impact on the gas flowing in tight pores. The flow behavior of gas and <b>water</b> in <b>tight</b> pores is different than in conventional formations, yet there is a lack of adequate models to predict the gas production and describe the gas-water flow behaviors in water-bearing tight gas reservoirs. Based on the experimental results, this paper presents mathematical models to describe flow behaviors of gas and <b>water</b> in <b>tight</b> gas formations; the threshold pressure gradient, stress sensitivity, and relative permeability are all considered in our models. A numerical simulator using these models has been developed to improve the flow simulation accuracy for water-bearing tight gas reservoirs. The results show that the effect of stress sensitivity becomes larger as water saturation increases, leading to a fast decline of gas production; in addition, the nonlinear flow of gas phase is aggravated with the increase of water saturation and the decrease of permeability. The gas recovery decreases when the threshold pressure gradient (TPG) and stress sensitivity are taken into account. Therefore, a reasonable drawdown pressure should be set to minimize the damage of nonlinear factors to gas recovery...|$|R

500|$|Weezer {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a rating}} out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100. AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave the}} album a [...] rating of {{four and a half}} stars, stated that [...] "this may seem like nothing special -- it's just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but nobody else does it this [...] so well, no matter how many bands try." [...] PopMatters' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review, praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again: [...] "The guitar solos ring out as joyful as the words. And even the songs' lengths are nice and compact. Weezer comes in, plays the song, and exits. No overkill makes for many moments where you want to hear these songs again and again. Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board {{was one of the best}} ideas the band had, as the Green Album is certainly <b>water</b> <b>tight</b> all around." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album a very positive review, saying [...] "After creating the two greatest pop-rock records in existence it's time to add a third.

40|$|Normally in <b>tight</b> gas sands, <b>water</b> {{production}} {{is not a}} problem but in such low permeability reservoirs it is difficult to produce gas at commercial flow rates. Since water is more viscous than gas, very little water is normally produced in low permeability reservoirs. The production of large volumes of <b>water</b> from <b>tight</b> gas sands, say 50 - 100 bbls of water per MMcf of gas constitutes a cause for concern. High water production (> 200 bbls of water per MMcf of gas) has been observed in the low permeability Cotton Valley sands in the Caspiana, Elm Grove and Frierson fields of North Louisiana. This research evaluates water production in the above tight gas sands using field data provided by Matador Resource, a member of the Crisman Institute in Texas A&M university. The research is aimed at providing realistic reservoir scenarios of excess <b>water</b> production in <b>tight</b> gas sands. Log analysis, property trends and well production profiles have been used in establishing the different scenarios.
