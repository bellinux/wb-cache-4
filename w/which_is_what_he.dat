On October 17 he suffered his first defeat, a six-round decision to Victor Lozoya. Over the next six bouts, he went 4–2. Following that, his financial situation dramatically improved (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was trying to achieve early on in his career) and from there he went 28–2–1, with notable wins over Alfred Ankamah, Juan Soberanes, future World Middleweight Champion Sergio Gabriel Martinez, Buck Smith, David Kamau and Frankie Randall, a former World Light Welterweight Champion who became the first man to beat Julio César Chávez in 91 fights.|$|E

He resigned his circuit judgeship on November 19, 1881, after tiring of the [...] "wool sack", <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called his judicial court dress. Former West Virginia Governor John Jeremiah Jacob was appointed by Governor Jacob B. Jackson to fill the remainder of Melvin's unexpired term.|$|E
500|$|One common {{criticism}} of the original Ratchet & Clank was the design and personality of Ratchet. Ted Price, the game's producer, said that to fix this they made Ratchet [...] "less cocky, he is much more friendly to Clank, and he's able to handle himself better in stressful situations without being impetuous, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was in Ratchet 1." [...] In addition, James Arnold Taylor replaces Mikey Kelley as the character's voice actor, providing a more mature-sounding voice. The character of Captain Qwark was a late addition to the game.|$|E

500|$|On November 20, 2007, Torres {{signed with}} the Chicago Cubs. In 2008, he engaged a private hitting {{instructor}} named Chris O'Leary to help him out. He began trying to model his swing after Albert Pujols, instead of merely {{trying to put the}} ball on the ground and run to first base, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had been doing. He spent the entire season with the Iowa Cubs of the Pacific Coast League, batting [...]306 in 118 games with 11 home runs. He finished fifth in the league with 91 runs scored, tied for second in the league with 10 triples (tied with Trent Oeltjen and Nate Schierholtz behind Tim Raines, Jr.'s 13), and led the league with 29 stolen bases. However, the Cubs did not re-sign him and he once again filed for free agency following the season.|$|E

2500|$|Kant defines {{his theory}} of {{perception}} in his influential 1781 work the Critique of Pure Reason, which has often been cited as the most significant volume of metaphysics and epistemology in modern philosophy. Kant maintains that {{our understanding of the}} external world had its foundations not merely in experience, but in both experience and a priori concepts, thus offering a non-empiricist critique of rationalist philosophy, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> and others referred to as his [...] "Copernican revolution".|$|E
2500|$|As {{provided}} by the secret treaty, the allies agreed in a [...] "Protocol of Subsidies" [...] that Bolivia had to bear {{the costs of the}} war. The agreement, which bound the tax income for many years, caused resentments and fears in Bolivia, where the deployment of Bolivian forces to Tacna was seen as a help to Peru and, moreover, when they knew that the Bolivian army wouldn't be sent to free the occupied region of Bolivia but to protect Peru. As Daza and his officers came to Tacna and Arica, they didn't see the expected Peruvian military strength and they understood that their position of power in Bolivia was threatened by a defeat of the allied armies. Bolivian historian Querejazu suggests that Daza used the Chilean offer of Tacna und Arica for Bolivia in order exert pressure on Peru to get a more favorable [...] "Protocolo de Subsidios", <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> got.|$|E

Between 1956 and 1958 he did his {{military}} service. In 1960 he became a photo laboratory assistant at the State Institute for Historical Monuments Preservation and Environmental Protection in Prague. It was there that he acquired many useful photographic and darkroom skills. Since 1964 {{he has been a}} freelance photographer.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Riki {{joined the}} staff at Northamptonshire county cricket club where he {{impressed}} in the second eleven producing several noticeable scores. This led to him being selected for the MCC in 2004 {{and in the first}} team of Nottinghamshire {{for the start of the}} 2011 season. In 2004, he established himself as a first class player, and scored his first century at the age of 19 against Somerset. In 2007, [...] he became qualified to play for England <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has wanted to do from an early age. Being a keen Hockey player (playing for Northampton Lions and the University of Northampton teams) helps him to play a variety of shots including the Reverse sweep for which he is well known. He is a fairly attacking player especially in one day cricket, where he has one century to date. On 7 November 2008, Wessels signed a new contract extension along with fellow Northamptonshire wicket keeper Niall O'Brien, keeping Riki at the club until 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The writer {{changed the}} fate of another character, Krug's son Justin {{attempting}} to give the audience a better [...] "sense of hope". Craven points out that early on he suggested that Krug have a son who commits suicide, but found it interesting to see [...] "this strange Romeo and Juliet thing happening" [...] between Krug's son and Mari. He also stated that he likes the fact that John Collingwood is a doctor who actually gets to use his skills in the film, unlike in the original where the character is merely identified as being a doctor. Craven comments, [...] " [...] an extraordinary moment" [...] when John is forced to improvise a way to restore a collapsed lung; [...] "It made it real." [...] Ellsworth {{wanted to create a}} level of interest in the characters that would [...] "engage [...] ", as opposed to simply leaving the family in [...] "even worse shape [...] the end of the movie". He asserts that the film does not have a happy ending, but that there is some hope left at the end. Director Dennis Iliadis further explains that the point is to show the family from a different light. Initially the director feared that they were [...] "wussing out" [...] with the ending; he eventually decided that what you really see is a family that has physically survived this encounter, but are [...] "dead in many ways". Iliadis expressed {{that he did not want}} to go the way of [...] "torture porn", <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> sees most horror films moving toward, but instead show a sense of [...] "urgency" [...] with the parents' actions.|$|E

Wieters' first major league hit came the next night, a triple, off of Detroit's Justin Verlander. Wieters hit his first career home run June 17, 2009 against the Mets, a two-run home run off of Mets starter Tim Redding. Wieters changed his jersey number after {{his rookie season}} from 15 to 32, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wore in college at Georgia Tech.|$|R
30|$|To my knowledge, Professor Gary B. Palmer, {{from the}} University of Nevada, Las Vegas, {{was the first}} scholar who {{proposed}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called a “theory of cultural linguistics”, which he did in his 1996 book, Toward a theory of cultural linguistics. Palmer’s proposal called for three traditions in anthropological linguistics {{to be applied to}} cognitive linguistics, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called cultural linguistics. Central to his proposal was the notion of ‘imagery’, <b>which</b> he argued <b>was</b> closely related to language {{and at the same time}} culturally constructed.|$|R

60|$|Love is wonderful. It is the {{everlasting}} and miraculous amazement. Oh, trust me, I {{know the}} old, hard scientific method of weighing and calculating and classifying love. It {{is a profound}} foolishness, a cosmic trick and quip, to the contemplative eye of the philosopher--yes, and of the futurist. But when one forsakes such intellectual flesh-pots and becomes mere human and male human, in short, a lover, then all he may do, and <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> cannot help doing, is to yield to the compulsions of being and throw both his arms around love and hold it closer to him than is his own heart close to him. This is the summit of his life, and of man's life. Higher than this no man may rise. The philosophers toil and struggle on mole-hill peaks far below. He who has not loved has not tasted the ultimate sweet of living. I know. I love Margaret, a woman. She is desirable.|$|E
