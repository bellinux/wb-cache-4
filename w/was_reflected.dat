5|$|Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, Javot (1896), {{the score}} for the film L'assassinat du duc de Guise (1908), and {{incidental}} music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916. Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by Molière and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and Charpentier.|$|E
5|$|The season's {{activity}} <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{rating of}} 57. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of}} the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} {{finished}} with extremely similar statistical totals, as befitting a close game. The two teams were within 38total yards of each other; Kansas had 344yards and Virginia Tech had 306. That relative closeness <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> in the teams' first-down totals as well. Virginia Tech earned 20first downs: 10rushing, eightpassing, and twovia penalty. Kansas, meanwhile, earned 19first downs: fiverushing, 13passing, and onevia penalty.|$|E
30|$|In actual {{oilfield}} production, dynamometer {{cards are}} used to analyze down-hole conditions of sucker rod pumping systems according to the production experience of technical staff. Different fault types <b>are</b> <b>reflected</b> by different graph shapes of the dynamometer cards. Taking some typical dynamometer cards in actual production for examples, “normal running” <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> by “the above {{and bottom of the}} curve is nearly parallel, and the same of the left and right”; “liquid shortage in the pump” <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> by “lack of right-bottom corner of the curve, the loading is normal and the unloading is slower”; “parting of rod” <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> by “shape of the curve is near flat, and the loading drops”; “oil of high viscosity” <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> by “shape of the curve is fat (round and convex)”; “travelling valve leakage” <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> by “like parabola, the loading is slower and the unloading is faster”; “standing valve leakage” <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> by “the upper portion of the curve is upward and the two sides are round, the unloading is slower and the loading is faster”; “pump bumping (upstroke)” <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> by “the loading at the top dead point has a sudden increase”; “pump bumping (downstroke)” <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> by “the loading at the bottom dead point has a sudden increase”; “sand production” <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> by “zigzag pattern of the curve with crest tips and rapid changes”; “piston goes outside of the cylinder” <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> by “lack of right-top corner of the curve, the unloading happens quickly”.|$|R

5|$|This tour saw the {{beginning}} of a bowling partnership between Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose that would trouble batsmen across the world for the next 12 years. England, on the other hand, had entered the series with low expectations and confidence. This <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> in their team selections, with 23 players being used during the series.|$|E
5|$|Along with rapid promotion, the war also noticeably {{lowered the}} age of {{battalion}} commanding officers. In 1914, they were aged over 50, while the average age for a battalion commanding officer in the BEF between 1917 and 1918 was 28. By this stage, it was official policy that men over 35 were no longer eligible to command battalions. This trend <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> amongst the junior officers. Anthony Eden was the Adjutant of a battalion when aged 18, and served as the Brigade Major in the 198th Brigade while still only aged 20.|$|E
5|$|Another injury problem; {{this time}} an ankle {{ligament}} injury sustained in a pre-season match at Goodison Park, restricted Shearer to just twogoals in 17games in the 1997–98 season. His injury <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> in the club's form, and Newcastle finished just 13th in the Premier League. However, United (now managed by Shearer's old boss at Blackburn, Kenny Dalglish) {{had a good}} run in the FA Cup; Shearer scored the winning goal in a semi-final victory over Sheffield United as the team reached the final. The team were unable {{to get on the}} scoresheet at Wembley, and lost the game 2–0 to Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century. During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation as a result of industrialisation, which <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom that reflected the growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the FPÖ {{became more}} eurosceptic, which <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> by its change from pan-Germanism to Austrian patriotism. The party's {{opposition}} to the European Union grew stronger in the 1990s. The FPÖ opposed Austria's joining the EU in 1994, and promoted a popular initiative against the replacement of the Austrian Schilling with the Euro in 1998, but to no avail. Owing to perceived differences between Turkish and European culture, the party opposes the accession of Turkey to the EU; it has declared that should this happen, Austria must immediately leave the EU.|$|E
5|$|City {{had only}} {{appeared}} in one previous major final when {{they won the}} 1911 FA Cup Final before Wembley Stadium had been built. Hence, the play-off final was the club's first game at Wembley in their 93-year history. For Notts County, it was the fifth visit to the national stadium since 1990. The historic occasion for Bradford <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> in the ticket sales, with City fans outnumbering their opponents nearly three-to-one with 28,000 of the crowd of 39,972 coming from Bradford.|$|E

5|$|Crawley {{originally}} traded as {{a market}} town. The Development Corporation intended {{to develop it}} as a centre for manufacturing and light engineering, with an industrial zone. The rapid growth of Gatwick Airport provided opportunities for businesses in the aviation, transport, warehousing and distribution industries. The significance of the airport to local employment and enterprise <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> by {{the formation of the}} Gatwick Diamond partnership. This venture, supported by local businesses, local government and SEEDA, South East England's Regional Development Agency, aims to maintain and improve the Crawley and Gatwick area's status as a region of national and international economic importance.|$|E
5|$|During 1987, {{relations}} improved steadily, with U.S. military inspectors {{present at}} Soviet military manoeuvres, {{an agreement to}} establish centers on Reducing Nuclear Threat, and a first round of negotiations aimed at banning nuclear tests. The thaw in relations <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> in the cultural sphere. Matlock’s invitation to ballerina Maya Plisetskaya to attend a reception at Spaso House provided a way for Matlock to judge Gorbachev’s intentions, as earlier Soviet leaders would have considered it a provocation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fifth}} term, 1999 to 2004, {{there was a}} break in the grand {{coalition}} resulting in a centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties. This <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> in the Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the ELDR, rather than the EPP and Socialists. In the following term the liberal group grew to hold 88 seats, the largest number of seats held by any third party in Parliament.|$|E

50|$|Understanding light's {{effect on}} makeup and various shades and {{pigments}} is important when designing a performer’s makeup. The following {{are among the}} basic rules of light: nothing has color until light <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> from it; an object appears black {{when all of the}} light is absorbed; an object appears white when all of the light <b>is</b> <b>reflected.</b> If certain rays are absorbed and others <b>are</b> <b>reflected,</b> the reflected rays determine the color.|$|R
5|$|From the 1st century AD onwards, Cassel {{developed}} into a key urban centre for the whole region with an extensive road network converging on the hill. Towards {{the end of the}} 3rd century, however, repeated invasions of Germanic tribes caused devastation throughout the region and at least 80% of settlements in the area are thought to have been abandoned, accompanied by a general economic decline. Cassel was fortified with a circuit of walls at around this time but suffered its own decline, which <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> in its loss of status as a regional capital; Tournai took over as the capital of the newly constituted Civitas Turnacensium.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's growing {{interest}} in art <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> in the story, as he included a copy of Alfred Sisley's Le Canal du Loing at Marlinspike Hall. He also included paintings by Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró aboard Rastapopolous' Scheherazade. Muller's pseudonym in the story, Mull Pasha, was based upon the British soldier Glubb Pasha. In the final scene, Hergé included cameos of both himself and his friend and colleague Edgar P. Jacobs.|$|E
5|$|In 1925–26, while {{teaching}} at the Dalhousie Law School, Macdonald took additional courses in law at Columbia University in New York, mainly by correspondence. He used these courses {{as the basis for}} full-time graduate work at the Harvard Law School in Boston, Massachusetts in 1928. Harvard's faculty members saw the law as an instrument for social improvement. That view <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> in Macdonald's 1929 doctoral thesis on the responsibility of property holders under civil law.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{the city}} of Bern celebrated the 650th anniversary of its {{adherence}} to the Old Swiss Confederacy with many events, including a dedicated exposition at the Historical Museum that ran for several months and {{the publication of the}} history schoolbook Berns mutige Zeit. The simultaneous 350-year anniversary of the peasant war <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> in the city only in a few newspaper articles, but it was widely celebrated in the coutryside with speeches, colloquia, and an ambitious and very successful open-air theatre production at Eggiwil in the Emmental.|$|E
5|$|In his poetry, Chivers {{made use}} of legends and themes from Native American culture, {{particularly}} the Cherokee, though often with Christian overtones. He was also heavily influenced {{by the work of}} François-René de Chateaubriand and Emanuel Swedenborg. Many of Chivers's poems included themes of death and sorrow, often using images of shrouds, coffins, angels, and reunions with lost loves in the afterlife. Religious conventions at the time made discussion of death popular, as <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> in poetry. Because of his background as a doctor, Chivers was able to graphically depict the last moments before someone's death.|$|E
5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that {{held that the}} form of the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy that held that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of the}} eye. He suggested that light <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of the eye.|$|E
30|$|From (6) and (7), we {{know that}} that the light {{intensity}} of the image is attenuated in amplitude MTF(u) times {{compared with that of}} the object. Therefore, MTF contains the transfer ability of the optical system and reflects the imaging quality of the system in the frequency domain comprehensively. The scene’s details <b>are</b> <b>reflected</b> by the high-frequency part; the scene’s gradations <b>are</b> <b>reflected</b> by the mid-frequency part; and the scene’s outline <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> by low frequency.|$|R
