5|$|Cannery Row {{is set in}} Monterey, California, before World War II. In Sweet Thursday, Doc {{returns from}} the war to find Cannery Row almost deserted {{and many of his}} {{colorful}} friends gone. Even his close friend Dora, who ran the Bear Flag Restaurant, a whorehouse, has died, and her sister Fauna has taken her place as madam. A former social worker, Fauna teaches the girls how to set a table properly, hopeful they will marry wealthy men. Doc's friends Mack (Mac in Pipe Dream) and Hazel (both men) are still around. They decide Doc's discontent is due to loneliness, and try to get him together with Suzy, a prostitute who has just arrived in Monterey. The two have a brief romance; disgusted by her life as a hooker, Suzy leaves the bawdy house and moves into an abandoned boiler. She decides she cannot stay with Doc, but tells her friends that if Doc fell ill, she <b>would</b> <b>care</b> for him. The accommodating Hazel promptly breaks Doc's arm as he sleeps, bringing the two lovers back together. At the end, Doc and Suzy go off to La Jolla to collect marine specimens together.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Joel and Ellie {{was the central}} focus of the game; all other elements were developed around it. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson were cast as Joel and Ellie, respectively, and provided voice and motion capture performances. Baker and Johnson contributed {{to the development of}} the characters; for example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel <b>would</b> <b>care</b> for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann that Ellie should be stronger and more defensive. Ellie's physical appearance was also redesigned throughout development to make her look more similar to Johnson. The game's other characters also underwent changes. The character Tess was originally intended to be the main antagonist of The Last of Us, but the team found it difficult to believe her motives. The sexuality of the character Bill was originally left vague in the script, but later altered to further reflect his homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Joel is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel <b>would</b> <b>care</b> for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary number of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they did the same with Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.|$|E

25|$|One {{research}} {{priority is}} to determine the role and nature of malignant hyperthermia in FSS. Such knowledge would benefit possible surgical candidates and the anaesthesiology and surgical teams who <b>would</b> <b>care</b> for them.

Further research is wanted to determine epidemiology of psychopathology in FSS and refine therapy protocols.|$|E
25|$|In 1606, {{there were}} less than 70 men at Port-Royal. Lescarbot states that, in total, about 50 Frenchmen, joined by Indians, participated in the {{welcoming}} home of Poutrincourt and the first gathering of the Order. However only fifteen men of birth are recognized as founding the Order. These {{would have been the}} only men present at the time of sufficient social standing with whom Champlain and the Baron de Poutrincourt <b>would</b> <b>care</b> to dine. The guests of the Order likely sat at other tables, probably getting equally good dinners as the rest, but without being recognized as official members of the Order.|$|E

[...] In December 1996, Lisa Hathaway filed a counter-suit against Melinda Dubroff and Lloyd Dubroff's estate for $1.5million, the exact amount of money Lloyd Dubroff intended, saying Lloyd Dubroff [...] "gave his word he <b>would</b> <b>care</b> for and support [...] for the rest and remainder of her natural life." ...|$|E

[...] Tully noted that this information had been publicly available {{since the publication of}} Around the World Submerged: The Voyage of the Triton, Captain Beach's 1962 account of Operation Sandblast. [...] Arguably, Tritons circumnavigation remains the fastest for a motorized sea vessel, beating Cable & Wireless Adventurers 1998 74-day voyage and Earthraces 2008 circumnavigation of 60 days, 23 hours, and 49minutes.|$|E
500|$|Moffat was {{inspired}} by a crack in his son's bedroom wall and developed the idea into the main story arc for the fifth series. He thought that a child might think that something interesting lived inside such a crack. The hidden room in Amelia's house was based on Moffat's recurring childhood dream of a nonexistent hidden room in his grandmother's house. Moffat was keen to give the monster a giant eyeball, and commented that the Atraxi's design— a giant eyeball on a star— was easy for children to draw, as he used to draw Doctor Who monsters as a child. These aspects reflect Doctor Who [...] "domestically-scaled menace" [...] principle. Moffat wrote a scene that explained Prisoner Zero's crime, but cut it because he figured no one <b>would</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E

500|$|The first topic covered is Astronomy, in Book II. Pliny {{starts with}} the known universe, roundly criticising {{attempts}} at cosmology as madness, including the view that there are countless other worlds than the Earth. He doubts the four (Aristotelian) elements, fire, earth, air and water, but records the seven [...] "planets" [...] including the sun and moon. The earth is a sphere, suspended {{in the middle of}} space. He considers it a weakness to try to find the shape and form of God, or to suppose that such a being <b>would</b> <b>care</b> about human affairs. He mentions eclipses, but considers Hipparchus's almanac grandiose for seeming to know how Nature works. He cites Posidonius's estimate that the moon is 230,000 miles away. He describes comets, noting that only Aristotle has recorded seeing more than one at once.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{considered}} Uru a major {{departure from}} Myst and Riven in that Cyan {{wanted to create}} a persistent world, where actions occurred while the player was not online. Miller did not consider the game a true massively multiplayer online game, saying [...] "there is not leveling and skills and monsters and experience in any artificial sense. The 'leveling' is finding and exploring and owning new Ages that are released regularly; the experience is what you really learn while exploring that will help you later—not points on a scale." [...] Miller considered there to be two benefits to such a system: firstly that players <b>would</b> <b>care</b> more about being part of the story, and secondly that even new players could make discoveries and be part of the community. The game was designed as more of a spin-off than a sequel to previous Myst games, due to the merging of items from the contemporary (traffic cones and T-shirts) to the fantastic (books that transport the user to new worlds).|$|E
500|$|With the Station to Station {{sessions}} {{completed in}} December 1975, Bowie started {{work on a}} soundtrack for The Man Who Fell to Earth with Paul Buckmaster as his collaborator. Bowie expected to be wholly responsible for the film's music but found that [...] "when I'd finished five or six pieces, I was then told that if I <b>would</b> <b>care</b> to submit my music along with some other people's... and I just said [...] "Shit, you're not getting any of it". I was so furious, I'd put so much work into it." [...] Notwithstanding, Harry Maslin argued that Bowie was [...] "burned out" [...] and could not complete the work in any case. The singer eventually collapsed, admitting later, [...] "There were pieces of me laying all over the floor". In the event, only one instrumental composed for the soundtrack saw the light of day, evolving into [...] "Subterraneans" [...] on his next studio album, Low.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the death}} of Franco in 1989, Simaro met with {{the family of the}} late band leader and agreed to split revenue 70% to 30% with the family. Simarro <b>would</b> take <b>care</b> of the musicians and the family <b>would</b> take <b>care</b> of the lawyers, record labels and other {{technical}} stakeholders. However, in 1993, OKJazz split up over disagreements in the way funds were being shared. In January 1994, Simaro formed Bana OK, with the majority of the musicians from OKJazz, about thirty of them.|$|R

That <b>would</b> take <b>care</b> of my daughters, and after that I am not particular. I shall then have long been out of this struggle, independent of it, indifferent to it.|$|R

500|$|Publisher's Weekly said, [...] "It is a {{testament}} to the storytelling that the existence of this parallel world and the convergence of Peter and Thea's stories, told in separate chapters, are both credible and absorbing. Young readers will find this a journey worth taking." [...] Kirkus Reviews found the novel to be a [...] "Thoroughly enjoyable arctic adventure", praising how the adventure tests the main characters' courage as they learn the truth of both worlds. Vicky Smith from Horn Book Magazine found the two main characters well written and the city of Gracehope well structured. While, Smith found the city's origin unbelievable, she recognized that few people <b>would</b> <b>care</b> about that and compared the threat in First Light similar to the one in The City of Ember. Jenifer Hubert from Booklist also compared the novel to The City of Ember and to Neal Shusterman's Downsiders. Hubert criticized the slow beginning and flaws in the mythology and structure of the underground world, but still felt that [...] "the icy setting and global-warming theme are well realized".|$|E
500|$|In late 2010, Square Enix {{announced}} a franchise reboot titled Tomb Raider; the new Lara Croft {{would be a}} darker, grittier reimagining of the character. In examining the character, Crystal Dynamics concluded that Croft's largest failing was her [...] "Teflon coating", and that it needed a more human version that players <b>would</b> <b>care</b> about. The studio sought a new voice actress, trialling dozens of relatively unknown performers. The second reboot focuses {{on the origin of}} the character, and as a result, changes the previous back story. Staff opted to first work on the character's biography rather than cosmetic aspects. Crystal Dynamics sought to avoid the embellished physique of past renditions and pushed for realistic proportions. In redesigning the character's appearance, the designers began with simple concepts and added features that it felt made Lara Croft iconic: a ponytail, [...] "M-shaped" [...] lips, and the spatial relationship between her eyes, mouth, and nose. The company also changed the character's wardrobe, focusing on what it believed was more functional and practical. In designing the outfits, staff aimed to create a look that was [...] "relevant" [...] and [...] "youthful", but not too [...] "trendy" [...] or [...] "hip". To gauge the redesign, Crystal Dynamics conducted eye tracking studies on subjects who viewed the new version and previous ones.|$|E
500|$|Kaga {{wanted to}} create a {{scenario}} where players <b>would</b> <b>care</b> about the characters in a similar way to a role-playing video game. According to Kaga, while role-playing games had strong stories but limited protagonists, tactical games had multiple characters but a weak story: Fire Emblem was his solution, combining the two to create a fun gameplay experience with relatable characters. This lack of emphasis on a single character was intentional, to the point that even Marth was not considered by Kaga to be the main character. The setting and characters drew inspiration from Classical mythology. During the early story draft, there were two dragons that acted as bosses: the Earth Dragon Gaia and the Water Dragon Neptune. While Neptune was scrapped due to hardware limitations, Gaia would evolve into the character of Medeus. The series' titular [...] "Fire Emblem" [...] appears in its first and most recognizable form as a shield with mystical power. The artifact's title made reference to war and the power of dragons, which would form a key part of future entries. The use of such an extensive story approach was a rarity in Famicom games at the time, which were still beset by memory storage problems. Multiple scenarios were also planned by Kaga to alleviate the linear feel of the campaign, but this could not be managed.|$|E
