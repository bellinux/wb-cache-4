5|$|Asda's latest {{attempt to}} draw {{attention}} to themselves involves trying to leap on the Harry Potter bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders <b>were</b> <b>invented</b> by supermarkets and {{have nothing to do with}} Bloomsbury Publishing or Harry Potter and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.|$|E

Their main feature was a sealed glass tube with a colored bubbling liquid inside.|$|E
5|$|Horses were {{probably}} ridden in prehistory {{before they were}} driven. However, evidence is scant, mostly simple images of human figures on horse-like animals drawn on rock or clay. The earliest tools used to control horses were bridles of various sorts, which <b>were</b> <b>invented</b> nearly {{as soon as the}} horse was domesticated. Evidence of bit wear appears on the teeth of horses excavated at the archaeology sites of the Botai culture in northern Kazakhstan, dated 35003000 BC.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th and 13th centuries, Europe {{produced}} {{economic growth}} and innovations in methods of production.

5|$|Katyusha rocket launchers, which <b>were</b> <b>invented</b> in Voronezh, were {{mounted on}} many {{platforms}} during World War II, including on trucks, artillery tractors, tanks, and armoured trains, {{as well as}} on naval and riverine vessels as assault support weapons. Soviet engineers also mounted single Katyusha rockets on lengths of railway track to serve in urban combat.|$|E
5|$|Portable organs (the portative and the {{positive}} organ) <b>were</b> <b>invented</b> in the Middle Ages. Towards {{the middle of}} the 13th century, the portatives represented in the miniatures of illuminated manuscripts appear to have real keyboards with balanced keys, as in the Cantigas de Santa Maria. Its portability made the portative useful for the accompaniment of both sacred and secular music in a variety of settings.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} are {{a sample of}} the basic or widely practiced throws and pins. Many of these techniques derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others <b>were</b> <b>invented</b> by Morihei Ueshiba. The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation. Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.|$|E
5|$|The major {{development}} of {{weapons in the}} early modern and modern periods occurred with firearms, which became progressively more efficient. Gunpowder settled into its standard ratio in the 17th century, and general ballistic technology improved. Initially, iron round shot replaced the earlier stone balls for cannon then, latterly, different types of shot <b>were</b> <b>invented.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{pendulum}} clock {{remained the}} most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when quartz oscillators <b>were</b> <b>invented,</b> followed by atomic clocks after World War 2. Although initially limited to laboratories, the development of microelectronics in the 1960s made quartz clocks both compact and cheap to produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and wristwatches.|$|E

5000|$|In 1950, the prefold diaper <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> by {{a diaper}} service owner and {{produced}} by Curity. The prefold diaper {{consisted of a}} standard [...] "flat" [...] diaper, but pre-folded and sewn together. Also in 1950, the Safe-T Di-Dee diaper <b>was</b> <b>invented.</b> The diaper <b>was</b> preformed {{and was the first}} pinless, snap-on diaper- this was the first fitted diaper. It <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> by Sybil Geeslin (Kennedy) who subsequently sold the patent. They were then sold as Keystone Safe-T Di-Dee Diapers and were nationally distributed.|$|R

5|$|This formula was {{powerful}} enough to stand {{as the basis for}} all subsequent descriptions of motion within the solar system until the 20th century. During that time, sophisticated methods of perturbation analysis <b>were</b> <b>invented</b> to calculate the deviations of orbits due to the influence of multiple bodies on a planet, moon, comet, or asteroid. The formalism was exact enough to allow mathematicians to predict the existence of the planet Neptune before it was observed.|$|E
5|$|Allocators <b>were</b> <b>invented</b> by Alexander Stepanov {{as part of}} the Standard Template Library (STL). They were {{originally}} intended as a means to make the library more flexible and independent of the underlying memory model, allowing programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types with the library. However, in the process of adopting STL into the C++ standard, the C++ standardization committee realized that a complete abstraction of the memory model would incur unacceptable performance penalties. To remedy this, the requirements of allocators were made more restrictive. As a result, the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov.|$|E
5|$|Folding screen: The folding {{screen is}} a type of {{furniture}} consisting of several frames or panels. Screens date back to China during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty period (771–256 BC). These were initially one-panel screens in contrast to folding screens. Folding screens <b>were</b> <b>invented</b> during the Han Dynasty (206 BC - AD 220). Depictions of those folding screens have been found in Han Dynasty era tombs, such as one in Zhucheng, Shandong Province. During the Tang Dynasty, folding screens were considered ideal ornaments for many painters to display their paintings and calligraphy on. Many artists painted on paper or silk and applied it onto the folding screen. The landscape paintings on folding screens reached its height during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).|$|E

50|$|Wax {{foundation}} <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> by German Johannes Mehring in 1857, {{not long}} after Langstroth constructed the Langstroth hive (1851).
