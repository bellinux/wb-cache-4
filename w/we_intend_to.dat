25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for <b>we</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. Learning a new language as an adult is a very difficult thing to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a lot of new Americans.|$|E

500|$|Thompson filed {{a lawsuit}} {{on behalf of the}} parents of three {{children}} killed in the Heath High School shooting in 1997. Investigations showed that the perpetrator, 14-year-old Michael Carneal, had regularly played various computer games (including Doom, Quake, Castle Wolfenstein, Redneck Rampage, Nightmare Creatures, MechWarrior, and Resident Evil) and accessed some pornographic websites. Carneal had also owned a videotape of The Basketball Diaries, which includes a high school student dreaming about shooting his teacher and some classmates. The suit sought $33 million in damages, alleging that the producers of the games, the movie, and the operators of the Internet sites were negligent in distributing this material to a minor because it would desensitize him and make him more prone to violence. Additional claims included product liability for making [...] "defective" [...] products (the defects alleged were violent features and lack of warnings) and violation of RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, for distributing this material to minors. Said Thompson, [...] "We intend to hurt Hollywood. <b>We</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> hurt the video game industry. <b>We</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> hurt the sex porn sites." ...|$|E

We all know his capabilities and <b>we</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> help him develop." [...] Later while attending Jinsei Gakuen High School, Watanabe was called up by Suzuki to compete with the national team in 2013. He made his debut on the international stage at the 2013 East Asia Basketball Championship and stayed with Japan for the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship. At the event, Watanabe averaged 5.3 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 0.5 assists in four games played. He helped the team finish in ninth place.|$|E

500|$|U.S. {{policy was}} for a time {{dictated}} by its perception of improvement in the Saigon government. No further commitment by the Americans would occur without tangible proof of the regime's survivability. Events in Vietnam, however, outraced this policy. By the beginning of 1965, it was stood upon its head—it was believed that without further American action the Saigon government could not survive. However, as late as February 8, in a cable to US Ambassador to South Vietnam Maxwell Taylor, Johnson stressed that the paramount goal of a bombing campaign would be to boost Saigon's morale, not to influence Hanoi, expressing hope [...] "that {{the building of a}} minimum government will benefit by ... assurances from us to the highest levels [...] that <b>we</b> ... <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> take continuing action." ...|$|E
500|$|A [...] "Draft Clark" [...] {{campaign}} {{began to}} grow with the launch of DraftWesleyClark.com on April 10, 2003. The organization signed up {{tens of thousands of}} volunteers, made 150 media appearances discussing Clark, and raised $1.5 million in pledges for his campaign. A different website, DraftClark2004.com, was the first organization to register as a political action committee in June 2003 to persuade Clark to run. They had presented him with 1000 emails in May 2003 from throughout the country asking him to run. One of DraftClark2004's founders, Brent Blackaby, said of the draft effort: [...] "Just fifty-two years ago citizens {{from all over the country}} were successful in their efforts to draft General Eisenhower. <b>We</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> do the same in 2004 by drafting General Clark.

500|$|Although the Giants were {{no longer}} the league's top draw by 1955, falling to ninth in {{attendance}} and being one of three teams which had decreased attendance compared to the previous season, the Maras were still financially secure enough to turn down an offer of one million dollars for the team. NFL commissioner Bert Bell had personally made the offer on behalf of an unidentified group of investors, and accorded to Bell the Maras responded, [...] "ootball is our business and <b>we</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> remain in it." [...] The offer was the largest for a franchise in pro football up to that point. The investment group was reportedly enticed by the team's potential television revenue—at the time the Giants [...] "television-radio" [...] income led the league at $150,000 annually—and the 8,000,000 population of New York City from which it could draw. Despite {{the size of the}} offer, John Mara considered the figure low, and stated that he had [...] "no idea" [...] who was in the group attempting to buy the team.|$|E

500|$|As in most Westminster system parliaments, Australia's {{government}} is {{formed by the}} party enjoying {{the confidence of the}} lower House of Parliament, the House of Representatives. However, Australia's Parliament also has a powerful upper house, the Senate, which must pass any legislation initiated by the House of Representatives if it is to become law. The composition of the Senate, in which each state has an equal number of senators regardless of that state's population, was originally designed to attract the Australian colonies into one Federation. The Constitution forbids the Senate to originate or amend a money bill, but places no limitation on the Senate's ability to defeat one. In 1970, Gough Whitlam, as Leader of the Opposition, had stated of a budget bill, [...] "Let me make it clear at the outset that our opposition to this Budget is no mere formality. <b>We</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> press our opposition by all available means on all related measures in both Houses. If the motion is defeated, we will vote against the Bills here and in the Senate. Our purpose is to destroy this Budget and destroy the Government which has sponsored it." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the tour}} of the show reached a racially {{segregated}} theatre in Wilmington, Delaware, Rodgers and Hammerstein threatened to cancel the performances there unless seating was integrated, which it was. In 1953, with the tour in Atlanta, there was controversy over [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Two Georgia state legislators, Senator John D. Shepard and Representative David C. Jones, objected to the song, stating that though South Pacific was a fine piece of entertainment, that song [...] "contained an underlying philosophy inspired by Moscow", and explained, [...] "Intermarriage produces half-breeds. [...] And half-breeds are not conducive to the higher type of society.... In the South, we have pure blood lines and <b>we</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> keep it that way." [...] They stated that they planned to introduce legislation to outlaw such communist-inspired works. The Northern press had a field day; Hammerstein, when asked for comment, responded {{that he did not}} think the legislators were representing their constituents very well, and that he was surprised at the suggestion that anything kind and decent must necessarily originate in Moscow. In part because of the song, touring companies of South Pacific had difficulty getting bookings in the Deep South.|$|E
500|$|As part of Parker's {{modernization}} efforts, {{the newspaper}} unit became the [...] "Public Information Division" [...] with Captain Stanley Sheldon in charge. He and Gene {{had known each}} other since Roddenberry attended Los Angeles City College. Roddenberry became Parker's speech writer, and wrote of the Chief's professional philosophy in the in-house magazine, The Beat, in September 1952. He reputedly based the Star Trek character Spock on Parker's rational and unemotional behavior. In this new office, he worked alongside Don Ingells, who would go on to create Fantasy Island, and write episodes for Star Trek such as [...] "The Alternative Factor". The Association for Professional Law Enforcement was founded on November 12, 1952, with Roddenberry as one of the founding members and spokesman. He said at the time that: [...] "We are of the opinion that professional ethics and practical police work are completely compatible and <b>we</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> meet together to promote this compatibility." [...] Following this, Roddenberry began a correspondence with Erle Stanley Gardner, creator of the Perry Mason novels. The duo would record audio letters and send them to each other. Gardner forwarded Roddenberry's comments to Harry Steeger, who felt that he and Roddenberry had similar opinions on law enforcement. Gardner began to seek Roddenberry's opinion of his work, including allowing him a preview of The Court of Last Resort.|$|E
