Vance confesses and blames his {{bitterness}} at having been resurrected <b>with</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> scarred and deformed visage. Mulder and Scully, who {{have been able to}} trace a large purchase of grasshoppers to Vance, arrive to find the man dying of cyanide poisoning from his own glass of water. He confesses to the agents before falling dead.|$|E
5|$|Eaton's pintail has two subspecies, A. e. eatoni (the Kerguelen pintail) of Kerguelen Islands, and A. e. drygalskyi (the Crozet pintail) of Crozet Islands, and was {{formerly}} considered conspecific {{with the northern}} hemisphere's northern pintail. Sexual dimorphism is much less marked in the southern pintails, with the male's breeding appearance being similar to the female plumage. Unusually for a species <b>with</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large range, northern pintail has no geographical subspecies if Eaton's pintail is treated as a separate species. A claimed extinct subspecies from Manra Island, Tristram's pintail, A. a. modesta, appears to be indistinguishable from the nominate form.|$|E
5|$|In May and June 1952, Jevđević visited Canada and {{addressed}} the Congress of the Serbian National Defense (Srpska Narodna Odbrana) in Niagara Falls regarding developments within Italy's Serb émigré community. The following year, he and Đujić issued a proclamation in Chicago declaring {{their intention to}} organize Chetnik groups against Damjanović, who had since emigrated to Germany. Jevđević later received threatening letters warning him not to go through <b>with</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> plan for fear of disuniting the Yugoslav diaspora. Little is known of his activities after 1953. He continued to live in Rome {{until his death in}} October 1962.|$|E

Tony Rolt was the Technical Director of Ferguson Research, where he was heavily involved {{in the design of}} the four-wheel drive system used in the Jensen FF, the first sports car to be fitted <b>with</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> transmission. Tony Rolt also had a long involvement with Jaguar, winning the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans with the factory works team driving the Jaguar C-Type.|$|E
5|$|Lody's death {{produced}} a low-key {{response from the}} German government.

The Kaiser agreed, though not without some reluctance.|$|E

5|$|The JINR team {{sought to}} use {{berkelium}} because calcium-48, the isotope of calcium {{used in the}} beam, has 20 protons and 28 neutrons, making a neutron–proton ratio of 1.4; {{and it is the}} lightest stable or near-stable nucleus <b>with</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large neutron excess. The second-lightest such nucleus, palladium-110 (46 protons, 64 neutrons, neutron–proton ratio of 1.391), is much heavier. Thanks to the neutron excess, the resulting nuclei were expected to be heavier and closer to the sought-after island of stability. Of the aimed for 117 protons, calcium has 20, and thus they needed to use berkelium, which has 97 protons in its nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The Superliner I cars stored {{waste in}} onboard {{retention}} tanks, but then macerated and dumped {{it along the}} tracks once the train had attained a preset speed. This was an improvement on the Hi-Levels, which dumped directly to the tracks. Growing public concern about such dumping led {{to the adoption of}} a full-retention system in the Superliner IIs. They were the first long-distance cars <b>with</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> system. The Superliner I cars were retrofitted with a full-retention system in the early 1990s.|$|E

Rochambeau was stricken from the Navy List in 1872 and scrapped in 1874.|$|E

From this he created a great bridge with sixty piers that spanned the Danube. Trajan used this to strike deep within Dacia, forcing the king, Decebalus, to surrender and become a client king.|$|E
