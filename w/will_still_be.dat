The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E

If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> passed on.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{establishing}} a republic {{instead of a}} monarchy was around 18 per cent in the United Kingdom in 2006, while a majority thinks that there <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> a monarchy in the United Kingdom in ten years' time, public opinion is rather uncertain about a monarchy still existing in fifty years and a clear majority believes that the monarchy will no longer exist a century after the poll. Public opinion is, however, certain that the monarchy will still exist in thirty years. About 30 per cent are in favour of discontinuing the monarchy after Elizabeth's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} injection {{leads to}} a quick fill of the die, which is required so the entire cavity fills before {{any part of the}} casting solidifies. In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections.

5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is {{satisfied with the}} use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be covered. Investors <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. Furthermore, covered interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the forward exchange rate. The following equation represents covered interest rate parity.|$|E

The European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven or eight years, and a second series of banknotes is already in preparation.

Lockheed Martin responded to talk of CAPES cancellation with a fixed-price upgrade package for foreign users. CAPES {{was not included in the}} Pentagon's 2015 budget request. The USAF said that the upgrade package <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> offered to Taiwan, and Lockheed said that some common elements with the F-35 will keep the radar's unit costs down.

5|$|The GHMix2.0 mode {{allows one}} to {{precisely}} create songs up to 10 min, and includes pre-defined sample tracks that can be modified on a note-by-note basis as desired. The new Jam mode lets the players select one of several standard pre-set rhythms and then play along with it on the instrument controllers in a free-form mode; however, players can then capture any segment of this music and move it to the Mix mode to compile a song. User songs are then uploaded and downloaded through the GHTunes mode of the Music Studio. While songs that violate copyright <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> removed from the service, Neversoft will be less aggressive about this and will rely more on user feedback on such issues.

5|$|Their {{high energy}} and drive make these dogs {{ideally suited to}} a number of {{different}} dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> energetic after their owner has called it a day.

5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} is no other way he could win over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart to do whatever he wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> proud of him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January, Marsden arrests Ian after Janine {{told her}} that Ian took {{advantage}} of her, stole Archie's laptop, which had a recording of them having sex on it, and dumped it in the canal. Ian refuses to talk, but when Marsden shows him CCTV footage of him dumping the laptop, and then shows him the recovered laptop, he admits visiting Archie on Christmas Day, claiming that Archie was threatening him. He wanted to delete the recording and denies murdering Archie, but Marsden charges him. Days later, Janine tells Marsden she saw Ian leave the Queen Victoria on Christmas Day but the bust of Queen Victoria was on the bar after he left. Marsden places Janine at the scene, but she also denies murdering Archie. Marsden tells Ian that although the murder charge will be dropped, he <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> charged with burglary and theft of Archie's laptop. She and DC Wayne Hughes (Jamie Treacher) attend Archie's funeral, watching people's reactions {{in the hope of}} a new lead.

5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E
