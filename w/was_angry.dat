5000|$|St. Thomas Aquinas, in the {{question}} on anger of his Summa Theologiae, quotes the Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum, [...] "he that <b>is</b> <b>angry</b> without cause, shall be in danger; but he that <b>is</b> <b>angry</b> with cause, shall not be in danger: for without anger, teaching will be useless, judgments unstable, crimes unchecked," [...] and concludes saying that [...] "to <b>be</b> <b>angry</b> <b>is</b> therefore not always an evil." ...|$|R

Pressed, she acknowledged that her mother had begun to drink large quantities of alcohol. She denied that she had ever seen matches in the house and expressed surprise that Tim had not escaped by the same route she had, which was via a bedroom window onto the roof.|$|E
5|$|Following his Macedonian triumph, Pyrrhus was {{approached}} by his officer Cleonymus. The Spartan convinced the Epiriote king to aid him in a scheme to seize control of his homeland. Cleonymus' reasons for seeking to attack Sparta were twofold. Firstly, he <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> {{that he had been}} overlooked for the Agiad kingship of Sparta in favour of his nephew, Areus II. Plutarch ascribes Cleonymus' failure to secure the throne to his arbitrariness and violent nature. Furthermore, Cleonymus had become a target of ridicule in Sparta by the fact that his new wife, Chilonis, was engaging in an affair with Acrotatus, the son of Areus.|$|E
5|$|In 1115 Henry sent Warelwast back to Rome to {{negotiate}} with Paschal, who <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> that the king was prohibiting papal legates in England, not allowing clerics {{to appeal to the}} papal court, and was failing to secure papal sanction for church councils or the translation of bishops. Warelwast was unable to change the pope's mind, but he did manage to prevent sanctions against the king. Henry also employed Warelwast as a papal envoy during the Canterbury–York disputes over the primacy in the English Church, with visits in 1119, 1120, and possibly also in 1116.|$|E

5|$|When Clark {{finally left}} Fort Pitt in August 1781, he was {{accompanied}} by only 400 men, although he expected to meet Lochry and his Pennsylvanians at Fort Henry (present Wheeling, West Virginia). Clark <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> {{about the lack of}} support given his campaign, but he still hoped that the Kentucky militia, who were to rendezvous with him at Fort Nelson (Louisville, Kentucky), would provide additional men. He intended to at least carry out an expedition against enemy Indians if he did not have enough men to attack Detroit.|$|E
5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> that Ramirez {{has been slow to}} join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E

5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} around the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet) that became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes {{that they would be}} protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the whites. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to only pay white traders half of what they owed, and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, whiskey, and guns. In 1810, Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the Treaty of Fort Wayne be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Another {{prominent}} {{opponent of}} the Theses was Johann Eck, Luther's friend and a theologian at the University of Ingolstadt. Eck wrote a refutation, intended for the Bishop of Eichstätt, entitled the Obelisks. This was {{in reference to the}} obelisks used to mark heretical passages in texts in the Middle Ages. It was a harsh and unexpected personal attack, charging Luther with heresy and stupidity. Luther responded privately with the Asterisks, titled after the asterisk marks then used to highlight important texts. Luther's response <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> and he expressed the opinion that Eck did not understand the matter on which he wrote. The dispute between Luther and Eck would become public in the 1519 Leipzig Debate.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, the Liberal Party had {{considered}} Howe {{as a potential}} candidate for the House of Commons. The Liberals were then in opposition. The public <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> over the inability of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett and his Conservative (or Tory) government {{to deal with the}} Depression, and the Liberals were considered likely to return to office at the next election, due by 1935. Howe, feeling political activism was bad for business, had not publicly expressed political views. Norman Platt Lambert, a Liberal Party official and friend of Howe, brought him to a meeting with Liberal Party leader and former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 20 January 1934. The two men were impressed with each other, but each felt the other should make the next move. According to Lambert in his diary, Howe wanted a guaranteed Cabinet position were he to run in the new riding of Port Arthur.|$|E

5|$|As {{literary}} studies {{developed into a}} discipline {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, the story of the origins of Romanticism in England emerged along with it; according to this version of literary history, Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age. This view held sway for almost a century. Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld still did not receive her due. As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman—one who <b>was</b> <b>angry,</b> one who resisted the gender roles of her time, and one who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women. Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories and it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re-examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice Barbauld had been.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{lamented the}} effects of his drug use and noted the irony that the drugs did not do much to improve the {{consistency}} of his performances. On his return to international competition his times were significantly worse than he achieved prior to drug use: in the 100m final at the 2006 European Championships, Chambers ran a sub-par 10.24s and finished in fifth place. He {{was part of the}} gold medal-winning British 4×100m team, but Darren Campbell, who <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> about losing his 2002 and 2003 relay medals due to Chambers' ban, refused to join the team in a celebratory lap. After the competition, Chambers again expressed an interest in switching to American football and completed a week-long NFL Europa training camp in Cologne that November.|$|E
5|$|During filming in Sierra Gorda, Chile, {{the local}} mayor, Carlos Lopez, staged a protest because he <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> at the filmmakers' {{portrayal}} of the Antofagasta Region as part of Bolivia. He was arrested, detained briefly, and put on trial two days later. Eon dismissed his claim that they needed his permission to film in the area. Michael G. Wilson explained that Bolivia was appropriate to the plot, because of the country's history of water problems, and was surprised the two countries disliked each other a century after the War of the Pacific. In a poll by Chilean daily newspaper La Segunda, 75% of its readers disagreed with Lopez's actions, due to the negative image of Chile they felt it presented, and the controversy's potential to put off productions looking to film {{in the country in}} the future.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Some {{propose that}} the {{question}} of how you know that James <b>is</b> <b>angry</b> can <b>be</b> adequately answered with the claim that you see that James <b>is</b> <b>angry.</b> Call this the Perceptual Hypothesis. Here, I examine that hypothesis. I argue that there are two different ways in which the Perceptual Hypothesis could be made true. You might see that James <b>is</b> <b>angry</b> by seeing his bodily features. Alternatively, you might see that James <b>is</b> <b>angry</b> by seeing his anger. If you see that James <b>is</b> <b>angry</b> in the first way, your knowledge is inferential. If you see that James <b>is</b> <b>angry</b> in the second way, your knowledge is not inferential. These are different ways of knowing that James <b>is</b> <b>angry.</b> So the Perceptual Hypothesis alone does not adequately answer the question of how you know that fact. To ascertain how you know it, we need {{to decide whether or not}} you saw his anger. This is an epistemological argument. But it has consequences for a theory of perception. It implies that there is a determinate fact about which features of an object you see. This fact is made true independently of what you come to know by seeing. In the final section of the paper, I seek to undermine various ways in which the claim that you see James' anger may be thought implausibl...|$|R
