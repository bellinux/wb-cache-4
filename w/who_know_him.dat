25|$|I {{sometimes}} {{think there are}} two Wagners in our culture, almost unrecognizably different from one another: the Wagner possessed by those who know his work, and the Wagner imagined by those <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> only by name and reputation.|$|E
25|$|His name is the {{synonym for}} the {{faithful}} discharge of duty. In his business regulations {{he has won}} the respect and admiration of all <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him.</b> As a public officer, when fortunes were within his grasp, not a thought of seizing them entered his mind. He is a man vigorously positive, determined, honest, generous and able. Not a stain has been cast on his name. Not a man can say a word against him to impeach his qualifications for the Mayoralty of New York.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a war}} scare in May 1906 {{when the}} Turks {{occupied}} an old Egyptian fort {{at the head of}} the Gulf of Aqaba. Wilson noted that Grierson (Director of Military Operations) and Lyttelton (“absolutely incapable … positively a dangerous fool”) had approved the proposed scheme for military action, but neither the Adjutant-General nor the Quartermaster-General had been consulted. Repington wrote to Esher (19 Aug 1906) that Wilson was an “intriguing impostor” and “a low-class schemer whose sole aptitude is for worshipping rising suns – an aptitude expressed by those <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> in more vulgar language”. On 12 September 1906 Army Order 233 finally set up a General Staff to supervise education and training and to draw up war plans (Wilson had drafted an Army Order late in 1905, but it had been held up by disputes over whether staff officers should be appointed by the Chief of the General Staff as Wilson preferred or by an eleven-man selection board).|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the details}} (if they were {{accurately}} reported) of his killing of Molineux show {{him in a}} rather sinister light, Mortimer had the respect and esteem of many <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him,</b> including his brother and his nephew. The chronicler Adam of Usk, <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> personally, praised him as [...] "a vigorous knight".|$|R

500|$|Plumb is reticent about {{discussing}} his accomplishments, but colleagues {{have referred to}} him as the [...] "ultimate team member" [...] who could be counted on to {{be at the top of}} his game and a consistent performer. As team captain at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, he was noted for helping his teammates understand everything that was going on around them. His athleticism and personal courage have been praised by those <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> such as Michael Page, chef d’equipe for the 1986 US World Championship team, who recounted how Plumb medaled at the competition despite three broken ribs. Plumb admits to being completely focused on riding and [...] "not a social person", with former coach Jack le Goff saying that [...] "horses are his only reason for being on earth".|$|E
500|$|Due to his immense {{popularity}} {{during his}} lifetime, Holmes was {{often called upon}} to produce commemorative poetry for specific occasions, including memorials, anniversaries and birthdays. Referring to this demand for his attention, he once wrote that he was [...] "a florist in verse, and what would people say / If I came to a banquet without my bouquet?" [...] As critic Hyatt Waggoner noted, however, [...] "very little... survives the occasions that produced it". Holmes became known as a poet who expressed the benefits of loyalty and trust at serious gatherings, as well as one who showed wit at festivities and celebrations. Edwin Percy Whipple for one considered Holmes to be [...] "a poet of sentiment and passion. Those <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> only as a comic lyricist, as the libellous laureate of chirping follow and presumptuous egotism, would be surprised at the clear sweetness and skylark thrill of his serious and sentimental compositions".|$|E
500|$|Henry married Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont in February 1575, {{two days}} after his coronation. His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a {{political}} marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal nuncio Salviati observed, [...] "it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring... physicians and those <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> well {{say that he has}} an extremely weak constitution and will not live long." [...] As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, Francis, Duke of Alençon, known as [...] "Monsieur", played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion. Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold. On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2014, Wirtz {{was named}} the Vice Provost for Research at Johns Hopkins University. In announcing the Wirtz’s appointment, Provost Robert C. Lieberman stated, [...] "As is obvious to all <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> Denis is an {{extremely}} productive and accomplished faculty member and a wonderful colleague. Those traits will serve both Denis and the university as he works with me to support important multidisciplinary research projects, including the strategic initiatives identified in the campaign, the Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships, and multidivisional proposals in response to RFAs (requests for applications).” ...|$|E

2500|$|Sturgis {{continued}} to write novels during the 1880s. [...] They were My Friends and I (1884), John Maidment (1885), Thraldom (1887), and The Comedy of a Country House (1889). Reviewing {{the second of}} these, The Manchester Guardian said, [...] "Readers of Little Comedies know how patiently and ingeniously Mr. Sturgis can draw what may be called the minor scoundrel – the scoundrel whose scoundrelism is so successfully concealed from the world and from himself {{that it is only}} a few people <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> to be a scoundrel at all. [...] He has made a fresh and more audacious study of this type in John Maidment, a study audacious but successful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abdelrazik {{was born}} in Sudan on January 1, 1962. He {{initially}} trained as a machinist and got married. He was imprisoned for his political views after the 1989 military coup by Omar al-Bashir, and fled to Canada as a refugee in 1990. In 1992 he was granted landed immigrant status. He married a French Canadian woman in 1994, and they soon had a daughter together. He became a Canadian citizen in 1995. Muslims <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> have characterized him as a devout Muslim who [...] "often read the Koran to the sick and was paid as a healer." [...] In an interview with Globe and Mail he stated that he has traveled to many places including such countries as Pakistan and Bosnia. He states {{that he was only}} involved in humanitarian work, to help people. He further stated that, [...] "my humanitarian trips abroad were funded by my religious work as a Muslim healer in Montreal and also through donations from many individuals in the Muslim community".|$|E
2500|$|Jason Grace awakens on {{a school}} bus, unable to {{remember}} who or where he is, or anything about his past. He is sitting next to Piper McLean and Leo Valdez, <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> by name and say they are his girlfriend and best friend respectively. All three {{are part of a}} class field trip to the Grand Canyon, and after they arrive, a classmate turns into a Venti (storm spirit) and attacks the trio and their trip leader, Coach Gleeson Hedge. In the ensuing fight, Jason surprises everyone including himself, when his gold coin turns into a sword, which he uses to battle the storm spirit. During the fight, Coach Hedge reveals himself as a satyr and is captured by the spirits as they flee. Soon after the fight, a flying chariot with two demigods appears in order to save the three, but the girl in it, Annabeth Chase, is upset when she discovers that her boyfriend, Percy Jackson, who mysteriously disappeared, is not there as she expected. Annabeth, seeking Percy, was told in a vision from the goddess Hera to look for the [...] "boy with one shoe", who turns out to be Jason, who lost his shoe during the storm spirit attack. Jason, Piper, and Leo are told that they are demigods and are taken back to Camp Half-Blood where they meet other Greek demigod children like themselves.|$|E
