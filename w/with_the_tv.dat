5|$|The players {{went out}} on strike in week 3. The main demand was free agency for all players with at least four years of service.

5|$|Sorkin came up {{with the}} idea to write about the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the {{screenplay}} for The American President. He would work late, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of SportsCenter. The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead he turned his idea into a TV comedy series. Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney-owned ABC network in the fall of 1998.|$|E

The series is an extension of the Madeline franchise, a series of children's books written by Ludwig Bemelmans, which feature the adventures of a young French heroine named Madeline.

Another West German TV movie, under the title Die zwei herren aus Verona, was screened on Das Erste in 1966. Directed by Harald Benesch, it starred Jürgen Kloth as Valentine, Lothar Berg as Proteus, Anne-Marie Lermon as Julia and Carola Regnier as Silvia. In 1969, the entire play was broadcast on Austrian TV channel ORF eins from a performance at the Theater in der Josefstadt, under the title Zwei aus Verona.

25|$|Task Review: First Forte {{built their}} {{campaign}} around comparing the music {{system to a}} larger, classical jukebox, even using the size {{differences between the two}} as part of it, with their overall presentation being viewed as impressive. Meanwhile, Impact suffered major issues throughout the task, as Paul spent less time managing the team and more on directing their TV advert, leaving Saira to give a very vague brief to a graphics designer on what was required from their print ad. Both adverts were deemed poor, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> advert hardly showing the product, while their sales pitch failed to improve things, as Sir Alan felt that First Forte's was clearly the better campaign.|$|E
25|$|William Ball's 1976 American Conservatory Theater production, {{starring}} Fredi Olster and Marc Singer. This celebrated {{production was}} grounded {{very much in}} commedia dell'arte, with acrobats, clowns, pantomime-style violence, over-the-top posturing (Petruchio is depicted shirtless for almost the entire performance), much highly choreographed physicality {{on the part of}} the two leads, and an on-stage audience of clowns who provided on-going sound-effects, such as drums for punches and whistles for people fainting. This production dropped Sly altogether. Katherina's final speech is delivered in an ironic manner, with Olster winking at the audience, before grabbing a confused Petruchio and kissing him passionately. The production was broadcast by PBS in 1976 as part of their Great Performances series, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> presentation directed by Kirk Browning.|$|E
