Smith recorded: [...] "The next morning I {{went to see}} elder Rigdon, and found him crazy, and his head highly inflamed, for they had dragged him by his heels, and those too, so high from the earth he could not raise his head from the rough frozen surface, which lascerated it exceedingly; and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> he called to his wife to bring him his razor. She {{asked him what he}} wanted of it? and he replied to kill me. Sister Rigdon left the room, and he asked me to bring his razor. I asked him what he wanted of it, and he replied he wanted to kill his wife, and he continued delirious some days." ...|$|E
2500|$|Groucho {{maintained}} his irrepressible {{sense of humor}} to the very end, however. [...] George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story {{of one of his}} final visits to Groucho's home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Groucho from his wheelchair, put his arms around his torso, and began to [...] "walk" [...] the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you always were a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature." [...] Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: [...] "I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you," [...] he said. [...] "And <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> he was weak, but he was there; and he put his fingers on the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, which brings me to tears." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E

He gave {{a little bit of a}} start <b>when</b> <b>’e</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> talking to a lady, and then ’e nips down sudden, about a couple o’ yards away, and begins to do ’is {{bootlace}} up.

6000|$|Mr. Chipperton jumped {{right up}} {{and opened the}} door. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Rectus and <b>me</b> {{standing}} there, he must have seen in our faces that something was the matter, for he instantly asked: ...|$|R
60|$|He uttered {{an exclamation}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> still there, the gate shut and the officer in talk with me. He spurred quickly forward.|$|E

60|$|We hoisted {{the boys}} out and {{arranged}} them on chairs, while Wontner changed into uniform, but stopped <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> taking off my jacket.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{got through}} the town, and had {{advanced}} {{a few hundred yards}} along the road that leads to the great house, when I saw Armadale at a little distance, coming toward me. He was walking fast--evidently with some errand of his own {{to take him to the}} town. The instant he caught sight of me he stopped, colored up, took off his hat, hesitated, and turned aside down a lane behind him, which I happen to know would take him exactly in the contrary direction to the direction in which <b>he</b> was walking <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b> His conduct said in so many words, 'Miss Milroy may hear of it; I daren't run the risk of being seen speaking to you.' Men have used me heartlessly; men have done and said hard things to me; but no man living ever yet treated me as if I was plague-struck, and as if the very air about me was infected by my presence! ...|$|R
60|$|I then inquired {{into the}} {{circumstances}} of his present case at that time, and what it was <b>he</b> expected <b>when</b> <b>he</b> came to be tried. He told me that they had no evidence against him, or but very little; for that of three robberies, which they were all charged with, it was his good fortune that he was but in one of them, and that there was but one witness to be had for that fact, which was not sufficient, but that it was expected some others would come in against him; that <b>he</b> thought indeed, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> that I had been one that came of that errand; but that if somebody came in against him, he hoped he should be cleared; that he had had some intimation, that if he would submit to transport himself, he might be admitted to it without a trial, but that he could not think of it with any temper, and thought he could much easier submit to be hanged.|$|R
5000|$|Mrs Lyth later {{commented that}} she {{went to see the}} play when she was told she'd {{inspired}} it, but she much preferred a play by John Galsworthy that was shown with it in a double-bill,, [...] I was supposed to have inspired him for this play, but I don't know <b>when</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> wooing anybody! ...At that time I ran a café here, in addition to my duties as postmistress, and Mrs Arthur Wontner and her children came in one day for tea. She said, 'You're the lady who inspired G.B.S. for the play, and you must go up and see it'--so I did. Following it in the same programme was one of Galsworthy's plays called The Little Man, which I enjoyed much more than Village Wooing. I don't say Mr Shaw's aren't good plays, but I think they lack suspense. In spite of that, I wrote and congratulated Dame Sybil Thorndike on her wonderful portrayal of a postmistress in a little village shop. She autographed her picture for me and wrote on the back that she was most interested to know that she had been playing me, and would come and see me one day.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, miss!" [...] said Mr. Guppy, rising <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> rise. [...] "But would you allow me the favour of a minute's private conversation?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Peggotty (who never {{shut his}} mouth once, I remember, during the visit) showed great concern <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me</b> do this, and nudged Ham to say something.|$|E
60|$|When I {{came to my}} own house, {{for which}} I was forced to inquire, one of the {{servants}} opening the door, I bent down to go in, (like a goose under a gate,) for fear of striking my head. My wife run out to embrace me, but I stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise {{never be able to}} reach my mouth. My daughter kneeled to ask my blessing, but I could not see her till she arose, having been so long used to stand with my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet; and then I went to take her up with one hand by the waist. I looked down upon the servants, and one or two friends who were in the house, {{as if they had been}} pigmies and I a giant. I told my wife, “she had been too thrifty, for I found she had starved herself and her daughter to nothing.” In short, I behaved myself so unaccountably, that they were all of the captain’s opinion <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> and concluded I had lost my wits. This I mention as an instance of the great power of habit and prejudice.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{small arms}} and {{provisions}} were already ashore, and the petty officers and squads of men conveying them to camp. One Gatling had been safely landed; {{the other was}} just being hoisted {{over the side of}} the vessel as we arrived. I noticed Kearny darting about on board, seeming to have the ambition of ten men, and doing the work of five. I think his zeal bubbled over <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Carlos and <b>me.</b> A rope's end was swinging loose from some part of the tackle. Kearny leaped impetuously and caught it. There was a crackle and a hiss and a smoke of scorching hemp, and the Gatling dropped straight as a plummet through the bottom of the flatboat and buried itself in twenty feet of water and five feet of river mud.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is a noble lad," [...] Dame Vernon {{had said}} to herself when Walter had taken his leave. [...] "Would {{he had been the}} son of one of the nobles of the court! It might have been then, if he {{distinguished}} himself in war, as he would surely do, that the king might have assigned Edith to him. As her lord and guardian he is certain to give her hand as a reward for valour in the field, and it may well be to a man with whom she would be less happy than with this 'prentice lad; but there, I need not be troubling myself about a matter which is five or six years distant yet. Still the thought that Edith is a ward of the crown, and that her hand must go where the king wills, often troubles me. However, I have a good friend in the queen, who will, I know, exert what influence she has in getting me a good husband for my child. But even for myself I have some fears, since the king hinted, <b>when</b> last <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> that it was time I looked out for another mate, for that the vassal of Westerham and Hyde needed a lord to lead them in the field. However, I hope that my answer that they were always at his service under the leading of my cousin James will suffice for him. Now, what am I to do in that matter? Who would have thought that he so coveted my lands that he would have slain me and Edith to possess himself of them? His own lands a thrice as broad as mine, though men say that he has dipped deeply into them and owes much money to the Jews. He is powerful and has many friends, and although Earl Talbot would stand by me, yet the unsupported word of an apprentice boy were but poor evidence on which to charge a powerful baron of such a crime as this. It were best, methinks, to say nought about it, but to bury the thought in my own heart. Nevertheless, I will not fail to take the precaution which the lad advised, and to let Sir James know that there are some who have knowledge of his handiwork. I hear he crosses the seas tomorrow to join the army, and it may be long ere he return. I shall {{have plenty of time to}} consider how I had best shape my conduct towards him on his return; but assuredly he shall never be friendly with me again, or frighten Edith with his kisses." ...|$|R

60|$|However, {{the door}} of the house was open, and inside was a man {{sweeping}} the sanded floor. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me,</b> he stopped his work and stared at me.|$|E
60|$|A card {{had come}} up on a salver, and it was {{followed}} by the same bearded ruffian who had attacked me in the street. He started <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Peter had {{at first}} tormented me mercilessly about the affair, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> I {{did not like}} his chaff he stopped it. Peter was always a good fellow.
