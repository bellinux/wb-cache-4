2500|$|Pay for {{performance}} systems link compensation to measures of <b>work</b> <b>quality</b> or goals. , 75 {{percent of all}} U.S. companies connect {{at least part of}} an employee's pay to measures of performance, and in healthcare, over 100 private and federal pilot programs are underway. Current methods of healthcare payment may actually reward less-safe care, since some insurance companies will not pay for new practices to reduce errors, while physicians and hospitals can bill for additional services that are needed when patients are injured by mistakes. However, early studies showed little gain in quality for the money spent, as well as evidence suggesting unintended consequences, like the avoidance of high-risk patients, when payment was linked to outcome improvements. The 2006 Institute of Medicine report Preventing Medication Errors recommended [...] "incentives...so that profitability of hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, [...] insurance companies, and manufacturers (are) aligned with patient safety goals;...(to) strengthen the business case for quality and safety." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor {{many years}} {{culture has been}} claimed as an {{important}} element of organizational successful in the business world. Organizations take very different approaches to build <b>quality</b> <b>work</b> culture. For some organizations, <b>quality</b> <b>work</b> culture has never mattered most. But in some organizations, <b>quality</b> <b>work</b> culture is crucial to ensure the employees served a better service to the customers. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify which leadership style creates <b>quality</b> <b>work</b> culture at financial institution. Data collected through survey and direct interviews with several executives in order to gain accurate information. The respondents were chosen among employees from first line managers up to top management. Bass and Avolio's (1995), Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ Form 5 X) was used to measure leadership styles and questions on <b>quality</b> <b>work</b> culture adopted from Geri McKeown. In addition, IFE matrix was applied to determine current work culture in the financial institutions. Findings revealed that transactional leadership had greatest influence towards <b>quality</b> <b>work</b> culture. A strong <b>quality</b> <b>work</b> culture may due to number of years the financial institutions existed in the industry. This statement was supported by a strong correlation between <b>quality</b> <b>work</b> culture and leadership styles. The strong significant relationship between leadership style and <b>quality</b> <b>work</b> culture clearly shows that transactional leadership style possessed by majority of leaders influence the level of <b>quality</b> <b>work</b> culture. The paper is hoped to contribute towards improving the <b>quality</b> <b>work</b> culture by identifying the prominent leadership style practiced by financial institutions...|$|R
