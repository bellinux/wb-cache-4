5|$|Until the 20th century, naval weapons {{had a short}} range, so {{camouflage}} was unimportant for ships, and for the men {{on board}} them. Paint schemes were {{selected on the basis}} of ease of maintenance or aesthetics, typically buff upperworks (with polished brass fittings) and <b>white</b> <b>or</b> <b>black</b> hulls. Around the start of the 20th century, the increasing range of naval engagements, as demonstrated by the Battle of Tsushima, prompted the introduction of the first camouflage, in the form of some solid shade of gray overall, in the hope that ships would fade into the mist.|$|E

5|$|In chess {{tournaments and}} matches, the {{frequency}} with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration. In matches, the players' colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots, and alternated thereafter. In round robin tournaments with an odd number of players, each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks; with an even number of players, each receives one extra <b>white</b> <b>or</b> <b>black.</b> Where one or more players withdraws from the tournament, the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than whites, or vice versa. The double-round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks, and plays both White and Black against each opponent.|$|E
5|$|In {{the high}} school section, {{students}} in Secondary 1 to Secondary 3 (inclusive) must wear a white short-sleeved shirt with khaki short trousers and white socks, which must cover the ankle. The four metal buttons must be worn on the two front pockets and on both shoulders. The school collar pin should be worn on the left collar. Either white, blue or black shoes with either <b>white</b> <b>or</b> <b>black</b> laces must be worn. Secondary 4 students wear long beige trousers with a beige shirt, similar to the male students in the college section. College girls wear a beige blouse and a beige skirt. The uniform for the college section was retained from the former Hwa Chong Junior College, which was designed by a Malay girl of the pioneer batch.|$|E
5|$|The Panthers {{have three}} main jersey colors: black, white, and blue. Their blue jerseys, {{designated}} their alternate uniforms, are the newest and {{were introduced in}} 2002. NFL regulations allow the team to use the blue jersey up to two times in any given season. In all other games, the team must wear either their <b>white</b> <b>or</b> <b>black</b> jerseys; in NFL games, the home team decides whether to wear a dark or white jersey, while the away team wears the opposite. The Panthers typically pair their white jerseys with white pants, while the black and blue jerseys are paired with silver pants; there have only been a few exceptions to these combinations.|$|E

5|$|The club's home kit {{has always}} {{consisted}} of a black-and-white vertically striped shirt, with black shorts and <b>white</b> <b>or</b> <b>black</b> socks. The width of {{the black and white}} stripes has varied from season to season, as has the colour of the shirt numbers, which have usually been red, black, white or yellow. Atlético's traditional away kit is all-white shirts, shorts and socks, but has had slight variations. An all-black third kit was introduced in the 2000 season, being used again in 2015. In 2008, a black-and-gold vertically striped third kit was launched to commemorate the club's centenary, featuring the first crest. Squad number 12 is retired from the club's kits, dedicated to the fans.|$|E
5|$|Two-color {{varieties}} {{always have}} a white base color with areas of the second color. Tan and white {{is the most common}} two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either <b>white</b> <b>or</b> <b>black</b> with different colored flecks (ticking), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar to the coloring of the Bluetick Coonhound. Some tricolor beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas.|$|E
5|$|Continuous zonal {{patterns}} {{can take}} the form of whitish subsutural bands (A. similis), heavy subperipheral pigmentation (A. perversus var. infraviridis), subsutural color lines (A. columellaris), broad spiral color bands (A. metabletus, A. webbi), or narrow spiral bands (A. laevus). Interrupted zonation can consist of the interruption of bands into spots in (A. maculatus); highly irregular splitting of zones (A. perversus vars. sultanus and interruptus); formation of oblique radial streaks which run parallel to (in A. inversus) or cross (in A. latestrigatus) the incremental growth lines; or almost every conceivable combination and variation of these factors. Often the pattern will change radically from the apex to the body whorl (in A. quadrasi vars.). The aperture, parietal callus, columella, lip, and umbilical region are variously marked with pink, brown, purple, <b>white,</b> <b>or</b> <b>black.</b> Haniel (1921) includes several color plates which clearly demonstrate the extent of color variation within two species of the Syndromus type. A. perversus and A. maculiferus of the subgenus Amphidromus are equally variable, whereas species such as A. inversus and A. similis are almost uniform in coloration.|$|E

5|$|When Maribor was established, some of {{the club}} {{officials}} were favouring the red and white colours, while the traditional colours of Branik were black and white. Because {{of the fact that}} many football teams in Yugoslavia wore red and <b>white</b> <b>or</b> <b>black</b> and white jerseys, most notably Red Star Belgrade and Partizan, Maribor officials decided for a new and fresh combination. They decided to follow the example of Fiorentina, which at the time {{was one of the most}} successful clubs in Europe, and their purple and white combination. Oto Blaznik, the first captain in history of the club, was the one who proposed the combination after seeing the Italian side play. Eventually, they changed the secondary colour to yellow. In July 2015, white replaced yellow as the secondary colour. Today, Maribor play their home matches in purple and away matches in white kits. Since July 2011, the club's kit manufacturer is Adidas.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is a {{terrestrial}} rodent {{with short}} forelimbs and long hindfeet. With a head and body length of 150mm (5.9in) and body mass of 105g (3.7oz) {{in the only}} known complete specimen, it is much larger than M.bastardi, and its measurements fall {{at or above the}} upper end of the known range of variation in M.ingens. The upperparts are covered with soft and short, brown fur. Most cover hairs (the main part of the fur) are dark brown for the two-thirds closest to the base, then light brown, with a short dark brown tip. The middle of the back appears darker, because the cover hairs there are entirely dark brown. The hairs are 6 to 8mm (0.2 to 0.3in) long on the shoulders and 7 to 9mm (0.3 to 0.4in) on the back. The guard hairs are gray. Because the flanks lack entirely dark cover hairs, they are slightly lighter than the rest of the upperparts. They are sharply separated in color from the underparts, which are entirely white to buffish. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers above the mouth) are long, up to 60mm (2.4in), and <b>white</b> <b>or</b> <b>black</b> in color. The pinnae (external ears) are dark brown and covered with fine gray hairs, and ear length is 32mm (1.3in).|$|E
5|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Bouba/Kiki phenomenon is a case of ideasthesia. Most people will agree that the star-shaped object on the left is named Kiki and the round one on the right Bouba. It has been assumed that these associations come from direct connections between visual and auditory cortices. For example, according to that hypothesis, representations of sharp inflections in the star-shaped object would be physically connected to the representations of sharp inflection in the sound of Kiki. However, Gomez et al. have shown that Kiki/Bouba associations are much richer as either word and either image is associated semantically to a number of concepts such as <b>white</b> <b>or</b> <b>black</b> color, feminine vs. masculine, cold vs. hot, and others. These sound-shape associations seem to be related through a large overlap between semantic networks of Kiki and star-shape on one hand, and Bouba and round-shape on the other hand. For example, both Kiki and star-shape are clever, small, thin and nervous. This indicates that behind Kiki-Bouba effect lies a rich semantic network. In other words, our sensory experience is largely determined by the meaning that we assign to stimuli. Food description and wine tasting is another domain in which ideasthetic association between flavor and other modalities such as shape may play an important role.|$|E

25|$|Electronic {{paper was}} first {{developed}} in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The first electronic paper, called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometers across. Each sphere is a janus particle composed of negatively charged black plastic {{on one side and}} positively charged white plastic on the other (each bead is thus a dipole). The spheres are embedded in a transparent silicone sheet, with each sphere suspended in a bubble of oil so that they can rotate freely. The polarity of the voltage applied to each pair of electrodes then determines whether the <b>white</b> <b>or</b> <b>black</b> side is face-up, thus giving the pixel a <b>white</b> <b>or</b> <b>black</b> appearance.|$|E
5000|$|Generally public {{schooling}} {{in rural}} areas did not extend beyond the elementary grades for either <b>whites</b> <b>or</b> <b>blacks.</b> This was known as [...] "eighth grade school" [...] After 1900, some cities began to establish high schools, primarily for middle class whites. In the 1930s roughly one fourth of the US population still lived and worked on farms and few rural Southerners of either race went beyond the 8th grade until after 1945.|$|R
