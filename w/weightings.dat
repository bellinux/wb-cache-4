5|$|In January 2009 the International Baseball Federation {{created a}} ranking {{system so that}} the nations {{involved}} in international competition could be compared independently. Teams receive points based on the position they finish {{at the end of}} tournaments. The system takes into account results not only of the senior men's teams but also of junior teams. <b>Weightings</b> that emphasise the importance of certain tournaments are {{based on the number of}} teams competing, the number of continents represented (or eligible to be represented), and in the case of continental tournaments such as the Oceania Baseball Championship the relative strength of teams eligible. Only results within the previous four years are used, so points are added and removed over time. Since the system began, the rankings have been adjusted after the completion of tournaments qualifying for the ranking process; the most recent was the 2009 Baseball World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1996–97 season, European Sports Media have {{awarded the}} Golden Shoe {{based on a}} points system that allows players in tougher leagues to win even if they score fewer goals than a player in a weaker league. The <b>weightings</b> are {{determined}} by the league's ranking on the UEFA coefficients, which in turn depend on the results of each league's clubs in European competition over the previous five seasons. Goals scored in the top five leagues according to the UEFA coefficients list are multiplied by a factor of two, goals scored in the leagues ranked six to 21 are multiplied by a factor of 1.5, and goals scored in leagues ranked 22 and below are multiplied by a factor of 1. Thus, goals scored in higher ranked leagues will count for more than those scored in weaker leagues. Since this change, there was only been one winner was not playing in one of the top five leagues (Henrik Larsson, 2000–01 Scottish Premier League).|$|E
25|$|FIFA {{changed the}} formula used {{to compute the}} {{confederation}} <b>weightings</b> after the 2010 FIFA World Cup without public announcement. Without this modification, UEFA's multiplier would have dropped {{for the first time}} below 1, with CONMEBOL remaining the only confederation with a multiplier of 1.|$|E
25|$|Pioneering {{research}} on the perception of sounds at different frequencies was conducted by Fletcher and Munson in the 1930s. Their work led to a standard way of weighting measured sound levels within investigations of industrial noise and hearing loss. Frequency <b>weightings</b> have since been used within filter and controller designs to manage performance within bands of interest.|$|E
25|$|Markov {{chains are}} {{employed}} in algorithmic music composition, particularly in software such as CSound, Max and SuperCollider. In a first-order chain, {{the states of the}} system become note or pitch values, and a probability vector for each note is constructed, completing a transition probability matrix (see below). An algorithm is constructed to produce output note values based on the transition matrix <b>weightings,</b> which could be MIDI note values, frequency (Hz), or any other desirable metric.|$|E
25|$|These rankings {{use some}} of the same {{criteria}} as the World University Rankings but they use other measures, such as incoming and outgoing exchange students as well. As the criteria and their <b>weightings</b> are different, the QS World university rankings and the QS Asian University rankings released in the same academic year are different. QS published global universities ranking by different major in different countries, which has special reference value for international students, like Statistics & Operational Research program in China.|$|E
25|$|The {{erythemal}} {{weighting factors}} applied to {{these figures are}} 1.0, 0.22, and 0.003 respectively. (Also note the huge increase in sunburn damage caused by the shorter wavelengths; e.g., for the same irradiance, 305nm is 22% as damaging as 295nm, and 325nm is 0.3% as damaging as 295nm.) Integration of these values using all the intermediate <b>weightings</b> over the full spectral range of 290nm to 400nm produces a figure of 264mW/m2 (the DUV), which is then divided by 25mW/m2 to give a UV Index of 10.6.|$|E
25|$|The subject rankings are {{intended}} to address the most frequent criticism of all world university ranking systems, that they contain too little material about specific subjects, something potential applicants are keen to see. These rankings have been drawn up {{on the basis of}} citations, academic peer review and recruiter review, with the <b>weightings</b> for each dependent upon the culture and practice of the subject concerned. They are published in five clusters; engineering; biomedicine; the natural sciences; the social sciences; and the arts and humanities, and covered 42 subjects in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The Standard & Poor's500, often {{abbreviated}} as the S 500, or {{just the}} S, is an American stock market index based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ. The S 500 index components and their <b>weightings</b> are determined by S Dow Jones Indices. It differs from other U.S. stock market indices, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the Nasdaq Composite index, because of its diverse constituency and weighting methodology. It {{is one of the}} most commonly followed equity indices, and many consider it one of the best representations of the U.S. stock market, and a bellwether for the U.S. economy. The National Bureau of Economic Research has classified common stocks as a leading indicator of business cycles.|$|E
25|$|The Working Group {{divided the}} Evaluation Report on eleven {{detailed}} themes and weightings: Government support, legal issues {{and public opinion}} (2); General infrastructure (5); Sports venues (4); Olympic Village(s) (3); Environmental conditions and impact (2); Accommodation (5); Transport concept (3); Safety and security (3); Experience from past sports events (2); Finance (3); and, Overall project and legacy (3). <b>Weightings,</b> varying between 1 and 5 (5 being the highest), were attributed by the Working Group to each criterion, reflecting the level of information requested of the Applicant Cities {{at this stage of}} the bid process, and the potential of achieving the level required for the organisation of the Olympic Games in the seven years' preparation time. The Working Group set the benchmark at 6 as minimum required grade (on a scale of 0 to 10). This grade was attributed by the Working Group to the main and sub-criteria for each Applicant City, reflecting the assessment of the Working Group (quality, number, location, concept, etc.).|$|E

2500|$|It is {{also used}} when {{measuring}} low-level noise in audio equipment, especially in the United States. In Britain, Europe and {{many other parts of}} the world, broadcasters and audio engineers more often use the ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which was developed in the 1960s based on research by the BBC and other organizations. [...] This research showed that our ears respond differently to random noise, and the equal-loudness curves on which the A, B and C <b>weightings</b> were based are really only valid for pure single tones.|$|E
2500|$|Up to date, the HEC has {{published}} rankings {{for the years}} 2006, 2012, 2013, 2014 and most recently 2015. In addition to the top ten and general rankings, independent rankings are also provided for universities and institutes in the categories of agriculture and veterinary science; arts and design; business; engineering and technology; and medicine. The HEC ranking uses five criteria, {{all of which have}} specific <b>weightings</b> and are summed to give an aggregate score out of 100. Institutional rankings are determined based on this aggregate score. Each criterion and its weighting is dependent upon a set of sub-components. The five criteria, along with their weighted score and sub-components are summarised below: ...|$|E
2500|$|Chromaticity {{diagrams}} are two-dimensional diagrams that plot {{the projection}} of the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) XYZ color space onto the (x, y) plane. The X, Y, Z values (or tristimulus values) are simply used as <b>weightings</b> to create new colors from the primary colors, much {{in the same way}} that RGB is used for creating colors from primaries in televisions or photographs. The x and y values used to create the chromaticity diagram are created from the XYZ values by dividing X and Y by the sum of X, Y, Z. [...] The chromaticity values that can then be plotted are dependent upon two values: dominant wavelength and saturation. Since luminous energy is not included, colors that differ only in its lightness are not distinguished on the diagram. For instance, brown, which is just a low-luminance mixture of orange and red, will not appear as such.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2012, Donald {{lost the}} No. 1 {{position}} to Rory McIlroy; the pair then exchanged the No. 1 position a further {{four times in}} the following two months, so the volatility of the No. 1 ranking again became a source of comment. At the end of 2012, McIlroy had opened up a clear lead {{at the top of the}} rankings, following his second major victory at the PGA Championship and emulating Donald in leading the money lists on both sides of the Atlantic. However, by the end of March 2013, a resurgent Tiger Woods had returned to the top of the rankings, after adding three PGA Tour wins in 2013 to his three victories from 2012 while McIlroy struggled with his form following equipment changes. Woods then suffered a back injury that sidelined him for the early part of 2014, and in his absence, Adam Scott, winner of the 2013 Masters, became the 17th world No. 1 on May 18, despite not winning an event in 2014 to that date; he would win the following week to secure his No. 1 position and avoid following Tom Lehman as a one-week No. 1. He held the No. 1 position until August 3, when McIlroy regained the top spot by following his Open Championship victory with another at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. Following his second-place finish at the 2015 PGA Championship (that followed earlier wins at the Masters and the U.S. Open), Jordan Spieth became the 18th world No. 1 on August 16, 2015, describing it as [...] "as good a consolation prize as I've ever had". Over the following three weeks, the No. 1 spot passed back and forth between McIlroy and Spieth, due to the way each player's average points (which were almost identical) fluctuated (as their point <b>weightings</b> and events played divisors changed), until, on September 20, both were overtaken by Jason Day, the 2015 PGA Championship winner, who became the 19th world No. 1 with victory in the BMW Championship, his fifth of the season. A week later, Spieth regained the No. 1 spot from Day after winning the Tour Championship (and with it, the FedEx Cup), and concluded 2015 as world No. 1, but Day's continued good form took him back to number one after winning the WGC Matchplay in March 2016.|$|E
