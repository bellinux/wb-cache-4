5|$|In 1968, several donors made {{gifts to}} the University of Michigan College of Engineering to {{establish}} an endowed chair for the Paul G. Goebel Professor of Engineering.

5|$|In the 1930s, Muslim lowlanders {{attacked}} the Torajans, resulting in widespread Christian conversion among those <b>who</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> align {{themselves with the}} Dutch for political protection and to form a movement against the Bugis and Makassarese Muslims. Between 1951 and 1965 (following Indonesian independence), southern Sulawesi faced a turbulent period as the Darul Islam separatist movement fought for an Islamic state in Sulawesi. The 15 years of guerrilla warfare led to massive conversions to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|The IOC {{originally}} resisted funding {{by corporate}} sponsors. It {{was not until}} the retirement of IOC president Avery Brundage, in 1972, that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to them.

5|$|The R+L=J theory {{posits that}} rather than Rhaegar {{kidnapping}} Lyanna, {{they fell in love}} and ran away together. Living for a year in the Tower of Joy, they conceived a child—Jon.

Ned claimed the baby as his own to protect him from Robert, <b>who</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> exterminate all Targaryens out of hatred and to secure his claim to the throne.|$|E
5|$|According to Jerusalem {{architectural}} historian David Kroyanker, {{the heyday}} of the Downtown Triangle lasted from the early 1930s to the 1970s. Many stores and restaurants were opened by German Jewish immigrants <b>who</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> recreate a European ambience in the city center. Their upscale boutiques, coffeehouses, delicatessens, and exclusive restaurants were frequented by senior Mandate officials and wealthy, English-speaking tourists. Unlike Israeli stores that sold all kinds of unrelated products under one roof, the Europeans introduced boutiques that featured only one item, such as gloves or ties. Some shops offered unique extras, such as coffeehouses that included an orchestra and dance floor, and a bookstore with a second-floor library.|$|E
5|$|After the 1962 season, the Yankees sold Turley to the Los Angeles Angels for cash, in {{the first}} move made by new Yankees' general manager Roy Hamey, <b>who</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> rebuild the Yankees {{pitching}} staff. The move was conditional; the Angels could return Turley {{if they were not}} satisfied with him. The Angels chose to retain Turley {{at the start of the}} 1963 season. Turley struggled, winning two games while losing seven, and the Angels released him in July. A week later, he signed with the Boston Red Sox. Turley retired after the 1963 season, with a 101–85 win–loss record and a 3.64 ERA in 12 seasons.|$|E

5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests <b>who</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E
5|$|Chanel {{bought the}} five acre plot on which La Pausa {{was built for}} 1.8 million French francs in February 1929. The plot had {{formerly}} {{been part of the}} hunting grounds of the ruling family of Monaco, the Grimaldis, and contained wild olive and orange groves. The villa was built less than a year later. The final cost of the villa was 6 million francs, a large sum for the time. It is not clear whether Chanel or her lover, Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster financed the building and furnishing of La Pausa. La Pausa was built by architect Robert Streitz, <b>who</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> build 'the ideal Mediterranean villa'.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{reputation}} as an able politician and a likable man, during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war. To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the more moderate Free Soilers, as divisive and {{as a threat to}} the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners. Although he criticized those <b>who</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> limit or end slavery, he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme position or opposed northern interests.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 19th century until 1944 Guatemala was {{governed by a}} series of authoritarian rulers <b>who</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> {{strengthen}} the economy by supporting the export of coffee. Between 1898 and 1920, Manuel Estrada Cabrera granted significant concessions to the United Fruit Company, an American corporation that traded in tropical fruit, and dispossessed many indigenous people of their communal lands. Under Jorge Ubico, who ruled as a dictator between 1931 and 1944, this process was intensified, with the institution of harsh labor regulations and a police state.|$|E
5|$|He was disheartened {{with what}} he saw in Pernambuco, a {{province}} {{far away from the}} imperial capital, {{but one of the most}} important in the country. Local political bosses were aligned with the Party of Order or the Liberal Party, but these were mostly nominal affiliations. Local oligarchs had vied among themselves for centuries over power. To them, political principles, such as those preached by the national leaders of the Party of Order, meant little or nothing. Their political ambitions focused on patronage and the annihilation of their local rivals. Honório Hermeto found himself embroiled in an ongoing power struggle between the aristocratic planters, <b>who</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> exercise control over provincial affairs.|$|E
5|$|In 2100, 28 years later, the company's failed {{stocks and}} assets were bought by a Russian oligarch named Anatoly Korenchkin, a former black market {{operator}} <b>who</b> <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> {{make money in}} legitimate ways. He re-licensed and restored the company to its former status in the following decade. Along with producing healthcare and consumer products, Korenchkin signed weapons contracts with various military organizations, private and political-owned. The new UNN was almost virtually powerless with Korenchkin exercising control over them.|$|E
