5|$|Despite being {{currently}} {{portrayed as}} an underachiever, Bart was actually very happy and looking forward {{about going to}} school. However, the boy's initial enthusiastic nature is crushed by an uncaring and bitter teacher <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be a failure at life and never amount to anything. Deeply hurt by this comment, Bart then began {{the process of developing}} his path into the mischievous way of life.|$|E
5|$|Much of Carter's {{inspiration}} for the episode came from reports of Phineas Gage, who underwent a personality change after a blasting accident drove an iron rod completely through his head (though the idea that Gage became violent, immoral, or a pathological liar, as Scully describes him, is without foundation). The aliens' use of a dental drill on Barry {{was inspired by a}} neighbour of Carter <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was abducted and that the aliens drilled holes into his teeth – which a dentist analyzed and said could not be done with any equipment he knew.|$|E
25|$|Another fast typist of the Beat Generation was Richard Brautigan, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{thought out}} the plots {{of his books}} in detail beforehand, then typed them out at speeds {{approaching}} 90 to 100 words a minute.|$|E

25|$|In November 1985 the Anglo-Irish Agreement {{was signed}} between Garret FitzGerald and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The {{agreement}} gave the Republic of Ireland a formal say in Northern Ireland and its affairs.

25|$|After India {{failed to}} qualify for the final of the DLF Cup, Dravid, the skipper, was criticised by former all-rounder Ravi Shastri <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not {{assertive}} enough and let Greg Chappell make too many decisions.

2500|$|Sallows is {{an expert}} on the theory of magic squares and has invented several {{variations}} on them, including alphamagic squares and geomagic squares.

25|$|Initially, {{there was}} {{uncertainty}} about who {{had created the}} video. Due to its professional quality, some speculated {{that it was one}} of Huckabee's opponents, possibly John McCain. Within hours it was revealed that the video was created by 29-year-old Keith Emis, of Fayetteville, Arkansas, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sought out Davidson and created the video after seeing her on television.|$|E
25|$|Several {{witnesses}} who {{benefited from the}} citizenship for votes scheme have corroborated this assertion, including a Filipino man <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was given his identity card without applying for it.

25|$|The former Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schröder, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, {{were strong}} {{advocates of the}} {{pipeline}} project during the negotiation phase. International media alluded to a past relationship between the Managing Director of Nord Stream AG, Matthias Warnig, himself a former East German secret police officer, and Vladimir Putin {{when he was a}} KGB agent in East Germany. These allegations were denied by Matthias Warning, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had met Vladimir Putin {{for the first time in}} his life in 1991, when Putin was the head of the Committee for External Relations of the Saint Petersburg Mayor's Office.|$|E

5000|$|Taylor's {{work as a}} broadcaster, critic, and {{commentator}} ultimately overshadowed {{his work}} as a composer. He hosted and narrated several television music series and documentaries.

25|$|There is {{a report}} that Ives also won the admiration of Gustav Mahler, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a true musical revolutionary. Reportedly, Mahler talked of premiering Ives' Third Symphony with the New York Philharmonic, but he soon died (in 1911) thus {{preventing}} the premiere. However, {{the source of this}} story is Ives himself; since Mahler died, {{there was no way to}} verify whether he had seen the score of the symphony or decided to perform it in the 1911–12 season. Nonetheless, it is known that Ives regularly attended New York Philharmonic concerts and probably heard Mahler conduct the Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversial}} area is {{the trailing}} interest issue. Trailing interest is the practice of charging interest on the entire bill no matter what percentage of it is paid. US Senator Carl Levin {{raised the issue of}} millions of Americans affected by hidden fees, compounding interest and cryptic terms. Their woes were heard in a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing which was chaired by Senator Levin, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intends to keep the spotlight on credit card companies and that legislative action may be necessary to purge the industry. In 2009, the C.A.R.D. Act was signed into law, enacting protections for many of the issues Levin had raised.|$|E
25|$|Durvasa {{felt that}} Ambarisha had {{violated}} the respect {{due to a}} guest by breaking his fast before the guest had taken his meal and in his rage created a demon to kill Ambarisha, out of a strand of his hair. Narayana's Sudarshana Chakra intervened, destroyed the demon and started chasing Durvasa himself. Durvasa went to Brahma and Shiva for protection. Both pleaded their inability to save him. Durvasa next went to Narayana himself, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could do nothing as he was bound by the blemishless devotion of Ambarisha and suggested that the sage seek the king's pardon. Durvasa took this advice and returned to Ambarisha, who prayed to Vishnu to recall the Sudarshana and save the sage, whereby the discus ceased to afflict him.|$|E

25|$|Neil Lake needed three metal plates {{inserted}} {{in his face}} after being attacked by a Hells Angel at a petrol station in Cardiff in October 2007. Lake took down the registration of his attacker's Harley-Davidson motorcycle which led police to Sean Timmins, the vice-president of the Wolverhampton chapter. Timmins denied inflicting grievous bodily harm on Lake and claimed that a fellow club member had been riding around with the same number plates as him; he told a judge he knew {{the identity of the}} actual attacker but explained that it would be against club rules for him to name him. Timmins was cleared of the charge in September 2008 after providing an alibi <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was working in his hometown {{on the day of the}} attack. He would later be one of the three Hells Angels jailed for six years after the brawl with the Outlaws at Birmingham Airport.|$|E
25|$|According to {{its title}} page, the {{libretto}} of La bohème {{is based on}} Henri Murger's novel, Scènes de la vie de bohème, a collection of vignettes portraying young bohemians living in the Latin Quarter of Paris in the 1840s. Although usually called a novel, it has no unified plot. Like the 1849 play by Murger and Théodore Barrière, the opera's libretto focuses {{on the relationship between}} Rodolfo and Mimì, ending with her death. Also like the play, the libretto combines two characters from the novel, Mimì and Francine, into a single Mimì character. Early in the composition stage Puccini was in dispute with the composer Leoncavallo, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had offered Puccini a completed libretto and felt that Puccini should defer to him. Puccini responded that he had had no idea of Leoncavallo's interest and that having been working on his own version for some time, he felt that he could not oblige him by discontinuing with the opera. Leoncavallo completed his own version in which Marcello was sung by a tenor and Rodolfo by a baritone. It was unsuccessful and is now rarely performed.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Daedalus {{was designed}} by Izzy Medrano, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> imagined Daedalus as a brilliant architect gone mad, and that Daedalus, similar to Kratos, was a pawn of the gods. The character was originally intended to have long white hair, but was eventually rendered bald, [...] "as long hair is {{a difficult thing to}} manage." [...] Icarus was conceived as an [...] "old disgusting man" [...] and portrayed as an evil, although slightly comedic, character.|$|E
5000|$|Sci-Fi on the Rock {{saw another}} amazing year with many great workshops.

500|$|After {{the charges}} were dropped, Gordon said that he wished to [...] "try to put all this, {{including}} the events of 21 years ago, behind me and try to return to my everyday life".
