5|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews and}} garnered {{the attention of}} several major labels. The band eventually signed with Island Records, who had agreed to match Thrice's charitable donations {{in the same manner}} that Hopeless/Sub City had. That fall, the band toured <b>with</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Water</b> Music and Coheed and Cambria before returning to the studio.|$|E
5|$|In the United States and Canada, {{the drink}} is popular in instant form, made <b>with</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> or milk from a packet {{containing}} mostly cocoa powder, sugar, and dry milk. This is the thinner {{of the two}} main variations. It is very sweet and may be topped with marshmallows, whipped cream, {{or a piece of}} solid chocolate. Hot chocolate was first brought to North America as early as the 17th century by the Dutch, but the first time colonists began selling hot chocolate was around 1755. Traditionally, hot chocolate has been associated with cold weather, winter, and dessert in the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Produced by Sara Lee's Douwe Egberts brand, BK Joe was Burger King's coffee {{line that}} was first {{introduced}} in 2001 in North America and later in parts of Europe. Advertised as being made from Arabica coffee, the product was made using Douwe's Cafitesse system, a platform that eschews coffee brewed from ground beans {{in favor of a}} beverage made from a coffee concentrate <b>with</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> added. Sara Lee claims the advantage of the system is that each cup of coffee is made at the time of order with minimal waste and labor. The product was not designed to compete with products from companies such as Starbucks, but was intended to appeal to customers who seek a consistent cup of coffee.|$|E

5|$|The Queen's grief was overwhelming, and the tepid {{feelings}} {{the public}} had felt previously for Albert were replaced by sympathy. Victoria wore black mourning {{for the rest of}} her long life, and Albert's rooms in all his houses were kept as they had been, even <b>with</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> brought in the morning, and linen and towels changed daily. Such practices were not uncommon in the houses of the very rich. Victoria withdrew from public life and her seclusion eroded some of Albert's work in attempting to re-model the monarchy as a national institution setting a moral, if not political, example. Albert is credited with introducing the principle that the British royal family should remain above politics. Before his marriage to Victoria, she supported the Whigs; for example, early in her reign Victoria managed to thwart the formation of a Tory government by Sir Robert Peel by refusing to accept substitutions which Peel wanted to make among her ladies-in-waiting.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} {{product of}} this region is certainly yerba mate. Consumed countrywide, this product features a peculiarity of its own in this area: {{it is not only}} prepared <b>with</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water,</b> but, driven by the region's high temperatures, it is common to see it prepared with cold water as well, in which case the beverage is known as tereré.|$|E
25|$|November 2010 saw Against Me!'s {{departure}} from Sire Records, their first (and only) major label. Following a two-month hiatus from touring, the band {{spoke for the}} first time since their tour cancellation, talking of their upcoming December 2010 shows, which saw Jay Weinberg cover for George Rebelo on drums, as he toured <b>with</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Water</b> Music.|$|E
25|$|Espresso-based coffee has {{a variety}} of {{possible}} presentations. In its most basic form, an espresso is served alone as a shot or short black, or <b>with</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> added, when it is known as Caffè Americano. A long black is made by pouring a double espresso into an equal portion of water, retaining the crema, unlike Caffè Americano.|$|E

25|$|In Uruguay, people {{commonly}} {{walk around}} the streets toting a mate and a thermos <b>with</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water.</b> In some parts of Argentina, gas stations sponsored by yerba mate producers provide free hot water to travelers, specifically {{for the purpose of}} drinking during the journey. Disposable mate sets with a plastic mate and straw and sets with a thermos flask and stacking containers for the yerba and sugar inside a fitted case are available.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{trick in}} a solar water heating {{system is to}} use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are vacuum- insulated, acting {{something}} like large thermos bottles. The tank is filled <b>with</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight. Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.|$|E
25|$|The eleven {{locomotives}} in {{the class}} had condensing apparatus that fed the exhaust steam {{back into the water}} tanks. The tanks themselves were shortened {{to make room for the}} external exhaust pipes and were extended down to the footplate in front of the cab to increase their capacity. As condensing the steam heated the water, a reciprocating pump (Weir pump) was fitted as a boiler feedwater pump because standard injectors will not work <b>with</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water.</b> The pumps led to (unsuccessful) tests with these locomotives acting as fire engines during World War II.|$|E

25|$|These {{complexes}} {{consist of}} cell wings radiating in a semi or full circle array from a center tower whence the prison could be kept under constant surveillance. The {{design for the}} penitentiary which Haviland devised {{became known as the}} hub-and-spoke plan which consisted of an octagonal center connected by corridors to seven radiating single-story cell blocks, each containing two ranges of large single cells—8 x 12 feet x 10 feet high- <b>with</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> heating, a water tap, toilet, and individual exercise yards the same width as the cell.|$|E
25|$|Table sugar (sucrose) {{comes from}} plant sources. Two {{important}} sugar crops predominate: sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) and sugar beets (Beta vulgaris), in which sugar {{can account for}} 12% to 20% of the plant's dry weight. Minor commercial sugar crops include the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), and the sugar maple (Acer saccharum). Sucrose is obtained by extraction of these crops <b>with</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water,</b> concentration of the extract gives syrups, from which solid sucrose can be crystallized. In 2013, worldwide production of table sugar amounted to 175 million tonnes.|$|E
25|$|Knott {{was known}} for his {{idiosyncratic}} behaviour on the field. His trademarks included always keeping his shirt collar turned up to protect him from the sun; his sleeves rolled down to safeguard his elbows when diving; and, after a tip from former Northamptonshire and England wicket-keeper Keith Andrew, warming his hands <b>with</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> before going on the field. According to Bob Taylor, Knott preferred strong-backed gloves with full webbing and plenty of padding in the palms, wearing two pairs of Chamois inners with strips of plasticine across the palms.|$|E

25|$|Matcha Like gyokuro, matcha is shaded before plucking. The plucked and {{processed}} leaf is called tencha. This product is then ground into a fine powder, which is matcha. Because the tea powder is very perishable, matcha is usually sold in small quantities. It is typically rather expensive. Matcha {{is the type}} of tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony. It is prepared by whisking the tea <b>with</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> in a bowl, until the surface is frothy. If the water is too hot, the tea may become overly bitter.|$|E

This camping area has a modern wash houses as well as several fire rings and picnic tables. The picnic area is by the lake near the swimming pool. The pool is open Memorial Day weekend until Labor Day weekend from 11:00 am until 7:00 pm.|$|E
25|$|The seeds {{themselves}} {{do not contain}} significant amounts of opiates. But a poppy tea consumed in some areas and {{often referred to as}} doda has been controversial for containing ground opium poppy plant, especially the seed head, and contains significant levels of opiates. Popular in some South Asian communities, doda is created by grinding dried poppy husks or poppy seeds into a fine powder and then ingesting the mix <b>with</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> or tea. In Canada, doda is made from poppy plants brought in from Afghanistan and Arizona under the guise of legal purposes such as floral arrangements, but is sold illegally from some meat markets.|$|E
5000|$|Recirculation systems: Since a {{tankless}} {{water heater}} is inactive when <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> is not being used, they are incompatible <b>with</b> passive (convection-based) <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> recirculation systems. They may be incompatible <b>with</b> active <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> recirculation systems and certainly use more energy to constantly heat water within the piping, defeating one of a {{tankless water heater}}'s primary advantages. On-demand recirculating pumps are often used to minimize <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> wait times from tankless water heaters and save water being wasted down the drain. On-demand recirculating pumps are activated by push-button or other sensor. A water contacting temperature probe installed at the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> usage point signals the pump to stop. Single-cycle pumping events only occur when <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> is needed thereby preventing the energy waste associated with constantly heating water within piping.|$|R
