[...] The {{performance}} included on the DVD was filmed at the Capitol, a building {{that used to be}} a bank, in Ocala, on January 5, 2008. The performance was filmed by Dan Dobi, with audio recorded by Wade. In February and March 2008, the band went on a US tour alongside Silverstein, the Devil Wears Prada, Protest the Hero and Four Letter Lie. The music video for [...] "The Danger in Starting a Fire" [...] was posted online on February 29, 2008. In early April, the band appeared at the Bamboozle Left festival. On April 16, 2008, it was announced that the band would be filming a music video for [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] on April 29 and 30. Five days later, it was mentioned online that the video's director was Don Tyler. In June and July, the band performed on the 2008 edition of Warped Tour. The music video for [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] appeared on YouTube on July 23. In September and October, the band went on a US tour with New Found Glory. The re-recorded version of [...] "Heartless" [...] appeared on the band's MySpace profile in October 2008.|$|E

He envisions a technologically governed totalitarian regime that dominates society through total information control. Zamyatin's <b>We</b> <b>is</b> recognized <b>as</b> <b>an</b> influence on both Huxley and Orwell; Orwell published a book review of We shortly after it {{was first published in}} English, several years before writing 1984.|$|R

Yes, there have been enquiries from other big clubs, but I have no interest in going anywhere.

2500|$|Huckabee said on May 16 that, if his {{campaign}} falters, {{he would have}} to think long and hard before agreeing to become a vice-presidential candidate on a ticket whose presidential candidate believes that abortion should remain legal. [...] "This is an issue to me that is very critical. It's {{one of the reasons that}} I got into politics because I believe the manner in which we treat innocent life and the matter in which we respect human life, at whatever stage ... is an incredibly powerful statement about who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> people," [...] Huckabee told reporters in a conference call in South Carolina.|$|E
2500|$|Bush's {{election}} to the U.S. presidency [...] "changed" [...] Greenwald's previous uninvolved political attitude toward the electoral process [...] "completely", and in 2006 he wrote: Over the past five years, a creeping extremism has taken hold of our federal government, and it is threatening to radically alter our system of government and who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nation. This extremism is neither conservative nor liberal in nature, but is instead driven by theories of unlimited presidential power that are wholly alien, and antithetical, to the core political values that have governed this country since its founding"; for, [...] "the fact that this seizure of ever-expanding presidential power is largely justified through endless, rank fear-mongering—fear of terrorists, specifically—means that not only our system of government is radically changing, but so, too, are our national character, our national identity, {{and what it means}} to be American." ...|$|E

2500|$|UKIP {{considers}} {{itself to}} be a British unionist party, although its support base is centred largely in England. Farage has characterised his party's growth as [...] "a very English rebellion", and has described UKIP as [...] "unashamedly patriotic, proud to be who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nation". The political scientist Richard Hayton argued that UKIP's British unionism reflects [...] "Anglo-Britishness", a perspective that blurs the distinction between Britain and England. With Mycock, Hayton argued that in conflating Englishness with Britishness, UKIP exhibited an [...] "inherent Anglocentrism" [...] that negates the distinct culture of the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish peoples of the United Kingdom. Hayton suggests that UKIP tap into [...] "a vein of nostalgic cultural nationalism" [...] within England, {{and it has been}} noted that UKIP's discourse frames the image of Englishness in a nostalgic manner, harking back to the years before the collapse of the British Empire.|$|E
2500|$|She graced every {{printed cover}} of Good Housekeeping from December 1917 through April 1933, {{becoming}} the artist with the longest run of illustrated magazine covers. She created {{a total of}} 184 illustrations of family scenes for the magazine. The magazine said of her, [...] "Certainly no other artist is so fitted to understand us, and to make for us pictures so truly an index to what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> magazine are striving for. The holding up to our readers of the highest ideals of the American home, the home with that certain sweet wholesomeness one associates with a sunny living-room—and children." [...] She {{was one of the}} highest paid illustrators of the time, earning over $1,500 per cover. Smith also created illustrations for Kodak and Procter & Gamble's Ivory soap over the course of her career. She made illustrations for Collier's magazines and of Charles Dickens' works, like Tiny Tim, Dickens' Children - Ten Children, and David Copperfield.|$|E
2500|$|The {{three main}} issues were RCA {{position}} on homosexuality, {{the adoption of}} the Belhar confession and complementarianism. Beyond the three reasons University Reformed Church mentioned: [...] "We have a deep desire to belong to a family of churches where who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> congregation fits squarely with what our denomination does and believes." [...] "We want to raise up pastors who do not fear that the ordination process is against them"."We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "We {{want to be in a}} denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, notsome extreme right flank". [...] "The denomination(RCA) has moved away from churches like ours." [...] "We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "In practice, the RCA is already well down this path [...] and that given the way our classical structure works those who stand for biblical orthodoxy can do little to stop it. We believe laboring in such a mixed denomination undermines the true nature of biblical unity, hinders our witness for Christ, and does not represent the most effective avenue for ministry for URC in the years and decades ahead." [...] "URC would be able to serve with greater integrity and disciple our people (especially ministerial candidates) more effectively if we were in a denomination that shares our complementarian convictions, rather than in one that is moving full speed ahead in the other direction." [...] "We(URC) are troubled by the weak form of confessional subscription in the RCA, the process for examining ministerial candidates, and our formal ecumenical ties with liberal denominations like the UCC, ELCA and PCUSA". [...] "We have often heard from visitors that though they lived in Lansing for years they never thought to visit URC because it was an RCA church or because of things they had heard about liberal leanings in the RCA. How many others might be staying away because our denominational affiliation gives them the wrong idea about who we are and what we believe?"We do not recommend our RCA seminaries. [...] "We want to be in a denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, not some extreme right flank". [...] "The RCA connection inhibits interest in planting churches, the vision for training up pastors, and placement for new pastors." [...] "we also feel a measure of distance between us and most churches in the denomination".|$|E

60|$|Then we {{have been}} told that {{responsible}} government presupposes Party government, and that in the Orange River Colony there are not the elements of political parties, that there is not that diversity of interests which we see in the Transvaal, that there are not the same sharp differences between town and country, or the same astonishing contrasts between wealth and poverty which prevail in the Transvaal. And we are told that, in order that responsible government should work properly, and Party government should be a success, there must be the essential elements of Party conflict. I suppose <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> majority in this House, admirers of the Party system of government; but I do not think that we should any of us carry our admiration of that system {{so far as to say}} that the nation is unfit to enjoy the privilege of managing its own affairs unless it can find some one to quarrel with and plenty of things to quarrel about.|$|E
60|$|We must {{therefore}} give ourselves no airs of superiority when denouncing the cruelties of vivisection. We all do just as horrible things, with even less excuse. But in making that admission {{we are also}} making short work of the virtuous airs with which we are sometimes referred to the humanity of the medical profession as a guarantee that vivisection is not abused--much as if our burglars should assure us that they arc too honest to abuse the practice of burgling. <b>We</b> <b>are,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> matter of fact, a cruel nation; and our habit of disguising our vices by giving polite names to the offences {{we are determined to}} commit does not, unfortunately for my own comfort, impose on me. Vivisectors can hardly pretend to be better than the classes from which they are drawn, or those above them; and if these classes are capable of sacrificing animals in various cruel ways under cover of sport, fashion, education, discipline, and even, when the cruel sacrifices are human sacrifices, of political economy, it is idle for the vivisector to pretend that he is incapable of practising cruelty for pleasure or profit or both under the cloak of science. We are all tarred with the same brush; and the vivisectors are not slow to remind us of it, and to protest vehemently against being branded as exceptionally cruel and its devisors of horrible instruments of torture by people whose main notion of enjoyment is cruel sport, and whose requirements in the way of villainously cruel traps occupy pages of the catalogue of the Army and Navy Stores.|$|E

40|$|As I have {{reflected}} on the presentation of this topic, and what focus {{it would take for}} me, it became quite clear {{that it is necessary to}} place a discussion of gender-based violence within a context of two key concepts – culture and socialization- in order that you understand the filter out of which my approach is founded and explored. Culture is a dynamic system, ever changing, of the integrated, accepted, and patterned ways of life of a given people and society; the unique achievements, the ways of believing, doing, behaving, seeing, that distinguishes one group from the other. Culture is shared and learned. Culture defines who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> individual and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> people, holding alive our past, reflecting our values, and articulating our hopes. For me, multicultural education is an ongoing cultural awareness process that recognizes, respects and accepts the human dignity and cultural diversity of each individual, promoting an understanding of self and others. As process, multicultural education is a continual development of cultural awareness- an awareness that resides within the person’s perception, attitudes, values, the hidden unconscious level of one’s being, as well as within the external factors of content, curriculum, and materials.

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>are,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nation, in {{the truly}} {{extraordinary}} condition {{of not knowing}} our own merits. We have played a great and splendid part {{in the history of}} universal thought and sentiment; we have been among the foremost in that eternal and bloodless battle in which the blows do not slay, but create. In painting and music we are inferior to many other nations; but in literature, science, philosophy, and political eloquence, if history be taken as a whole, we can hold our own with any. But all this vast heritage of intellectual glory is kept from our schoolboys like a heresy; and they are left to live and die in the dull and infantile type of patriotism which they learnt from a box of tin soldiers. There is no harm in the box of tin soldiers; we do not expect children to be equally delighted with a beautiful box of tin philanthropists. But there is great harm {{in the fact that the}} subtler and more civilized honour of England is not presented so as to keep pace with the expanding mind. A French boy is taught the glory of Molière as well as that of Turenne; a German boy is taught his own great national philosophy before he learns the philosophy of antiquity. The result is that, though French patriotism is often crazy and boastful, though German patriotism is often isolated and pedantic, they are neither of them merely dull, common, and brutal, as is so often the strange fate of the nation of Bacon and Locke. It is natural enough, and even righteous enough, under the circumstances. An Englishman must love England for something; consequently, he tends to exalt commerce or prize-fighting, just as a German might tend to exalt music, or a Flamand to exalt painting, because he really believes it is the chief merit of his fatherland. It would not be in the least extraordinary if a claim of eating up provinces and pulling down princes were the chief boast of a Zulu. The extraordinary thing is, that it is the chief boast of a people who have Shakespeare, Newton, Burke, and Darwin to boast of.|$|E
