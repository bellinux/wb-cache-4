5|$|In {{a modern}} note {{written on a}} {{fly-leaf}} {{at the end of}} the book it is said that the author of the Chronicle was one Gregory Skinner (meaning William Gregory of the Skinners' Company) who was Mayor of London in 1451, the thirtieth year of Henry VI. And when <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chronicle itself the fact seems to be pretty well borne out by what the author himself says in the record of that year.|$|E
5|$|A social {{rational}} for the Hindu {{concept of}} rebirth in Hell {{is evident in}} the metric work of the Manusmrti: a written discourse focused on the “law of the social classes”. A large portion of it is designed to help people of the Hindu faith understand evil deeds (pätaka) and their karmic consequences in various hellish rebirths. The Manusmrti, however, does not go into explicit detail of each hell. For this <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bhagavata Purana. The Manusmrti lists multiple levels of hell in which a person can be reborn into. The punishments in each of these consecutive hells is directly related the crimes (pätaka) of the current life and how these deeds will effect the next reincarnation during the cycle of Saṃsāra This concept provides structure to society in which crimes have exacting consequences. An opposite social facet to these hellish rebirths is the precise way in which a person can redeem oneself from a particular crime through a series of vows (such as fasting, water purification rituals, chanting, and even sacrifices). These vows must take place during the same life cycle that the crimes were committed in. These religious lessons assist the societal structure by defining approved and unapproved social behavior.|$|E

25|$|This form {{suggests}} {{that if we can}} find a function ψ whose gradient is given by P, then the integral A is given by the difference of ψ at the endpoints of the interval of integration. Thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary can be related {{to the study of the}} level surfaces of ψ. In order to find such a function, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wave equation, which governs the propagation of light. This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics.|$|E

60|$|Again <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{figure in}} the corner, and {{there is such a}} light on his face that we shade our eyes. He is smoking the Arcadia, and as he smokes the tragedy of Hamlet takes form in his brain.|$|E

60|$|These, {{and such}} other {{considerations}} not directly connected with our subject, I shall, perhaps, {{be able to}} press farther {{at the close of}} my work; meantime, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> immediate question, of the distinction between the lower and higher picturesque, and the artists who pursue them.|$|E

60|$|And if <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{possibilities}} of air-transport {{in the future}} we are forced towards the same conclusion, that {{the security of the}} British Empire must rest in the future not on its strength in warfare, but on its keeping the peace within and without its boundaries.|$|E

60|$|From hence <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{south-west}} to Castle Rising, an old decayed borough town, {{with perhaps}} not ten families in it, which yet (to the scandal of our prescription right) sends two {{members to the}} British Parliament, being as many as the City of Norwich itself or any town in the kingdom, London excepted, can do.|$|E
6000|$|If <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great English satirists of {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries, for example, we find that they had this rough but firm grasp of the size and strength, the value and the best points of their adversary.

6000|$|From {{philology}} <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{examination of}} literary fragments, which will necessarily establish our already secured position (that Gladstone is the sun), or {{so much the}} worse for the fragments. These have reached us {{in the shape of}} burned and torn scraps of paper, covered with printed texts, which resolve themselves into hymns, and imprecations or curses. It appears to have been the custom of the worshippers of Gladstone to salute his rising, at each dawn, with printed outcries of adoration and delight, resembling in character the Osirian hymns.

60|$|The Indian {{was struck}} with this reply, which suited the {{character}} of his mind. Thrusting out his hand, he received mine, and shook it cordially, as much as {{to say he was}} satisfied.

6000|$|For instance, when Achilles goes, {{in great}} anger and sorrow, to {{complain}} to Thetis of the scorn done him by Agamemnon, the sea appears to him [...] "wine-colored." [...] One might think {{this meant that}} the sea looked dark and reddish-purple to him, in a kind of sympathy with his anger. But <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> passage of Sophocles, which has been above quoted--a passage peculiarly intended to express peace and rest--and we find that the birds sing among [...] "wine-colored" [...] ivy. The uncertainty of conception of the hue itself, and entire absence of expressive character in the word, could hardly be more clearly manifested.|$|E
6000|$|But {{it is no}} less true {{that the}} Hebrew and the Septuagint {{versions}} of most, if not all, of the Old Testament books existed before the birth of Jesus of Nazareth; and that their divine authority is presupposed by, and therefore can hardly depend upon, the religious body constituted by his disciples. As everybody knows, the very conception of a [...] "Christ" [...] is purely Jewish. The validity of the argument from the Messianic prophecies vanishes unless their infallible authority is granted; and, {{as a matter of}} fact, whether <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gospels, the Epistles, or the writings of the early Apologists, the Jewish scriptures are recognised as the highest court of appeal of the Christian.|$|E
60|$|If <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Convention, we {{find the}} {{position}} equally distracting. They, too, feared another insurrection and a second decimation. If the Right helped Robespierre to destroy the Fouchés and Vadiers, he would be stronger than ever; and what security had they against a repetition of {{the violence of the}} Thirty-first of May? If the Dantonists joined in destroying Robespierre, they would be helping the Right, and what security had they against a Girondin reaction? On the other hand, the Centre might fairly hope, just what Billaud feared, that if the Committee came to the Convention to crush Robespierre, that would end in a combination strong enough to enable the Convention to crush the Committees.|$|E
