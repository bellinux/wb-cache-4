5|$|Author Jeremy Rifkin had {{previously}} written several books that, like The Empathic Civilization, {{have attempted to}} extrapolate trends in the economy, technology, and society. For example, his 1995 book The End of Work concerns the changes that tele-commuting {{would have on the}} workplace, his 1998 book The Biotech Century concerns the expected impacts of genetic engineering, and his 2002 book The Hydrogen Economy concerns the economic and social effects that will result from the expected replacement of fossil fuels with hydrogen as an energy storage medium. His last book before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream, published in 2004, comparing the American Dream <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> expressed by Europeans in the post-industrial economy. At the time of publication, the 64-year-old Rifkin was working as an advisor to the European Union concerning issues relating to the economy, climate change, and energy security, as well as president of the American non-profit organization the Foundation on Economic Trends.|$|E
5|$|By {{combining}} {{the distance between}} the aircraft and satellite, speed, and heading with aircraft performance constraints (e.g. fuel consumption, possible speeds and altitudes), investigators generated candidate paths that were analysed separately by two methods. The first assumed the aircraft was flying on one of the three autopilot modes (two are further affected by whether the navigation system used magnetic north or true north as a reference), calculated the BTO and BFO values along these routes, and compared them <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> recorded from Flight 370. The second method generated paths which had the aircraft's speed and heading adjusted at the time of each handshake to minimise the difference between the calculated BFO of the path and the values recorded from Flight 370. A probability distribution for each method at the BTO arc of the sixth handshake of the two methods was created and then compared; 80 percent of the highest probability paths for both analyses combined intersect the BTO arc of the sixth handshake between 32.5°S and 38.1°S, which can be extrapolated to 33.5°S and 38.3°S along the BTO arc of the seventh handshake.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the Young Turks' press conference, Taylor privately met Khánh at the latter's office. He complained about the {{dissolution}} of the HNC and said it did not accord <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> of the alliance and the loyalty Washington expected of Saigon. He added that the US could not cooperate with two governments at once: a military regime that held power while a civilian body took the responsibility. Khánh testily replied that Vietnam was not a satellite of the US and compared the situation to the US support of the successful coup against Diệm, saying that loyalty was meant to be reciprocated. Khánh had hinted that he felt the Americans were about to have him deposed like Diệm, who was then assassinated, but this rankled Taylor, who had argued against the regime change. Taylor then bemoaned Khánh, saying he had lost confidence in the Vietnamese officer, recommending Khánh resign and go into exile. He also said military supplies currently being shipped to Vietnam would be withheld after arriving in Saigon and that American help in planning and advising military operations would be suspended.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at (1) {{identifying}} and analyzing {{the raw materials}} potential for seaweed agroindustry in Southeast Sulawesi, (2) analyzing and determining the location for developing seaweed agroindustry, (3) analyzing the cost structure for seaweed agroindustry activity {{in order to find}} out its feasibility and risk, (4) analyzing the added-value of seaweed agroindusty product, and (5) analyzing and determining the development priority of seaweed agroindustry in Southeast Sulawesi. The results of study showed that (1) The availability of raw materials for seaweed agroindustry in Southeast Sulawesi was more than enough. Southeast Sulawesi had the seaweed cultivation potential of around 89, 700 hectares (39 percent of sea cultivation potential). The potential of raw material resources reached 708, 584 tons of wet seaweed or 212, 575 tons of dry seaweed in one harvest time or around 141, 717 tons of dry seaweed per month; (2) The strategic location for developing seaweed agroindustry was Kendari District <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> of 11. 5964.

25|$|Values such {{as these}} do not give answers {{as to how to}} handle a {{particular}} situation, but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts. When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical dilemma or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists, and occasionally, the values of the medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members. For example, some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse blood transfusions, considering them life-saving; and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the HIV era.|$|E
25|$|The Yesode Hatora - Beth Jacob {{population}} is composed primarily {{of students from}} Hasidic, Haredi, and Orthodox backgrounds.

Students are educated in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> of Orthodox Judaism and fulfill the educational requirements of the Belgian Ministry of Education. The student {{population is}} separated by gender; male students attend Yesode Hatora and female students attend Beth Jacob. In accordance with the religious ideology that puts little value on secular learning, the school actively discourages the pursuit of secular higher education.|$|E

A large format 5-shilling value complemented the set in 1886 and this was used until 1911. Also in 1886, the GPO moved to Palazzo Parisio in Merchants Street, Valletta. Police stations in several villages began to sell stamps around 1891. Bollo personale, or postmen's personal handstamps, were used to indicate which postman delivered a particular letter.
