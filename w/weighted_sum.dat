25|$|Radio {{resource}} management is often solved by scalarization; that is, {{selection of a}} network utility function that tries to balance throughput and user fairness. The choice of utility function has a large impact on the computational complexity of the resulting single-objective optimization problem. For example, the common utility of <b>weighted</b> <b>sum</b> rate gives an NP-hard problem with a complexity that scales exponentially {{with the number of}} users, while the weighted max-min fairness utility results in a quasi-convex optimization problem with only a polynomial scaling with the number of users.|$|E
25|$|Like B-splines, NURBS {{control points}} {{determine}} {{the shape of}} the curve. Each point of the curve is computed by taking a <b>weighted</b> <b>sum</b> of a number of control points. The weight of each point varies according to the governing parameter. For a curve of degree d, the influence of any control point is only nonzero in d+1 intervals (knot spans) of the parameter space. Within those intervals, the weight changes according to a polynomial function (basis functions) of degree d. At the boundaries of the intervals, the basis functions go smoothly to zero, the smoothness being determined by the degree of the polynomial.|$|E

[25] investigated the conditional convergence for randomly weighted sums; Gao and Wang [26] and Tang and Yuan [27] investigated the randomly <b>weighted</b> <b>sums</b> of random variables and have given an application to ruin theory and capital allocation; Chen [28] obtained some asymptotically results of randomly <b>weighted</b> <b>sums</b> of dependent random variables with dominated variation, and so on.|$|R
30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{analysis}} of <b>weighted</b> <b>sums</b> {{plays an important role in}} the statistics, such as jackknife estimate, nonparametric regression function estimate and so on.

25|$|The {{integrals}} of the XYZ {{color matching}} functions must all be equal by requirement 3 above, {{and this is}} set by the integral of the photopic luminous efficiency function by requirement 2 above. The tabulated sensitivity curves have {{a certain amount of}} arbitrariness in them. The shapes of the individual X, Y and Z sensitivity curves can be measured with a reasonable accuracy. However, the overall luminosity curve (which in fact is a <b>weighted</b> <b>sum</b> of these three curves) is subjective, since it involves asking a test person whether two light sources have the same brightness, even if they are in completely different colors. Along the same lines, the relative magnitudes of the X, Y, and Z curves are arbitrary. Furthermore, one could define a valid color space with an X sensitivity curve that has twice the amplitude. This new color space would have a different shape. The sensitivity curves in the CIE 1931 and 1964 XYZ color spaces are scaled to have equal areas under the curves.|$|E
25|$|If a graph {{is drawn}} {{in the plane}} with {{straight}} line edges, then an equilibrium stress is defined as an assignment of nonzero real numbers (weights) to the edges, with the property that each vertex is in the position given by the <b>weighted</b> <b>sum</b> of its neighbors. According to the Maxwell–Cremona correspondence, an equilibrium stress can be lifted to a piecewise linear continuous three-dimensional surface such that the edges forming the boundaries between the flat parts of the surface project to the given drawing. The weight and length of each edge determines the difference in slopes of the surface {{on either side of}} the edge, and the condition that each vertex is in equilibrium with its neighbors is equivalent to the condition that these slope differences cause the surface to meet up with itself correctly in the neighborhood of the vertex. Positive weights translate to convex dihedral angles between two faces of the piecewise linear surface, and negative weights translate to concave dihedral angles. Conversely, every continuous piecewise-linear surface comes from an equilibrium stress in this way. If a finite planar graph is drawn and given an equilibrium stress in such a way that all interior edges of the drawing have positive weights, and all exterior edges have negative weights, then by translating this stress into a three-dimensional surface in this way, and then replacing the flat surface representing the exterior of the graph by its complement in the same plane, one obtains a convex poyhedron, with the additional property that its perpendicular projection onto the plane has no crossings.|$|E
500|$|Each league's {{award is}} voted on {{by members of}} the Baseball Writers' Association of America, with one {{representative}} from each team. As of the 2010 season, each voter places a vote for first, second, third, fourth and fifth place among the pitchers of each league.
