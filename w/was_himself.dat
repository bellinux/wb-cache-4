5|$|Although Blake <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> {{a member}} of the Spanish Regency, he was junior to Castaños in the {{military}} hierarchy (but senior to Ballasteros). He consequently did not protest when General Castaños agreed that Marshal Beresford, who was also junior to Castaños in rank, should command the combined Allied armies in any battle because there were more men in the Anglo-Portuguese force.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Warren Sledd (November 7, 1870 – March 16, 1939) was an American theologian, {{university}} professor and university president. A native of Virginia, {{he was the}} son of a prominent Methodist minister, and <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> ordained as a minister after earning his bachelor's and master's degrees. He later earned a second master's degree and his doctorate.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's speech {{received}} much less attention than his (now famous) remarks in Indianapolis and was largely forgotten {{by the news}} media.

5000|$|Thomas Fowler (1869) {{states the}} paradox as follows: [...] "Epimenides the Cretan says, 'that all the Cretans are liars,' but Epimenides <b>is</b> <b>himself</b> a Cretan; {{therefore}} he <b>is</b> <b>himself</b> a liar. But if he be a liar, {{what he says}} is untrue, and consequently the Cretans are veracious; but Epimenides is a Cretan, and therefore {{what he says is}} true; saying the Cretans are liars, Epimenides <b>is</b> <b>himself</b> a liar, and what he says is untrue. Thus we may go on alternately proving that Epimenides and the Cretans are truthful and untruthful." ...|$|R

5|$|The carvings at Isurumuniya {{are some}} of the best {{examples}} of the stone carving art of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Skill in arts was a respected and valued trait during this period and artists were well rewarded by the rulers.

5|$|The initial raiding parties {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi warriors. The first attack came on May 19, 1832, when Ho-Chunks ambushed six men near Buffalo Grove, Illinois, killing {{a man named}} William Durley. Durley's scalped and mutilated body was found by Indian agent Felix St. Vrain. The Indian agent <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> killed and mutilated, along with three other men, several days later at Kellogg's Grove.|$|E

5|$|Although Charles Holden had {{gradually}} reduced his workload, he {{was still}} continuing {{to go into the}} office three days per week during the early 1950s. He did not formally retire until 1958, but even then he visited occasionally. Margaret Holden died in 1954 after a protracted illness which had left her nearly blind since the mid-1940s. In the last decade of his life, Holden <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> physically weaker and was looked after by his niece Minnie Green.|$|E
5|$|Another {{cause of}} revulsion against Webster was her attempt to {{impersonate}} Thomas. She {{had managed to}} perpetrate the impersonation for two weeks, implying that middle-class identity amounted {{to little more than}} cultivating the right demeanour and having the appropriate clothes and possessions, whether or not they had been earned. John Church, the publican whom Webster had attempted to implicate, <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and effective management of his pub. His commitment to bettering himself through hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. Webster, in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.|$|E
5|$|Another former Hibernian player, John Hughes, {{was soon}} {{appointed}} {{in place of}} Paatelainen. Hughes, who made high-profile signings such as Anthony Stokes and Liam Miller, led Hibs {{to a good start}} to the 2009–10 season. Hibs finished fourth and qualified for the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. A poor start to the following season, including first round exits in Europe and the League Cup, led to Hughes leaving the club by mutual consent. Hughes was replaced by Colin Calderwood, who <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> sacked on 6 November 2011.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Sanh's {{activities}} in the 1910s, there were {{two members of the}} Nguyễn Dynasty who commanded respect among Vietnamese monarchists. The first was the boy emperor Duy Tân, who <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> deported in 1916 after staging an uprising. Duy Tan's grandfather, Emperor Dục Đức, was the adopted son of the childless Emperor Tự Đức, the last independent emperor of Vietnam. The second figure who was seen by Vietnamese as a possible leader of an independent monarchy was Prince Cường Để. Cường Để was a direct descendant of Emperor Gia Long, who had established the Nguyễn Dynasty and unified Vietnam in its modern state. Cường Để was a prominent anti-colonial activist who lived in exile in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Bosa (died c. 705) was an Anglo-Saxon Bishop of York {{during the}} 7th and early 8th centuries. He was educated at Whitby Abbey, {{where he became}} a monk. Following Wilfrid's removal from York in 678 the diocese was divided into three, leaving a greatly reduced see of York, to which Bosa was {{appointed}} bishop. He <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> removed in 687 and replaced by Wilfrid, but in 691 Wilfrid was once more ejected and Bosa returned to the see. He died in about 705, and subsequently appears as a saint in an 8th-century liturgical calendar.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> {{a critic}} of Big Science in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose {{approach}} he considered careless and focused on technology {{at the expense of}} science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the Solvay Conference in 1933, Chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, thereby causing the effect that the Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment.|$|E

5|$|Diefenbaker {{would often}} spend {{weekends}} {{with his parents}} in Saskatoon. While there, he began to woo Olive Freeman, daughter of the Baptist minister, but in 1921, she moved with her family to Brandon, Manitoba, and the two lost touch for more than 20 years. He then courted Beth Newell, a cashier in Saskatoon, and by 1922, the two were engaged. However, in 1923, Newell was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and Diefenbaker broke off contact with her. She died the following year. Diefenbaker <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> subject to internal bleeding, and may have feared that the disease would be transmitted to him. In late 1923, he had an operation at the Mayo Clinic for a gastric ulcer, but his health remained uncertain for several more years.|$|E
5|$|Domnall was {{a son of}} Murchad mac Diarmata, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1070), who <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> a son of Diarmait mac Máel na mBó, King of Leinster (died 1072). Domnall was, therefore, {{a member}} of the Uí Chennselaig; as well as the first of the Meic Murchada, a branch of the Uí Chennselaig named after his father. Domnall had two brothers: Donnchad (died 1115), a later King of Leinster, and Énna.|$|E
5|$|During the period, he also faced a Russian Bolshevik {{military}} action: {{just before}} Averescu came to power, as Russia's Leon Trotsky negotiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, the Rumcherod administrative body in Odessa, led by Christian Rakovsky, ordered an offensive {{from the east}} into Romania. In order to prevent further losses, Averescu signed his name to a much-criticized temporary armistice with the Rumcherod; eventually, Rakovsky <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> faced with a German offensive (sparked by the temporary breakdown of negotiations at Brest-Litovsk), and had to abandon both his command and the base in Odessa.|$|E

5|$|Goronwy's {{eldest son}} Hywel ap Goronwy joined the priesthood, {{and became a}} canon of Bangor Cathedral. In 1357, Hywel became the Archdeacon of Anglesey. Gruffydd drowned in 1344. Goronwy ap Tudur Hen {{was one of the}} direct {{ancestors}} of the Royal House of Tudor. His son Tudur ap Goronwy became a knight in the service of Edward III, and was the grandfather of Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur (through his son Maredudd ap Tudur, grandson to Goronwy ap Tudur Hen). Owain Anglicised his name, becoming Owen Tudor, and <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> the grandfather of King Henry VII of England, the founder of the House of Tudor.|$|E
5|$|Hines led John Hunt Morgan back to Confederate lines. First, {{they arrived}} at the train station in {{downtown}} Columbus, where they bought tickets to Cincinnati, Ohio. The duo jumped off the train before it entered the Cincinnati train station. They continued to evade capture in Cincinnati, staying for one night at the Ben Johnson House in Bardstown, Kentucky. In Tennessee, Hines diverted the Union troops' attention away from John Hunt Morgan, and <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> recaptured and sentenced to death by hanging. He escaped that night by telling stories to the soldier in charge of him and subdued him when given the chance. A few days later he again escaped Union soldiers who intended to hang him.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Waugh {{embarked}} on an extended voyage to South America. His decision to absent himself {{may have been a}} reaction to his increasingly complicated emotional life; while his passion for Teresa Jungman remained unrequited, he was involved in various unsatisfactory casual sexual liaisons, and <b>was</b> <b>himself</b> being pursued by the much older Hazel Lavery. The choice of South America was probably influenced by Peter Fleming, the literary editor of The Spectator. Fleming had recently returned from an expedition to Brazil seeking traces of Colonel Percy Fawcett who, in 1925, had disappeared in Brazil while searching for a fabled lost city.|$|E
