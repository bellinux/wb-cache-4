The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan, Ivan and his cavalry approached Constantinople while Michael Shishman <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> Yambol with his army. The plot was uncovered by the spies of Andronikos III. Fearing for his own imperial ambitions, {{he wrote to his}} rival and grandfather not to accept the Bulgarians into the capital. While Ivan stuck to the plan and signed an oath that he had come with peace to persuade the Byzantines, he promptly retreated to Bulgarian territory upon receiving that order from Michael Shishman.|$|E

On 27 June, following further discussions in London, the brothers were arrested on a warrant issued under the Fugitive Offenders Act, and brought before the Georgetown magistrates, where they were charged with the theft of Girl Pat.|$|E

5|$|Richard Nixon {{was buried}} beside his wife Pat {{on the grounds}} of the Nixon Library. He was survived by his two daughters, Tricia and Julie, and four grandchildren. In keeping with his wishes, his funeral was not a full state funeral, though his body did lie in repose in the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 to the morning of the funeral service. Mourners <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> line for up to eight hours in chilly, wet weather to pay their respects. At its peak, the line to pass by Nixon's casket was three miles long with an {{estimated}} 42,000 people waiting.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana further adds: Kabandha {{spent his}} days near the hermitage of the sage Matanga in the Krauncha forest. There, he spent his time scaring sages. Once, Kabandha {{attacked}} the sage Stulashira, who cursed him to remain in his hideous form for eternity. Upon Kabandha's pleading, the sage reduced his curse and said that Kabandha would be freed of his form, once Rama and Lakshmana sever his arms. So Kabandha <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> that forest for Rama's arrival. Growse suspected the tale to be a later interpolation arguing {{that it does not}} appear in all versions/translations of the original Ramayana.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle on}} September 19 began when Burgoyne moved {{some of his}} troops {{in an attempt to}} flank the entrenched American {{position}} on Bemis Heights. Benedict Arnold anticipated the maneuver and placed significant forces in his way. Burgoyne did gain control of Freeman's Farm, but it came at the cost of significant casualties. Skirmishing continued in the days following the battle, while Burgoyne <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> the hope that reinforcements would arrive from New York City. Patriot militia forces continued to arrive, meanwhile, swelling the size of the American army. Disputes within the American camp led Gates to strip Arnold of his command.|$|E

5|$|Thirteen {{thousand}} troops under General-Admiral Fyodor Apraksin {{marched to}} Viborg and laid siege on 22 March 1710. Magnus Stiernstr√•le, the Swedish commander at the fort, <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> vain for Swedish assistance, while a stalemate ensued because the Russians lacked sufficient artillery. In April, Peter the Great managed to bring through {{a fleet of}} 250 ships to deliver guns and supplies, and to help perform a final assault on Swedish positions. After these Russian attacks, the Swedish garrison surrendered on 12 June 1710.|$|E
5|$|AT Park is {{distinguished}} {{by having the}} San Francisco Bay beyond its right field bleachers. The body of water located adjacent to the ballpark is known as McCovey Cove, named for legendary Giants slugger Willie McCovey. McCovey Cove is known for having many fans sitting in the water in kayaks and boats hoping to retrieve a long home run ball hit there. Though dozens of fans <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> the cove during the Derby, no home runs were actually hit into the water, either on the fly or off the promenade next to the right field seats, though, one foul ball hit by Prince Fielder did reach the water. This was {{largely due to the}} three left-handed competitors all exiting in the first round, as well as wind currents blowing toward left field. Prior to the All-Star break, a total of 58 home runs were hit into the cove on the fly during the park's history.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Strategic {{customers}} {{take their}} waiting time into consideration upon making decisions. While satisfactorily completed service increases utility of a customer, {{waiting to be}} served decreases this utility in a queueing type service system. <b>In</b> this system, <b>waiting</b> can be classified into two: <b>in</b> queue <b>waiting</b> and <b>in</b> service <b>waiting.</b> Unlike the literature, proposed model assumes <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> a queue, while other customers are being served, differs from <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> service where the former one decreases the utility of a customer more. This paper analyzes decision making of a customer under this assumption. Comparing decision of the customer under proposed assumption and literature assumption, this paper shows that <b>in</b> queue <b>waiting</b> differs <b>in</b> service <b>waiting.</b> Index Term [...] Strategic customer, M/M/ 1, <b>in</b> queue <b>waiting,</b> <b>in</b> service <b>waiting,</b> observable queues, unobservable queue...|$|R

5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker {{and walked up}} to the garden of the Chancellery, where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de gr√¢ce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant G√ºnther Schw√§germann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schw√§germann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schw√§germann had an SS soldier fire several shots into his body, which did not move.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 22 January, seven hundred RPF fighters moved down from the {{mountains}} and <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> hidden locations around the city; they were assisted by RPF sympathisers residing in the area. On {{the morning of the}} 23rd they attacked. The Rwandan forces in the area were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion, although the Rwandan police and army did succeed for a while in repelling the invasion in some areas, killing a number of rebel fighters in the process. It is likely the FAR forces were assisted by French troops, as the French government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard. By noon, however, the defending forces were defeated, and the RPF held the whole of the city.|$|E
5|$|Having {{defeated}} von Rosen at Miƒôdzyrzec on 29 August, Ramorino's {{forces were}} ordered to return to Siedlce, but Ramorino disregarded that order and followed von Rosen towards Brze≈õƒá. The order to return through ≈Åuk√≥w to Siedlce was repeated on 4 September. From there, a forced march could allow the II Corps to cross the Vistula {{to the south of}} Warsaw and attack Paskevich from the rear, or rejoin the bulk of the Polish Army defending Warsaw. The repeated order was also ignored. A large part of the Polish forces, composed mostly of seasoned soldiers, high in morale thanks to recent victories, was wandering aimlessly through Podlasie, only a couple of days' march from Warsaw. Instead of coming to the aid of Warsaw or following the fleeing forces of von Rosen, Ramorino <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> Podlasie for a week, and then headed south, away from the enemy.|$|E

5|$|On 22 December {{a public}} {{memorial}} service took place for Tucker, Bentley and Choate at St Paul's Cathedral. King George V {{was represented by}} Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading {{for half an hour}} to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13km) journey to the cemeteries, it was estimated that 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{employing}} {{a system that}} returned men by units, or by employment categories, {{it was decided to}} utilise an egalitarian system that saw men who had been away for the longest period of time being returned first. Due {{to the size of the}} forces deployed overseas‚Äîroughly 167, 000 personnel in France, Britain and Egypt‚Äîand the logistical requirements of bringing them home the process was nevertheless a lengthy one and as such it became important to occupy the troops while they <b>waited.</b> <b>In</b> order to achieve this and to prepare the men for a return to civilian employment, a vocational education scheme was set up by George Long and troops in Britain were offered educational courses and civilian work placement opportunities and although these programs were not as successful as hoped, several thousand soldiers took advantage of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{constant}} Dutch attacks led Sudirman, {{perhaps at}} the suggestion of one of his men, to change his clothes and give his old outfit to one of his soldiers, Second Lieutenant Heru Kesser‚Äì who bore a resemblance to Sudirman. Kesser was ordered to head south with a large company of soldiers, remove the clothes, and furtively return north, while Sudirman <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> Karangnongko. The diversion was successful, and on 27December Sudirman and his men made their way to Jambu Village. Arriving on 9January 1949, Sudirman met with several government ministers who had not been present during the Dutch attack on Yogyakarta: Supeno, Susanto Tirtoprojo, and Susilowati. With the politicians, Sudirman made his way to Banyutuwo, ordering some of his soldiers to linger back and hold off Dutch ground troops. In Banyutuwo, they held for over a week. However, on 21January, when Dutch forces approached the village, Sudirman and his entourage were forced to leave, fighting their way out in heavy rain.|$|E

5|$|The {{information}} Bukovsky {{had gathered}} {{and sent to}} the West galvanized human rights activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union. It also struck a chord among psychiatrists. In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times (London) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These responses were carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence. As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row, Bukovsky <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> almost total isolation, without access to a lawyer, to be tried {{and sent to the}} camps or a special psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|Throughout July 1944, Goebbels and Speer {{continued}} to press Hitler {{to bring the}} economy to a total war footing. The 20 July plot, where Hitler was almost killed by a bomb at his field headquarters in East Prussia, played {{into the hands of}} those who had been pushing for change: Bormann, Goebbels, Himmler, and Speer. Over the objections of G√∂ring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort. Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service. However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer. Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise the new Wehrmacht recruits <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> barracks for their turn to be trained.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013 Tuscaloosa Police arrested four {{football}} {{players from the}} 2012 season: Brent Calloway, Tyler Hayes, D. J. Pettway and Eddie Williams. Williams was involved in four separate incidents on February 10 and 11. On February 10 he had a dispute with a gas station clerk about paying for gas {{and said he had}} to get something in the trunk of his car. The clerk called the police, the police arrested Williams with carrying a pistol without a license, but Williams was released later that day on a $500 bond. Later that night around 12:30a.m., Williams attacked an Alabama student with Hayes and Pettway and they stole the student's backpack. In a separate incident almost an hour later, Williams attacked another student while Hayes and Pettway <b>waited</b> <b>in</b> a car. Later Williams used one of the students' credit cards. Calloway was also arrested after he used a victim's student debit card with knowledge it was stolen. Following the arrests, Alabama suspended all four from the football team. Alabama also prohibited Hayes, Pettway and Williams from entering campus. On February 27, Alabama dismissed all four players from the university after completing a judicial review.|$|E
