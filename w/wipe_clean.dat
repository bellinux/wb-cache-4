60|$|Wherefore {{it was in}} {{fear and}} trembling, and with great modesty of spirit, that I entered the Presence. To confess that I was shocked were to do my {{feelings}} an injustice. Perhaps the blame may be shouldered upon Shylock, Fagin, and their ilk; but I had conceived an entirely different type of individual. This man--why, he was clean to look at, his eyes were blue, with the tired look of scholarly lucubrations, and his skin had the normal pallor of sedentary existence. He was reading a book, sober and leather-bound, while on his finely moulded, intellectual head reposed a black skull-cap. For all the world his look and attitude were those of a college professor. My heart gave a great leap. Here was hope! But no; he fixed me with a cold and glittering eye, searching with the chill of space till my financial status stood before him shivering and ashamed. I communed with myself: By his brow he is a thinker, but his intellect has been prostituted to a mercenary exaction of toll from misery. His nerve centres of judgment and will have not been employed in solving the problems of life, but in maintaining his own solvency by the insolvency of others. He trades upon sorrow and draws a livelihood from misfortune. He transmutes tears into treasure, and from nakedness and hunger garbs himself in clean linen and develops the round of his belly. He is a bloodsucker and a vampire. He lays unholy hands on heaven and hell at cent. per cent., and his very existence is a sacrilege and a blasphemy. And yet here am I, wilting before him, an arrant coward, with no respect for him and less for myself. Why should this shame be? Let me rouse in my strength and smite him, and, by so doing, <b>wipe</b> <b>clean</b> one offensive page.|$|E

50|$|The lyrics, “set to a bouncy bossa nova groove”, {{tell the}} stories of three hardworking undocumented {{characters}} who fear separation from their families because, “ICE is loose out on the streets”, as the chorus clearly states.

In {{the first half of the}} first verse, La Marisoul sings, “Eva using a rag to <b>wipe</b> <b>clean</b> the table/Cautiously making everything shines like a pearl/When the boss gets home, she hopes there’ll be no complaints/Accusing her of being illegal.” The chorus then addresses {{the stories of}} families that have been separated by deportations of the Immigrant and Customs Enforcement (ICE). One of the most moving visuals of the lyrics is found in the line about children crying at school, when they realize that their mom is not coming to pick them up.

50|$|Asquith and Grey {{were also}} tied to Rosebery through the Liberal League, a group {{set up in}} 1902 by Rosebery, of which Asquith and Grey were vice-presidents. The {{membership}} of the Liberal League was eclectic however: according to H. C. G. Matthew it included “Liberal Imperialist MPs, a number of Fabians, Liberal landowners, imperialistically minded journalists and nonconformist ministers”. The Liberal League, which was a successor organisation to the Liberal Imperialist Council, had as its aim the promotion of Liberal Imperialism and {{the policy of the}} ‘clean slate’. In a speech at Chesterfield in 1901. Lord Rosebery had told the Liberal Party that, after successive general elections defeats, being out of office for six years and more to come, it had to <b>wipe</b> <b>clean</b> its slate and to write upon it something of relevance for the present and not hark back to old policies. He was of course referring mainly to Irish Home Rule but urged the adoption of the policy of ‘national efficiency’. The split between Rosebery and Campbell-Bannerman raised the possibility of the creation of a separate party of Liberal Imperialists led by Rosebery, based on the membership of the Liberal League but the ending of the Boer War in 1902 took a lot of the sting out of the opposition between the Liberal Imperialists and the mainstream of the party, although Rosebery himself never found it possible to reconcile himself to Campbell-Bannerman’s leadership. The Liberal League was eventually wound up in 1910.|$|E
