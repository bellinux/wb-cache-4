5|$|The {{right-hand}} {{side of the}} above equation is the sure information, i.e. information which can be certainly extracted from the database regardless of what values are used to replace Nulls in the database. In the example <b>we</b> <b>considered</b> above, it's {{easy to see that}} the intersection of all possible models (i.e. the sure information) of the query selecting WHERE Age = 22 is actually empty because, for instance, the (unlifted) query returns no rows for the relation EmpH37. More generally, it was shown by Imielinski and Lipski that Codd tables are a weak representation system if the query language is restricted to projections, selections (and renaming of columns). However, as soon as we add either joins or unions to the query language, even this weak property is lost, as evidenced in the next section.|$|E

Though he was against that war, he disagreed with the tactics of the student protest movement, thinking it silly and juvenile to take anger at the war out on a private university. He and his friends {{did not participate in}} Harvard demonstrations. John Tyson, a former roommate, recalled that [...] "We distrusted these movements a lot ... We were a pretty traditional bunch of guys, positive for civil rights and women's rights but formal, transformed by the social revolution to some extent but not buying into something <b>we</b> <b>considered</b> detrimental to our country." [...] Gore helped his father write an anti-war address to the Democratic National Convention of 1968 but stayed with his parents in their hotel room during the violent protests.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the strongest}} and toughest foes and allies of the game, Elites (who are from Sanghelios) are called Sangheili in the fictitious Covenant language. They stand around [...] and feature {{recharging}} personal shields. The Elites initially had simple mouths, which developed into pairs of split mandibles substituting for the lower jaws. Bungie concept artist Shi Kai Wang noted that project lead Jason Jones had, at one point, been insistent on giving the Elites a tail. While Wang thought it made the aliens look too animalistic, the idea was eventually dropped due to practical considerations, including where the tail would go when the Elites were driving vehicles. [...] "At one point, <b>we</b> <b>considered</b> just having the Elites tuck their tails forward, between their legs," [...] Wang noted, [...] "But [...] abandoned that... for obvious reasons." [...] According to Paul Russel, when Bungie was bought by Microsoft and Halo was turned into an Xbox launch title, Microsoft took issue with {{the design of the}} Elites, as they felt that the Elites had a resemblance to cats that might alienate Japanese consumers.|$|E

2500|$|The unfinalized {{status of}} East Jerusalem has caused issues when {{attempting}} to market Jerusalem to international tourists. In 2009, 2010, and again in 2015, the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled against a series of Israeli Ministry of Tourism advertising campaigns that displayed images and information about tourist sites located in East Jerusalem. The advertising authority wrote in its ruling that [...] "the status of the occupied territory of the West Bank {{was the subject of}} much international dispute, and because <b>we</b> <b>considered</b> that the ad implied that the part of East Jerusalem featured in the image was part of the state of Israel, we concluded that the ad was likely to mislead." [...] Israel rejected the ruling, with the Ministry of Tourism releasing a statement that said the ad provided [...] "basic, accurate information to a prospective UK visitor". The ruling from 2009 also included criticism about Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights being shown as part of Israel.|$|E

Following a two month break in early 2002, HIM regrouped and began rehearsing material for another album. Valo later credited the tour for Deep Shadow and Brilliant Highlights for bringing the band closer together, which culminated in their fourth album, entitled Love Metal. The album saw HIM once again working with producer Hiili Hiilesmaa, and was viewed by the band {{as a reaction to}} the difficulties they faced during Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights. According to Valo: [...] "After what <b>we</b> <b>considered</b> a disappointment with Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights, because there were so many chefs in the kitchen, we wanted to be a band [...] that we control what we do, and everybody else can fuck-off." [...] Love Metal was also the band's first album to make prominent use of the band's logo, the heartagram, on its cover, which Valo called [...] "a statement of intent [...] musically, visually and ideologically." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Tunnel Rats formed after rapper Dax Reynosa {{performed}} at a graffiti equipment store Hex's Hip Hop Shop. After the performance, he invited {{about two dozen}} rappers to his house for an open mic. The performers came from racially diverse backgrounds, a mix of Latinos, whites, and blacks, groups which Reynosa says did not always get along then. Among the standout performers that night were Reynosa's cousin Jurny Big, his sister Zane One, the four-member group Future Shock (consisting of Ahred a.k.a. Redbonz, Ajax Starglider, Sojourn, and DJ Trey-Qel), and Shames Worthy (a.k.a. Raphi), all of whom came together to form the Tunnel Rats. Reynosa was inspired to name the group [...] "Tunnel Rats" [...] after his father, {{who served in the}} Vietnam War as a tunnel rat. Ahred, a member of Future Shock, stated in an interview that [...] "We just put a name to it and called it Tunnel Rats. In Vietnam, the tunnel rats were the guys who went underground {{to make sure that the}} tunnels were clear so the soldiers could go through. <b>We</b> <b>considered</b> ourselves as those guys going first to make the way clear for people to go after us."
