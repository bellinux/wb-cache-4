5|$|A {{hospital}} {{had originally been}} installed at Alcatraz during its time as a military prison in the late 19th century. During its time as a federal penitentiary, it was located above the dining hall on the second floor. Hospital staff were U.S. Public Health Service employees assigned to the Federal Prison Service at Alcatraz. Doctors often lasted fewer than several days or months at Alcatraz, because few of them could tolerate the violent inmates who <b>would</b> <b>often</b> terrify them if they failed to be given certain drugs.

5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe <b>would</b> <b>often</b> stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
5|$|After scoring touchdowns, Payton {{declined}} to celebrate; instead, he <b>would</b> <b>often</b> hand {{the ball to}} his teammates or the official.

He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk <b>would</b> <b>often</b> pull people off the street to work his campaigns for himâ€”many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E
