After touching at San Diego on the 27th, she arrived on 28 October at San Pedro, where Rear Admiral H.O. Stickney designated her the flagship of Pacific Fleet Training.

5|$|In places closely {{associated}} with Titanic, the sense of grief was deep. The heaviest losses were in Southampton, home port to 699crew members and also home {{to many of the}} passengers. Crowds of weeping women– the wives, sisters and mothers of crew– gathered outside the White Star offices in Southampton for news of their loved ones. Most of them were among the 549Southampton residents who perished. In Belfast, churches were packed, and shipyard workers wept in the streets. The ship had been a symbol of Belfast's industrial achievements, and there was not only a sense of grief but also one of guilt, as those who had built Titanic came to feel they had been responsible in some <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> loss.|$|E

5|$|The royal {{couple had}} at least two {{children}} together. In 1449, the King notified Ragusa {{of the birth of}} a son: this is likely to have been Sigismund. A daughter named Catherine was born in 1453. Queen Catherine may have also been the mother of a third son of King Thomas, who was buried on Meleda. Mavro Orbini, a 16th-century Ragusan chronicler, believed that the boy was born to Vojača. If Catherine hoped that her stepson's marriage to Maria of Serbia and his subsequent accession to the Serbian throne in 1459 would pave <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> own son's accession in Bosnia, the hopes were dashed very quickly: within three months Stephen Tomašević lost the Despotate of Serbia to the Ottomans and returned to the Bosnian royal court with his wife.|$|E

25|$|The power {{position}} of queen Louisa Ulrika deteriorated with the declining health of her spouse, king Adolf Frederick, {{and the growing}} adulthood of her son, crown prince Gustav. She recognized this threat, and when her son was declared an adult in 1762, she unsuccessfully opposed him taking {{a seat in the}} royal council. The tense relationship between her and her son, whom she viewed as a political rival, grew when he opposed her will by insisting to honor the engagement to Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, whom he finally married in 1766, instead of marrying a Prussian bride selected by her, which he viewed as a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to keep her influence over him and the family. This was illustrated by the queens harassment of the crown princess when she arrived in Sweden. After the Riksdag of 1766, it was no longer her, but her son the crown prince, who became the leader of the followers of absolute monarchy. In 1767, when the French ambassador sketched a suggestion of a Swedish coup d'état, it was, for the first time, the crown prince rather than the queen who was regarded as the natural center figure of the coup.|$|E

500|$|Series co-creator and {{executive}} producer Weiss praised Clarke's portrayal in the scene saying [...] "Emilia absolutely crushed it.

[...] Sackheim, {{the director of the}} episode, noted in an interview, [...] "With the interior, there was only one <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to play it, which is, bemused. She's the keeper of the secret. She knows how to extricate herself from this. I thought the ease with which she delivered the lines was necessary for the audience to feel jeopardy for her and for them to think she was crazy. The sequence outside was all about claiming the throne — or reclaiming the throne." [...] Sackheim also stated, [...] "We wanted to clearly distinguish everything we've seen {{from the end of the}} last season and the beginning of this one." ...|$|E

If Louise Colet is little known today, she then enjoyed a certain reputation, which fascinated Flaubert until the roles changed and he became a severe censor and a corrector of her poems. Certainly Louise Colet has written too much in order to live by her pen, but this does not justify the oblivion into which she has fallen.

500|$|The episode {{features}} the recurring villain Ricardio, played by George Takei, a character that Tom Kenny later called [...] "the valentine from Hell".

Sugar reveled in the fact that she got to draw Bubblegum ripping off Ricardio's leg and beating him with; she noted that she had been wanting to featuring such a scene in her art since she was in high school. The climactic scene with Ricardio was also supposed to have featured more body imagery. Ricardio was originally slated to have been seated on a giant hand-throne, and the hole in the Ice King's chest was to have been more graphic.|$|E
