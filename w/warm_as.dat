As French was frequently spoken in high circles, Victoria never completely mastered the Russian language. Although she was a first cousin of both Nicholas II, on her mother's side, and to Empress Alexandra, on her father's side, the relationship with them was neither close nor <b>warm.</b> <b>As</b> Kirill became a keen auto racer, the couple often took trips by car: a favorite pastime was traveling through the Baltic provinces. Victoria dreaded the long Russian winter with its short days, and she traveled abroad frequently visiting her sister Marie in Romania and her mother {{in the south of}} France or in Coburg. Victoria and her husband had a close relationship with their daughters, Maria and Kira. The family was spending the summer of 1914 on their yacht in the Gulf of Finland and were in Riga when the war broke out.|$|E

25|$|The {{global climate}} of the Eocene was {{probably}} the most homogeneous of the Cenozoic; the temperature gradient from the equator to the poles was half that of today's, and the deep ocean currents were exceptionally warm. The polar regions were much warmer than today, possibly as <b>warm</b> <b>as</b> the present-day Pacific Northwest of North America. Temperate forests reached the poles themselves, while rainy tropical climates reached 45°N. The greatest difference was in temperate latitudes; nevertheless, the climate at the tropics was probably similar to today's.|$|E
25|$|Grizzly bears {{hibernate}} for 5–7 months {{each year}} except where {{the climate is}} <b>warm,</b> <b>as</b> the California grizzly did not hibernate. During this time, female grizzly bears give birth to their offspring, who then consume milk from their mother and gain strength {{for the remainder of}} the hibernation period. To prepare for hibernation, grizzlies must prepare a den, and consume an immense amount of food as they do not eat during hibernation. Grizzly bears do not defecate or urinate throughout the entire hibernation period. The male grizzly bear's hibernation ends in early to mid-March, while females emerge in April or early May.|$|E

25|$|Lake Ontario's water {{temperature}} varies due to upwelling of colder water or warmer pools of surface water creating very localized thermal contrast; the deeper {{waters of the}} lake, far from the shore, remain at a near constant {{water temperature}} of , the effect of which is either cooling or warming (in winter). This creates generally warmer nights through the colder season. When offshore winds occur in summer, they <b>warm</b> <b>as</b> they blow toward the lakeshore in the evening; conversely, the cooling effect by the lake is most pronounced on spring afternoons, which affects Toronto even more than other cities on the Great Lakes as during spring onshore east to southeast winds are predominant, on some days, the temperatures can {{be as much as}} 10°C (18°F) cooler than areas located far enough away from the Lake Ontario, an effect that wanes by summer when the dominant windflow becomes more southwesterly.|$|E
25|$|Oocytes can be {{collected}} from most mammalian species. Conventional oocyte collection is when ovaries {{are removed from}} a donor animal; this is done posthumously in slaughter facilities. The ovaries are kept <b>warm</b> <b>as</b> they are brought back to a laboratory for oocyte collection. Keeping the ovaries warm helps increase the success rate of fertilization. Once collected the oocytes are assessed and categorized into small, medium, and large, and then matured for 20–23 hours. This simple, inexpensive technique can lead to about 24 oocytes collected from a bovine. Conventional oocyte collection is especially useful for females who unexpectedly die or who are incapable of being bred due to injury. A second option for oocyte collection is to utilize the transvaginal ultrasound guided oocyte collection method otherwise known as TUGA. Collection technique varies slightly by species, but the general methods for collection are the same; a needle is inserted into each ovarian follicle and pulled out via vacuum. The major benefit of using this method {{is the ability to}} expand the lifetime reproductive productivity, or the number of productive days an animal is in her estrous cycle. Pregnant cows and mares continue to develop new follicles until the middle of pregnancy. Thus, TUGA can be used to substantially increase the fitness of an individual because the female then has the potential produce more than one offspring per gestation.|$|E

25|$|Continuing quickly westward, the {{diameter}} of the eye decreased to 12mi (19km), and the National Hurricane Center estimates the hurricane attained a minimum central pressure of 929mbar (hPa; 27.43inHg) about seven hours after it reached Category5 status. Initially, Felix was predicted to track west-northwestward, striking Belize before crossing the Yucatán Peninsula; however, its path remained nearly due westward. Subsequently, cloud tops near the center started to <b>warm</b> <b>as</b> the eye became less distinct, and by 1800UTC on September 3, Felix weakened to Category4 status with winds of 145mph (235km/h). On September 4, Felix had completed an eyewall replacement cycle and began strengthening again during the day. Felix was upgraded to a Category5 for the second time at 1040UTC, and made landfall in extreme north-eastern Nicaragua shortly thereafter with winds of 160mph (260km/h). By nine hours after moving ashore, the system maintained a well-organized cloud pattern and intense rainbands, although the winds rapidly decreased; early on September 5 Felix weakened to a tropical storm as its upper-level circulation became detached from the low-level portion. The system deteriorated to a tropical depression as it crossed into southern Honduras, and at 0900UTC the National Hurricane Center issued the last advisory on Felix as it began degenerating into a broad low pressure area. The remnants of Felix tracked west-northwestward over other portions of Latin America, and eventually dissipated over the Mexican state of Tabasco on September 7.|$|E

500|$|The Spanish soldier Alonso Vázquez {{labelled}} the Battle of Zutphen as [...] "one of {{the best}} factions that until that time was ever seen in Flanders". For many years it was common among Spaniards and Netherlanders to call a hard-fought action [...] "as <b>warm</b> <b>as</b> the fight of Zutphen". According to John Lothrop Motley, [...] "it is probable that the encounter would have been forgotten by posterity but by the melancholy close up upon that field to Sidney's bright career". Sidney allegedly had removed his cuisses {{when he saw that}} William Pelham was not wearing any. However, by the 1590s cavalry soldiers wore less armour than in the past, and this, instead of Sidney's solidarity toward his companion, cost his life. Sidney was carried to the town of Arnhem to recover, but he died three weeks later of gangrene, as surgeons were unable to extract the bullet. Historians are uncertain about the number of casualties both sides suffered during the battle. Motley claims 13 horse and 22 foot killed on the English side, against 'perhaps' 200 men on the Spanish side. On the other hand, Vázquez claimed that the Spanish [...] "were winners with very little loss, having wounded and slaughtered many people to the rebels".|$|E
