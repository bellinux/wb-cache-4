40|$|Calendula maritima Gussone (1825 : 3) is {{endemic to}} a few coastal areas near Trapani, western Sicily, Italy. Its taxonomic {{distinctness}} is generally recognised, even though some authors have treated it as a subspecies rather than species, either as C. incana subsp. maritima (Guss.) Ohle (1974 : 279) or as C. suffruticosa subsp. maritima (Guss.) Meikle (1976 : 274), its uncertain position reflecting the difficulty in establishing a satisfactory taxonomic classification <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> genus Calendula Linnaeus (1753 : 921). Calendula maritima has recently been included in an IUCN pilot project devoted {{to the study of}} the fifty most threatened Mediterranean island plants (Montmollin & Strahm 2005) and, in that context, it has been made the central subject of a special international meeting (Troia & Raimondo 2011). Calendula maritima was one of the early species described by Giovanni Gussone (1787 – 1866), whose main works regarding Sicily and its surrounding islets were ‘Florae Siculae Prodromus ’ (1827 – 28) and ‘Florae Siculae Synopsis ’ (1842 – 44) (Stafleu & Cowan 1976). The protologue of C. maritima (Gussone 1825) consists of a brief diagnostic description but lacks any indication of the type locality: ‘C. incanae, pro qua habui, et C. marginatae Willd. en. proxima; sed foliis integerrimis et viscositate omnium partium, quae cultura perstat, ab utraque distincta’. In the following years, Gussone sent specimens of the new species to several colleagues and friends all over Europe. Candolle (1838) accepted C. maritima Guss. and mentione...|$|E
40|$|Broad-scale {{patterns}} of subterranean diversity are a fascinating but neglected part of biodiversity research. Carabid beetles adapted to belowground habitats form a particularly species-rich {{part of the}} subterranean fauna. We studied large-scale diversity {{patterns of}} these belowground carabids across the western Palaearctic and evaluated potential impacts of historical and contemporary environmental conditions {{on the distribution of}} these taxa, using available species richness and environmental data at country level. Regression modelling and variation partitioning showed a strong relationship between species richness and range in elevation. Potential effects of climatic variables, mainly those related to ambient energy input, were much weaker. We discuss the implications of this combination of effects, which suggests, concordant with the absence of subterranean carabids in northern and highest richness in southern Europe, a strong prevailing influence of historical processes on current richness distributions of these taxa. Previous studies did not provide clear indications for such an influence. In contrast to more mobile and widespread carabid beetles, dispersal limitation due to high adaptation of belowground carabids to subterranean habitats has probably hindered their re-colonization of former permafrost and glaciated regions. Hotspots of highest belowground diversity are located in regions with an assumed long-term stability of environmental conditions, correlating with patterns of other dispersal-limited taxa such as many endemic plants. Our study provides important new information in the discussion of potential determinants of the distinct geographic patterns of belowground diversity. Moreover, it contributes {{to a better understanding of}} range size related differences previously found in the distribution of diversity and environmental dependencies of widespread and range-restricted species <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> carabid beetles...|$|E

The field of timing and time perception has witnessed tremendous growth and multidisciplinary interest {{in the recent years}} with the advent of modern neuroimaging and neurophysiological approaches. In this article, I used a data mining approach to analyze the timing literature published by a select group of researchers (n = 202) during the period 2000 - 2015 and highlight important reviews as well as empirical articles that meet the criterion of a minimum of 100 citations. The qualifying articles (n = 150) are listed in a table along with key details such as number of citations, names of authors, year and journal of publication as well as a short summary of the findings of each study. The results of such a data-driven approach to literature review not only serve as a useful resource to any researcher interested in timing, but also provides a means to evaluate key papers that have significantly influenced the field and summarize recent progress and popular research trends in the field. Additionally, such analyses provides food for thought about future scientific directions and raises important questions about improving organizational structures to boost open science and progress in the field. I discuss exciting avenues for future research that have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the neurobiology of timing, and propose the establishment of a new society to promote open science and collaborative work <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> and multidisciplinary community of researchers in the field of timing and time perception...|$|E

40|$|The central aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the musical lives of three distinct ethnocultural community groups. Using ethnographic and grounded theory methods, this study explores the musical practices of South Sudanese Australians, Filipino Australians and White Australians in Blacktown, New South Wales. By researching musical participation in these three case study groups, this study aims to elucidate the relationship between various factors underlying individual and collective musical acculturation processes. Significant factors include the reasons for and attitudes towards cross-cultural contact, the sociohistorical and situational factors determining {{the context in which}} cross-cultural contact takes place, and the role of power and dominance in shaping cross-cultural interactions. Other determinants include the various ways ‘community’ is experienced, the maintenance and loss of heritage and homeland cultures, and the musical activities that generate and reflect participants’ understandings and experiences of the preceding. The interplay between these areas of inquiry positions this study at the nexus of music education, sociomusicology, ethnomusicology, acculturation psychology, intercultural relations and urban sociology. It was found that the types of musical activities with which participants engaged illustrated the importance they placed upon maintaining heritage traditions. This was often related to their attitudes towards multiculturalism and integration into mainstream Australian society. For all of the ethnocultural communities studied, nationalism and transnationalism {{played a major role in}} acculturation processes. The music with which South Sudanese Australian participants were occupied was significantly influenced by South Sudan gaining sovereignty during the project’s data collection phase. Many of the participants had migrated to Australia long before their new homeland country was declared an independent nation-state, and music was used to represent and facilitate debates surrounding South Sudanese nationalist discourse. In the Filipino Australian case study, it was found that the collective self-consciousness with which the participants assimilated into colonial cultural forms had a marked effect on the music with which they engaged. The contradictions in their music consumption patterns resonated with the ironies underlying Filipino nationalism generally. Finally, music was similarly significant in the renegotiation of cultural boundaries and identity reconstruction for participants in the White Australian case study. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> Blacktown region, interpretations of ‘Australian’ and mainstream music were seen to contribute to the notion of White Australia as the dominant community of the receiving society...|$|E
40|$|Sixty surface {{sediment}} {{samples from}} the eastern South Atlantic Ocean including the Walvis Ridge, the Angola and Cape basins, and the Southwest African continental margin were analysed for their benthic foraminiferal content to unravel faunal distribution patterns and ecological preferences. Live (stained with Rose Bengal) and dead faunas were counted separately and then each grouped by Q-mode principal component analysis into seven principal faunal end-members. Then, multiple regression technique was used to correlate Recent assemblages with available environmental variables and to finally differentiate between four principal groups of environmental agents acting upon the generation of benthic foraminiferal assemblages: (1) seasonality of food supply and organic carbon flux rates, together with oxygen content in the pore and bottom waters; (2) lateral advection of deep-water masses; (3) bottom water carbonate corrosiveness; and (4) energetic state at the benthic boundary layer and grain size composition of the substrate. Food supply and corresponding dissolved oxygen contents in the pore and bottom waters {{turned out to be}} the most important factors which control the distribution pattern of the Recent benthic foraminifera. At the continental margin, in the zone of coastal upwelling and its mixing area, benthic foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by stenobathic high-productivity faunas, characterized by elevated standing stocks, low diversities and a large number of endobenthic living species. At the continental shelf and upper continental slope the live assemblages are characterized by Rectuvigerina cylindrica, Uvigerina peregrina s. 1., Uvigerina auberiana and Rhizammina spp. while the dead assemblages are characterized by Cassidulina laevigata, Bolivina dilatata, Bulimina costata and B. mexicana. At the lower continental slope strong influence of high organic matter fluxes on the species composition is restricted to the area off the Cunene river mouth, where the live assemblage is dominated by Uvigerina peregrina s. 1., the corresponding dead assemblage by Melonis barleeanum and M. zaandamae. In the adjacent areas of the lower continental slope the biocoenosis is characterized by Reophax bilocularis, and Epistominella exigua which becomes dominant in the corresponding dead assemblage. At the Walvis Ridge and in the abyssal Angola and Cape basins, where organic matter fluxes are low and highly seasonal, benthic foraminiferal assemblages reflect both the oligotrophic situation and the deep and bottom water mass configuration. The top and flanks of the Walvis Ridge are inhabited by the Rhizammina, Psammosphaera and R. bilocularis live assemblages, the corresponding dead assemblages are dominated by G. subglobosa on the ridge top and E. exigua on the flanks. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> E. exigua dead assemblage several associated epibenthic species coincide with the core of NADW between about 1600 and 3700 m water depth. These species include Osangularia culter, Cibicidoides kullenbergi, Melonis pompilioides, Bolivinita pseudothalmanni and Bulimina alazanensis. The assemblages of the abyssal Cape and Angola basins are characterized by Nuttallides umbonifer and a high proportion of agglutinated species. These species are adapted to very low organic matter fluxes and a carbonate corrosive environment...|$|E
40|$|The Hymenoptera, {{comprising}} of sawflies, wasps, {{bees and}} ants, {{is the third}} largest order of insects. It contains more than 155, 000 described species, placed into two traditional suborders (Symphyta and Apocrita). Many hymenopteran species play important roles in biological control, ecosystems and production of commercial products. Unfortunately, higher-level relationships of the Hymenoptera, particularly <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> parasitic lineages, remain unresolved in both morphological and molecular studies. The mitochondrial (mt) genome sequence is becoming {{a powerful tool for}} reconstructing phylogenetic relationships. In addition, mt gene rearrangements also provide useful phylogenetic information. However, deficient representation of a broad range of lineages restricts the evolutionary utility of the mt genome in the Hymenoptera. For the four infraorders of the Apocrita, the Aculeata and Ichneumonomorpha are reasonably sampled. By contrast, the Evaniomorpha and Proctotrupomorpha are poorly represented. Therefore, this PhD research was focussed on increasing our understanding of mt genomes of the Hymenoptera and their utility for the recovery of the higher-level phylogeny by extending the taxonomic range of available mt genome sequences. Eleven new mt genomes for representatives of four evaniomorph and four proctotrupomorph superfamilies were determined. Several gene rearrangements were detected in each of the eleven mt genomes when compared with the ancestral positions. In particular, protein-coding or rRNA gene rearrangements were identified in six mt genomes. Mt genome organizations were also compared within the Evaniomorpha and Proctotrupomorpha. The results showed that there were no shared, derived gene rearrangements at the family level, indicating that the frequency of gene rearrangements of these groups is too high to be useful for assessing relationships between families. By contrast, comparison of mt genome organizations within the subfamily Scelioninae suggested that gene rearrangements have much potential as phylogenetic markers at the subfamily level. The large number of gene rearrangements identified in this study also facilitated the investigation of gene rearrangement mechanisms. Direct and indirect evidence that supports the notion that recombination is an important aspect of the gene rearrangement mechanism was identified. Most importantly, the end products of recombination were detected (minicircles), in a megaspilid wasp Conostigmus sp., which provided support for the link between recombination and mt gene rearrangement. Furthermore, a model of recombination which is important for our understanding of mtDNA evolution was developed. The first mt genome phylogeny of the Apocrita with a complete representation of superfamilies (excluding Mymmaromatoidea) was reconstructed. The influence of inclusion/exclusion of 3 rd codon positions, alignment approaches, partition schemes and phylogenetic approaches on topology and nodal support within the Hymenoptera was assessed. The results showed that the topologies were sensitive to the variation of dataset and analytical approach. However, some robust and highly supported relationships were recovered: the Ichneumonomorpha was monophyletic; the Trigonalyoidea + Megalyroidea and the Diaprioidea + Chalcidoidea were consistently recovered; the Cynipoidea was generally recovered as the sister group to the Diaprioidea + Chalcidoidea. In addition, the monophyletic Aculeata and Proctotrupomorpha were recovered in some analyses. Further phylogenetic analysis of the Hymenoptera will rely on increased sampling of both taxa and sequence data...|$|E

PhD thesis, Wageningen University, the Netherlands The objective {{of this research was}} to generate knowledge required for the development of an indigenous chicken (IC) breeding program for enhanced productivity and improved human livelihood in Kenya. The initial step was to review five questions; what, why and how should we conserve IC in an effective and sustainable way, who are the stakeholders and what are their roles in the IC breeding program. The next step of the research focused on detecting distinctive IC ecotypes through morphological and genomic characterization. Indigenous chicken ecotypes were found to be populations with huge variability in the morphological features. Molecular characterization was carried out using microsatellite markers and whole genome re-sequenced data. The studied IC ecotypes are genetically distinct groups. The MHC-linked microsatellite markers divided the eight IC ecotypes studied into three mixed clusters, composing of individuals from the different ecotypes whereas non-MHC markers grouped ICs into two groups. Analysis revealed high genetic variation <b>within</b> <b>the</b> ecotype with <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> MHC-linked alleles which are known to be involved in disease resistance. Whole genome re-sequencing revealed genomic variability, regions affected by selection, candidate genes and mutations that can explain partially the phenotypic divergence between IC and commercial layers. Unlike commercial chickens, IC preserved a high genomic variability that may be important in addressing present and future challenges associated with environmental adaptation and farmers’ breeding goals. Lastly, this study showed that there is an opportunity to improve IC through selection <b>within</b> <b>the</b> population. Genetic improvement utilizing within IC selection requires setting up a breeding program. The study described the systematic and logical steps in designing a breeding program by focusing on farmers’ need, how to improve IC to fit the farming conditions, and management regimes...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Gout is {{a painful}} form of acute {{inflammatory}} arthritis associated with elevated uric acid crystal deposition {{especially in the}} joints, but also in tendons and the kidney. Between 1 and 2 % of Western populations are affected and in severe cases, gout sufferers can be completely incapacitated. Despite the number of gout sufferers, {{the high number of}} risk factors and high incidence of adverse drug reactions using the standard treatment regimens, little research involving gout has been done <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> multiracial and multicultural population of South Africa. Hypothesis: This study was a hypothesis generating observational study to assess whether serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase protein levels could be used as markers of the gout status of a patient. Method: Thirty gout patients were enrolled onto the study and attended two visits. At the screening visit; medical history, vital signs and demographic details were collected from intercritical gout patients. At both visits, patients completed visual analogue scales; namely: subject’s assessment of pain and subject’s assessment of disease activity. A doctor completed the physician’s assessment of disease activity at both of the visits. At the end visit, patients experiencing an acute gout attack were asked to list various foods and beverages that triggered said attacks. Patients were requested to return for their second visit as soon as they experienced a gout attack, however, those patients that did not experience a gout attack were asked to return to the clinic to complete the follow up visit four months after their baseline visit. Uric acid, IL- 1 β, TNF-α and CRP were measured for each patient at both visits. Results: Many of the patients displayed risk factors for metabolic syndrome. The mean subject’s assessment of pain score increased from 31 mm at the screening visit to 40 mm at the end visit (p= 0. 1947; n= 26), while the mean subject’s assessment of disease activity score and the mean physician’s assessment of disease activity increased from 30 mm to 37 mm (p= 0. 3196; n= 26) and 23 mm to 35 mm (p= 0. 0937; n= 26) respectively. Uric acid levels decreased from 1. 053 mmol/L to 0. 871 mmol/L between visits (p= 0. 0926; n= 25) while CRP concentrations increased significantly from 10. 2 mg/L to 26. 6 mg/L (p= 0. 0278, n= 24). IL- 1 β concentrations remained similar (12. 17 pg/ml to 12. 54 pg/ml) while TNF-α concentrations decreased from 12. 63 pg/ml to 3. 54 pg/ml, however neither of these were statistically significant differences. Upon stratifying results into active and non-active patients, both IL- 1 β and TNF-α concentrations decreased between non-active and active patients, while CRP and urate concentrations increased. However, none of these differences were statistically significant. Conclusion: The visual analogue scales all showed an increase between the screening and final visits, although this was not statistically significant. Uric acid concentrations decreased between visits, however this increase was once again not statistically significant. There appears to be no association between inflammatory markers and the level of gout activity, although this needs to be tested in a larger sample population. Results in South African patients have confirmed results from previous studies where gout patients are at a higher risk of metabolic syndrome than the normal population.
