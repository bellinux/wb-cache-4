40|$|The {{results of}} a cyclic test on a precast RC column {{connected}} to the foundation through a grouted sleeve joint are presented. The column, having square cross-section with side length 0. 5 m, was 3. 7 m heigh. It was subjected to an axial compression of 1700 kN using two externally post-tensioned 47 mm-diameter Dywidag bars. A transverse displacement time-history {{was applied to the}} column cross-section 2. 8 m far from the column-foundation joint using a <b>worm</b> <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> with nominal loading capacity of 500 kN. The test was stopped after 19 displacement cycles, when the complete spalling of the concrete cover took place at the base-joint. Correspondingly, a 15 % degradation of the base-joint resistance was attained and the drift reached 5. 25 %. At this deformation level, the dowel action involving the connection rebars was significant, leading to a maximum slip within the joint of about 7 mm. The ultimate curvature was about 10 times the yielding curvature. Then, a behaviour factor of about 3. 7 was estimated for use in spectral response analyses based on the Italian Standard...|$|E

40|$|For {{research}} and development work and {{for the production of}} small quantities of pellets for specific applications, {{it is important to have}} a low-cost apparatus or machine for making pellets. This project work discusses the local design and manufacture of a dual-mode pelleting machine. It can be powered either electrically or manually. It takes care of power failure problems, and can be used in rural settlements where electricity supply is not in existence. The laboratory-sized pelleting machine uses a <b>worm</b> <b>screw</b> for propelling the grains/mash/mineral ore through the die. The <b>worm</b> <b>screw</b> encased in the pelleting chamber is propelled by a dual mode mechanism i. e. motorized and manual. This <b>worm</b> <b>screw</b> is fed by a hopper, which is able to hold a large quantity of mash/mineral ore at a time.

50|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>jacks</b> {{have now}} largely been {{replaced}} by hydraulic jacks. This was encouraged in 1858 when jacks by the Tangye company to Bramah's hydraulic press concept were applied to the successful launching of Brunel's , after two failed attempts by other means. The maximum mechanical advantage possible for a hydraulic jack is not limited by the limitations on <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> and can be far greater. After World War II, improvements to the grinding of hydraulic rams {{and the use of}} O ring seals reduced the price of low-cost hydraulic jacks and they became widespread for use with domestic cars. <b>Screw</b> <b>jacks</b> still remain for minimal cost applications, such as the little-used tyre-changing jacks supplied with cars.|$|R
50|$|The <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> {{consists}} of two simple machines in series; the long operating handle serves as a lever whose output force turns the screw. So the mechanical advantage is increased by a longer handle {{as well as a}} finer screw thread. However, most <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> have large amounts of friction which increase the input force necessary, so the actual mechanical advantage is often only 30% to 50% of this figure.|$|R

50|$|A {{jockey wheel}} is a {{retractable}} adjustable-height wheel {{used on the}} front of trailers with either a single axle (two running wheels) or more close-coupled axles at or near the centre of gravity whereby without additional support, the trailer would not remain 'level'. The jockey wheel is situated close to the towing hitch and has a built-in <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> to enable the trailer nose to be lifted over the tow ball of a car or other powered vehicle. The <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> can then be used to gently lower the trailer nose onto the tow ball. Once securely attached to the towing vehicle, the jockey wheel's jacking action is fully retracted for stowage. The jockey wheel is also unclamped and lifted as far as possible to give the greatest ground clearance before reclamping prior to a journey being made.|$|R
