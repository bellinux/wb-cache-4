40|$|Investigations {{were done}} at round gold wires of 0, 9 mm in diameter, used in jewelry making, from Au 585 alloy (58, 5 %Au, Ag, Cu and Zn). These cold drawn <b>wires</b> was cold <b>rolled</b> in two rolling {{programmes}} to various heights without any intermediate annealing on a two-high rolling stand with plain rolls of 180 mm in diameter. In first programme, the <b>wires</b> were <b>rolled</b> in several passes, with single height reductions of about 30 %, while in second one the rolling {{was carried out}} with maximal reduction only. Rolling speed was constant at all passes. It vas noted that more significant increase in widening, at samples rolled in a single pass, was at height reductions over 70 %, while at samples rolled in several passes significant increase in widening took place at high reductions of 80 % and over. Greater widening was obtained at rolling wires with maximal reduction only in comparison to <b>wires</b> <b>rolled</b> in several passes with small single reductions...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Rolled</b> <b>glass</b> (sometimes called [...] "table glass") is {{produced}} by pouring molten glass onto a metal or graphite table and immediately rolling it into a sheet using a large metal cylinder, similar to rolling out a pie crust. The rolling {{can be done by}} hand or by machine. Glass can be [...] "double rolled", which means it is passed through two cylinders at once (similar to the clothes wringers on older washing machines) to yield glass of a specified thickness (typically about 1/8" [...] or 3 mm). Glass made this way is never fully transparent, but does not necessarily have much texture. It can be pushed and tugged while molten to create certain effects. For distinct textures the metal cylinder can be imprinted with a pattern that is pressed into the molten glass as it passes through the rollers. The glass is then annealed. <b>Rolled</b> <b>glass</b> was first commercially produced around the mid-1830s and is widely used today. It is often called cathedral glass, but {{this has nothing to do}} with medieval cathedrals, where the glass used was hand-blown.|$|R
