5|$|In September 2015, David informs Amy of Val's {{death and}} the funeral date, but Amy {{believes}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> big a risk {{to return to the}} village. She passes her regards to Eric and the family.|$|E
5|$|According {{to transit}} {{advocate}} Steve Munro, the SSE {{will be built}} to use only automatic train control. This would preclude the operation of T1 subway cars on the extension as it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> expensive to convert T1 cars to ATC.|$|E
5|$|All GameCube {{systems support}} {{the display of}} {{stereoscopic}} 3D, and Luigi's Mansion was developed to utilize this feature. However, 3D televisions were not widespread at the time, and it was deemed that compatible displays <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> cost-prohibitive for the consumer. As a result, the feature was never enabled outside of development.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{not winning}} a {{medal at the}} Dutch time trial championships she won the time trial at the European Championships (under-23). She was not {{selected}} to ride the time trial at the Summer Olympics, because the course <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> heavy for her.|$|E
5|$|Its Linpack {{performance}} {{stands at}} 80 TeraFLOPs, {{which is about}} half {{as fast as the}} cut-off line for the Top 500 Supercomputers list. According to Rennie, all content was stored in Watson's RAM for the Jeopardy game because data stored on hard drives <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> slow to be competitive with human Jeopardy champions.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski's plan {{met with}} {{opposition}} {{from most of}} the prospective member states—who refused to relinquish any of their hard-won independence—as well as from the Allied powers, for whom it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> bold a change to the existing balance-of-power structure. According to historian George Sanford, around 1920 Piłsudski came to realize the infeasibility of this version of his Intermarium project.|$|E

5|$|Since Close Encounters {{was filmed}} anamorphically, the visual effects {{sequences}} were shot on 70 mm film to better conform with the 35 mm film {{used for the}} rest of the movie. A test reel using computer-generated imagery was used for the UFOs, but Spielberg found it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> expensive and ineffective since CGI was in its infancy in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} in North America on February 8, 2011. Jellyvision Games has stated they considered further international releases, but these <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> expensive at the present time. The company does not rule out future iterations of the game being released to a wider market based {{on the success of}} this title.|$|E
5|$|The use of helium {{reduces the}} {{distorting}} effects of temperature {{variations in the}} space between lenses in some telescopes, due to its extremely low index of refraction. This method is especially used in solar telescopes where a vacuum tight telescope tube <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> heavy.|$|E

5|$|By 1980, the USACE {{was working}} to obtain funding, {{which was the}} major {{obstacle}} for completion; public concerns about the project were {{that it was not}} needed and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> costly. The USACE announced in 1981 that an environmental impact report was necessary before the project could begin, following the Endangered Species Act of 1973; the least tern and light-footed clapper rail were considered endangered, and construction would have affected their habitat. The next year, the environmental impact report process began, funded by the USACE.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlin jealously guarded his position. In late 1943, Chamberlin {{differed}} {{with one}} of his planners, Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, over a proposed landing at Hansa Bay. Fellers thought that Hansa Bay could be bypassed, but Chamberlin felt that this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> risky. While Fellers was a newcomer to GHQ, he had known MacArthur for many years, and Fellers took his proposal directly to MacArthur, who approved it. A furious Chamberlin had Fellers fired from G-3. MacArthur made him his military secretary.|$|E
5|$|Google has {{questioned}} the proposal, saying the prohibitions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> broad. It is strongly opposed by free speech groups. A poll conducted by McNair Ingenuity Research for the Hungry Beast television program found that 80% of their 1,000 respondents were {{in favour of}} the concept of the plan. The survey also found that 91% were concerned about the government's intent to keep the list of filtered websites a secret.|$|E

5|$|His job was {{to prepare}} staff studies on {{upcoming}} potential operations. While he did do naval planning, his team prepared plans that coordinated land, air and sea operations. A staff study might be put into effect and become an operation, or MacArthur might shelve it {{in favor of an}} alternative operation, especially if the staff study revealed that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> time-consuming, difficult or costly. The three teams would work simultaneously on three different objectives in leapfrog fashion. Tarbuck routinely attended staff conferences that involved naval matters.|$|E
5|$|In April 1885, the Cosmos Club {{considered}} {{purchasing the}} house from the Tayloe family. The influential club already owned most of the block north of the Tayloe House, and was expanding rapidly. It valued the home at $60,000 and the furnishings at an additional $5,000. The Cosmos Club declined to buy the home after an investigation found {{that the cost of}} upgrading the Tayloe property for its use <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> costly.|$|E
5|$|In November 1979, Brock met Aaron Fechter of Creative Engineering, Inc. Concerned that Fechter's {{animatronics}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> {{strong a}} competition for Bushnell’s work, Brock requested that Bushnell release {{him from the}} co-development agreement, citing misrepresentation. In December 1979, Brock and Fechter formed “Showbiz Pizza Place Inc”, severing Brock's business relationship with Bushnell. ShowBiz Pizza Place was conceptually identical to Pizza Time Theatre in all aspects except for animation, which would be provided by Creative Engineering. Showbiz Pizza Place opened its first location on March 3, 1980, in Kansas City, Missouri.|$|E

He {{was a first}} Team All-Star, a starter in the NHL All-Star Game, and {{a finalist for the}} Hart Trophy again. The Devils lost the Atlantic Division title by 1 point to the Philadelphia Flyers, who thus obtained the third seed and home ice advantage against the sixth-seeded Devils {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> much for Brodeur and the Devils to overcome, as the Flyers went on to defeat them in five games.|$|E
5|$|Inside Out {{was first}} {{announced}} in August 2011 at the D23 Expo. In December 2012, Bleeding Cool reported {{the title of}} the film would be The Inside Out, while ComingSoon.net reported it would be Inside Out the following February. In April 2013, Disney officially announced the title on Twitter as Inside Out, during CinemaCon. Prior to its release, the film underwent a test screening for children, due to concerns from executives that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> complex for younger audiences—a fear quelled when the audience reacted positively to the picture.|$|E
5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E
