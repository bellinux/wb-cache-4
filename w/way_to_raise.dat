25|$|Ladies Night is a New Zealand stage {{comedy about}} {{unemployed}} male workers who {{put on a}} strip show at a club as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> some money. A version was also written for the United Kingdom. There are many parallels with The Full Monty, although Ladies Night predates that film.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> cash, Nilsson {{cared for}} infants {{in return for}} money from mothers who were not married and needed help. At that time, having a child outside of {{marriage}} was a shameful moral crime, and caring for these children for a fee (known as baby farming) was a common practice.|$|E
25|$|Local population: The militias, and the {{political}} parties they served, believed they had legitimate moral authority to raise taxes to defend their communities. Road checkpoints were a particularly common <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> these (claimed) taxes. Such taxes were in principle viewed as legitimate by much of the population who identified with their community's militia. However, many militia fighters would use taxes/customs as a pretext to extort money. Furthermore, many people did not recognize militia's tax-raising authority, and viewed all militia money-raising activities as mafia-style extortion and theft.|$|E

25|$|The Owensboro PumpkinFest is {{held each}} September at the Sportscenter/Moreland Park complex. The festival {{includes}} food vendors, crafts people, carnival rides, children and adult activities and games, and contests using pumpkins. Each year, the festival hosts a weekend-long concert series featuring {{some of the}} area's top bands, such as the Velvet Bombers, Sundown, Bad Kitty, and Mr. Nice Guy, to name a few. The event was started by the Glenmary Sisters as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> awareness and funds for their mission work in the southeastern United States. The festival was handed over to New Beginnings Rape Crisis Center in October 2009.|$|E
25|$|In 1764, Parliament {{passed the}} Currency Act to {{restrain}} the use of paper money, fearing that otherwise the colonists might evade debt payments. Parliament also passed the Sugar Act, imposing customs duties {{on a number of}} articles. That same year, Prime Minister George Grenville proposed direct taxes on the colonies to raise revenue, but he delayed action to see whether the colonies would propose some <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the revenue themselves. Parliament finally passed the Stamp Act in March 1765 which imposed direct taxes on the colonies for the first time. All official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and pamphlets were required to have the stamps—even decks of playing cards.|$|E
25|$|The {{garden tiger}} moth {{population}} decline is of concern for both laboratory research and in nature. A possible way to combat this in a laboratory setting is to use synthetic food. While not ideal, it resolves many issues that arise when trying to raise captive Lepidoptera. Concerns such as food sterility are quickly resolved, along with issues of gathering hard to find or cultivate host plant material. Many larvae, including those of A. caja, can consume synthetic food, which is based primarily on agar, powdered cellulose, cabbage, sucrose, salts, and wheat germ. Synthetic options {{appear to be a}} promising <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> lab populations of this species, for conservation or for study.|$|E
5000|$|The least {{expensive}} <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> capital are <b>to</b> finance from cash flow, {{and to improve}} cash flow through regular invoicing, collecting overdue receivables, stretching payables without incurring interest or penalties, renegotiating loans for lower interest rates and exploiting trade discounts.|$|R
50|$|Long-term debt {{arrangements}} and reverse repurchase agreements are two additional <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> additional capital for the fund.

25|$|The Syrian Cultural Caravan has the {{political}} aim to re-establish {{the complexity of}} the Syrian conflict. It provides the public with another narrative, counterweighting the simplified stories of bombings, attacks and terrorism found in the media. The work of artists is, according to Leila Shahid in La Marseilleise, a universal language to express the Syrian people’s suffering. It gives the opportunity for artists of the caravan to contribute in their own <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> awareness and engage the public, {{while at the same time}} reflecting on what kind of change art can bring. They do not wish to offer a blueprint, unidimensional solution to the conflict but rather they open up the space for dialogue by creating a platform of exchange.|$|E
25|$|Wooden {{carriages}} {{were originally}} hauled by steam locomotives leading to smoke-filled stations and carriages, unpopular with passengers. At {{the start of}} the 20th century the District and Metropolitan were seeing increased competition in central London from the new electric underground tube lines and trams, and conversion to electric traction was seen as the way forward. Experiments were carried out on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section, and a jointly-owned six-carriage train began passenger service in 1900. Following this an AC system was suggested, and this was accepted by both parties. However, the District was looking for a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the finance needed and in 1901 found an investor, the American Charles Yerkes. He formed the Underground Electric Railways of London (UERL), and his experience in the United States led him to favour DC, with third-rail pick-up similar to that in use on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade the DC system was taken up, and the railways began electrifying the routes, using multiple-unit stock.|$|E
25|$|Broad {{protection}} {{actions are}} geared towards children who {{could potentially be}} trafficked, and include raising awareness about child trafficking, particularly in vulnerable communities. This type of outreach also includes policies geared towards improving the economic statuses of vulnerable families, so that reasonable alternatives are available to them, other than sending their children to work. Examples of this include increasing employment opportunities for adults and conditional cash transfer programs. Another major broad protection program that has been readily endorsed by UN.GIFT, the I.L.O, and UNICEF involves facilitating gender equality, specifically by enhancing both boys' and girls' access to affordable, quality education. Another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> awareness for child trafficking is by communities {{from all over the}} world dedicating a week to this situation. Observing the 2012 Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the US, and wider world. Community groups along with police enforcements are collaborating to organize events as well as in depth information sessions and support groups for the victims. The events held by communities could include films, guest speakers, booths, and many more things that can help people understand the seriousness of this issue. The ICE (Human Trafficking) has a help line for victims as well as conducts awareness in the U.S.A communities through the ICE In Plain Sight Campaign.|$|E
50|$|According to Adam Smith, {{people of}} the same trade seldom meet without the {{conversation}} turning <b>to</b> conspiring <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> prices and defraud the public.

50|$|Reports were {{published}} in November 2006 to suggest that England's Education Secretary Alan Johnson was exploring <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the school leaving age in England and Wales to 18, pointing to the decline in unskilled jobs {{and the need for}} young people to be equipped for modern day employment.|$|R
50|$|All these {{changed when}} the Americans came in 1904. The {{tribunal}} in Isio was shifted to Cauayan and this fostered development. The natives were taught modern <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> crops, and schoolhouses, {{roads and bridges}} were constructed. Not even the Japanese occupation could disrupt {{the development of the}} town since then.|$|R
500|$|Sarah Welsh of the South Wales Echo {{gave the}} {{stalking}} storyline a negative review. She called both plot and acting [...] "ridiculous" [...] and commented {{that while she}} often felt sorry for the serial being snubbed at the National Soap Awards, [...] "This is not the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Sue {{informs the}} staff {{that the school}} is in {{financial}} trouble, and the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> money is to gain alumni donations from the upcoming football game or face firing a teacher. German teacher Willard Deutschebog informs English teacher Ennis Hofftard that a student may have caught him buying [...] "filthies" [...] (porn) at a newsstand that morning; because of this, Willard fears that if Sue hears, {{he may be the}} one getting fired. At the same time, Larry attempts to ask Miracle out on a date, but finds he cannot stand Miracle's [...] "stupid" [...] thoughts. As it turns out, she was the one responsible for his students' poor training in gym: she repeatedly throws out food, in honor of those in third-world countries.|$|E
500|$|Several legends {{are told}} {{regarding}} {{the origins of}} the Chincoteague, the most popular holds that they descend from survivors of wrecked Spanish galleons off the Virginia coast. It is more likely that they descend from stock released on the island by 17th-century colonists looking to escape livestock laws and taxes on the mainland. In 1835, the practice of pony penning began, with local residents rounding up ponies and removing some of them to the mainland. In 1924 the first official [...] "Pony Penning Day" [...] was held by the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company, where ponies were auctioned as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> money for fire equipment. The annual event has continued in the same fashion almost uninterrupted to the present day.|$|E

50|$|Funding can {{be raised}} in both legal and illegal ways. Some {{of the most common}} <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> funds are through front groups, {{charitable}} organizations, or NGOs with similar ideologies.

500|$|Unknown to Mayall, Lick {{observatory}} director William H. Wright and his predecessor, Robert G. Aitken, {{had both}} tried in secret {{to raise money}} for a larger reflector to replace the [...] Crossley Reflector. [...] They tried both private sources as well as trying to get Robert Gordon Sproul, the University of California President, to provide for one in the budget. [...] Despite multiple attempts, they continued to fail, primarily due to the Great Depression. [...] However, in 1942, Sproul asked Paul W. Merrill from Mt. Wilson to succeed Wright, but was turned down. [...] Agitated by the refusal, Sproul changed his stance and told the regents that they had to find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> money for a new telescope once the war ended. [...] At about this time, Sproul promised or secretly appointed C. Donald Shane as director of Lick, to take over when the war ended.|$|E
500|$|The {{route in}} the other three states became U.S. Route 491 in 2003, mainly through efforts of New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson. He {{requested}} the change due to the [...] "infamy brought by the inopportune naming of the road". While campaigning for governor, Richardson promised to renumber the highway {{as part of a}} larger plan to improve the highway and build relations between New Mexico and the Navajo Nation. Although traditional Navajo culture does not share the belief of 666 being an evil number, some Navajos had attempted for years to change the number as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> awareness about the dangerous highway. The highway had largely been ignored, with few improvements made since it was first paved. By 1997, US666 was named one of the 20most dangerous highways in the United States. Some Navajo leaders were concerned that efforts to reduce poverty on Navajo lands, via promoting tourism and outside investment, were being hampered by the Christian aversion to the number.|$|E

50|$|Glaciation had an {{enormous}} impact on the coastline of the North Sea. The west coast of Denmark is notable as it had been very glaciated during the Saale Glacial Stage and Weichsel glaciation.

50|$|While protest {{often leads}} to {{publicity}} of anti-whaling activities, there are more direct <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> public awareness. Media activism uses media and communication technologies for social movement, and/or tries to change policies relating to media and communication. Websites, newsletters, calls to action, pamphlets, books, speaking tours, rallies and mass mailings are all examples of outreach efforts.|$|R
