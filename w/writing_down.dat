It {{involved}} the radical <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> of war debts, which would have had the possible effect of increasing international trade all round, but at the same time thrown the entire cost of European reconstruction on the United States.|$|E
5|$|Corea {{explains}} at {{his website}} {{how he was}} motivated to work on music inspired by To the Stars, commenting that he {{was inspired by a}} scene from the book in which Hubbard describes the Captain of the spaceship in the story playing a melody on a piano. He had read the book eight or nine times, and after <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> musical composition based on Hubbard's work the album was created as a tone poem piece. Previous tone poem albums by Corea include The Leprechaun (1975), My Spanish Heart (1976), and The Mad Hatter (1978). The piece is Corea's first attempt at musical interpretation from one of Hubbard's works.|$|E

He also tells them that if both <b>write</b> <b>down</b> the same number, he will treat that number as the true dollar value of both suitcases and reimburse both travelers that amount. However, if one <b>writes</b> <b>down</b> a smaller number than the other, this smaller number will be taken as the true dollar value, and both travelers will receive that amount along with a bonus/malus: $2 extra will {{be paid to the}} traveler who <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> the lower value and a $2 deduction will be taken from the person who <b>wrote</b> <b>down</b> the higher amount. The challenge is: what strategy should both travelers follow to decide the value they should <b>write</b> <b>down?</b> ...|$|R

5|$|When Mulder and Scully {{travel to}} Iowa {{and meet the}} Morrises, Mulder observes Kevin <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> binary code {{on a piece of}} paper; Kevin claims they are coming from static on a {{television}} screen. After submitting Kevin's code for analysis, the agents meet with the local sheriff, who tells them that Ruby was a juvenile delinquent who likely ran away. They also meet a young woman, Tessa, who says that Ruby had gotten pregnant and was planning to run away with her boyfriend, Greg Randall. The agents are unable to find Greg at the bar where he works; however, his boss tells them about UFO activity at Lake Okobogee.|$|E
5|$|The same year, {{the family}} moved to Deurne, a suburb of Antwerp, where he came in contact with nature and with scouting, which both had a {{profound}} impact on his character and his later work. With the scouts, he became the troop reporter, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> heavily illustrated reports on their outings and adventures, in a similar vein as what Hergé did in his scouting period. Through the scouts, he also came into contact with Le Boy-Scout Belge, the Walloon scouting magazine where Hergé made Totor, his first published comic. Vandersteen made a few sequels to these adventures for his friends as amusement, which are the earliest preserved comics he made. He continued to follow the work of Hergé later on. Meanwhile, Vandersteen combined his studies at the Academy with his work in his father's workshop until 1935, when the market for stone decorations for houses collapsed.|$|E
5|$|There is {{only one}} early {{manuscript}} of Y Gododdin, the Book of Aneirin, thought to date from {{the second half of}} the 13th century. The currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains the work of two scribes, usually known as A and B. Scribe A wrote down 88 stanzas of the poem, then left a blank page before <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> four related poems known as Gorchanau. This scribe wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography. Scribe B added material later, and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since the material added by this scribe is in Old Welsh orthography. Scribe B wrote 35 stanzas, some of which are variants of stanzas also given by Scribe A while others are not given by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from the end of the manuscript, so some material may have been lost.|$|E

50|$|WDA {{applies to}} such amounts of {{allowable}} expenditure {{that are not}} relieved by either AIA or FYA.

Assets in the general pool are <b>written</b> <b>down</b> at 18% while those in the special pool are <b>written</b> <b>down</b> at 8%. An asset in a single-asset pool is <b>written</b> <b>down</b> at either 8% or 18% depending on its nature. The advantage is that, on disposal, the whole of the <b>written</b> <b>down</b> value may be offset against taxable profits. The whole balance of a pool may be written off if it falls below £1,000.|$|R

Shortly after Muhammad's death, the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it.

There are, however, variant readings, with mostly minor differences in meaning.|$|E
