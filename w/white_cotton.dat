5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} version {{of that kind of}} dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.|$|E
5|$|Nablus costume {{was of a}} {{distinctive}} style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Due to its position as important trade center with a flourishing souk ("market"), in late 19th century, {{there was a large}} choice of fabrics available in the city, from Damascus and Aleppo silk to Manchester cottons and calicos. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the Galilee, both long and short Turkish style jackets were worn over the thob ("robe"). For daily wear, thobs were often made of <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> or linen, with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the qabbeh ("square chest piece").|$|E
5|$|The prince found {{fulfillment}} {{in activities}} that required physical skills, {{rather than in the}} classroom. At his father's Santa Cruz farm, Pedro trained unbroken horses, and became a fine horseman and an excellent farrier. He and his brother Miguel enjoyed mounted hunts over unfamiliar ground, through forests, and even at night or in inclement weather. He displayed a talent for drawing and handicrafts, applying himself to wood carving and furniture making. In addition, he had a taste for music, and under the guidance of Marcos Portugal the prince became an able composer. He had a good singing voice, and was proficient with several musical instruments (including piano, flute and guitar), playing popular songs and dances. Pedro was a simple man, both in habits and in dealing with others. Except on solemn occasions when he donned court dress, his daily attire consisted of <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> trousers, striped cotton jacket and a broad-brimmed straw hat, or a frock coat and a top hat in more formal situations. He would frequently take time to engage in conversation with people on the street, noting their concerns.|$|E

25|$|The two New World cotton species {{account for}} the vast {{majority}} of modern cotton production, but the two Old World species were widely used before the 1900s. While cotton fibers occur naturally in colors of white, brown, pink and green, fears of contaminating the genetics of <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> have led many cotton-growing locations to ban the growing of colored cotton varieties.|$|E
25|$|Boudin and du Pont also competed {{to design}} window {{treatments}} for the Red Room. Boudin suggested straight panels of cerise silk, suspended from a gilded wood rod and rings. Du Pont proposed a lighter treatment of <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> voile or muslin, drawn {{back from the}} windows with tassels. Mrs. Kennedy was concerned that du Pont's drapes would require constant pressing in order to look good, and that souvenir-hunters might snip at the tassels and fringe. Boudin's scheme won out.|$|E

25|$|The Eureka Tent & Awning Company {{was founded}} {{sometime}} before 1895 in Binghamton, New York. The company’s first workshop on Binghamton’s Commercial Avenue originally produced custom tents, awnings, wagon covers, horse blankets, and flags. The company employed early manufacturing processes, such as using dies to cut stars and sewing together strips {{of red and}} white bunting to make American flags. Eureka fashioned its first awnings out of unfinished natural <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> duck and designed them to maximize the amount of light allowed into the storefront while still providing adequate shade to passers-by. Eureka’s earliest tents, assembled from untreated white army duck, were so sturdy that one completely usable early Eureka tent still hung in the company’s headquarters nearly one hundred years later.|$|E
25|$|Fashionable {{women of}} the Regency era wore several layers of undergarments. The first was the chemise, or shift, a thin garment with tight, short sleeves (and a low {{neckline}} if worn under evening wear), made of <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> and finished with a plain hem that was shorter than the dress. These shifts were meant to protect the outer-clothes from perspiration and were washed more frequently than outer clothes. In fact, washer {{women of the}} time used coarse soap when scrubbing these garments, then plunged them in boiling water, hence the absence of color, lace, or other embellishments, which would have faded or damaged the fabric under such rough treatment. Chemises and shifts also prevented the transparent muslin or silk dresses from being too revealing.|$|E
25|$|Back in the 1940s {{there were}} many members {{that were in the}} military. During that time period it was not easy for all of the members to get {{together}} for meetings because of gas rationing. On May 27 and 28, 1944 the first formal convention was held. This meeting was led by Jane Farrow and Jo Folden in Columbus, Ohio. The first Regional Meeting was held later that year in Plainfield, New Jersey. From this came the decision on the colors and the logo for Motor Maids. It was decided that royal blue and silver gray would make up the colors and a shield would represent the logo. Another thing that came from this meeting was the uniform for the group. At the start the uniforms were tailor-made of silver-gray gabardine with royal blue piping. This soon changed and the uniform became gray slacks, royal blue over-blouse with white boots, and a tie. Down the road in 2006, the group voted to change the uniform again. It was then changed to what it is in present day. It consists of black pants and boots, royal blue mock neck long sleeved shirt with a <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> vest, and white gloves. White gloves were added in 1941 when Howard Foley went to the motor maids with the idea of parading at the Charity Newsies Race. During this parade, the Motor Maids wore white gloves making them known as the “Ladies of the White Gloves”. They continued to parade for this event each year up until 1979. The Motor Maids are required to wear royal blue mock turtleneck and <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> vest, jet-black slacks, and clean black footwear. For parades white gloves are added. The rest are required at a convention for the parade, formal group picture, and banquet.|$|E

25|$|When Von Teese was a teenager, {{her mother}} {{took her to}} buy her first bra, made from plain <b>white</b> <b>cotton,</b> {{and gave her a}} plastic egg {{containing}} a pair of wrinkly, flesh-colored pantyhose. Von Teese says she was disappointed, as she had been hoping to receive beautiful lacy garments and stockings, of the type she had glimpsed in her father's Playboy magazines. This fueled her passion for lingerie. She worked in a lingerie store as a salesgirl when she was 15, eventually as a buyer. Von Teese has been fond of wearing elaborate lingerie such as corsets and basques with fully fashioned stockings ever since. In college, Von Teese studied historic costuming and aspired to work as a stylist for films. She is a trained costume designer, often designing (and copyrighting) her photo shoots herself.|$|E
25|$|The {{ceremonial}} huipil of Zinacantán, Chiapas is also {{distinguished by}} its manufacture and symbolism. It {{is made of}} <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> with a square neckline or with a vertical opening with a button fastener. The chest area is marked off with a red line inside of which are white chicken feathers delicately fastened with white, blue or green thread. The lower border has fringe made of the same materials and colors. It is the only garment in Mexico which uses the pre Hispanic art of featherwork today. This huipil is often used for weddings as {{it is believed that}} it ensures a good marriage. Other white wedding huipils are found in Pinotepa Nacional, Chopan and Cotzocón in Oaxaca. In Pinotepa Nacional, decorative elements include animals, flowers, human figures, fretwork, moons, suns, fish and insects.|$|E
25|$|Scouring, is a {{chemical}} washing process {{carried out on}} cotton fabric to remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibres and any added soiling or dirt. Scouring is usually carried in iron vessels called kiers. The fabric is boiled in an alkali, which forms a soap with free fatty acids (saponification). A kier is usually enclosed, so the solution of sodium hydroxide can be boiled under pressure, excluding oxygen which would degrade the cellulose in the fibre. If the appropriate reagents are used, scouring will also remove size from the fabric although desizing often precedes scouring and {{is considered to be}} a separate process known as fabric preparation. Preparation and scouring are prerequisites to most of the other finishing processes. At this stage even the most naturally <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> fibres are yellowish, and bleaching, the next process, is required.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{dress for}} women {{consists}} of a skirt decorated with stripes and a cotton blouse with short sleeves and a square neckline which is embroidered in bright colors. This embroidery often has images of humans and animals done in cross-stitch or with beads. A poncho-like garment called a quezquémetl is worn over the blouse, which is usually white with a wide purple or red trim. If it is sunny, this garment is then usually folded to be worn on the head. Traditional dress for men consists of pants and a shirt in plain cotton with a <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> belt, with a macramé fringe and bright colored embroidery. A heavier shirt in black or blue with white stripes may be worn over this along with an ixtle fiber bag and huarache sandals. A local type of basket which is still in use is called a tancolote, which has a frame of tree branches.|$|E
25|$|The 25th Arkansas Infantry was {{designated}} as the 30th Arkansas Infantry {{for a period of}} about six months in the winter of 1862-1863, until after the battle of Murfreesboro. While serving as the 30th Arkansas Infantry its colors were captured by the 2nd Ohio Infantry at the Battle of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, on December 31, 1862. The flag was returned to the State of Arkansas by the U.S. War Department in 1905. The flag measures 40inches on the staff by 46inches on the fly. It is composed of a blue cotton field, bordered on all sides with <b>white</b> <b>cotton,</b> 3inches wide, with a white St. Andrew's cross traversing the blue field. In black painted outline figures, 2-1/2inches high, is the designation 30TH REG, ARK INF on the upper and lower borders, respectively. Two battle honors—FARMINGTON MISS and RICHMOND KY—appear in white painted outline letters, in the upper and lower quadrants, respectively, formed by the white cross. The flag is presently housed {{in the collection of the}} Old State House Museum in Little Rock, Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|The 28th Arkansas Infantry mustered by {{companies}} and conducted its initial training near Fort Smith, Arkansas, {{on what the}} locals called the Mazzard Prairie. Initially, the regiment was poorly equipped; however, they were eventually supplied with modern Springfield rifle-muskets that had been captured at the First Battle of Bull Run, Virginia, and transported west. The regiment gained a reputation {{as some of the}} most disciplined and martial looking then training on Mazzard Prairie. In the Spring of 1863 the men was issued standard Columbus Depot uniforms, generally made from light-grey jean material with an eight button single breasted frock coat having dark blue trim on its straight stand-up collar and straight cuffs. They also were issued one pair of matching trousers and a simple black felt hat. The regiment's commissioned officers were mostly men of means before to the war, and it is assumed they would have indulged themselves at the many commercial uniform outfitters. The 36th Arkansas's microfilm records include many Quartermaster receipts showing the officers purchased gold braid, coats, silk sashes, <b>white</b> <b>cotton</b> shirts, and large brimmed hats.|$|E
