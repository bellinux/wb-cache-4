Over 80 per cent of the lands bordering the named rivers are state-owned; as to them, the Act is principally interesting as an imaginative conservation effort by a state which traditionally has given its forest lands a high measure of protection. Where private lands border the rivers, however, the statute provides for use restrictions so severe in some cases that many might conclude they must be purchased through condemnation proceedings. Yet the Act provides for the payment of "just compensation" only if an existing use is to be restricted.

40|$|AbstractAgriculture, fishing, greenhousing, carpet manufacturing, {{granite stone}} {{engraving}} and tourism {{are the primary}} sources of income in Dikili, Izmir. Tourism started to develop in the region since the 1980 s and recently, coastal tourism and domestic tourism have gained importance. The aim {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate that beside coasts where coastal tourism takes place, Dikili, has natural and cultural sources required for development of thermal tourism and rural tourism/ecotourism. Additionally, presenting these sources give way to provide numerous opportunities as a power, is complement aim. The presence of high-flow geothermal water sources in Kaynarca and Ilıca districts in Dikili provides opportunities for heating houses and performing greenhousing in the districts, however Nebiler, Bademli, Kocaoba, French hot springs and etc. offer a great potential for the development of thermal tourism. The land allocations for the establishment of two facilities in Dikili indicate that the region will soon be mentioned with thermal tourism. Except for the Aegean Sea and geothermal waters, the mountains, mountain pastures, islands, lakes, waterfalls, caves, forests, monumental trees, natural medicinal plants, <b>wild</b> animals <b>and</b> <b>scenic</b> beauties indicate how rich natural geography Dikili has. Local economic products (olive, olive oil, marine products, Yagcıbedir carpets and etc.), ancient cities, rock tombs and ruins of castles as well as villages display the diversity of cultural sources in the region. These all sources mean great attractions for rural tourism/ecotourism and the only shortcoming is that these products have not been branded or turned into touristic products yet. In this sense, the design of tracking paths, the establishment of shopping stands and the opening of some restaurants in some villages are primarly steps and touristic products to launch tourism. Finally in the study, SWOT analysis is made and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of Dikili in terms of thermal tourism and rural tourism/ecotourism are suggested. The paper has been written in the field of tourism geography and prepared after data collection, geographical observations, analysis and synthesis...|$|R
