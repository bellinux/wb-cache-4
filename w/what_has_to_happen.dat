25|$|There have been, and {{continue}} to be, various reasons for researching non-standard BBN. The first, which is largely of historical interest, is to resolve inconsistencies between BBN predictions and observations. This {{has proved to be}} of limited usefulness in that the inconsistencies were resolved by better observations, and in most cases trying to change BBN resulted in abundances that were more inconsistent with observations rather than less. The second reason for researching non-standard BBN, and largely the focus of non-standard BBN in the early 21st century, is to use BBN to place limits on unknown or speculative physics.

40|$|Declarative process {{models have}} become a mature {{alternative}} to procedural ones. Instead of focusing on <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> they rather follow an outside-in approach based on a rule base containing different types of constraints.

This is followed by a comparison of Bangladesh and Vietnam, suggesting that a “development from below ” approach (including microcredit programs) advocated by Muhammad Yunus, is not enough to enable countries to escape extreme poverty unless (as in Vietnam) political leaders are motivated enough to engender the “social energy ” necessary to do so.

40|$|The {{practice}} of consultation between senior managers and employee representatives {{has a long}} history in British employment relations yet has often been overshadowed by discussions on collective bargaining. In the last few decades, the importance of consultation has been elevated by two main trends: the decline in trade union membership and the retreat from collective bargaining in the private sector on the one hand, with the result that consultation may be the only form of collective employee voice available; and the programme of legislative support for consultation by the European Union since the 1970 s on the other. The book charts the meaning and development of consultation in the twentieth century and explores the justifications for the practice. It shows how EU intervention to promote consultation evolved and changed, paying particular attention to the adoption of the Information and Consultation of Employees (ICE) Regulations, which became fully operational in enterprises with 50 or more employees in 2008. Analysing the half-hearted response to EU consultation initiatives by the social partners in Britain, it provides a critical assessment of successive UK governments' handling of the issue. Drawing on the authors' empirical research in twenty-five organizations, the book closely examines the take-up and impact of consultation regulations, and explores the processes involved in effective consultation. Consultation at Work looks at the dynamics of consultation and draws a contrast between 'active' consultation of the type envisaged by the EU, and more limited consultation used as a means of communication. Discussing the UK experience in comparative perspectives, it asks <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> for the take-up of consultation to improve and suggests the changes that should be made to the EU Directive and UK ICE Regulations...|$|E

The research outlined in this paper demonstrates that the noteworthy contribution of structural constellation work for problem solving is typically the result of a combination of functional analysis and the feeling-as-information principle. The constellation work helps, at first, to reveal the subjective experiences, such as feelings, moods, emotions, and bodily sensations, and then to accept them as a source of objective information relevant to the decision making process. In accordance with the latest research [19], the use of feelings as a source of information follows the same principles as the use of any other information.

40|$|The Age {{could find}} {{itself at the}} centre of a test case for a brand new law, says Martin Hirst in The Conversation. Victoria Police e-crime squad members {{yesterday}} raided the offices of The Age newspaper {{as part of their}} ongoing investigation into allegations that reporters from the paper illegally hacked into an ALP database. Officers attempted to seize the computer of investigative reporter Nick McKenzie, but The Age obtained an emergency injunction blocking the removal of the equipment. Police interest in the matter stems from a story published during the 2010 Victorian election campaign demonstrating the high level of personal detail kept on individuals by ALP on its voter management database. The Conversation spoke with Associate Professor Martin Hirst about journalism, the law and what constitutes public interest. The original story in The Age revealed how the Victorian ALP collected and used data on constituents. Was this in the public interest? I guess every story in politics is in the public interest, and this certainly was a politically interesting story, but having reread it, {{it seems to me that}} it was merely a one-off, a front page splash for The Age, and an exclusive for them, so it was good for them, but in the scheme of things I don’t think anyone would be surprised that political parties, or indeed any organisation, is keeping files on them. Has the significance of this story been overblown? I think the significance of the original story has been overblown. It’s been kept alive very well over the past several months by the Herald Sun and by The Australian and I think they’ve done a very good job of keeping it alive in the public mind. They’ve related it very much to the British phone-hacking story and used it as a bit of a spoiler to deflect from the heat from that. It’s on a different scale,though. The News of the World events are much more significant. How did the article lead to a police raid on the paper? Well it seems there’s a bit of a background here. After the Herald Sun started sniffing around on this story, one of the people they spoke to was the Victorian Electoral Commissioner, who then complained to the police and asked the police to investigate whether any illegal activity had taken place. So it seems that’s where the original complaint was laid from, and the police are now just doing what they’re tasked with, which is to follow up on these types of of allegations. Who do you see as being the victim in this crime? It’s hard to say that anybody’s really a victim here. The Labor Party is obviously embarrassed because their secret polling and the existence of this database is now public information, so they’re a little bit embarrassed. The Age has been very careful not to release information they got from this database without checking with those people, so they haven’t really released any private information. I think to some extent it’s a victimless crime. There’s no victim I can see here. The police have raided the office to establish whether journalists who accessed this database have broken any laws, in particular section 478 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. If the journalists have broken this law, do you think it was a law they were entitled to break, and are journalists entitled to break the law in general? The police have to establish through their investigation whether or not a law has been broken and I think if I was advising The Age journalists I’d be very cautious about what they say about this, and certainly I would argue that given that they got the password and the username from an ALP worker that they perhaps could argue that they were authorised. But in the general sense of when it’s permissible to break laws, I think <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in a a situation like that is that the public interest has to be set very, very high. I think the public interest test bar has to be incredibly high in a situation like this before you can actually say that journalists are allowed to break the law. I think journalists often would like to think they’re above the law but they’re not. Journalists must abide by the laws of the land and for anybody to take the law into their own hands and argue that they have a right to break a particular law, you have to have a very good case, you have to have a very strong public interest argument that it’s desrirable to break the law. I don’t think the original public interest on this story was high enough to warrant breaking the law – if that’s what’s happened. There is a shield law to allow journalists to protect sources, found in the Evidence Act. Should that shield law be applicable in this case? It seems to me that the most interesting aspect of this case is in fact that that new section of the Evidence Act can be brought into bear here, and may be used as a defence. I don’t think this law has been used before – it was only passed into legislation earlier this year – so it has not yet been tested. Now having looked at section 126 h of the Evidence Act, or the amendments to the act that were passed this year, it does make it quite clear that a journalist is within their rights to refuse to give up the name of a source if they have offered that source some form of identity protection, so in this case it could very well be used as a defence. It seems to me that we’re likely to see the first legal test of this if it does ever get to court.   This article was originally published at The Conversation.

40|$|Originally, Charles Rose came to SAIS {{because he}} thought {{he wanted to go}} into the State Department for which he found he was entirely unsuited, so he never went. He thought he was {{interested}} in the State Department because he was interested in history – his major as an undergraduate at Hamilton College. When he was at SAIS, he remembers it having a very run down building on Florida Avenue, in a so-so neighborhood. He recalls the back alley being swarmed with large rats. He recalls the faculty and being trained in French, which he eventually learned to speak and write. The best tutoring he received was from Madam Chabaneau who daughter had a career in journalism in Washington, D. C. The one professor he had at SAIS who he thought was extremely sophisticated was Mario Toscano. The most interesting part of his attending SAIS was his fellow students, some of whom had excellent careers in the Foreign Service. He particularly remembers David Corn who had an interesting career, but who has now retired and has written a couple of books (one on Ethiopia). He remembers {{having a lot of fun}} and not ever knowing exactly what he wanted to do then. He particularly remembers the librarian, Frank Shork, who was interesting and who invited him and his friends out to his country home – they all had a good time. He also remembers Dean Thayer who was extremely tolerant of all of Rose’s ‘vagaries’ and he remembers him fondly. He firmly believes in the concept of experience and thinks that it is a curious thing. In hind sight, he believes SAIS was a very good experience because it gave him a lot of time to read, which he always did, and mature. Also, some of his later interests started at SAIS, particularly that of Roman law…. and that was because Rose studied international law at SAIS. He did take and pass the written portion of the Foreign Service exam, but never pursued it as a career. He later went to Columbia to work on his PhD, which he did receive, in history, and for a number of years, he taught history. He feels that he really started to learn the most during his experiences in teaching. He first started teaching at a school called Queens College – he taught a contemporary civilization course – and there for four or five years. He then went to teacher’s college where he volunteered doing development work, and then got his first job a year later at Finch College (and has since closed its doors). After that, he went to the New York Studio School, which was fascinating and had wonderful artists who were also teachers. That school’s existence was based entirely on fund raising. Rose later lectured part-time at NYU in their general studies department, while still doing development work for the New York Studio School. By this time, he had done a tremendous amount of reading, so he had a completely different view of history than he had while he was at SAIS. One of his lectures was picked cited as outstanding by one of the deans. Because of this, Rose was almost tenured at NYU, but he never received it as the dean who offered him the tenure died four weeks later. After this dean passed away, Rose realized he needed to find a job that allowed him to earn more of a living. He left the New York Studio School and worked right next door at a school called St. Hilda’s and St. Hugh’s School, doing development work and teaching. He helped this school get their first large grants. He had gone from place to place until he found himself as vice president at a social service agency, where he helped them raise a lot of money. There, he focused heavily on a project related to foster children, who he deemed who in most need of education (his passion). He still does fund raising work for this organization and helps turn up scholarships for these foster children. They have produced several college graduates and even a doctor (a woman who he met on a sidewalk of New York, had no parents and did not even have a warm coat to wear in the dead of winter). Rose recently started a new project to provide tutor / mentoring to children in his neighborhood and he raised $ 130 K from two or three different foundations. He believes that it is not large projects, but the small, targeted projects that help the social infrastructure of our country. Overall, he is mainly interested in taking people off the streets and finding ways to elevate them into the middle class. When asked about what advice he has for current students today, his reply is: “I don’t think advice is worth anything. I think <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> is that people have to learn from experience. Advice is not only cheap, but it’s mostly useless. [laugh] Now, it might be very good advice, by the way,…it’s not that. It’s that you really can’t do anything with it because temperamentally, you’re not suited for that advice. It’s interesting…. I think I probably work with greater concentration now at 79, than I did when I was a young person…. I’m much more focused. ” He also mentions having had a wonderful experienced in his year at the Bologna Center, where he met a diverse group of people. In those days, it was in a farming community. He would go out in a local church and enjoy observing the peasant community. He began to see the role of the Catholic Church historically, as the center of any given community (around which all activity happened).
