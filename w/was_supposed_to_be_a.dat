BRMB gave him his job back, after which he successfully applied to Midlands Today at the BBC's Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham, a job that included on-air appearances. One of the earliest stories he covered for them was the murder of Carl Bridgewater, the paperboy who was shot during a robbery in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Parizeau's {{hopes for}} {{international}} recognition, a practical requirement of statehood, rested with France and the Francophonie. He {{believed that if}} Quebec declared independence in these circumstances, President of the French National Assembly Philippe Séguin, a powerful Gaullist power broker who was sympathetic to the sovereignty movement, would pressure President Chirac to recognize the declaration. He counted on a French recognition to spread quickly to the Francophonie and bring the issue to a head. Benoit Bouchard, Canada's ambassador at the time, believed that the plan was irrational as he doubted Séguin, who <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> neutral figure in his role, could bring sufficient pressure in the country's semi-presidential system.|$|E

The fleet was commanded by Captain Henry Mowat. The attack began with a naval bombardment which included incendiary shot, followed by a landing party meant to complete the town's destruction.

5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E

5|$|Initially Los Alamos <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{military}} laboratory, and Oppenheimer {{and other}} researchers were to be commissioned into the Army. He {{went so far as}} to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the Army physical test, which he failed. Army doctors considered him underweight at , diagnosed his chronic cough as tuberculosis and were concerned about his chronic lumbosacral joint pain. The plan to commission scientists fell through when Robert Bacher and Isidor Rabi balked at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California under contract to the War Department. It soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely underestimated the magnitude of the project; Los Alamos grew from a few hundred people in 1943 to over 6,000 in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Like Florida State, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{began the}} 1999college {{football}} season with raised expectations. In 1998, the Hokies had gone 93 {{during the regular}} season and had posted a 52 record against fellow Big East Conference teams. The Hokies concluded that 1998 season—which <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rebuilding year—in the 1998 Music City Bowl, where the Hokies defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide, 387. With the addition of redshirt freshman quarterback Michael Vick to a team that had allowed an average of just 12.9points per game on defense, there was the possibility that Tech could improve upon its previous season's performance. Sports Illustrated, for example, predicted that the Hokies might challenge Miami for the Big East football championship, and the preseason Coaches' Poll ranked the Hokies No. 14 prior to {{the first game of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Ram Gopal Varma signed Suriya for a {{multilingual}} crime film titled The Businessman in May 2010, to {{be directed}} by Puri Jagannadh simultaneously in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi.

The film's production was expected to begin in October 2010 once Suriya completed his part in 7aum Arivu (2011) and was scheduled for release in the summer of 2011. Jagannadh stated in an interview that principal photography would begin in September 2010. It was speculated that the film was {{to be based on the}} real-life story of a gangster who had moved from the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu to Mumbai in the late 1960s.|$|E

UConn finished the regular season undefeated and established a 70-game winning streak, shattering the previous mark of 54 set by Louisiana Tech; the streak ended in the Big East championship game loss to Villanova.|$|E
5|$|After two {{series of}} Gladiators, Joseph {{was eager to}} return to acting, so took the role of villain Joanne Brennan in Home and Away from 1995 to 1996. In 1999, {{she moved to the}} United States to study acting at the Atlantic Theater Company in New York City, then spent 18 months unsuccessfully auditioning for roles in Los Angeles. In 2001, she was cast as Jo Ellison in the British {{television}} series Cold Feet. She appeared in the fourth and fifth series and returned to Australia two days after filming the final episode in 2002. In 2004, she appeared in a major recurring role as Dr. Grace Connelly in six episodes of the Australian soap opera All Saints. She returned to America after filming All Saints, where she got a small role as flight attendant Cindy Chandler in the pilot episode of Lost. The role <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> one-off in the pilot but a producer liked Joseph and the character, so brought her back for a recurring role in the second, third and sixth seasons. Away from acting, Joseph has been involved in efforts to highlight the effects of Soviet nuclear testing in Kazakhstan, including directing a short film.|$|E
5|$|Debates {{about the}} {{national}} flag occurred again in 1917 during the Vilnius Conference. Two colors, green and red, were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates {{did not like the}} design as it was too dark and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On April 19, 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the Council of Lithuania. The flag <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the upper left corner or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.|$|E

5|$|Matthew Fox, Dominic Monaghan and Jorge Garcia {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Sawyer, who at the time <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> suit-wearing city con man, but the role was given to Josh Holloway. Garcia was the first actor the producers knew they were going to cast. While the producers thought Garcia was spectacular, they did not think he fit in the role of Sawyer, so they created the Hurley character for him instead. When Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked his southern accent and the edge he brought to the character (Holloway reportedly forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration). The producers knew he did not suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, but kept the same intelligence he originally had. After appearing in The Lord of the Rings, Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles, like elves and pixies. He was keen to portray a different role, so he wanted a contemporary part that had layers and an edge. Originally Charlie was an older rocker that has been a big hit in the 1980s but now had a heroin addiction. After the producers enjoyed Monaghan's audition of Sawyer, they decided to cast him as Charlie and rewrote the script to make Charlie a young has-been instead.|$|E
5|$|With a short {{timeframe}} {{to complete}} The Wrath of Khans special effects sequences, effects supervisor Jim Veilleux, Meyer, Jennings, Sallin and Minor worked {{to transform the}} written ideas for the script into concrete storyboards and visuals. The detailed sequences were essential to keep the film's effects from spiraling {{out of control and}} driving up costs, as had occurred with The Motion Picture. Each special and optical effect, and the duration of the sequences, was listed. By the end of six weeks, the producers determined the basic look and construction of nearly all the effects; the resulting shots were combined with film footage five months later. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) produced many of the effects, and created the new models; the Reliant was the first non-Constitution-class Federation starship seen in the series. Originally, the Reliant <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Constitution-class starship identical to the Enterprise, but it was felt audiences would have difficulty distinguishing between the two ships. As the script called for the Reliant and Enterprise to inflict significant damage on each other, ILM developed techniques to illustrate the damage without physically harming the models. Rather than move the models on a bluescreen during shooting, the VistaVision camera was panned and tracked to give the illusion of movement. Damage to the Enterprise was cosmetic, and simulated with pieces of aluminum that were colored or peeled off. Phaser damage was created using stop motion. The script called for large-scale damage to the Reliant, so larger versions of the ship's model were created to be blown up.|$|E
