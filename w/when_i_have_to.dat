In an {{interview}} for Toronto Star, she said, [...] "Every time I'm in Canada I feel more Swedish, and every time I'm in Sweden I feel more Canadian. I belong in both places and I love them both equally." [...] She holds both Swedish and Canadian passports. Apart from speaking fluent English and Swedish, she also speaks French and Spanish. She describes herself as a feminist as she believes in equal treatment for both sexes, but also considers that [...] "We [...] are different", adding that she [...] "embrace those differences." [...] She has revealed that she is dyslexic and said that it took her [...] "a long time" [...] to learn her lines. [...] "I get horrified <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do table reads with the whole cast, because there’s a lot of stuttering coming from me, so I {{have to do a lot}} of prep", she explained. Because of this, she prefers to improvise her lines.|$|E
500|$|Lindwall's {{emergence}} {{after the}} Second World War {{along with his}} new ball partner Keith Miller heralded {{a new era in}} cricket. The pair were regarded as the two best fast bowlers of their era, and signalled a change in the cricket landscape, which had been dominated during the interwar period by batsmen. Together the pair formed a new ball fast-bowling combination {{regarded as one of the}} best in Test history. During the 1948 tour of England, the hosts had agreed to have a new ball available every 55 overs, and the Australians used this to unleash Lindwall and Miller on the Englishmen with a shiny new ball. The pair often targeted the leading opposition batsmen, particular England's Len Hutton and Denis Compton with large amounts of short-pitched bowling, raising fast bowling to a new standard. Hutton's battles with Lindwall were regarded as one of the key match-ups in Anglo-Australian battles of the time, and Hutton said his opponent had the ability to [...] "strike at will". Hutton felt that Lindwall's bouncers were the best that he faced, saying of their accuracy:"You had to play them or be hit". Lindwall refused to bowl bouncers at tailenders, saying that [...] "If the day ever came <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> bowl bouncers at tailenders then I won't deserve to play for Australia". When England developed quality pace bowlers of their own in the 1950s, Hutton was captain and he implemented a similar strategy to that executed by Lindwall and Miller. In retirement, Lindwall went on to mentor Lillee, who went on to break the Test world record for wicket-taking.|$|E

"I don't mind {{some kinds}} of pick and shovel work," [...] he said to Percival Serle, [...] "but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> throw heavy stuff over my {{shoulder}} it gives me rather a wrench." [...] He may have been referring to the time he spent in the Heyfield area, where he wrote several poems and helped {{in the construction of}} the Lake Glenmaggie weir wall.|$|E

2500|$|When {{black men}} wished to become Masons {{in the new}} nation the white members of the Lodge had to {{unanimously}} vote to accept a petitioner to receive Masonic degrees. If one white person voted against the petitioner that person would be rejected. In a letter by General Albert Pike to his brother in 1875 he said, [...] "I am not inclined to mettle in the matter. I took my obligations to white men, not to Negroes. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> accept Negroes as brothers or leave Masonry, I shall leave it." [...] Masonic and Grand Lodges generally excluded African Americans. Since the votes were anonymous, {{it was impossible to}} identify the member who had voted against accepting a black member. The effect was the black men who had legitimately been made Masons in integrated jurisdictions could be rejected. Racial segregation existed until the 1960s and still persists in some jurisdictions.|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Maya {{culture was}} an important inspiration for Asturias. He saw a direct relationship between magical realism and Indigenous mentality, saying, “...an Indian or a mestizo in a small village might describe how he saw an enormous stone turn into a person or a giant, or a cloud turn into a stone. That is not a tangible reality but one that involves an understanding of supernatural forces. That is why <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give it a literary label I call it [...] "magic realism." [...] Similarly, scholar Lourdes Royano Gutiérrez argues that surrealist thought is not entirely different from the indigenous or mestizo worldview. Royano Gutiérrez describes this worldview as {{one in which the}} border between reality and dream is porous and not concrete. It is clear from both Asturias' and Gutiérrez' quotes that magical realism was seen as a suitable genre to represent an indigenous character's thoughts. The surrealist/magical realist style is exemplified in Asturias' works Mulata de tal and El señor Presidente.|$|E
