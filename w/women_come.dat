500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] {{talks about}} females wanting to submissevely serve their male love {{interests}} {{and take care}} of them as they admire their hard work and are inspired by them. The trio further sings about the men of their lives {{and the way in which}} they will take care of them. [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] was written as a continuation on the previous song on Destiny Fulfilled, [...] "Soldier"; after the trio sings about finding a suitable lover in the aforementioned song, they express a will to cater to him in [...] "Cater 2 U". In the second edition of the book Introducing Cultural Studies, the authors argued that the song contained lyrics about objectification of women, which suggested that their gender role was to [...] "'keep herself up', 'keep it right', 'cater to' their man by providing him with his dinner, a foot rub, a manicure, fetching his slippers, and much more, on demand". An editor writing in The Times of India found a theme of feminine assertiveness in [...] "Cater 2 U"; he noted that [...] "the <b>women</b> <b>come</b> off not so much as lovers as full-service romantic servants". J. Freedom du Lac, a staff writer of The Washington Post wrote that the song's theme was supplication.|$|E
5000|$|Of the ten {{types of}} women in the poem, nine are {{delineated}} as destructive: the dirty <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from a pig; the cunning woman originates from a fox, the incessantly curious and high-maintenance <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from a dog, the lazy or apathetic <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from earth or soil, the capricious woman of mood swings comes from seawater, the stubborn <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from an ass, the untrustworthy and uncontrollable <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from a ferret, the overly proud <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from a mare, and the worst and ugliest type of <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from an ape or monkey. Only the [...] "Bee Woman" [...] is regarded as virtuous. The bee reference is considered homage to the earlier poem of Hesiod entitled Theogony, which uses the metaphor of women and men as bees in one part.|$|R

2500|$|In some countries, the {{immigration}} policy {{is tied to}} whether the person desiring citizenship is married to his/her sponsor. This can lead to persons [...] being trapped in violent relations - such persons may risk deportation if they attempt to separate (they may be accused of having entered into a sham marriage). Often the <b>women</b> <b>come</b> from cultures where they will suffer disgrace from their families if they abandon their marriage and return home, and so they prefer to stay married, therefore remaining locked in a cycle of abuse.|$|E
2500|$|The poem {{follows the}} {{conscious}} {{experience of a}} man, Prufrock (relayed in the [...] "stream of consciousness" [...] form characteristic of the Modernists), lamenting his physical and intellectual inertia with the recurrent theme of carnal love unattained. Critical opinion is divided {{as to whether the}} narrator leaves his residence {{during the course of the}} narration. The locations described can be interpreted either as actual physical experiences, mental recollections, or as symbolic images from the unconscious mind, as, for example, in the refrain [...] "In the room the <b>women</b> <b>come</b> and go".|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Chapel of St. Anthony of La Florida is {{sometimes}} named the [...] "Goya's Sistine Chapel". The chapel {{was built on}} orders of King Charles IV of Spain, who also commissioned the frescoes by Goya. These were completed over a six-month period in 1798. The frescoes portray miracles by Saint Anthony of Padua, including one that occurred in Lisbon but that the painter has relocated to Madrid. Every year on 13 June, the chapel becomes {{the site of a}} lively pilgrimage in which young unwed <b>women</b> <b>come</b> to pray to St. Anthony and ask for a partner.|$|E

[...] Senator Alan K. Simpson was puzzled by why Hill and Thomas met, dined, and spoke by phone on various occasions after they no longer worked together.|$|E
2500|$|Toril Moi has {{developed}} a feminist perspective on psychoanalysis proposing {{that it is a}} discourse that [...] "attempts to understand the psychic consequences of three universal traumas: {{the fact that there are}} others, the fact of sexual difference, and the fact of death". She replaces Freud's term of castration with Stanley Cavell's concept of [...] "victimization" [...] which is a more universal term that applies equally to both sexes. Moi regards this concept of human finitude as a suitable replacement for both castration and sexual difference as the traumatic [...] "discovery of our separate, sexed, mortal existence" [...] and how both men and <b>women</b> <b>come</b> to terms with it.|$|E

2500|$|Archery (datse) is the {{national}} sport of Bhutan, which is played not only with traditional bows and arrows but also with modern archery techniques at the Changlimithang Sports and Archery Stadium in Thimphu. Archery {{is central to the}} cultural identity of the nation and as a result all tournaments are started with a ceremony. <b>Women</b> <b>come</b> to witness the sports in their colourful best attire and cheer their favorite teams. Men stand close to the target and taunt the players, if targets are missed. The targets are spaced at [...] intervals. Teams which win the tournaments celebrate with their supporters by singing and performing a dance jig. Archery is organized nationally within the Bhutan Archery Federation.|$|E
2500|$|Some immigrants, {{particularly}} those from cultures {{in which women}} are subordinate to men, may express disapproval {{about the influence of}} American culture on girls and women. Men in particular may perceive women from their own cultural heritage who have assimilated into American society as too [...] "independent" [...] and thus incompatible with the traditional family structures that such men may wish to uphold. This may cause men to seek out spouses from their home countries, believing these women will be more willing to take on the traditional household duties of a wife. When these <b>women</b> <b>come</b> to the United States they may experience isolation, particularly if they do not have family members or friends already in the U.S. In such instances, men often control women's access to outside resources and support systems, creating a power imbalance within the home. In instances of domestic violence, this isolation may make it difficult for women to find the help they need.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Roaring Reggie" [...] {{came from}} the way he would shout at the Japanese guards. This {{subjected}} him to many beatings. Standing up for his men was his main focus. He would do whatever was necessary to protect them and keep them alive. He found that feigning displays of respect for Warrant Officer Aitaro [...] "Tiger" [...] Hiramatusu, the Japanese camp commander, brought more benefits than acts of defiance. [...] But it was a fine line to walk. In an interview with Pattie Wright for her book [...] "The Men of the Line," [...] Len, a 2/19th member recalled how Captain Newton got on the [...] "Tiger's" [...] better side. [...] "The 'Tiger' was a bad one but Reggie got around him. [...] We saw comfort <b>women</b> <b>come</b> into our camp. [...] They were in the last carriage of one of the trains going through.

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), the servant took Abraham's bounty and ten of Abraham's camels and {{traveled}} to Aram-Naharaim, {{the city of}} Nahor. He made the camels kneel by the well outside the city at evening, when <b>women</b> <b>come</b> out to draw water. The servant asked God to grant that the maiden whom he would ask to draw water for him and who replied by offering also to water his camels might be the one whom God had decreed for Isaac. He had scarcely finished speaking when Rebekah, the beautiful virgin daughter of Abraham's nephew Bethuel, came out with her jar on her shoulder, {{went down to the}} spring, filled her jar, and came up. The servant ran toward her and asked to sip a little water from her jar, and she quickly let him drink and when he had drunk his fill, she offered to draw water for his camels until they finish drinking. When the camels had finished drinking, the servant took a gold nose-ring and two gold bands for her arms, and asked her whose daughter she was and whether there was room in her father's house for him to spend the night. She identified herself and told him that there was plenty of straw and feed and room at her home for him to spend the night. The servant bowed low to God. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|This novel {{deals with}} the issue of racism on a level beyond a white/other dichotomy. [...] Race {{relations}} in the novel are complicated by the favoring of Spanish blood within the ethnic category of [...] "Mexican." [...] This is demonstrated in the multiple references to Spanish features as the beauty ideals within the Mexican communities. [...] Another demonstration of this favoring is evident in the marriage relations and rules, as Mexicans of indigenous blood or features were not allowed into the marriage structures of those with more direct Spanish lineage and were bound to roles as [...] "peons." [...] While this racist structure existed within the hacienda community, there was simultaneously a land conflict between Native American Indians, Mexicans, and Anglo Americans, as referenced in historical context. [...] This caused a lot of bitter feelings, as witnessed in the derogatory use of the word [...] "gringo" [...] and the fear of Indian Americans. The historical context of the U.S./Mexican War] is a continuous theme throughout the entire novel, and is represented often through the gender expressions of the characters. [...] The <b>women</b> <b>come</b> to represent peace and life while the heterosexual men represent fighting and war. This speaks volumes to the strict gender roles of this culture and time period, in which femininity and masculinity are defined in these classic terms. Don Santiago is also seen as the ultimate patriarch, an identity that ultimately does not serve him well.|$|E

If the Six Corpses (the Three Corpses of the adept himself and of the woman that he looks at?) cause chaos, the blood in your viscera will be disturbed and aroused, your three hun souls will be unguarded. Your spirit will weaken and your qi will leave. All of these [...] will accumulate, and bring about death. As for why you avoid [...] on these days, it is not only to block off lasciviousness. It is [...] to pacify the female palaces. The female palaces are in the shen and the male palaces are in the yin. Yin and shen punish each other. Both execute each other. On these days the Three Corpses of men and <b>women</b> <b>come</b> out from the pupils of the eyes. Female Corpses beckon the male, and male Corpses beckon the female. Misfortune and harm pass back and forth, making the spirit perish and thus blemishing your rectitude. Even if a person does not notice it, his body is exposed and has already been harmed because the Three Corpses fight within the eyes, while blood is shed within the Niwan (a compartment in the brain). On these days, even if it is a girl who you are extremely fond of, or a wife of a close friend, you absolutely must not look them face to face.
