5|$|Across all releases, it is {{estimated}} that Gone with the <b>Wind</b> <b>has</b> sold over 200 million tickets in the United States and Canada, and 35 million tickets in the United Kingdom, generating more theater admissions in those territories than any other film. In total, Gone with the <b>Wind</b> <b>has</b> grossed over $390 million globally at the box office; in 2007 Turner Entertainment estimated the gross to be equivalent to approximately $3.3 billion when adjusted for inflation to current prices, while Guinness World Records arrived at a figure of $3.44 billion in 2014, making it the most successful film in cinema history.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-11f's low {{density is}} {{not shared by}} the planets Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c because the solar <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> reduced their atmospheres to a thin layer. The planets accreted such atmospheres because they formed within the first few million years of the system's existence, when a protoplanetary disk was still present.|$|E
40|$|The CMS <b>winding</b> <b>has</b> now {{arrived at}} its {{constructive}} phase. This means that some practical aspects regarding the <b>winding</b> itself <b>have</b> to be considered, {{such as the}} minimum requirement of conductor performance for each layer of each $ 9 module. Several magnetic calculations have been already performed, but the <b>winding</b> <b>has</b> been never analyzed in detail, {{in order to understand}} the impact of the self-field on its performances. This analysis and its implications are $ 9 reported in this paper...|$|R

5|$|Gone {{with the}} <b>Wind</b> <b>has</b> been criticized as {{historical}} revisionism glorifying slavery, but nevertheless, {{it has been}} credited for triggering changes to the way African-Americans are depicted cinematically. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. The film is {{regarded as one of}} the greatest films of all time; it has placed in the top ten of the American Film Institute's list of top 100 American films since the list's inception in 1998, and in 1989, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.|$|E
5|$|In arid climates, {{the main}} source of erosion is wind. The general wind {{circulation}} moves small particulates such as dust across wide oceans thousands of kilometers downwind of their point of origin, which is known as deflation. Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. <b>Wind</b> <b>has</b> a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for {{a large percentage of the}} biomass of land plants.|$|E
5|$|In human civilization, <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> {{inspired}} mythology, {{influenced the}} events of history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a power source for mechanical work, electricity and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans. Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and man-made structures are damaged or destroyed.|$|E

500|$|By Saturday, the storm's status {{had been}} {{upgraded}} to [...] "severe". The storm was centered over eastern Lake Superior, covering the entire lake basin. The weather forecast of the Port Huron Times-Herald stated that southerly <b>winds</b> <b>had</b> remained [...] "moderate to brisk". Northwesterly <b>winds</b> <b>had</b> reached gale strength on northern Lake Michigan and western Lake Superior, with winds {{of up to}} 60mph (97km/h) at Duluth, Minnesota.|$|R

5|$|Winds can shape landforms, via {{a variety}} of aeolian {{processes}} such as the formation of fertile soils, such as loess, and by erosion. Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names {{in various parts of}} the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.|$|E

25|$|SeaTwirl {{deployed}} {{its first}} floating grid connected wind turbine {{off the coast}} of Sweden in August 2011. It was tested and de-commissioned. This design intends to store energy in a flywheel. Thus, energy could be produced even after the <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> stopped blowing.|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} a bitter day, and a cutting {{north-east}} <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> blown for some time. The <b>wind</b> <b>had</b> gone down with the light, and so the snow had come on.

500|$|The {{hard part}} of filming was {{controlling}} the buildup; Beeman {{wanted to build}} the drama, visuals, and the wind from the storm up together. Mike Walls brought in [...] "jet-powered wind machines", which had been used for the movie Twister, to simulate the high velocity winds for the storm {{that was going to}} blow through Smallville. The [...] "wind" [...] is first introduced when Chloe arrives to pick Clark up for the prom. What begins as a [...] "gentle" [...] introduction is built upon, little by little, with each progressing scene. By the time Lana drops Whitney off at the bus station, the <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> become very strong.|$|E
500|$|Interplanetary space, {{the space}} around the Sun and planets of the Solar System, is the region {{dominated}} by the interplanetary medium, which extends out to the heliopause where {{the influence of the}} galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the Sun. Interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere (the heliosphere) for billions of kilometers into space. This <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> a particle density of 5–10 protons/cm3 and is moving at a velocity of [...] The distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind. The discovery since 1995 of extrasolar planets means that other stars must possess their own interplanetary media.|$|E
500|$|Other non-sandy deserts {{consist of}} exposed {{outcrops}} of bedrock, dry soils or aridisols, {{and a variety}} of landforms affected by flowing water, such as alluvial fans, sinks or playas, temporary or permanent lakes, and oases. A hamada is a type of desert landscape consisting of a high rocky plateau where the sand has been removed by aeolian processes. Other landforms include plains largely covered by gravels and angular boulders, from which the finer particles have been stripped by the wind. These are called [...] "reg" [...] in the western Sahara, [...] "serir" [...] in the eastern Sahara, [...] "gibber plains" [...] in Australia and [...] "saï" [...] in central Asia. The Tassili Plateau in Algeria is an impressive jumble of eroded sandstone outcrops, canyons, blocks, pinnacles, fissures, slabs and ravines. In some places the <b>wind</b> <b>has</b> carved holes or arches and in others it has created mushroom-like pillars narrower at the base than the top. In the Colorado Plateau it is water that has been the eroding force. Here the Colorado River has cut its way over the millennia through the high desert floor creating a canyon that is over a mile (6,000 feet or 1,800 meters) deep in places, exposing strata that are over two billion year old.|$|E
