30|$|It <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> {{that after}} 5  years, the prices {{go back to}} what they were before the price cap was introduced.

5|$|The planet e's {{eccentricity}} {{is poorly}} defined; varying values between 0 and 0.4 does not significantly improve the fit, so an eccentricity of 0.2 <b>was</b> <b>assumed.</b> Taking {{interactions between the}} planets into account results in a near-zero orbital eccentricity.|$|E
