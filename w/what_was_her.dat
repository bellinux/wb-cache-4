5|$|U-66 {{began her}} seventh {{and what was}} to be her final patrol on the morning of 2 September when she {{departed}} from Emden destined for operations in the North Channel. Shortly after noon on 3 September, U-66 reported a position in the North Sea that placed her beyond known British minefields, in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> last known contact. A postwar German study offered no explanation for U-66s loss. British records suggest that U-66 may have either struck a mine in an older minefield in the Dogger Bank area, or that a combination of destroyers, submarines, and anti-submarine net tenders sank U-66 sometime between 1 and 11 October. Author Dwight Messimer discounts this latter theory as not being supported by operational details.|$|E
