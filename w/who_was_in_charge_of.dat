5|$|After the Hessians {{entered the}} fort, the American {{officers}} attempted to placate the Hessian commander, Captain von Malmburg, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the surrender. They invited him into their barracks, and offered him punch, wine, cake, with compliments. As {{they left the}} fort, the Hessians stripped the American troops of their baggage and beat some of them. Their officers intervened to prevent further injuries or deaths. The British captured thirty-four cannons, two howitzers, along with many tents, blankets, tools and much ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Groves soon {{decided to}} {{establish}} his project headquarters {{on the fifth floor}} of the New War Department Building (now known as the Harry S Truman Building) in Washington, D.C., where Marshall had maintained a liaison office. In August 1943, the MED headquarters (and Nichols, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the production facilities at Hanford and Oak Ridge) moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but the name of the district did not change.|$|E
5|$|In most of Brassey's {{contracts}} {{he worked}} in partnership with other contractors, in particular with Peto and Betts. The planning {{of the details of}} the projects was done by the engineers. Sometimes there would be a consulting engineer and below him another engineer <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the day-to-day activities. During his career Brassey worked with many engineers, the most illustrious being Robert Stephenson, Joseph Locke and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The day-to-day work was overseen by agents, who managed and controlled the activities of the subcontractors.|$|E
5|$|On May 19, 1865, Davis {{was imprisoned}} in a casemate at Fortress Monroe {{on the coast}} of Virginia. Irons were riveted to his ankles at the order of General Nelson Miles <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the fort. Davis was allowed no visitors, and no books except the Bible. He became sicker, and the {{attending}} physician warned that his life was in danger, but this treatment continued for some months until late autumn when he was finally given better quarters. General Miles was transferred in mid-1866, and Davis's treatment continued to improve.|$|E

5|$|Orders {{given by}} Hitler on 21 and 24 January 1945 ordered the {{movement}} of looted possessions from Königsberg. This allowed Albert Speer, Reichminister of Armaments, and his administration team to transport cultural goods of priority. However, before the Amber Room could be moved, Erich Koch, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> civil administration in Königsberg during the final months of the war, abandoned his post and fled from the city, leaving General Otto Lasch in command.|$|E
5|$|The Fort Vancouver Centennial half dollar, {{sometimes}} called the Fort Vancouver half dollar, is a commemorative fifty-cent piece struck by the United States Bureau of the Mint in 1925. The coin was designed by Laura Gardin Fraser. Its obverse depicts John McLoughlin, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> Fort Vancouver (present-day Vancouver, Washington) from its construction in 1825 until 1846. From there, he effectively ruled the Oregon Country, {{on behalf of the}} Hudson's Bay Company. The reverse shows an armed frontiersman {{standing in front of the}} fort.|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{administration}} {{wanted to}} expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> Gorée, left for Casamance {{in search of a}} site for a trading post. The tip of Diogue, on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted.|$|E

5|$|Chappuis {{was rescued}} by an Italian partisan, Aldo Comucci, a 21-year-old <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> {{one of the}} many {{underground}} groups operating in the area. Comucci and his band of resistance fighters got to Chappuis before the Germans and hid him and two other American flyers from the same plane for nearly three months {{until the end of the}} war. The partisans passed Chappuis and the two other Americans from house to house, and village to village, toward the Swiss frontier. Dressed in shawls — but still wearing G.I. shoes — they once walked undetected past a German sentry.|$|E
5|$|Favaloro became {{interested}} in developments in cardiovascular intervention, and developed an enthusiasm for thoracic surgery. During one visit to La Plata, he met Professor Mainetti, who pointed him {{in the direction of}} the Cleveland Clinic. Although in the beginning he had doubts about leaving his profession as a rural physician, he thought that he could make a greater contribution to the community on returning from the United States. With few resources and rudimentary English, he decided to travel to Cleveland. He first worked as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, working with Donald B. Effler, head of cardiovascular surgery, F. Mason Sones, Jr., <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the Angiography Laboratory and William L. Proudfit, head of the Department of Cardiology.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar's {{marketing}} department had allocated space on their {{stand at the}} motor show for the XJ220, but {{had not seen the}} vehicle until its arrival. Jaguar chairman John Egan and Roger Putnam, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> Jaguar's racing activities, were shown the vehicle the week before the motor show and signed off on the concept, allowing its unveiling. The car received an overwhelmingly positive reception by public and press, and a number of wealthy Jaguar enthusiasts handed over blank cheques to secure a purchase option should the XJ220 concept go into production. Ferrari's display of their F40 model at the same event was overshadowed; an estimated 90,000 additional visitors came to see the Jaguar XJ220.|$|E

5|$|Juan Larrea {{was born}} on June 24, 1782, {{in the city of}} Mataró, Catalonia. His father was Martín Ramón de Larrea, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> customs {{operations}} in Mataró, and his mother was Tomasa Espeso. He studied mathematics and navigation, and focused his education towards a career in commerce. His father died in 1793, so Larrea became the patriarch of the family. They moved to Buenos Aires, where he established a warehouse for wines, leather, and sugar. He traded with Peru, Upper Peru, Paraguay, Chile and colonial Brazil. By 1806 he was a well respected businessman, and a syndic of the Royal Consulate. He promoted the role of deputies from Buenos Aires at the Madrid court, to better the representation of the Brazilian viceroyalty and reduce the privileges of peninsular merchants.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{participated in}} the bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, flying on the Enola Gay as weaponeer and Senior Military Technical Observer. Shortly after takeoff, he clambered into the bomb bay and {{carefully}} carried out the procedure that he had rehearsed the night before. It was Parsons and not Tibbetts, the pilot, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the mission. He approved the choice of Hiroshima as the target, and gave the final approval for the bomb to be released. For his part in the mission, Parsons was awarded the Silver Star, and was promoted to the wartime rank of commodore on 10 August 1945. For {{his work on the}} Manhattan Project, he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|Reports from 1983 {{gave way}} to urban legend stating {{that as a result}} of {{overproduction}} and returns, millions of unsold cartridges were buried in an Alamogordo, New Mexico landfill. In 2013, plans were revealed to conduct an excavation to determine the accuracy of reports about the burial, and in April of the following year, the diggers confirmed that the Alamogordo burial did include E.T. cartridges among other titles. James Heller, the former Atari manager <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the original burial, was also on hand at the excavation and revealed to the Associated Press that 728,000 cartridges of various titles were buried.|$|E

5|$|Robert Anderson was {{appointed}} {{head of the}} CID on 1 September, but he went on sick leave to Switzerland on the 7th. Superintendent Thomas Arnold, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> H (Whitechapel) Division, went on leave on 2 September. Anderson's absence left overall direction of the enquiries confused, and led Chief Commissioner Sir Charles Warren to appoint Chief Inspector Donald Swanson to co-ordinate the investigation from Scotland Yard. A German hairdresser named Charles Ludwig {{was taken into custody}} on 18 September on suspicion of the murders, but he was released less than two weeks later when a double murder demonstrated that the real culprit was still at large.|$|E
5|$|He {{then did}} a ten-month {{residency}} at Melbourne Hospital to gain experience {{before going into}} practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under John Gordon and Alan Newton, both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed {{when he had to}} do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist Richard Stawell, whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the Clinical Report of the Melbourne Hospital was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} the case, Helble {{concluded}} that the United States should tell Diệm that his regime must condemn {{the actions of the}} troops and punish the culprits. If Diệm refused, the United States should threaten to publicly condemn and distance itself from Saigon. With the US also decrying the use of troops against civilian protests, the South Vietnamese government complained that unlike their Saigon counterparts, the Huế police were not trained in riot control. Diệm's authorities requested that the Americans airlift 350 military personnel from Vũng Tàu in the far south to quell the protests in Huế, but the Americans refused. William Trueheart, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the US Embassy, Saigon while Ambassador Frederick Nolting was on holiday, confronted Secretary of State Nguyễn Đình Thuận about the allegations of blister gas usage the next day. Thuận appeared to be astounded and asked Trueheart what blister gas was. Trueheart explained that the symptoms of the victims were consistent with those of mustard gas and passed on the US threat to denounce the regime for the chemical attacks.|$|E
