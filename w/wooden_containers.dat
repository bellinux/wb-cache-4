25|$|In 1950, DFDS {{was one of}} {{the first}} to {{introduce}} a door-to-door solution. Two ships were specially designed to transport small <b>wooden</b> <b>containers.</b> DFDS commenced a new service, linking Danish mainland to Greenland. This was discontinued in 1959. In 1957, Nordana Line - cargo service Gulf of Mexico-Mediterranean - began. For the first time in DFDS's history, the company played the role of cross-trader. 1964 saw the introduction of the first ro-ro passenger ferry, when M.S.

2500|$|Containerization has {{its origins}} in early coal mining regions in England {{beginning}} in the late 18th century. In 1766 James Brindley [...] designed the box boat 'Starvationer' with 10 <b>wooden</b> <b>containers,</b> to transport coal from Worsley Delph (quarry) to Manchester by Bridgewater Canal. In 1795, Benjamin Outram opened the Little Eaton Gangway, upon which coal was carried in wagons built at his Butterley Ironwork. The horse-drawn wheeled wagons on the gangway took the form of containers, which, loaded with coal, could be transshipped from canal barges on the Derby Canal, which Outram had also promoted.|$|E

2500|$|Kobold beliefs {{represent}} {{the survival of}} pagan customs into the Christian and modern eras and offer hints of how pagan Europeans worshipped {{in the privacy of}} their homes. Religion historian Otto Schrader has suggested that kobold beliefs derive from the pagan tradition of worshipping household deities thought to reside in the hearth fire. Alternatively, Nancy Arrowsmith and George Moorse have said that the earliest kobolds were thought to be tree spirits. According to 13th-century German poet Conrad of Würzburg, medieval Germans carved kobolds from boxwood and wax and put them [...] "up in the room for fun". Mandrake root was another material used. People believed that the wild kobold remained in the material used to carve the figure. These kobold effigies were 30 to 60cm (one to two feet) high and had colourful clothing and large mouths. One example, known as the monoloke, was made from white wax and wore a blue shirt and black velvet vest. The 17th century expression to laugh like a kobold may refer to these dolls with their mouths wide open, and it may mean [...] "to laugh loud and heartily". These kobold effigies were stored in glass and <b>wooden</b> <b>containers.</b> German mythologist Jacob Grimm has traced the custom to Roman times and has argued that religious authorities tolerated it even after the Germans had been Christianised.|$|E
