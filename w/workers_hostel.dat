The East coast tour was a great success and raised more money for Turangawaewae buildings. Following this she was invited to Wellington {{to take part in a}} wide range of official and social arrangements. Te Puea used the contacts she had made, especially with Māori MP Ngata to further her development of the Kingitanga base. She was able to acquire from the government a block of land near the meeting house for growing vegetables, increased pensions and a local post box. The Prime Minister also gave her a 200-acre farm, built her a house and made a gift of ₤1,000 for farm development; he also subsidised a Maori <b>workers</b> <b>hostel</b> in Tuakau. Coates said this was given in recognition of her work for Waikato orphans and the poor but also to consolidate her political support at a time when the Ratana church was becoming a major and threatening political force. Ngata gave Te Puea government loans and another 300 acre block to grow food to support the kingitanga. This farm needed a developer and an experienced Pakeha farmer paid for by the government was appointed supervisor. Ngata fired him and replaced him with Te Puea. She was given a car so she could move around the 3 farms. Her husband was given another farm at Tikitere in Rotorua. However concerns were raised in Parliament about how Ngata was operating and misusing government funds in 1934. This led to an investigation held by a royal commission that found there had been a host of irregularities involving the expenditure of ₤500,000. Labour leader Robert Semple said that the commission revealed one of the worst specimens of abuse of political power, maladministration and misappropriation of public funds. Ngata resigned.|$|E

40|$|After 1994 the new South African {{government}} {{introduced a}} hostels upgrading and conversion {{program with the}} objective of turning dormitory-type migrant <b>worker</b> <b>hostel</b> compounds into integrated “villages ” suitable for family living. Government capital subsidy and state-backed loan funding are the main financing tools. The funding regime is rigid in that it prescribes both certain minimum requirements for the housing product and the kind of household eligible for subsidy (family or person with dependents, but excluding singles). With more than 600 000 beds in public sector hostels alone, poor living conditions generally, and buildings and services often in a state of neglect, the question is whether existing policies and programmes promote the redevelopment of hostels as a sustainable form of housing for the poor in South Africa. A survey among residents of one of the larger hostels revealed that: • The majority of the residents will experience financial and other problems if they let mostly rurally-based families join them in the city. • In addition, low pay and high unemployment contribute to real fears among the residents about their ability to afford the to be upgraded accommodation, and the possibility of displacement, and even eviction as a result. • The expressed need therefore appears to be for affordable accommodation options not limited to family units, ranging from single rooms to apartments for sub-letting and sharing. It is concluded that a more flexible funding system is required to cater for the real needs of the intended beneficiaries of the upgrading program...|$|R

40|$|Unlike many {{of their}} North African and West African compatriots who reunified with family and settled in France in the 1970 s and 80 s, the {{decision}} of migrant <b>worker</b> <b>hostel</b> residents not to return definitively to places of origin at retirement is puzzling. Firstly, it {{calls into question the}} assumptions of the ‘myth of return’ literature, which explains non-return on the basis of family localisation. In the case of ‘geographically-single’ hostel residents, however, the grounds for non-return cannot be family localisation, since the men’s families remain in places of origin. Secondly, older hostel residents also remain unmoved by the financial incentives of a return homewards, where their French state pensions would have far greater purchasing power. Instead of definitive return, the overwhelming preference of hostel residents is for back-and-forth migration, between the hostel in France and communities of origin. The aim of this dissertation is to resolve this puzzle, by asking: What explains the hostel residents’ preference for back-and-forth mobility over definitive return at retirement? In order to make sense of these mobility decisions, several theories of migration are presented and evaluated against qualitative data from a multi-sited research design incorporating ethnography, life story and semi-structured interviews, and archive material. This fieldwork was carried out across France, Morocco and Senegal. Although no one theory adequately accounts for all the phenomena observed, the added value of each theory becomes most apparent when levels of analysis are kept distinct: at the household level as regards remittances; at the kinship/village level as regards re-integration in the home context; at the meso-level of ethnic communities in terms of migrants’ transnational ties; and at the macro-level of social systems concerning inclusion in healthcare and administrative organisations. Widening the focus beyond the puzzle/dilemma of late-in-life mobility, the thesis concludes by questioning what ‘home’ can mean for the retired hostel residents. An innovative way of theorising home – building on conventional conceptions of home based on territory and community – is outlined, arguing that to be ‘at home’ can also mean to be ‘included’ in different ‘social systems’. With this argument the thesis aims to contribute to broader debates on what it means for immigrants to belong and achieve inclusion in society.

The indices drawn from the objective and subjective indicators of quality of life which were adopted from Moller, Schlemmer and Du Toit's (1987) were used as the basis from which the interview schedule was drawn, and has proved useful. Reference is made in particular to questions 12, 13 and 14. Relevant construct for quality of life were found, with more usable constructs from questions 12 and 13. Furthermore the statistical analysis of the vector of the mean test scores referring to the HOT 1 has also given useful information as it enabled the student to analyse three variables independently and jointly see section 3. 3.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 335 - 348. This study {{documents}} {{the lives of}} {{children between the ages of}} 10 and 15 years who reside in migrant <b>worker</b> <b>hostels</b> in the Hottentots-Holland region of the Western Cape. It focuses on three particular aspects of the children's lives: their domestic circumstances and relationships prior to their residence in the hostels; their experiences of everyday life in the hostels; and the quality, extent, and determinants of their education over time. The children's domestic circumstances before moving to the hostels had been disrupted in the extreme. This disruption took various forms, but was caused primarily by the participation of parents and other significant adults in labour migration. Consequently, the children's histories are characterised by high levels of mobility, where children themselves have migrated, by frequent separation from parents, and by high incidences of foster-parenting. Testimony by the children indicates that they have felt this domestic disruption acutely. A further consequence of the children's residential and domestic mobility has been regular interruptions over time in their schooling. Factors such as the frequency of the children's own movement, separation from their parents, devaluative attitudes towards education by temporary foster parents, and vicissitudes in their economic circumstances have meant that most of them have progressed less than half as far at school as they should have done. This is compounded at Lwandle by the state's refusal to provide a school for hostel children, and by the inadequacy of the 'self-help' teaching which takes place there as a result. The children's everyday lives in the hostels are examined in relation to the severe limitations on space and privacy which exist there. Particular attention is granted to children's perceptions of the hostel milieu, to the difficulties which parents experience in rearing children in the hostels, to parent-child relations, and to the games and other play-activities in which the children engage. Perhaps the most prominent feature of life in the hostels which emerged during the research is the frequency with which children are exposed to acts of extreme violence. The study documents both the children's accounts of this violence, and their diagnoses of it. In conclusion, questions are raised about the future of these children and others like them. Attention is also directed towards the potential for further research into childhood by anthropology and other social sciences. The study grants primacy to children's viewpoints over and above those of their parents and other adults in the hostels, and one of its implicit objectives is to demonstrate the value to anthropology of children's insights into social life. It makes extensive use of the children's own testimony, both written and oral, and of life history material...|$|R
40|$|People leaving prison {{typically}} face numerous {{barriers to}} successful reintegration – a situation reflected by high reoffending rates {{in many countries}} throughout the world. To support people to overcome these barriers, criminal justice systems often provide some form of post-custodial supervision. Based on a multisite ethnographic study, this article provides an insight into post-custodial supervision in England and Wales. It introduces a novel theoretical framework for understanding the dynamics of supervisory relationships, which at its core distinguishes between legitimacy based on processes and legitimacy based on outcomes. While both sources of legitimacy are desirable, the former is particularly important because the latter is largely dependent upon it. In short, constructive relationships between licencees and supervisors fail to develop when processes are neglected, which, in turn, prevents probation and <b>hostel</b> <b>workers</b> from fulfilling their supervisory roles effectively...|$|R
40|$|In England & Wales, {{the number}} of people leaving prison subject to a period of {{supervision}} in the community has almost doubled in the last decade. The significant and consistent upward trend in {{the number of}} people ‘on licence’ has been accompanied by another notable trend: an increasing number of people being recalled to prison for breaching the terms and conditions of their licence. Yet, despite these two important trends, there has been a dearth of research on post-custodial supervision. This thesis explores post-custodial supervision from the perspective of those on licence. In particular, it explores licencees' perceptions of the legitimacy of probation and <b>hostel</b> <b>workers,</b> and considers how these perceptions were shaped. Understanding licencees' perceptions of the legitimacy of power holders is important, since previous research has consistently identified a relationship between people's perceptions of power holder legitimacy and their willingness to comply with rules and cooperate with those in power. Empirical fieldwork was conducted in three Approved Premises in England, including periods of observation and interviews with hostel residents and members of hostel staff. Based on this fieldwork, I identified two fundamental sources of power holder legitimacy: procedure-based and outcome-based legitimacy. Overall, I argue that licencees' perceptions of procedure-based legitimacy were pivotal, since they formed the basis of constructive relationships between licencees and power holders (e. g. probation and <b>hostel</b> <b>workers).</b> In turn, these relationships could play a significant role in helping licencees to reintegrate into their communities, thus contributing to licencees' perceptions of power holder outcome-based legitimacy. The thesis rides on a tide of legitimacy research that has already served to illuminate the fields of policing and other forms of penal sanction. While research to date has primarily utilised quantitative data to explore perceptions of legitimacy, the current research highlights the role that qualitative data can play in this regard. The thesis aims not only to increase our understanding of a neglected area of penology, but also to contribute to the development of theories of legitimacy. ...|$|R

It may be hypothesised that staff's attributions and preferred management strategies would vary according to their attitudes and whether they believed the violent person had schizophrenia. The present study examines the attributions and preferred management strategies of 59 <b>hostel</b> <b>workers</b> {{in response to a}} hypothetical vignette of a violent incident. Half of the participants were told that the individual described had schizophrenia. Agreement with attributional statements was assessed using Likert scales, and later grouped according to the internal temporary, internal enduring and external dimensions. Management strategies were grouped as punitive, talking/caring and medical. Attitudes towards homeless people and people with schizophrenia were assessed using social distance scales and the Public Attitudes Towards Homelessness Scale. The Just World Scale was also administered. Staff reported internal temporary, internal enduring and external attributions for the incident. The results indicated that staff made fewer internal enduring attributions about the behaviour of a homeless person with schizophrenia than a homeless person without a diagnosis, otherwise, they made quite similar attributions. Staff rated psychiatric strategies as more useful in managing the behaviour of a person with schizophrenia. Staff were found to have positive attitudes towards homeless people and people with schizophrenia. External attributions, positive attitudes and talking/caring management strategies were associated. The findings are discussed in the context of theories of attribution, balance and helping behaviour. They are also compared with other studies of attributions, attitudes and violence. The clinical implications of the current study are explored. Finally, directions for future research are suggested...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{reflects on}} the merits of using of photo-elicitation methodology to explore the identities of women living and working in homeless hostels. Homeless women are often marginalised as ‘vulnerable victims’ or ‘social deviants’, characterised by social and personal issues such as mental health, domestic abuse, drug and alcohol use, financial issues, forced marriage or family breakdown. There is little research on women’s <b>hostel</b> <b>worker</b> identities beyond how they address the support needs of residents. The identities of hostel residents and support workers are therefore often positioned in terms of problems and supporting people to overcome problems in ‘total institution’ and ‘charity work’ roles. Photo-elicitation enables participants to purposefully visually represent and verbalise aspects of their identities. It will be argued that the method therefore offers active participation and choice in self-representation, and may contribute a greater understanding of identities and dynamics in women’s homeless hostels. Photo-elicitation methodology involves semi-structured interviews using photographs as a discussion tool. It has a number of advantages in that it has been shown to give personal control and is therefore legitimising, empowering and participatory, and can engage hard to reach participants. In this study, photo-elicitation interviews were embedded into an ethnographic study of women’s hostels in the UK. Participants were given disposable cameras and asked to take photographs that show something about themselves, which were then discussed in interviews. This paper will discuss the merits of using the photo-elicitation method in the context of research with women in homeless hostels. It will highlight how photo- elicitation interviews reduced the inherent power imbalance between the psychology researcher and participants by empowering the participant gaze and discuss personal reflections on the visual data they produced. It will be argued that this method contributed to gaining richer and more personal constructions of identity than may have emerged through more traditional research approaches...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{severity}} of psychiatric symptoms among residents of hostels for homeless people. DESIGN [...] Survey of residents in two hostels in Oxford, comprising three weeks of background fieldwork, a demographic questionnaire, and rating behaviour over two weeks with a behavioural rating scale (REHAB) and mental state with the brief psychiatric rating scale. SETTING [...] Two hostels for homeless people in Oxford. SUBJECTS [...] 146 Medium to long term residents, of whom 48 were selected by <b>hostel</b> <b>workers</b> by the following criteria: continuous residence {{for at least two}} months, signs of persistent severe mental disability, and difficulty in coping independently in the community. Two subjects died during the study; three (previously long term psychiatric inpatients) declined to be assessed on the psychiatric scale. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Behavioural disturbance and mental state. RESULTS [...] Only a third of the total sample had been born in Oxfordshire. Subjects had been accepted into the hostel either by arrangement with the local psychiatric service (22) or straight off the streets (26); 43 had had a previous (non-drug related) psychiatric admission. Subjects were significantly more likely than other residents to have spent longer (greater than 80 weeks) in a hostel {{in the past three years}} (p less than 0. 02). With reference to norms for deviant behaviour, the 46 subjects assessed showed considerable deviant behaviour (average weekly scores: 0 (11 subjects), 1 (14), 2 - 3 (16), and greater than or equal to 4 (5] not significantly different from that expected in moderately to severely handicapped psychiatric inpatients (chi 2 = 1. 3, df = 3, p greater than 0. 7); 22 had scores equivalent to those in most severely handicapped inpatients. Of the 43 subjects assessed with the psychiatric rating scale, 16 had symptoms of neurosis, 29 of florid psychosis, and 32 of a deficit state. Symptoms of deficit state were positively correlated with ratings of low social activity on the behavioural scale (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0. 30, p = 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS [...] Hostels are having to care for long term severely affected psychiatric patients discharged into the community. The suitability of the services offered to such subjects should be assessed...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} U. S. {{military presence in}} World War II-era China, Americans’ first attempt to forge a nominally equal military alliance with a non-Western nation. Drawing on overlooked Chinese and English-language sources from archives in six countries, it recasts how we view that relationship. Other studies attribute the wartime deterioration of Chinese-American relations to the contentious relationship between Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek and U. S. General Joseph Stilwell, or to conflicting wartime and postwar strategic aims. This study, by contrast, shows how the success and failures of the alliance turned upon {{the actions of a}} far larger cast of characters: GIs and Chinese soldiers, ordinary civilians, interpreters, <b>hostel</b> <b>workers,</b> farmers, prostitutes, thieves, bandits, and smugglers. It argues that the power asymmetries between these various actors permeated all levels of Sino-American interaction, undermining the Guomindang government, stoking American feelings of superiority, exacerbating Chinese sensitivities about unequal treatment, and making these allies into adversaries even after Stilwell left China but also long before Cold War animosities solidified. A military occupation, friendly or otherwise, required a daunting set of arrangements that are rarely examined in detail. Beginning in 1941, as some 70, 000 U. S. troops trickled into China, American commanders and their Chinese hosts set about solving knotty problems of alliance management related to providing food, lodging, and interpreters. Interactions between GIs and Chinese civilians nevertheless proved fraught, particularly in relation to issues of money, legal privileges, cultural norms, and sex. As theft, misconduct, and violent encounters snowballed, military-to-military relations also deteriorated. From Chinese perspectives, the alliance became an occupation. From American perspectives, the Chinese became impediments—rather than partners. The wartime alliance marked a key turning point in how the United States projected power around the world as well as a seminal moment for modern Chinese perceptions of Americans. After Japan’s surrender, Chinese Communists would exploit local resentment against American servicemen to attack the Chinese Nationalists and seize and consolidate power. Meanwhile, the U. S. military’s legal, cultural, economic, political, and sexual impact on China set recurring patterns of American military behavior that have complicated U. S. policy down to the present day. 2018 - 12 - 03 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{homeless}} peoples' views and experiences of a specialist physiotherapy service for homeless people in Glasgow, Scotland. RELEVANCE: Evidence suggests that homelessness increases the risk of poor health and makes access to appropriate healthcare difficult. Benefits of specialist health services for homeless people have been identified and can improve access to appropriate healthcare. In Glasgow, a specialist physiotherapy service has existed since 1996. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiotherapy service from the perspective of homeless people. This would allow for the development of a service which is responsive to the needs of the population it serves. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of convenience of twelve homeless people (11 males, 1 female, mean age: 47 ± 13. 6 years) was recruited from a homeless drop-in centre in Glasgow. METHODS: Ethical approval to carry out this study was granted from Greater Glasgow Primary Care NHS Trust ethics committee. Using a qualitative approach, 1 -hour semi-structured interviews and a focus group were conducted with 12 homeless people. Five participants had experience of the specialist physiotherapy service, 7 had not. Interviews were conducted within a private room, were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. ANALYSIS: Using an interpretive phenomenological approach to data analysis, recurrent themes were identified from interview transcripts. Member checking of identified themes was undertaken. RESULTS: The findings revealed that participants who had used the physiotherapy service were positive about this and valued the one-to-one contact they had with their physiotherapist. The fact that the physiotherapist came to them in their hostel or at a drop-in clinic meant that it was easily accessible. Despite the availability of direct access to the service none of the participants had initiated a self-referral and instead relied on a support or <b>hostel</b> <b>worker</b> for this. Participants felt that physiotherapy was for people who had sustained serious injuries, such as car accidents or for people with sports injuries. As a result physiotherapy was not felt to be relevant to them and their problems. While good health was valued, poor health was often tolerated as an expected consequence of homelessness. CONCLUSIONS: Homeless people in this study were positive about their experiences of the specialist physiotherapy service. However there was limited awareness of what physiotherapy might offer and this could reduce participants' self-referring to the physiotherapy service. A strength of this study was that it allowed individuals to voice their opinions of the physiotherapy service. A weakness is that the sample comprised of self-selecting participants. Further research on how to support homeless people to access physiotherapy services is needed. IMPLICATIONS: The study revealed a need to raise awareness about physiotherapy and the services available amongst homeless people and those who work closely with them. Homeless people experience difficulties accessing appropriate and timely healthcare and may require support to do so...|$|R
