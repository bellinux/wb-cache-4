40|$|When {{choosing}} {{and applying}} the award criteria {{in the context}} of public procurement procedures, contracting authorities exercise their discretionary powers with a view to selecting the most economically advantageous tender. The importance of the use that contracting authorities make of their margin of discretion {{is directly related to the}} result of any public procurement procedure: the level of satisfaction of the contracting authorities’ needs provided by the works/supply/service contract concluded with the <b>winning</b> <b>tenderer.</b> Despite the tendency for public procurement regulation to focus on procedural rules (‘how to buy’), rather than the actual outcome of the procurement activity itself (‘what to buy’), there are substantive requirements derived from legislative sources, as well as soft law and jurisprudence, that somehow structure the contracting authorities’ decision making freedom. Although there is no standard unit that allows for the measurement of contracting authorities’ margin of discretion and its variation, this thesis aims to identify factors which contribute either to increase or to reduce the said margin. In other words, it is proposed to highlight the elements which determine the expansion or the limitation of the referred discretionary powers. The thesis concludes that despite the different national regulatory approaches to this topic under the common EU legal framework, the practice in the Member States covered by this thesis seems to indicate that contracting authorities exercise their discretionary powers in a (unknowingly) similar way...|$|E

40|$|Since 1994, the Public Procurement Act has {{undergone}} changes aimed {{to improve the}} procurement process and promoting innovation. In order to promote innovation {{there are a number}} of government agencies that offer financial assistance, especially to small business with innovative ideas. Despite these efforts, newly established small businesses have difficulties entering the market. The study investigates whether changes have been made in the public procurement of medical devices with regard to price and quality prioritization. The priority criteria is presented by the contracting authority as percentage in the allocation criteria. The study is limited to in vitro diagnostic products contracting in Swedish healthcare between the years 2009 and 2015. All tenders, companies that apply for participation in procurement, were analyzed based on sales, number of employees and year of establishment with the purpose of evaluating differences between <b>winning</b> <b>tenders</b> and other tenders. The result shows that prioritization has been increasingly on price rather than the quality. Regarding the <b>winning</b> <b>tenders</b> the study shows that larger, more established companies dominates the market. Noteworthy is that this dominance has increased over theses last years. The increase may be due to a spiral effect that is created when <b>winning</b> <b>tenders</b> get an increased economic power. ...|$|R
