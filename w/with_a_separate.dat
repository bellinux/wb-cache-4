5|$|In {{areas where}} there was a high {{interest}} in air cadets, additional squadrons were established with different parade nights to accommodate the numbers. These squadrons were often placed into air cadet wings (a formation of two or more squadrons) <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> wing HQ staff of both officers and senior cadets overseeing the operation. The system was discontinued in the late 1960s and all squadrons became independent once again.|$|E

5|$|The {{continued}} growth of long-distance railway traffic {{led to a}} major expansion along the station's west side starting in 1887. The work involved rerouting Cardington Street over a burial ground; to avoid public outcry, the graves were re-interred at St Pancras Cemetery. Two extra platforms (Nos.4–5) opened in 1891, and four further departure platforms (now Nos.12–15) opened on 1 July 1892, bringing the total to fifteen, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> booking office on Drummond Street.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Grace {{holds the}} record for being the {{farthest}} northeast forming tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin. The seventh named storm of the slightly below average 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, Grace formed from an extratropical cyclone over the Azores on October4. It strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 65mph (100km/h) and developed an eye-like feature, although cold sea surface temperatures inhibited the development of thunderstorm activity near the center.

5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven black silk <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> heavy red silk fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E
5|$|As the {{prospect}} of war with Japan became more likely, so also did {{the need to make}} appropriate arrangements for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack had recommended that in the event of war, the Military Board be abolished and its powers vested in a Commander-in-chief. In April 1941, the Minister for the Army, Percy Spender, recommended that this now be done, with Sturdee becoming Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or Army Council as it was called there) continued to operate, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> GOC Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General Sir Iven Mackay was appointed to this newly created post. However, the idea of a Commander in Chief did not go away and editorials in the Sunday Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald advocated the appointment.|$|E
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of Banksia paludosa are {{endemic to}} New South Wales. The nominate subspecies paludosa is found from Glen Davis {{through to the}} Sydney region and then south to Ulladulla on the South Coast, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> population {{in the vicinity of}} Eden just north of the Victorian border. It occurs inland as far as Taralga on the Southern Tablelands. It was collected in 1966 from Hat Head on the Mid North Coast by Lawrie Johnson, but has not been found there since despite field work in the area. This record aside, the northernmost historical coastal record is from what is now Centennial Park and La Perouse in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where it is now locally vanished. Subspecies astrolux is restricted to Nattai National Park in the Southern Highlands.|$|E

5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). The house, an altered 14th century monastic complex, was rented {{by a friend}} of the Dudleys and {{possible}} relative of Amy's, Sir Anthony Forster. He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, relations of the house's owner. Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.|$|E
5|$|Inside of his chansons, {{he often}} used a cantus firmus, {{sometimes}} a popular song whose origin {{can no longer}} be traced, as in Si j'avoye Marion. Other times he used a tune originally associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> text; and still other times he freely composed an entire song, using no apparent external source material. Another technique he sometimes used was to take a popular song and write it as a canon with itself, in two inner voices, and write new melodic material above and around it, to a new text: he used this technique in one of his most famous chansons, Faulte d'argent ("The problem with money"), a song sung by a man who wakes in bed with a prostitute, broke and unable to pay her.|$|E

5|$|On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard {{joined the}} strike, under the {{leadership}} of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes).

In 2005, Brown was arrested and charged <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> kidnapping in the United States. He was demoted and involuntarily retired from the military in 2006 and at his trial in 2009 entered an Alford plea, receiving probation on the felony conviction.|$|E
5|$|Passage through Hull {{had long}} been difficult, {{because of the number}} of ships which used the river for loading and {{unloading}} goods. In 1794, the merchants of Beverley had advocated the building of docks at Hull, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> entrance, so that traffic to the upper river would not be impeded, while the Driffield Navigation had unsuccessful attempted to get a clause inserted into the Act of Parliament which the Hull Dock Company obtained in 1840, to ensure free passage for vessels, and the removal of tolls for boats not using the docks. The Navigation Company also received complaints from the Beverley and Barmston Drainage Commissioners, who believed that water levels were being kept at a higher level than was good for drainage.|$|E

5|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} sparse {{through most of}} the life of the railway. In 1905, three trains per day ran from Goole to Haxey Junction and back, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> train {{operating}} on the Fockerby Branch. By November, only the morning and evening train ran, except on Wednesdays. A coal strike in 1912 resulted in all services being withdrawn except on Wednesdays and Saturdays for a period of three weeks. At a public meeting held in October 1920, users complained about the poor service and the lack of trucks to carry goods. The chairman of the Isle of Axholme Rural District Council was particularly exasperated by the fact that the trains arrived at Haxey Junction shortly after the trains on the other line had departed.|$|E
5|$|Presented with a jewelled brooch as a {{farewell}} gift by her fellow officers, Stevenson asked that its value instead be put towards a scholarship for an ex-WAAAF member to study social {{work at the}} University of Sydney.

It was succeeded in 1950 by a new organisation <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> charter to the RAAF, the Women's Royal Australian Air Force (WRAAF). WRAAF members achieved a pay scale equal to the male service in 1972, and five years later were integrated with the RAAF.|$|E
5|$|Several {{designs for}} new castles emerged that made keeps unnecessary. One such design was the {{concentric}} approach, involving exterior walls guarded with towers, and perhaps supported by further, concentric layered defenses: thus castles such as Framlingham {{never had a}} central keep. Military factors may well have driven this development: R. Brown, for example, suggests that designs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> keep and bailey system inherently lacked a co-ordinated and combined defensive system, and that once bailey walls were sophisticated enough, a keep became militarily unnecessary. In England, gatehouses were also growing in size and sophistication until they too challenged {{the need for a}} keep in the same castle. The classic Edwardian gatehouse, with two large, flanking towers and multiple portcullises, designed to be defended from attacks both within and outside the main castle, has been often compared to the earlier Norman keeps: some of the largest gatehouses are called gatehouse keeps for this reason.|$|E
