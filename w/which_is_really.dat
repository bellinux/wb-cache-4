25|$|Sea ice {{serves to}} {{stabilise}} methane deposits on {{and near the}} shoreline, preventing the clathrate breaking down and venting into the water column and eventually reaching the atmosphere. From sonar measurements in recent years researchers quantified the density of bubbles emanating from the subsea permafrost into the Ocean (a process called ebullition), and found that 100–630mg methane per square meters is emitted daily along the East Siberian Shelf, into the water column. They also found that during storms, methane levels {{in the water column}} drop dramatically, when wind-driven air-sea gas exchange accelerates the ebullition process into the atmosphere. This observed pathway suggests that methane from seabed permafrost will progress rather slowly, instead of abrupt changes. However, Arctic cyclones, fueled by global warming and further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could contribute to more release from this methane cache, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> important for the Arctic. An update to the mechanisms of this permafrost degradation, implying the possibility of being close to an acceleration of methane release was published in 2017.|$|E

And that’s the beauty of Nick and Dot." [...] Concurring with this sentiment, John Altman (Nick) agreed: [...] "No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him.

500|$|... "Rebel Heart" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Pettifer wrote: [...] "The last {{song on the}} album feels like the first to properly spring into aural life in an unapologetically major key [...] The song relates the story of its singer— who she was and how she became who she is– <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> the record's underlying conceit". Pettifer also wrote that the lyrics were [...] "more auto-biographical and therefore more interesting". Bradley Stern, an editor and publisher for MuuMuse, also praised the song's autobiographical lyrics; [...] "The message is sincere, vulnerable and undoubtedly true to Madonna’s story, the music is strong and that chorus is utterly anthemic. Madonna hasn’t had a truly rich, singer-songwriter, sing-along friendly record in a while— maybe since Music?— so it's kind of unbelievable to hear such a strong melody from the Queen again". He called it [...] "one of her best songs in a long time". Stern preferred the leaked demo over the final original version.|$|E

[...] The song was written in 1990, and had been performed live several times, including at Lollapalooza, before it had been recorded in a studio. The album version mentions then-Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates and the black motorist Rodney King, whose beating by LAPD officers was recorded on videotape. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that the song [...] " [...] a warning, not a threat—to authority that says, 'Yo, police: We're human beings. Treat us accordingly.'" [...] In an interview for Rolling Stone, Ice-T stated that [...] "We just celebrated the fourth of July, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> just national Fuck the Police Day [...] I bet that during the Revolutionary War, there were songs similar to mine." ...|$|E

[...] They brought out [...] "a really unique character" [...] in all the songs. During the recording, guitarist Ed Reyes used Orange and Burman amplifiers. Most of his guitar tracks were recorded with an Epiphone Casino guitar, and he also used an Epiphone Crestwood guitar. Frequently using a tape delay effect, Reyes did not use distortion pedals since the Orange amp [...] "had a perfect gain sound in itself." [...] Mascherino used his Gibson SG Special guitar during recording, which he said had [...] "an amazing sound <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> warm and gives me my own sound." [...] He channeled it through a Marshall JCM800 amplifier, and also used a Gibson Firebird guitar when the group needed [...] "a really tight sound." [...] The drums were recorded in three days.

Ethan and Kurt encourage her to return to her family and think about trying to make an artistic name for herself when she is older. As Marge arrives to take Lisa home, Ethan and Kurt show off a mural that they have painted in her honor, which takes up an entire side of a building.|$|E
500|$|West {{collaborated with}} American film score {{composer}} Jon Brion, {{who served as}} the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. West had been exposed to Brion's work while watching the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, for which Brion had composed music. West was also listening to songs Brion had produced for When the Pawn..., the second studio album of alternative singer-songwriter Fiona Apple, another one of West's favorite musicians and sources of musical inspiration for the album. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. When questioned if his presence made Late Registration any less hip-hop, Brion replied, [...] "There are colors and ideas that make [...] different from average hip-hop, but Kanye is already different from the average hip-hop guy. He's got this sense of pop record-making <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> solid, and he likes tracks with {{a lot of things going}} on in them — which is not necessarily common for hip-hop. He was already barking up that tree. This is definitely not just a hip-hop album. But it is also by no means overtly arty, or non-hip-hop. I don't think it's a weird record by any means." ...|$|E

With Colonel Brandon being a stronger character, his costumes were halfway between the two. His clothes were designed {{to be out of}} date and firm, using more heathers instead of the rural colours. The production had an emphasis on youth and passion, which Clapton incorporated into her work. The designer said, [...] "Ten years ago, female characters in 19th-century dramas would all have their hair done in very precise ringlets, all neat and perfect just like in the portraits. Now we're trying to achieve a more believable, natural look, especially when the Dashwoods are at home." [...] She added that the director had wanted the characters to [...] "feel more human." [...] Morrissey commented that the period costumes were [...] "slightly uncomfortable" [...] for modern life, {{but as soon as the}} cast were riding horses or walking across fields, they realised why they were made that way. He added, [...] "When you're dancing, they're quite restrictive, but that's quite good for posture – posture was different then, and that's important. But they give you a feel for the character <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> an advantage to you as an actor." ...|$|E

Recording sessions began in October 2001 and initially {{she intended to}} record in Chicago, Illinois, but those plans were later abandoned. Although each session had individual engineers, Auf der Maur and Chris Goss were primary producers of the project. Auf der Maur also financed the recording sessions herself, as she was not signed to a record label at the time. She also self-financed the sessions to [...] "secure creative control" [...] as she [...] "wanted the foundation of it to be really pure." [...] Describing the recording process, Auf der Maur said: [...] "The L.A. section of the record is the prettier, more ethereal stuff [...] the dark, rock stuff actually –– <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> my main route and the muscle of the record –– was recorded in Canada. And then in Chicago we're recording some songs with James and Chris that are more mid-dissonant pop –– mid-tempo, mid-volume." ...|$|E
500|$|Ralph Fiennes {{was cast}} as Gareth Mallory, a former {{lieutenant}} {{colonel in the}} British Army and now {{the chairman of the}} Intelligence and Security Committee, which gives him the authority to regulate MI6. At the end of the film, Mallory becomes the head of MI6, assuming the title of M. During production, Fiennes stated that he could not say anything specific about the role other than that it was a [...] "really interesting part <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> quite fun". To play the returning character of Miss Moneypenny, Naomie Harris was cast. Harris' role was initially presented as that of Eve, an MI6 field agent who works closely with Bond. Despite ongoing speculation in the media that Harris had been cast as Miss Moneypenny, this was not confirmed by anyone involved in production of the film, with Harris herself even {{going so far as to}} dismiss claims that Eve was in fact Moneypenny, stating that [...] "Eve is not remotely office-bound". According to Harris, Eve [...] " [...] she is Bond's equal, but she is really his junior". Another character returning to the series was Q, played by Ben Whishaw. Mendes had initially declined to confirm which part Whishaw would play, and later said the idea of the re-introduction was his, saying [...] "I offered ideas about Moneypenny, Q and a flamboyant villain and they said yes". To play the part of Kincade, Mendes cast Albert Finney. The producers briefly considered approaching Sean Connery to play the role in a nod to the 50th anniversary of the film series, but elected not to as they felt Connery's presence would be seen as stunt casting and disengage audiences from the film.|$|E

In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, Walsh said, [...] "This is about people reducing the hostility around the topic, and getting the articles back to a state where they make sense. I think the arbitration committee wants to send the message that Wikipedians have to be neutral on all accounts and all fronts. They don't take these situations lightly.

[...] When asked by Ross Reynolds of National Public Radio affiliate KUOW-FM why the Arbitration decision included a [...] "ban on IP addresses at the Church of Scientology", Walsh answered, [...] "So the simple answer is that within looking at these computers and where these edits were coming from, the decision is that ultimately most of the edits within these ranges have been from single-user-accounts, people who have a single intention to change or move or in some cases remove information, which could be considered censorship, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> something that doesn't work out well on Wikipedia.
