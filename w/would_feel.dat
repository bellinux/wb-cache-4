5|$|As The World Ends with You {{focuses on}} the {{character}} of Neku Sakuraba, {{in order to create a}} believable story the developers put a lot of focus on his development, such as how he <b>would</b> <b>feel,</b> what thoughts lie behind his actions, how he interacted with other characters, and how the people around him feel about him. The developers included aspects and daily concerns, hoping that they could be things that players would have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.|$|E
5|$|In Mario Kart DS, a kart is able {{to draft}} behind another kart to gain a speed boost momentarily, a feature that was also {{previously}} used in the 1996 video game Mario Kart 64. Mario Kart DS places a stronger focus on the feature and once again provides a visual cue when a kart is drafting. In an interview, Konno notes that they included tracks from previous Mario Kart games into Mario Kart DS so that players who played the original Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> {{more familiar with the}} DS iteration of the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Ryō as a cross-dressing idol has been praised by one reviewer who {{called him the}} cutest out of the three playable idols because of both his appearance and his personality. Miyokawa suggested that Ryō may have been created to lessen any sense of awkwardness that male players <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> from playing as female idols, but upon playing his scenario, Miyokawa noted that the player is naturally {{able to get into}} the story, in part due to the comical events surrounding Ryō's story that deal with him cross-dressing.|$|E

5|$|To {{demonstrate}} Henry's immortality, Miller {{decided that}} Henry would die and <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> the pain {{every time he}} died. Anything on Henry's body would disappear with his body during each death. Miller felt that Henry's naked rebirth in water would be an interesting {{way to keep the}} show's protagonist alive during the series by completing the death and rebirth process; the nakedness would create several comedic moments within the series. Miller intended to use Henry's death and rebirth process sporadically after the first two episodes so that the series would focus on Henry's long life.|$|E
5|$|To {{develop the}} game's overall aesthetic, the main {{aim was to}} create designs that would combine comic book style with realism. The {{environmental}} architecture and characters had to be extravagant enough to represent the Batman universe, but needed realistic texture and detail. The second aim was to recreate the dark, Gothic imagery inherent to the Batman universe, especially Arkham Asylum, so that the structure <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> as insane as those whom it houses. The asylum was considered an ideal location because it can house many of Batman's foes.|$|E
5|$|Under a 2007 {{agreement}} with Malaysia Airlines, Tzu Chi—an international Buddhist organisation—immediately sent specially trained teams to Beijing and Malaysia to give emotional support to passengers' families. The airline also sent its own team of caregivers and volunteers {{and agreed to}} bear the expense of bringing {{family members of the}} passengers to Kuala Lumpur and providing them with accommodation, medical care, and counselling. Altogether, 115 family members of the Chinese passengers flew to Kuala Lumpur. Some other family members chose to remain in China, fearing they <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> too isolated in Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|Bohr's {{evidence}} {{came from}} an interpretation of a letter he received from a Soviet friend and scientist in Russia, which he showed to the British security services. He reasoned that the longer the United States and Britain hid their nuclear advancements, Russia <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> increasingly threatened and more inclined to speed up their effort to produce an atomic bomb of their own. With the help of U.S. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, Bohr met with the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was initially sympathetic to his ideas about controlling nuclear weapons on 26 August 1944; but Churchill was adamantly opposed to informing the Soviet Union of such work. At the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944, Roosevelt sided with Churchill, deciding {{that it would be}} upon the nation's best interest to keep the atomic bomb project a secret. Moreover, they decided Bohr was potentially dangerous and specific security measures must be made in order to prevent him from leaking information {{to the rest of the}} world, Russia in particular.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary because he thought it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E
5|$|Erin Ryan and {{her colleagues}} {{performed}} a 2009 study {{on the effect of}} the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in Blue's Clues episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.|$|E

5|$|The Nizam {{was also}} beset by the Telangana Rebellion, led by communists, {{which started in}} 1946 as a peasant revolt against feudal elements; and one which the Nizam {{was not able to}} subjugate. The {{situation}} deteriorated further in 1948. The Razakars ("volunteers"), a militia affiliated to the Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen and set up under the influence of Muslim radical Qasim Razvi, assumed the role of supporting the Muslim ruling class against upsurges by the Hindu populace, and began intensifying its activities and was accused of attempting to intimidate villages. The Hyderabad State Congress Party, affiliated to the Indian National Congress, launched a political agitation. Matters were made worse by communist groups, which had originally supported the Congress but now switched sides and began attacking Congress groups. Attempts by Mountbatten to find a negotiated solution failed and, in August, the Nizam, claiming that he feared an imminent invasion, attempted to approach the UN Security Council and the International Court of Justice. Patel now insisted that if Hyderabad was allowed to continue its independence, the prestige of the Government would be tarnished and then neither Hindus nor Muslims <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> secure in its realm.|$|E
5|$|However, {{although}} the spectators {{would now be}} able to see the players at night, they still suffered from the problem of obstructed views caused by the pillars that supported the roofs. With the 1966 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, this prompted the United directors to completely redesign the United Road (north) stand. The old roof pillars were replaced in 1965 with modern-style cantilevering on top of the roof, allowing every spectator a completely unobstructed view, while it was also expanded to hold 20,000 spectators (10,000 seated and 10,000 standing in front) at a cost of £350,000. The architects of the new stand, Mather and Nutter (now Atherden Fuller), rearranged the organisation of the stand to have terracing at the front, a larger seated area towards the back, and the first private boxes at a British football ground. The east stand – the only remaining uncovered stand – was developed in the same style in 1973. With the first two stands converted to cantilevers, the club's owners devised a long-term plan to do the same to the other two stands and convert the stadium into a bowl-like arena. Such an undertaking would serve to increase the atmosphere within the ground by containing the crowd's noise and focusing it onto the pitch, where the players <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> the full effects of a capacity crowd. Meanwhile, the stadium hosted its third FA Cup Final, hosting 62,078 spectators for the replay of the 1970 final between Chelsea and Leeds United; Chelsea won the match 2–1. The ground also hosted the second leg of the 1968 Intercontinental Cup, which saw Estudiantes de La Plata win the cup after a 1–1 draw. The 1970s saw the dramatic rise of football hooliganism in Britain, and a knife-throwing incident in 1971 forcing the club to erect the country's first perimeter fence, restricting fans from the Old Trafford pitch.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes has {{sex with}} Dr. Paul Browning (Joe Thompson), who assumes {{she is a}} prostitute and pays her afterwards. Mercedes becomes a cleaner in a {{hospital}} along with Lynsey. Mercedes meets Doctor Browning {{at the hospital and}} he asks to keep seeing and paying Mercedes, which she agrees to. Mercedes convinces Lynsey to help a patient who is DNR. Lynsey is blamed for the incident and Mercedes discovers Doctor Browning had not put the patient's DNR request into their file. Mercedes discovers Doctor Browning is married and threatens him, telling him she will tell his wife of their relationship should he report Lynsey. Mercedes joins an escorting website. She is contacted by a client and arranges to meet him at a hotel. Lynsey finds Mercedes and stops her going ahead with it. Mercedes becomes depressed and Jacqui meets Riley, telling him if Mercedes were to see Bobby then she <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> better. Riley later arrives back in Hollyoaks asking Mercedes to sign legal documents so he will have full custody of Bobby. Mercedes and Riley agree to attend mediation, but Mercedes does not turn up as she gets drunk. Mercedes sees an online news article showing a picture of Riley and Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) together and considers running away with Bobby, but instead attends Bobby's christening service and slaps Mitzeee. She witnesses Riley and Mitzeee kissing in the car park and later confronts them. Mercedes begins stalking Mitzeee who leaves the village temporarily. Mercedes learns Silas will not be put to trial and will be put in an institute for the insane. Mercedes tells people she is fine but begins having nightmares of her time imprisoned by Silas.
