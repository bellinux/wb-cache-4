5|$|The Pandharpur image, {{when not}} clothed by its {{attendant}} priest to receive devotees, provides Vithoba with the detailed features distinctive {{of a male}} body, visible in full relief. However, close inspection of the stonework reveals {{the outline of a}} loincloth, supported by a kambarband (<b>waist</b> <b>belt),</b> traced by thin, light carvings. Other images and pictures depict Vithoba clothed, usually with pitambara – a yellow dhoti and various gold ornaments—the manner in which he is attired by the priests in the daily rites.|$|E
5|$|For {{protection}} and preservation, a polished Japanese sword needs a scabbard. A fully mounted scabbard (koshirae) may {{consist of a}} lacquered body, a taped hilt, a sword guard (tsuba) and decorative metal fittings. Though the original purpose was to protect a sword from damage, from early times on Japanese sword mountings became a status symbol and were used to add dignity. Starting in the Heian period, a sharp distinction was made between swords designed for use in battle and those for ceremonial use. Tachi long swords were worn edge down suspended by two cords or chains from the <b>waist</b> <b>belt.</b> The cords were attached to two eyelets on the scabbard.|$|E
5|$|Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is {{generally}} depicted standing. He wears rich clothes (generally in sculpture, only a dhoti) {{as well as}} various ornaments like a crown, armbands, necklaces etc., symbolic of royalty and the yagnopavita (sacred thread). In his eight arms, he is prescribed in the texts to carry gada (mace), sword, arrow and the Sudarshana Chakra in his left hands and shankha (conch), shield, bow and lotus in his right hands. However, in sculpture, he is often four-armed and in two of his hands, he holds a lotus and a conch, while his other hands rest on the heads of his personified weapons (ayudhapurusha) - Gadadevi or Gadanari (gada as a female) on his right and Chakrapurusha on his left, who stand as small figures besides his legs. They both look upwards towards him and hold fly whisks. A tiny figurine of the earth goddess Prithvi (who associated with Varaha and Vishnu as his consort) rises from the pedestal in between his feet, as though supporting the deity. A short dagger or sword may be tucked up in the <b>waist</b> <b>belt</b> of the god near the right hip, a peculiar feature of Kashmir icons. Attendants or devotees may be also shown besides or below Vishnu. Sometimes, Brahma and Shiva and the ten avatars of Vishnu may be depicted in the background.|$|E

25|$|Service uniform (Dienstuniform) – The summer service uniform for {{officers}} was a bloused jacket, {{called a}} Hemdbluse, worn without a shirt, trousers, and a visored service cap. The winter service uniform featured a tunic with four large buttoned-down patch pockets, a black <b>waist</b> <b>belt,</b> the service cap, breeches, shirt, tie, and pants belt; high boots were reserved for officers and NCOs. A long, heavy, belted greatcoat was {{also part of}} the winter uniform.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1960s, {{the band}} wore a {{modified}} version of the full uniform on away trips. The modified uniform was also worn when the band was in concert. This consisted of the band hat without plume and a white <b>waist</b> <b>belt</b> was worn instead of cross belts. The band also wore a red citation cord on the left shoulder. As more away trips were taken, the band found it necessary to create a separate travel uniform which allowed the regular uniform to stay clean and pressed. Band students wear a black blazer with a patch of the OSUMB crest on the left brest pocket, white dress shirt, red OSUMB tie, gray pants, and black shoes. While not technically allowed, many band members can be seen wearing their band hats on away trips using air travel, as the hats cannot be placed in the luggage bays for fear of breaking. Band students often collect pins at various functions they attend, which they then wear on the Blazer uniform.|$|E
25|$|Close combat troops, {{infantry}} and cavalry, {{made use of}} a spear, of varying length, usually {{referred to as a}} kontarion. Specialist infantry called menavlatoi used a heavy-shafted weapon called the menavlion the precise nature of which is uncertain; they are mentioned in the earlier Sylloge Tacticorum but may still have been extant. Swords were of two types: the spathion which was straight and double edged and differed only in details of the hilt from the typical ‘sword of war’ found in Western Europe, and the paramērion which {{appears to have been a}} form of single-edged, perhaps slightly curved, sabre. Most Byzantine soldiers would have worn swords as secondary weapons, usually suspended from a baldric rather than a <b>waist</b> <b>belt.</b> Heavy cavalry are described (in slightly earlier writings) as being doubly equipped with both the spathion and paramērion. Some missile-armed skirmish infantry used a relatively light axe (tzikourion) as a secondary weapon, whilst the Varangians were known as the “Axe-bearing Guard” because of their use of the double-handed Danish axe. The rhomphaia a long-bladed, cleaver-like, weapon was carried by guardsmen in close attendance on the emperor. Heavy cavalry made use of maces. Byzantine maces were given a variety of names including: mantzoukion, apelatikion and siderorabdion, suggesting that the weapons themselves were of varied construction.|$|E
25|$|Jewellery {{making in}} the Pacific started later than in other areas because of recent human settlement. Early Pacific {{jewellery}} was made of bone, wood, and other natural materials, and thus has not survived.

5000|$|Until the late-1930s, the United States Army’s field uniform {{consisted}} of a wool shirt, mid-hip-length [...] "all-purpose service coat" [...] and wool overcoat.

Little changed since World War I, it featured notched lapels and five metal buttons from its open collar to its <b>belted</b> <b>waist.</b> Made of heavy wool serge, it touted two flapped and button-through patch pockets at the breast and two identically styled patch pockets below its <b>belted</b> <b>waist</b> - its four pockets either box-pleated or bellows-styled-pleats.|$|R
25|$|In {{collecting}} his testimony, Kennedy realised {{that women}} were being treated as badly as children and widened his scope to include them as well. Kennedy visited the area of Little Lever and interviewed several women and children working in the pits. The women lived in Outwood and were employed by Thomas Fletcher. Fletcher owned both Ladyshore and Outwood Collieries and the women moved from one pit to another {{depending on how much}} coal was being produced. Their testimonies showed that children as young as 5 or 6 were working in the pits. Married and mothers, Betty Wardle and Mary Hardman gave damning testimony to conditions underground. Wardle told Kennedy she started work at the age of 6 whilst Hardman said she started at the age of 7. Wardle later described how she was employed to 'draw with belt and chain'; that is pull the tubs along the underground rails by means of a leather <b>waist</b> <b>belt</b> to the back of which was attached a chain to the tub, used where the tunnels were too small for the use of ponies, (ponies were not used at Outwood, so this must refer to Ladyshore). She then went on to tell Kennedy that she was forced to work whilst pregnant and that she had one child of her four in the mine, the work had brought on labour and the newborn was carried out of the mine in her skirt.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{purposes}} of bondage in BDSM is to restrain a person (typically called the bottom) in a BDSM position. This may involve simply tying the hands together in front or behind. Other positions involve the use of a <b>waist</b> <b>belt</b> to anchor the hands to the front, back or sides. Other popular positions are the spread eagle, with the limbs splayed out and fastened by wrists and ankles to bedposts, door frame or some other anchoring point; the hogtie, which secures each wrist to its corresponding ankle behind the back (wider, padded restraints such as bondage cuffs are recommended for this); the balltie, which secures wrists to ankles, in front, with the knees drawn up to the chest; the crotch rope, which involves pulling a rope between the labia to apply pressure to the female genitals. Sometimes a knot is placed in the rope at the position of the clitoris to intensify the sensation. A crotch rope can also be used on males, either placing pressure directly on the scrotum or including a tie to capture the scrotum. Other positions include the reverse prayer position (not recommended unless the subject has flexible shoulders), and an over-arm tie, in which the arms are brought over the head, and the wrists fastened together behind the head and then by a length of rope, chain or strapping to a belt at the waist.|$|E
500|$|The Omani khanjar {{is tucked}} {{underneath}} a <b>waist</b> <b>belt</b> and is {{situated at the}} front and centre of the wearer's body. [...] It used to form part of everyday attire; however, it is now carried as a [...] "ceremonial dagger", and worn only for formal events and ceremonies – such as weddings, parades, meetings, and diplomatic functions – among many other occasions. [...] Labelled a [...] "ubiquitous sign of masculinity" [...] by John M. Willis in The Arab Studies Journal, the khanjar {{is a symbol of}} [...] "manhood, power and authority", as well as serving as a status symbol for the person wearing it. [...] As a result, it is sometimes given by families to their sons when they reach adolescence, and is a common wedding gift to the groom.|$|E

500|$|Thus, {{throughout}} the Napoleonic wars, the 52nd foot continued to wear red uniforms with buff facings. The officers had silver lace, {{while the other}} ranks' lace was worn in pairs, red with orange stripes (according to 1802 regulations); in 1812 a commentator described the lace as red with two blue stripes. Light infantry officers wore short jackets, rather than the tailed coats of the other line regiments, with white piping, silver buttons, and silver and scarlet shoulder wings. The uniform was completed with a crimson sash; to match the buff facings and turn-backs, the officers generally wore buff breeches, or grey overalls. Field officers of the 52nd wore silver epaulettes, with regimental badge, overtop the light infantry wings, to designate rank. An 1810 order stipulated these be badged with a star (for majors), a crown (lieutenant colonels) or star and crown (colonels). Light infantry also commonly wore a narrow <b>waist</b> <b>belt</b> instead of the customary shoulder belt. The 52nd did not adopt the [...] "Belgic cap" [...] but retained the stovepipe shako {{throughout the}} Napoleonic period; it was adorned with the brass bugle badge and green plumes of the light infantry. In the 52nd, officers' plumes were made from horsehair. Officers generally carried a stirrup-hilted sabre.|$|E
2500|$|Reese {{developed}} a reputation for his innovative theories on training and nutrition, {{many of which are}} used by top American coaches. [...] Over the years, he employed such unusual training methods as having his Florida Gators swimmers swim upstream in the nearby Ichetucknee River, do training workouts fully clothed, crawl their way up the entrance ramp of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on their hands with wheels attached to their ankles, and swim with a <b>waist</b> <b>belt</b> attached to a pulley and weights. [...] Reese's creative ideas included his invention of special arm paddles to create water resistance while correcting the motion of his swimmer's strokes.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment has {{historically}} centered on removing mechanical {{pressure from the}} joint until the disease has run its course. Options include traction (to separate the femur from the pelvis and reduce wear), braces (often for several months, {{with an average of}} 18 months) to restore range of motion, physiotherapy, and surgical intervention when necessary because of permanent joint damage. To maintain activities of daily living, custom orthotics may be used. [...] Overnight traction may be used in lieu of walking devices or in combination. [...] These devices internally rotate the femoral head and abduct the leg(s) at 45°. [...] Orthoses can start as proximal as the lumbar spine, and extend the length of the limbs to the floor. [...] Most functional bracing is achieved using a <b>waist</b> <b>belt</b> and thigh cuffs derived from the Scottish-Rite orthosis. These devices are typically prescribed by a physician and implemented by an orthotist. Clinical results of the Scottish Rite orthosis have not been good according to some studies, and its use has gone out of favor. Many children, especially those with the onset of the disease before age 6, need no intervention at all and are simply asked to refrain from contact sports or games which impact the hip. [...] For older children (onset of Perthes after age 6), the best treatment option remains unclear. Current treatment options for older children over age 8 include prolonged periods without weight bearing, osteotomy (femoral, pelvic, or shelf), and the hip distraction method using an external fixator which relieves the hip from carrying the body's weight. [...] This allows room for the top of the femur to regrow. The Perthes Association has a [...] "library" [...] of equipment which can be borrowed to assist with keeping life as normal as possible, newsletters, a helpline, and events for the families to help children and parents to feel less isolated.|$|E
50|$|A {{study was}} {{published}} in Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research in 1989, showed that participants who wore <b>waist</b> <b>belts</b> when weight lifting had an increase in blood pressure. that when weight lifting, the support belts that the men wore increased their blood pressure. This inspired the popular corset maker and founder of Lucy's Corsetry, Lucy Williams, {{to see if this}} could potentially apply to corsets as well. In a video, she measures her blood pressure {{both in and out of}} the corset, seeing a 10% increase of blood pressure while wearing a corset. This is consistent with the 1989 study which saw a 6-15% increase in blood pressure of the wearers.|$|R
