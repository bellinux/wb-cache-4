40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} optimum suction mass flow requirements for LFC wings is addressed. Some previous methods for predicting {{the extent of}} laminar flow over swept <b>wings</b> <b>with</b> <b>suction</b> are briefly reviewed. These range from the purely empirical to those utilizing tabulated linear stability computations. The present method is described. This method solves the linear, incompressible stability equations by spectral techniques. The maximum temporal amplification of boundary layer crossflow and 2 -D disturbances is determined for waves of a given frequency. Group velocities are used to integrate these amplification rates along the wing to yield the logarithmic amplitude ratio or 'N factor' of the disturbance. The 'N factor' calibration of a computer code utilizing this method is described, using experimentally determined transition data. The method is shown to be as consistent as previously used 'fixed wavelength' methods...|$|R

40|$|Summary. -Camber {{and twist}} {{is applied to}} the problem of {{reducing}} the drag due to incidence, of thin triangular or swept-back wings, at supersonic speeds, with subsonic leading edges and supersonic or sonic trailing edges. Two cases are considered: (i) <b>with</b> leading-edge <b>suction</b> forces ignored, (ii) <b>with</b> leading-edge <b>suction</b> forces included. It is found that twist, especially towards the wing tips, is more effective in reducing drag, for given lift, for the larger values of tan yjtan u, where y is the semi-apex-angle and ft is the Mach angle, and that camber is more effective for the smaller values, though, in general, the best results are obtained by a suitable combination of camber and twist. For triangular <b>wings,</b> <b>with</b> <b>suction</b> ignored, the maximum percentage drag reduction varies from about 10 per cent (for sonic leading edges) to 50 per cent (for very slender plan-forms) and, if suction forces are included, from zero (for very slender plan-forms) to about 10 per cent (when the leading edges are sonic). The effect of the swept-back trailing edge is, in general, to increase the maximum percentage drag reduction for given lift if suction forces are ignored; but to decrease the maximum reduction for smaller values of tan yjtan ft, and to increase the maximum reduction for values of tan yjtan ft near to one, if suction forces are included. [...] _~ 1. Introduction. -In Ref. 1, the effect of camber and twist on the pressure distribution and drag on some triangular wings of zero thickness, at supersonic speeds but with subsonic leading edges, is investigated.

A highly cambered single element <b>wing,</b> <b>with</b> the <b>suction</b> surface nearest to the ground, was used to research the effect of changing the operating height from the ground at a single incidence. The results are of direct relevance to both aeronautical and racing car applications. A Laser Doppler Anemometry survey {{has been used to}} investigate the ground effect on the mean flow characteristics of the wake of the wing. The size of the wake was found to increase with proximity to the ground. A downward shift of the path of the wake was also observed. Instantaneous Particle Image Velocimetry elucidates the unsteady flow features. Discrete vortex shedding was seen to occur behind the finite trailing edge of the wing (Figure 1). As the ground height is reduced, separation occurs on the suction surface of the wing and the vortex shedding is coupled with a flapping motion of the wake in the transverse direction...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the performance characteristics and flowfield phenomena of a wing in ground effect. Model tests were performed in low-speed wind tunnels equipped with moving ground. A highly cambered single element <b>wing,</b> <b>with</b> the <b>suction</b> surface nearest to the ground, nas used to investigate the effect of changing both the ride height from the ground and the incidence. Data obtained in model tests included force balance measurements, surface pressure results, and surface oil flow visualization. Results are compared with the freestream case. As the ride height is reduced, higher levels of downforce were recorded; at clearances between the suction surface and the ground of less than 20 % chord, the downforce is significantly higher. Closer to the ground, at a ride height of less than 10 % chord, downforce drops as the wing stalls. This force reduction phenomenon is shown to be due to trailing-edge separation of the boundary layer, The effect of transition fixing was found to be significant, especially in terms of levels of downforce generated in ground effect...|$|R

Wind tunnel tests were used to quantify {{the effect of the}} ground on the aerodynamic performance of a <b>wing,</b> <b>with</b> the <b>suction</b> surface nearest to the ground. Features of the flowfield around the wing were investigated using Laser Doppler Anemometry and Particle Image Velocimetry to map the wake at the centre of the wing, and the state of the tip vortex. Initially, a single element configuration was used, both under transition free and transition fixed conditions. The application of Gurney flaps was then examined. The experimental study was completed using a double element configuration. The performance is discussed together with the flowfield results. Wind Tunnel testing was performed at a Reynolds number of approximately 0. 75 x 10 (6) based on the chord of the double element wing.

40|$|Results of an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} effects of bed injection (upward seepage from the permeable bed) and suction (downward seepage) on the double-averaged (DA) turbulent flow characteristics over and within the interface of flow gravel beds are presented. The DA Reynolds shear stress within the interfacial sublayer undergoes a higher damping <b>with</b> <b>suction</b> and a lesser damping with injection, as compared to that with no seepage. The form‐induced stress within the interfacial sublayer has a decelerating effect with no seepage and suction and an accelerating effect with injection. The quadrant analysis suggests that within the interfacial sublayer the sweep events in flows with injection and the ejection events <b>with</b> <b>suction</b> are the primary contributors toward the Reynolds shear stress production, while both the events in flows with no seepage are equally prevalent. In the roughness sublayer (form-induced and interfacial sublayers together), the mean duration of bursting increases <b>with</b> <b>suction</b> and decreases <b>with</b> injection, but the bursting events become less frequent <b>with</b> <b>suction</b> and more frequent with injection. The analysis of DA higher-order moments confirms that the seepage affects the Reynolds normal stress flux, the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) flux, and the TKE budget. A downward-upstream flux of TKE is developed within the roughness sublayer with injection; while an upward-downstream flux of TKE is prevalent over the entire flow depth <b>with</b> <b>suction.</b> The significance of this study lies on the hydrodynamic process in such a physical system that may result in modifying the flow resistance, sediment entrainment, and morphological characteristics of a streambed...|$|R

Methods: This was a prospective, cohort study in which we invited emergency medicine faculty and residents to participate. Each participant intubated 2 cadavers (one with simulated pulmonary edema and one with simulated vomit), using CMAC <b>with</b> inline <b>suction</b> and CMAC <b>with</b> traditional <b>suction.</b> Thirty emergency medicine providers performed 4 total intubations each in a crossover trial comparing the CMAC <b>with</b> inline <b>suction</b> and CMAC <b>with</b> traditional <b>suction.</b> Two intubations were performed with simulated vomit and two with simulated pulmonary edema. The primary outcome was time to successful intubation; and the secondary outcome was proportion of successful intubation. Results: The median time to successful intubation using the CMAC <b>with</b> inline <b>suction</b> versus traditional suction in the pulmonary edema group was 29 s and 30 s respectively (p= 0. 54). In the vomit simulation, the median time to successful intubation was 40 s using the CMAC <b>with</b> inline <b>suction</b> and 41 s using the CMAC <b>with</b> traditional <b>suction</b> (p= 0. 70). There {{were no significant differences}} in time to successful intubation between the 2 devices. Similarly, the proportions of successful intubation were also not statistically significant between the 2 devices.
