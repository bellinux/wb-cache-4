5|$|Ono {{was also}} an {{experimental}} filmmaker who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply No. 4, {{often referred to as}} Bottoms. The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a treadmill. The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company Swatch produced a limited edition watch that commemorated this film.|$|E

25|$|The {{vulnerabilities}} of {{the victim}} are exploited <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> particularly vulnerable being most often selected as targets. Traumatic bonding can occur between the abuser and victim {{as the result of}} ongoing cycles of abuse in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change and a climate of fear. An attempt may be made to normalise, legitimise, rationalise, deny, or minimise the abusive behaviour, or blame the victim for it.|$|E

This study compared the cost-effectiveness and outcomes of {{three kinds of}} diversions—cautions, expiation and warnings—with the traditional criminal justice system response of charging the offender.

25|$|People who are {{homeless}} {{tend to be}} socially isolated, which contributes negatively to their mental health. Studies have correlated that those who {{are homeless}} and have a strong support group tend to be more physically and mentally healthy. Aside from the stigma received by the homeless population, another aspect that contributes to social isolation is the purposeful avoidance of social opportunity practiced by the homeless community out of shame of revealing their current homeless state. Social isolation ties directly to social stigma in that homeless socialization outside of the homeless community will affect how the homeless are perceived. This is why homeless individuals talking <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not homeless is encouraged since it can combat the stigma that is often associated with homelessness.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Dulaney Jr. of Maryland, {{likewise}} {{observed that}} attempting to tax subjects on the inequitable basis of 'virtual' representation was unsound because, The {{situation of the}} non-electors in England — their capacity to become electors — their inseparable connection <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> electors, and their representatives — their security against oppression resulting from this connection, {{and the necessity of}} imagining a double or virtual representation, to avoid iniquity and absurdity, have been explained — the inhabitants of the colonies are, as such, incapable of being electors, the privilege of election being exerciseable only in person, and therefore if every inhabitant of America had the requisite freehold, not one could vote, but upon the supposition of his ceasing to be an inhabitant of America, and becoming a resident of Great-Britain, a supposition which would be impertinent, because it shifts the question — should the colonies not be taxed by parliamentary impositions, their respective legislatures have a regular, adequate, and constitutional authority to tax them, and, therefore, there would not necessarily be an iniquitous and absurd exemption, from their not being represented by the House of Commons. There is not that intimate and inseparable relation between the electors of Great-Britain, and the inhabitants of the colonies, which must inevitably involve both in the same taxation; on the contrary, not a single actual elector in England might be immediately affected by a taxation in America, imposed by a statute which would have a general operation and effect, upon the properties of the inhabitants of the colonies. The latter might be oppressed in a thousand shapes, without any sympathy, or exciting any alarm in the former. Moreover, even acts, oppressive and injurious to the colonies in an extreme degree, might become popular in England, from the promise or expectation, that the very measures which depressed the colonies, would give ease to the inhabitants of Great-Britain.|$|E

Clark denied this version of events and claimed that after finding out several students had left a Bible reading to read a different version of the Bible, he commented that if reading the Bible caused this kind of confusion, {{that it would be better}} if it were not to be read in school.
