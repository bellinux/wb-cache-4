5|$|Conceptual {{design of}} a {{permanent}} repository was determined by 1983, calling for placement of copper-clad iron canisters in granite bedrock about 500 metres underground, below the water table in {{what is known as}} the KBS-3 method. Space around the canisters <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> with bentonite clay. After examining six possible locations for a permanent repository, three were nominated for further investigation, at Osthammar, Oskarshamn, and Tierp. On 3 June 2009, Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Co. chose a location for a deep-level waste site at Östhammar, near Forsmark Nuclear Power plant. The application to build the repository was handed in by SKB 2011.|$|E
5|$|If a {{representative}} is absent for whatever reason, {{his or her}} seat <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> by a candidate from the same party-list—in other words, there are no by-elections. Representatives who die during the term are replaced permanently, whereas representatives who are appointed to a government position, such as government minister (cabinet member) or state secretary, {{will be replaced by}} a deputy representative until the representative no longer holds the government position. Deputy representatives also meet during typically short-term absence, like when {{a representative}} travels abroad with a parliamentary work group or is absent for health reasons.|$|E

50|$|As {{seventy percent}} of Brazil’s {{electricity}} is generated by hydropower there is concern {{that a lack of}} water may also lead to energy rationing in addition to water rationing. Analysts indicate that thermal plants <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>filling</b> the energy gap, but the switch <b>will</b> <b>be</b> costly. In response to decreased hydroelectric power, rolling power cuts have been instituted.|$|R

25|$|November 3: With the {{beginning}} of free agency season, the Braves were able to remove offseason free agents from the forty-man roster. The free agents for this offseason include shortstop Alex González, infielder Jack Wilson, and veteran relievers Scott Linebrink and George Sherrill. In conjunction with the moves made on November 2, Frank Wren and his staff now have seven roster spots that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> with potential offseason acquisitions or prospects they wish to protect from the Rule 5 draft.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, NASCAR {{announced}} another revamp to the Chase format, {{expanding the}} Chase pool to 16 drivers, and eliminating four drivers after every three races, leaving four drivers {{to compete for}} the championship at the season finale at Homestead. In addition, wins were given an increased emphasis, with the 16 drivers with the most wins (15 if the points leader is winless; points leader will receive an automatic berth) gaining a spot in the chase. If there are less than 16 winners, the remaining spots <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> based on the conventional points system.|$|E
25|$|There must be {{at least}} one sekiwake and komusubi {{on each side of the}} banzuke, {{normally}} two total, but there may be more. Although there is usually a yokozuna there is no requirement for one, and it has sometimes happened that no active yokozuna or no ōzeki were listed in the ranks. If there is more than one yokozuna but only one ōzeki, the lower rank <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> out by designating one of the yokozuna as yokozuna-ōzeki.

25|$|CrossCountry, {{aspiring}} {{to improve their}} overall network and services, aims to increase services between Sheffield and Leeds. East Midlands Trains also plans to make service improvements to its services between Liverpool and Norwich via Sheffield with two-car Class 158 trains doubling in capacity to four cars. Coupled with newly acquired Class 156 trains, this will lead to an extra 1,500 seats being available each day on this service. Northern, responsible for operating most local services in the Sheffield area, announced in August 2011 that extra services between Sheffield and Manchester Piccadilly would begin in December that year. The Hope Valley Line, which will see an extra service in each direction during the peak evening period, is a key commuter route and currently has a two-hour gap in its evening schedule, which <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> by the new services.|$|E
25|$|A {{solution}} lake is a lake {{occupying a}} basin formed by surface dissolution of bedrock. In areas underlain by soluble bedrock, its solution by precipitation and percolating water commonly produce cavities. These cavities frequently collapse to form sinkholes that {{form part of}} the local karst topography. Where groundwater lies near the grounds surface, a sinkhole <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> water as a solution lake. If such a lake consists of a large area of standing water that occupies an extensive closed depression in limestone, it is also called a karst lake. Smaller solution lakes that consist of a body of standing water in a closed depression within a karst region are known as karst ponds. Limestone caves often contain pools of standing water, which are known as underground lakes. Classic examples of solution lakes are abundant in the karst regions at the Dalmatian coast of Croatia and within large parts of Florida.|$|E
25|$|On 7 April 2015, {{the band}} {{announced}} that they have begun working on the follow-up of Halo of Blood. On 29 May 2015, the band announced on their Facebook page that Roope Latvala is no longer part of Children of Bodom with the new album to be recorded as a four-piece for the first time. However, the band later updated that Latvala's part in the band <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> in by Antti Wirman, keyboardist Janne Wirman's younger brother for live commitments {{until the end of}} the year; he debuted with the band in a private live show in Helsinki. In a later interview with Wirman, he stated that his brother would not join the band permanently. On 8 June 2015, the album title was announced as I Worship Chaos and was released through Nuclear Blast on 2 October 2015. On 19 January 2016, the band announced the addition of Daniel Freyberg on guitar. He would make his live debut with them in Tampa, Florida on 9 February.|$|E

25|$|RNs are {{the largest}} group of health care workers in the United States, with about 2.7 million {{employed}} in 2011. It has been reported that the number of new graduates and foreign-trained nurses is insufficient to meet the demand for registered nurses; this {{is often referred to as}} the nursing shortage and is expected to increase for the foreseeable future. There are data to support the idea that the nursing shortage is a voluntary shortage. In other words, nurses are leaving nursing of their own volition. In 2006 it was estimated that approximately 1.8 million nurses chose not to work as a nurse. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 296,900 healthcare jobs were created in 2011. RNs make up the majority of the healthcare work force, therefore these positions <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> primarily by nurses. The BLS also states that by 2020, there will be 1.2 million nursing job openings due to an increase in the workforce, and replacements. (Rosseter, 2012).|$|E
25|$|The {{next six}} {{elements}} on {{the periodic table}} should be the last six main-group elements {{before the end of}} the periodic table at Z = 173. In elements 167 to 172, the 9p1/2 and 8p3/2 shells <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled.</b> Their energy eigenvalues are so close together that they behave as one combined p shell, similar to the non-relativistic 2p and 3p shells. Thus, the inert pair effect does not occur and the most common oxidation states of elements 167 to 170 should be +3, +4, +5, and +6 respectively. Element 171 (unseptunium) is expected to show some similarities to the halogens, showing various oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7, although its physical properties should be closer to that of a metal. Its electron affinity should be 3.0eV, allowing it to form HUsu, analogous to a hydrogen halide. The Usu− ion is expected to be a soft base, comparable to iodide (I−). Element 172 (unseptbium) should be a noble gas with chemical behaviour similar to that of xenon, as their ionization energies should be very similar (Xe, 1170.4kJ/mol; , 1090.3kJ/mol). The only main difference between them is that element 172, unlike xenon, is expected to be a liquid or a solid at standard temperature and pressure due to its much higher atomic weight. Unseptbium should be a strong Lewis acid, forming fluorides and oxides, similarly to its lighter congener xenon. Because of this analogy of elements 165–172 to periods 2 and 3, Fricke et al. considered them to form a ninth period of the periodic table, while the eighth period was taken by them to end at the noble metal element 164. This ninth and final period would be similar to the second and third period in that it should have no transition metals.|$|E
