The trick is {{to do it in a}} creative way. Let's try to display the lyrics and the feeling of the dance at the same time." [...] On October 2009, Brown released screencaps for the video, coincidentally the same day Rihanna released her video for [...] "Russian Roulette". The photos showed several scenes, including Brown in the middle of a squadron of black storm troopers, Brown in a gray suit, and him giving a karate kick in mid-air. Another was also of Brown, Wayne and Swizz Beatz standing confidently against a white backdrop.|$|E

500|$|When {{reflecting}} on the casting of James Pickens, Jr., Spotnitz called him [...] "another great find", adding that [...] "so {{many times over the}} course of the series <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> so lucky with the actors that we cast in these guest parts and just kept bringing them back because they were so wonderful. That's what happened with William B. Davis as the Cigarette-Smoking Man and with Nick Lea as Krycek, and with Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner, and that's what happened here with James Pickens. Just a fantastic actor, not at all like this person, really transformed himself to play this part". Spotnitz thought that, for a viewer who had weekly been watching The X-Files sixth season, there was a great sense of gratification when—in the final moments of [...] "One Son"—Spender essentially withdraws and tells Kersh that Mulder has been right, all along, precisely because the last thing that Kersh wanted was for Spender to behave in this way.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the 1999 season, Tolliver {{remained}} a vocal supporter of coach Ditka despite the Saints' 3–13 record, saying [...] "I think he's {{a heck of}} a football coach, a great motivator. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> to start buying what he's selling." [...] Ditka was fired by the Saints, but as training camp for the 2000 season began, Tolliver was the Saints' backup quarterback behind Jeff Blake. On August 1, the Saints traded for quarterback Aaron Brooks, which left Tolliver to compete for the third-string spot alongside Jake Delhomme. The Saints' roster was reduced to 53 players, and Tolliver was among those cut. When the Saints lost Jeff Blake for the season in mid-November due to a dislocated foot, Tolliver was re-signed by the Saints, though he did not play a game that season. In July 2001, Tolliver was signed by the Green Bay Packers. This briefly reunited him with Brett Favre, with whom he was teammates in Atlanta. However, he was cut in the preseason when Doug Pederson won the backup job, and this stint marked the end of Tolliver's professional career.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to Dublin, Bono wrote lyrics for a song about the funeral that he titled [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] after the hill he remembered from his visit to Auckland in 1984. The music was developed early in the recording sessions for The Joshua Tree. The Edge said, [...] "We were jamming with Brian [...] He was playing keyboards ... <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> this groove going, and this part began to come through. It's almost highlife, although it's not African at all ... the sound was for me at that time a very elaborate one. I would never have dreamt of using a sound like that before then, but it just felt right, and I went with it." [...] Bono recorded his vocals in a single take, as {{he felt that he}} could not sing the lyrics a second time. The Edge used a Bond Electraglide guitar to play a solo with a [...] "heavy fuzz" [...] sound {{at the end of the}} song. Three musicians from Toronto—Dick, Paul and Adele Armin—recorded string pieces for the song in Grant Avenue Studio in Hamilton, Ontario. In a six-hour phone call with the Edge, and under the supervision of producer Daniel Lanois, the Armins used [...] "sophisticated 'electro-acoustic' string instrument" [...] they developed called Raads to record a piece created for the song. Dick Armin said, [...] " [...] were interested in using strings, but not in the conventional style of sweetening. They didn't want a 19th-century group playing behind them." [...] Bono found the song so emotional, he was unable to listen to it after it had been recorded.|$|E

Approximately 1,000 of the nutcrackers from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers. The museum is open to visitors in the afternoon, from May to October; it is open to the public on weekends during the period from November to April.

2500|$|In World War I, battle-tested, veteran Marines {{served a}} central role in the United States' entry into the conflict. Unlike the {{majority}} of Allied armies, the Marine Corps had a deep pool of officers and non-commissioned officers with battle experience, and experienced a smaller growth. They participated in small ways throughout 1918 (such as Château-Thierry, Soissons, and Saint-Mihiel), but its most famous action of the war would come that summer as the Spring Offensive neared its end. From 1 to 26 June, Marines fought their celebrated Battle of Belleau Wood, then the largest in the history of the Corps, creating their reputation in modern history.

2500|$|As {{the tour}} progressed, Vaughan was longing {{to work on}} {{material}} for his next LP, but in January 1987, he filed for a divorce from Lenny, which restricted him of any projects until the proceedings were finalized. This prevented him from writing and recording songs for almost two years, but Double Trouble wrote the song [...] "Crossfire" [...] with Bill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth. Layton recalled: [...] "Basically, we wrote the music, {{and they had to}} write the lyrics. We had just gotten together; Stevie was unable to be there at that time. He was in Dallas doing some things, and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> together and started writing some songs. That was the first one we wrote." [...] On August 6, 1987, Double Trouble appeared at the Austin Aqua Festival, where they played to one of the largest audiences of their career. According to biographer Craig Hopkins, as many as 20,000 people attended the concert. Following a month-long tour as the opening act for Robert Plant in May 1988, which included a concert at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, the band was booked for a European leg, which included 22 performances, and ended in Oulu, Finland on July 17.

2500|$|On September 18, 1971, Michigan {{defeated}} , 56–0, in {{the home}} opener before a crowd of 81,391 at Michigan Stadium. Michigan took a 35–0 lead at halftime and used its reserves extensively, including five quarterbacks and 11 running backs. [...] Michigan's offense was heavily skewed {{in favor of the}} ground game, with 83 rushing carries and only 10 passes. The Wolverine backs carried the ball 83 times and totaled 495 rushing yards, including 107 yards by Ed Shuttlesworth and 89 yards, all in the first half, by Billy Taylor. Michigan scored seven rushing touchdowns, two each by Taylor and Alan Walker and one each by Shuttlesworth, Bob Thornbladh and Fritz Seyferth. Michigan's eighth touchdown was scored by Dave Elliott, the son of former Michigan player Pete Elliott, who fell on the ball after a Michigan kickoff was not fielded by Virginia as it made its way into the end zone. Kevin Casey started his second game at quarterback and completed two of five passes for 43 yards. Virginia completed only one pass and threw three interceptions. In total offense, Michigan out-gained Virginia, 566 yards to 78 yards. After the game, Virginia coach Don Lawrence praised Michigan's running backs: [...] "Those are the best six running backs I've ever seen together.

2500|$|The buildup to Steven's exit {{involved}} in a bisexual love triangle storyline between him, Stacey and Christian Clarke (John Partridge), who is the gay brother of Jane. On-screen, Steven and Stacey's friendship progressed into something more serious in March 2008, when they shared a kiss. Steven later decided {{he was ready to}} lose his virginity to Stacey, and took Ian's advice [...] "to try to name the England football team and substitutes as a technique for pacing himself," [...] which Sidwell has described as, [...] "a really funny scene to film [...] my favourite comedy moment since joining the show." [...] Speaking of the character's impending exit, he added: [...] "Steven loves Stacey as a friend, and would do anything for her. He misreads loving someone as being 'in love', though. Things aren't right between them, and he can't put his finger on the reason why. That's what's going to lead him to question his sexuality..." [...] On-screen, Steven was unable to consummate his love for Stacey, and after an emotional rant, he kissed Christian. The filming of the storyline posed difficulties for Aaron Sidwell; {{in an interview with the}} Daily Star he explained, [...] " [...] a really good friend of mine, so kissing her was weird, but <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> on with it! But I found it really challenging to kiss [...] because I'm not gay [...] I saw the conflict teenagers go through when they're struggling to come to terms with their sexuality. [...] is a cracking scene and I'm really pleased with it." [...] The storyline progressed with Steven denying his homosexual tendencies, leading Christian to continuously try and [...] "out" [...] him. John Partridge, has commented, [...] "Christian knew Steven was gay from the outset. He noticed Steven had tendencies that he himself had as a young man – and his gaydar is very good [...] Christian didn't ask to be kissed by Steven but now that it's happened he wants the boy to admit that he's gay. He basically wants to help him. Steven doesn't want to be gay and Christian knows how he feels. Coming out is hard for any young man [...] Christian's worried that Stacey is going to get hurt. He knows that when you're gay, you're gay. That's it. There's nothing you can do about it and if you try to hide it, people get hurt." [...] After the truth was revealed to Stacey, Steven falsely claimed to Ian that Christian had attempted to seduce him – a means of revenge for Christian's rejection. The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality. The plot has been described as [...] "controversial" [...] and gay actor John Partridge has confessed that he had worries about it initially: [...] "A gay man having any sort of relationship with an 18-year-old boy is a bit contentious. However, I think it has been handled really well." ...|$|E
