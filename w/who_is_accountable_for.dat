40|$|Abstract—These days, {{sensitive}} and personal information is used within {{a wide range}} of applications. The exchange of this information is increasingly faster and more and more unpredictable. Hence, the person concerned cannot determine what happens with his personal data after it has been released.

This work compares the two concepts from a data protection perspective. The support and fulfillment of data protection requirements are analysed. Models and architectures are investigated for commonalities. Combining the two tech-nologies can increase flexibility and effectiveness of provenance tracking and thereby enhance information accountability in practice, if resulting linkability drawbacks are properly handled.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{accountability in}} governance of local energy and IT systems. The {{aim is to}} focus on accountability of local policy making regarding technical systems by comparing consequences when new forms of governance are developed. Governance steering demands and ensures a clear division of responsibility regarding what a network is responsible for, but not regarding <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> the decision making and implementation. On the other hand, in a steering context characterized by government, it is clear who is responsible and accountable for decisions, but the specific issues for which different actors can be accountable are unclear. We argue that demands for clarifications of accountability emerges from the complex modern governance.

40|$|Cyber {{systems and}} {{critical}} infrastructure {{are changing the}} dynamics of international conflicts, security issues, and challenge traditional ways of understanding warfare. Early warning and attribution of <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> a cyber-attack {{and what is the}} intention with the attack is crucial information. To be able to efficiently response to a cyber-antagonist the measure of response must be decided at network speed, which is far beyond what is possible with traditional attribution methods. The ongoing “cyber arm raze” push towards the development and use of autonomous cyber response systems. An autonomous cyber response would most probably use the complexity of attack vector as a tool for attribution, not considering the identity of the antagonist for deciding the measure of response. This will challenge traditional ways of understanding conflict, war, and how nation states handle different kinds of aggressions. This leads to a new kind of deterrence increasing the need to theorize cyber conflicts, as well as empirically study how different actors are acting and reacting in relation to this new threat. This paper initiates the discourse on the implications of the use of autonomous cyber response systems for the international system/relations...|$|E

When Queer embodiment and Indigenous identity collide the constituent ideological frameworks of each signifier are called into question.
