Many patients actually start opening up to the possibility of what's happening to them, but there's very little vocabulary to help them deal... We decided to expand it <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> [...] offering a gift to her husband as a metaphor that tells him where she's come to in her awe inspiring journey towards death.

500|$|The episode {{helped to}} solidify the {{different}} personalities of The Lone Gunmen. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz explained, [...] "Up , they {{were sort of}} interchangeable in the information they delivered. But then Vince, who loved the characters and really wanted a chance to dig more deeply into them, created a back story and they became a lot more interesting." [...] Actor Dean Haglund, who played Langly, said of the episode, [...] "What we read in the script wasn't really our origins as we'd imagined it. I'd thought we were all in a university garage band together or something. Bruce [...] thought he was a photocopier repair man." [...] Much of the episode's action focused on Byers, played by Bruce Harwood. This experience was different for him, and he noted, [...] "I don't think I'd ever done an episode where I was the lead character. But I felt like the lead because it was my story about falling in love <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> and then dragging these other two schmucks into the disaster that followed." [...] Vince Gilligan was particularly happy with his characterization of Byers, later admitting, [...] "I just loved the idea of Byers working for the government and being this very gung-ho pro-government guy. That's just a fundamental drama where you take a character on a journey and the journey take him 180 degrees from who he original was." ...|$|E
