5|$|An {{important}} element {{in the emergence of}} a Scottish national history was an interest in antiquarianism, with figures like John Pinkerton (1758–1826) collecting sources such as ballads, coins, medals, songs and artefacts. Enlightenment historians had tended to react <b>with</b> <b>embarrassment</b> to Scottish history, particularly the feudalism of the Middle Ages and the religious intolerance of the Reformation. In contrast many historians of the early nineteenth century rehabilitated these areas as suitable for serious study. Lawyer and antiquarian Cosmo Innes, who produced works on Scotland in the Middle Ages (1860), and Sketches of Early Scottish History (1861), has been likened to the pioneering history of Georg Heinrich Pertz, one of the first writers to collate the major historical accounts of German history. Patrick Fraser Tytler's nine-volume history of Scotland (1828–43), particularity his sympathetic view of Mary, Queen of Scots, have led to comparisons with Leopold von Ranke, considered the father of modern scientific historical writing. Tytler was co-founder with Scott of the Bannatyne Society in 1823, which helped further the course of historical research in Scotland. Thomas M'Crie's (1797–1875) biographies of John Knox and Andrew Melville, figures generally savaged in the Enlightenment, helped rehabilitate their reputations. W. F. Skene's (1809–92) three part study of Celtic Scotland (1886–91) was the first serious investigation of the region and helped spawn the Scottish Celtic Revival. Issues of race became important, with Pinkerton, James Sibbald (1745–1803) and John Jamieson (1758–1839) subscribing to a theory of Picto-Gothicism, which postulated a Germanic origin for the Picts and the Scots language.|$|E

Thinking that Arrigo has been ordered to remain to guard Milan, Rolando begs him {{to take care of}} his wife and son in the event of his death (Se al nuovo dì pugnando /"If when we fight on the morrow"). The two men part company, Rolando moved by grief, Arrigo <b>with</b> <b>embarrassment.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lynch {{wrote in}} 1977 that The Homosexual Matrix [...] "had been widely criticized for many reasons", {{including}} for largely ignoring {{the gay rights}} movement and for expressing a negative view of women. According to Lynch, Tripp stated {{in an interview with}} Keith Howes in Gay News that he had not written about the gay liberation movement because he did not know enough about it to be able to discuss the subject, that he was amazed at the accusation of sexism directed against his book, and that he believed the [...] "gay press" [...] had reacted <b>with</b> <b>embarrassment</b> to it, while Howes suggested that Tripp was hurt by the negative reaction to his book from some gay people.|$|E
500|$|Boycott's slow scoring led to {{increasing}} media pressure, and owing to his perceived selfish attitude, he was {{dropped from the}} team after the match. He remembered in 1987 that [...] "the decision stunned me at the time, though looking back now I see that it had become inevitable. I was mortified <b>with</b> <b>embarrassment</b> and filled with an angry, burning sense of injustice which I can remember clearly and painfully to this day." [...] A combination of low confidence and a throat infection limited Boycott to two further Test appearances, playing once more against India and once against Pakistan, {{for the rest of}} the year. He nevertheless again topped the domestic averages with 1260 at 48.46. In 1967, Boycott toured the West Indies with England, where he hit a rich seam of form. He scored 463 runs at 66.14 in a series England won 1–0.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s Brown {{had grown}} {{dissatisfied}} with his drawing style. [...] He began simplifying it after bringing Ed the Happy Clown to an end, as he had been reading work by cartoonists with simpler styles such as John Stanley and Brown's friend Seth. [...] He abandoned the grid layout that he had used and arranged panels on the page in a varied, organic manner. [...] He made the drawings first and only afterwards laid down panel borders, which conform to the shapes of the pictures they enclose and are in a wobbly free-hand–much like those of the Hernandez brothers or Robert Crumb. [...] Brown distorted his images to convey emotion, but not in traditional cartoonish ways. [...] For example, when the adolescent Brown encounters friends of his parents, he does not physically shrink <b>with</b> <b>embarrassment,</b> but does so through distortion of perspective.|$|E
500|$|Max Mosley, the {{president}} of the FIA, also responded to Schumacher's comments saying that his comments [...] "reflect poorly on the sport and show a lack of adult attitude". Mosley also commented on the weight issue surrounding Schumacher saying that [...] "it is a pity that it became a matter for public discussion, whether he drank a huge amount of water, didn't go to the loo or had a heavy helmet. It is just a pity he didn't take care that it didn't happen". Elf was also unhappy with {{the way in which the}} episode had been handled, the company's Commercial Director Michel Bonnet declaring that [...] "We believe the FIA acted in a high-handed manner in disqualifying our two cars so quickly. It should have declared the results provisional and waited for the results of further analysis. Acting the way it did, the FIA has affected the image of large industrial companies, of top F1 teams and of famous drivers. The fact that we have been treated as cheats by a red team – probably red <b>with</b> <b>embarrassment</b> at having finished one lap behind our cars – and by Gerhard Berger is a serious slur against us." [...] Elf also threatened to take the matter to a tribunal if the cars were not reinstated. Company representative Valerie Jorquera also highlighted the need for a consistent chromatographic analysis of fuel samples, drawing attention to the fact that the samples provided during the event had been analysed by a different company than the reference sample, and that the differences may have been caused by the use of different analytical machines and methods. The incident was seen as unfortunate for the sport, which was trying to make a fresh start after several controversies the previous year. From the San Marino Grand Prix onwards, an FIA mobile fuel laboratory accompanied the teams to each event to permit more detailed testing at the track, in addition to ensuring consistency between events.|$|E

2500|$|Sion {{was still}} {{regularly}} present at later Tinerimea salons. In 1912, {{he was extremely}} radical, allowing critics {{of the day to}} regard him as the prototype Romanian [...] "Futurist" [...] (an expression of shocking newness, rather than an actual affiliation with the Futurist current). In 1913, his featured paintings included a rendition of the Crucifixion and melancholic depictions of solitary shepherds.
