Their apartment is frequented by a large rat, but he finds himself unable to kill {{it because it is}} pregnant. This causes the hostess to stay at her friend's place.

25|$|At a {{very early}} ageas young as fiveJesperson would capture and torture animals. He enjoyed {{watching}} animals kill each other {{as well as the}} feeling he got from taking their lives. This continued as he got older. He would capture birds and stray cats and dogs around the trailer park where he lived with his family, severely beating the animals and then strangling them to death, something he claims his father was proud of him for. In the years following, Jesperson said he often thought about what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> do the same to a human.|$|E

Yer honour will excuse me, but it just seemed natural that you should be wishing to send a line; and a sweeter young lady never trod the sod." ...|$|R

She tells Laura, somewhat evasively, that the problem is in her uterus, probably the cause of her infertility. Laura moves to comfort Kitty with an embrace. She feels a sense of what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a man, and also a sort of jealousy towards Ray, Kitty's husband. Both women capitulate to the moment, to holding each other. Laura is kissing Kitty's forehead, when Kitty lifts her face and {{the two women}} kiss each other on the lips.|$|E

Each of the characters responds to this turn of events differently: Don Santiago scoffs, refusing to consider Americans any threat to his way of life; Alvaro wants to know what military action can be undertaken to stave off the American forces; Luis Gonzaga contemplates whether or not Americans really are the uncultured hoodlums he has heard them to be; María de los Ángeles, under the assumption that Americans are not Catholic, assumes the invasion is punishment from God for Mexico's sins; and Susanita wonders what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> dance with a tall white-skinned man.|$|E

The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is then shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips and steals her first kiss. Lee said [...] "For days, all Sunny's been able to think about is what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> kiss Zeke.

500|$|The {{idea for}} the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe {{promoting}} their film Stargate. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like Stargate {{if he did not}} believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, [...] "I think I have an idea for our next film." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{scene in}} [...] "Apollo, Apollo", Jack wonders what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see the world through NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) eyes, {{revealing}} that Kenneth sees everyone as Muppets. To accommodate this, Sesame Street puppeteers Joey Mazzarino, Carmen Osbahr, and Matt Vogel were brought in to do the muppet versions of Jack, Liz, and Tracy Jordan. This angle would later be used again in the show's fourth season episode [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show" [...] in which Kenneth appears as a muppet while walking by a high-definition camera. In addition, the program was parodied by Sesame Street, in the show's 39th season, entitled [...] "30 Rocks".|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} eight episode [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] the writers decided to examine [...] "what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> {{actually}} work alongside Homer Simpson". The episode explores {{the possibilities of}} a realistic character with a strong work ethic named Frank Grimes placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and {{the embodiment of the}} American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the end of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering [...] "real American hero", has become the villain; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.|$|E

500|$|William Shatner as James T. Kirk, {{the former}} {{commanding}} officer of the USS Enterprise and an Admiral at Starfleet headquarters, who re-assumes command of the Enterprise, and with it, temporary demotion to his previous rank, captain. When asked during a March 1978 press conference about what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> reprise the role, Shatner said, [...] "An actor brings to a role not only {{the concept of a}} character but his own basic personality, things that he is, and both Leonard Nimoy and myself have changed over the years, to a degree at any rate, and we will bring that degree of change inadvertently to the role we recreate." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Nate Fox {{stated that}} much of the {{inspiration}} of the superhero story came from two DC Comics series, DMZ and [...] Both center on a city after a large disaster. The series also inspired the crafting of the game's grim take on the superhero genre. Fox further stated that the film Batman Begins was an inspiration for the game. However, any correlation to DC Comics' Static Shock was unintentional. Fox considered his own personal involvement in the Seattle WTO riots of 1999 as influencing the reflection of [...] "spending time in a lawless place" [...] within the game. Grand Theft Auto III was also stated as an influence, in that the team could easily see themselves as superheroes in the open world of Liberty City; similarly, Spider-Man 2 was used as a model to demonstrate what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> move about the city and answer random requests for help alongside regular missions. They had toyed around with a version of the game that they compared to a superhero version of Animal Crossing, and along side superhero work, the hero would have an alter-ego of property developer to meet the citizens' more common needs, but dropped this and focused solely on superhero activities after about six months of work. The character of Cole was created to be a [...] "kind of an everyman" [...] so that players could then [...] "get into the headspace of what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a real human being who has been granted these exceptional abilities". The team also avoided giving Cole an alter-ego or outfitting him with a costume as it would not have reasonably fit in with the character or the game's story.|$|E
500|$|Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole was keen to win {{his first}} trophy in the final: [...] "We don't feel under any great pressure, but we do feel excited about the {{possibility}} of winning our first trophy, we've just been imagining what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> lift the trophy, who's going where in the line if we win it, and how we'll run round Cardiff with it." [...] Teammate Frank Lampard was also keen {{to win his}} first trophy: [...] "If you haven't won anything, a runners-up medal is not what you want at all." [...] He also stated that Chelsea manager José Mourinho's desire to win had been rubbing off on the players: [...] "He actually gets angrier with each one, so every time we lose it's the worst I've seen him, he's a winner, though, that's what you expect, and that's the attitude that's needed at Chelsea these days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have known}} Dr. and Mrs. Bretton so long," [...] I suggested, [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> less <b>like</b> {{separation}} <b>to</b> give {{her to him}} than to another." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Campbell Cabin, located {{next to the}} schoolhouse, {{is another}} {{structure}} with historic significance to the area.

[...] A sign on the cabin reads [...] "Cecil & Nell Campbell 1609 E 18th ST." ...|$|R
5000|$|King says he {{wondered}} what it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> raised by such a mother, and based the story itself on {{a reversal of the}} Cinderella fairy tale. According to one biography of King, later the girl [...] "married a man who was as odd as her, had kids, and eventually killed herself." ...|$|R
500|$|The Doors {{wanted to}} {{capitalize}} on the experimental climate in popular music at the time that brought about groundbreaking works like The White Album and Electric Ladyland while redefining what could be accomplished within the rock medium. Looking for a new, creative sound, Rothchild hired Paul Harris to arrange string and orchestral arrangements for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and local jazz horn players. Session musicians Doug Lubahn and Harvey Brooks also served as additional bass guitarists. The music on The Soft Parade incorporated art rock, blues rock, jazz fusion, and psychedelic rock styles. Drummer John Densmore and Manzarek, who both had jazz backgrounds, asserted they were receptive to Rothchild's jazz concept: [...] "We'd [...] always talk about using some jazz musicians – let's put some horns and strings on, man, let's see what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> record with a string section and a big horn section", recalled Manzarek.|$|E
500|$|Hall was in New York City and {{thinking}} {{of going back to}} theatre work, and had no intention of returning to television so quickly. However, he changed his mind after reading the script, because he was [...] "intrigued by the macabre mix of dark humor, chilling violence, and a unique central character." [...] He also said that he [...] "realized it was a big commitment and certainly appreciated that coming off of Six Feet Under" [...] but said that he [...] "couldn't pass it up". Lindsay was initially against casting Hall, based on seeing him on Six Feet Under, but after he saw Hall speak one line of the script, Lindsay changed his mind, describing Hall as [...] "absolutely perfect" [...] to portray Dexter. To prepare for the part, Hall read various books on the psychology of serial killers, read transcripts of interviews with serial killers, and spent time with the head blood-spatter analyst at the Miami precinct. He also watched people in New York restaurants {{to get a feel for}} what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> stalk them.|$|E
500|$|According to Metcalfe, Mercedes did {{not want}} to have an affair and was not [...] "looking for someone else", stating, [...] "Malachy's been working hard to provide for them and he hasn’t {{had a lot of time}} for her". Turning to Calvin, she confided in him and they kiss. Whittle added that the affair had become more serious and their {{chemistry}} was [...] "more than just physical". Also according to Metcalfe, [...] "Every three months Mercedes has to have an HIV test and, yes, it is making her resent Malachy a bit. She can’t help wondering what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be with someone like Calvin who isn't HIV positive", even though she felt [...] "guilty". When Mercedes learned that she has to be retested for HIV, she feared that the test would be positive. Initially, she did not tell Malachy about it, but eventually [...] "snaps" [...] at him, telling him she [...] "won't forgive him" [...] if she has contracted HIV. The test was negative which was a [...] "huge relief" [...] for them.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Carl {{evolves into}} a {{desensitized}} character and ultimately relinquishes his naïveté {{to the world}} around him. Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re {{going to start to}} see more and more of this kid. What's awesome about that is, think about what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> grow up in this world. It's one thing to have everything you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to have barely even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature with these kinds of situations. It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2008, Thile and bassist Edgar Meyer {{announced}} the release {{date of the}} duo's planned debut album. The album was released on Thile's label Nonesuch Records on September 23, 2008. Commenting on the collaboration, Thile said [...] "Edgar {{is one of the}} biggest influences on my musical life, and now I'm in a duo with him and writing songs with him. This was my dream.

2500|$|Yale {{historian}} Paula Hyman {{commented that}} the deep divisions in the appointment committee were the primary reasons that Cole was rejected: [...] "There was also concern, aside from the process, {{about the nature of}} his blog and what it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have a very divisive colleague." [...] Yale political science professor Steven B. Smith commented, [...] "It would be very comforting for Cole's supporters to think that this got steamrolled because of his controversial blog opinions. The blog opened people's eyes as to what was going on." [...] Another Yale historian, John M. Merriman, said of Cole's rejection: [...] "In this case, academic integrity clearly has been trumped by politics." ...|$|E
