5|$|Differences in {{vulnerability}} to lead-induced neurological damage {{between males and}} females have also been found, but some studies have found males to be at greater risk, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> found females to be.|$|E
5|$|Company towns {{were once}} common in British Columbia. Many were large, but never had {{municipal}} government and were largely located on company-owned land. A few such as Granisle, Tumbler Ridge and Wells became municipalities, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> become ghost towns. Among the largest were Anyox, Bralorne, Ocean Falls, Cassiar, Gold Harbour (Tasu) and Kitsault.|$|E

5000|$|Some R-4s had the {{tailwheel}} {{located at}} the extreme aft end of the boom near the tail rotor <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>had</b> it positioned at {{the midpoint of the}} boom. Additionally, some had short [...] "stub" [...] exhaust pipes from the engine <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>had</b> a much longer one which extended vertically and then aft above the main landing gear struts.|$|R

5|$|In a verse in Hávarðar saga Ísfirðings, {{the phrase}} á Hlín fallinn ("fallen on Hlín") occurs. Some editors have emended the line <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> {{accepted}} the reading and taken Hlín {{to refer to}} the earth.|$|E
5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the water column, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> developed a number of mechanisms for {{holding on to the}} eggs until they are ready to hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E

5|$|Larger male, female or bovine {{terracotta}} wheelmade {{figures are}} much rarer. An important group {{was found in}} the Temple at Mycenae together with coiled clay snakes, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> been found at Tiryns and in the East and West Shrines at Phylakopi on the island of Melos.|$|E
5|$|Most {{eukaryotic}} cell types {{usually have a}} single nucleus, but some have no nuclei, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> several. This can result from normal development, as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells, or from faulty cell division.|$|E
5|$|Post-Skilling, some {{courts have}} held that gratuities may be reached as kickbacks, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> held that they may not. Prof. Coffee has argued that honest {{services}} fraud doctrine should explicitly distinguish {{between public and private}} corruption.|$|E
5|$|Some of the North American mounds, such as Grave Creek Mound (c. 250–150BCE) in West Virginia, {{functioned as}} burial sites, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>had</b> {{different}} purposes.|$|R
50|$|After the war {{some were}} {{scrapped}} <b>while</b> <b>other</b> <b>had</b> their flight deck removed and converted as merchant vessels (and all eventually scrapped by the 1970s).|$|R

5|$|Since the Nemesis' introduction, the {{character}} {{has received a}} positive reception, and {{has come to be}} {{regarded as one of the}} series' most popular characters. Some publications have praised its role as an intimidating villain, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> noted it as one of their favourite and most terrifying monsters in video games.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of psoriasis as an autoimmune disease has sparked considerable debate. Researchers have proposed differing descriptions of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; some authors have classified them as autoimmune diseases <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> classified them {{as distinct from}} autoimmune diseases and referred to them as immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.|$|E
50|$|Some of the North American mounds, such as Grave Creek Mound (c. 250-150 BCE) in West Virginia, {{functioned as}} burial sites, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>had</b> {{different}} purposes.|$|R

5|$|The {{formation}} of planetesimals {{is the biggest}} unsolved problem in the nebular disk model. How 1cm sized particles coalesce into 1km planetesimals is a mystery. This mechanism {{appears to be the}} key to the question as to why some stars have planets, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> nothing around them, not even dust belts.|$|E
5|$|The {{organization}} won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001, and {{a number}} of its officers and agencies have also been awarded the prize. Other evaluations of the UN's effectiveness have been mixed. Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> called the organization ineffective, corrupt, or biased.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5000|$|Five NC {{locomotives}} were built. Some had General Electric electrical equipment, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>had</b> Westinghouse, since EMC's own {{designs were}} not yet ready. This model did not have multiple unit equipment. They were: ...|$|R
50|$|However the RWD Nissan Silvia and Nissan 180SX {{produced}} in 1991 were built with a longitudinally aligned SR20DET. Some of the 180SX's were released with the SR20DET <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>had</b> the naturally aspirated SR20DE.|$|R
50|$|Deluxe-sized toy {{came with}} the Mini-Con Over-Run. Mini-Con {{could be used to}} {{activate}} a punching action gimmick. Several variants of this figure exist. One difference is some had yellow painted headlights, <b>while</b> <b>other</b> <b>had</b> silver.|$|R
5|$|Ceratopsid teeth, {{including}} those of Styracosaurus, were arranged in groups called batteries. Older teeth on top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. Some scientists have suggested that ceratopsids like Styracosaurus ate palms and cycads, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> suggested ferns. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down angiosperm trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.|$|E
5|$|Following De la Fuente's {{departure}} from the group, most of the classic band members also left and established bands with similar names, including Germaín y sus Ángeles Negros and Los Ángeles de Chile. Guitarist Mario Gutiérrez continued {{to work with other}} musicians under the name of Los Ángeles Negros. Songs by Los Ángeles Negros have been covered by singers including Celia Cruz, Raphael, and José Luis Rodríguez, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> been sampled by hip-hop and rap musicians such as Funkdoobiest, Damian Marley, the Beastie Boys, and Jay-Z.|$|E
5|$|Geysers are fragile {{phenomena}} and if conditions change, they may go dormant or extinct. Many {{have been destroyed}} simply by people throwing debris into them <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> ceased to erupt due to dewatering by geothermal power plants. However, the Great Geysir of Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially induced—often on special occasions—by the addition of surfactants to the water.|$|E
50|$|The {{racehorses}} {{could not}} be kept following the outbreak of World War II. Some were given away to local farmers to ride <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>had</b> to be shot. Len died suddenly just before Christmas 1939.|$|R
25|$|Similarly, South Africa's cholera {{outbreak}} was {{exacerbated by}} the government's policy of privatizing water programs. The wealthy elite of the country were able to afford safe water <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>had</b> to use water from cholera-infected rivers.|$|R
