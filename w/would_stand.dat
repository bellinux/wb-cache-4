5|$|A {{flashback}} explores Raj's previous {{relationship with}} Sonia. Five years earlier, Raj and Sonia (then a model) {{meet at a}} beach in Cape Town. They {{fall in love and}} move in together; Sonia becomes pregnant with Raj's child, which makes him happy, but Sonia refuses Raj's marriage proposal and says she is going to terminate the pregnancy as her child <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> in the way of wealth, fame, power and status and their relationship ends.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} legal maneuverings {{involving}} both sides {{took place in}} the late winter and early spring of 1996. Defense attorneys requested that cameras be barred from Green's eventual trial, but the request was rejected. Green was judged by court-appointed psychologists to be competent to stand trial and denied a reduction in bail. The presiding judge ruled that she <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> trial once, for all of the charges against her, rather than be tried separately on each.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of its cancellation, Thunderbirds had become widely popular in the UK and was being {{distributed}} extensively overseas. Grade, however, believed that without the financial boost of an American network sale, a full second series would fail to recover its production costs. He therefore asked Anderson to devise a new concept that he hoped <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> a greater chance of winning over the profitable US market. This became Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.|$|E

5|$|Carl Meissner demoted Eubanksia to {{sectional}} rank in his 1856 classification, {{and divided}} it into four series, with B.brownii placed in series Dryandroideae. When George Bentham published his 1870 arrangement in Flora Australiensis, he discarded Meissner's series, placing all the species with hooked styles {{together in a}} section that he named Oncostylis. This arrangement <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> for over a century.|$|E

5|$|Peter Padfield's Hess, Hitler and Churchill (2013) {{explores the}} mystery of Hess's flight to Britain. Padfield {{suggests}} that Hess was carrying documents with detailed proposals from Hitler which would have meant peace between Germany and Britain, which <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> neutral in a planned German war against the Soviet Union, in return for which Germany was willing to withdraw from Western Europe.|$|E
5000|$|... == First {{proposal}} == The first iteration of Sapphire Tower <b>would</b> have <b>stood</b> at 196 metres (643 feet) or 62 floors. Scheduled {{to begin}} construction in Spring 2007, the previous 90-storey proposal on Temperance Street, which <b>would</b> have <b>stood</b> at 342 metres (1,122 feet), was rejected because of shadow and height concerns.|$|R

5|$|Skyscrapers in {{the sets}} were oblong cubes that were shot from an angle that exaggerated their height. To create {{the effect of}} {{sunlight}} glimmering off the buildings, one person <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> {{on one side of}} the cubes with a mirror, and another <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> on the opposite side with a light bulb and swing it back and forth, so the mirror could catch reflections of the swinging light and throw it back onto the skyscrapers. To create a sense of hysteria and excitement surrounding an opening night performance, a skyscraper was photographed with the camera swinging quickly up and down from side to side. While scenes from miniature sets were composed of long shots, scenes were actors were shot entirely in close-ups, which make up about 300 feet of the final film reel. Rather than attempting to put the actor into the miniature backgrounds through trick photography, the scenes were cut rapidly and successively, so the viewer first sees the actor and then the set, creating the impression they are in the same place. Sets involving actors were minimalistic, with some consisting of only a few elements like a table, telephone, two chairs, and a cigar.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's final {{event was}} the decathlon, his first—and {{as it turned}} out, his only—Olympic decathlon. Strong {{competition}} from local favorite Hugo Wieslander was expected. Thorpe, however, easily defeated Wieslander by more than 700 points. He placed in the top four in all ten events, and his Olympic record of 8,413 points <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> for nearly two decades. Overall, Thorpe won eight of the 15 individual events comprising the pentathlon and decathlon.|$|E
5|$|To {{test his}} theory, Franklin {{proposed}} a potentially deadly experiment, {{to be performed}} during an electrical storm, where a person <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> on an insulated stool inside a sentry box, and hold out a long pointed iron rod to attract a lightning bolt. This experiment was first performed successfully in France On May 10, 1752, and later repeated several more times throughout Europe. Franklin proved by this sentry-box experiment that lightning and electricity were one and the same.|$|E

5|$|While Bevato was the {{location}} of larger gatherings and royal festivals, royal edicts and public judgments were handed down in the sacred courtyard (kianja) of Ambarangotina {{at the base of}} the hill leading to the Bevato compound. From the kianja sovereigns delivered kabary to announce new laws and decrees and administer justice. The sovereign <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> atop the kianja's vatomasina (a large granite boulder), which is surrounded by a brick half-wall and accessed by a set of steps.|$|E
5|$|As {{a junior}} in 2011, he {{repeated}} as the Ivy League outdoor 10,000 meter and steeplechase champion and became the indoor champion in the 3000 meters and 5000 meters. He {{was selected as the}} most outstanding performer at both the indoor and outdoor Heps meets. That fall, he had been the 2010 Ivy League cross country champion. He finished second at the NCAA championships with a time of 8:32.14. At the NCAA national outdoor 5,000 meter race, he established a school record of 13:40.62 that <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> for less than a year.|$|E
5|$|Based on an {{expected}} audience {{of up to}} 13million, ITV raised the prices of their 30-second advertising slots during the final from between £100,000 and £150,000 {{to as much as}} £250,000. It was estimated that ITV <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> to make £9million in advertising revenue during the final, rising to £10million if it went to extra time and penalties; this compared with amounts of £2–3million normally received for its Wednesday night schedule and £3–4million for a Champions League final with no British teams involved. Among the confirmed advertisers on ITV were Ford, Cadbury, Nike, Heineken, Audi and BlackBerry. Sky's advertising prices were not reported, but among their scheduled advertisers were Audi, Ford, Nike, Samsung and Pepsi.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{announced}} on 10 May 2010 that he <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> down as Labour Leader, {{with a view}} to a successor being chosen before the next Labour Party Conference in September 2010. The following day, negotiations between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats to form a coalition government failed. During the evening, Brown visited Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation as Prime Minister to Queen Elizabeth II and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, to form a government. He resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{were divided}} on the {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, {{was known to be}} a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous with regard to the gold and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention not knowing where their nominee <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> on the money question.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{formation}} of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government on 11 May 2010, Gordon Brown resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. Deputy Leader Harriet Harman took over as Acting Leader and became Leader of the Opposition. On 14 May, Miliband announced that he <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> as a candidate in the forthcoming leadership election. He launched his campaign during a speech given at a Fabian Society conference and was nominated by 62 fellow Labour MPs. The other candidates were left-wing backbencher Diane Abbott, Shadow Education Secretary Ed Balls, Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham and Miliband's elder brother, Shadow Foreign Secretary David Miliband.|$|E

5|$|Following the speech, Nixon {{formally}} selected Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland as {{his running}} mate, who received 1119 delegate votes, with the distant second being Governor Romney with 186. Agnew was relatively unknown nationally, and was selected due to his purported appeal to African Americans, and work for the Nixon campaign after an embarrassing experience {{as the head of}} the Draft Rockefeller movement. It was later noted that the convention had featured Nixon as the centrist candidate with Rockefeller to his left and Reagan to his right. The same analysis applied to the general campaign, as commentators noted that Nixon <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> to the right of the still undecided Democratic nominee but would fall to the left of American Independent Party candidate George Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Giving Jharokha Darshan {{from this}} jharokha was a daily feature. This {{tradition}} was also continued by rulers who followed Akbar (r. 1556–1605 CE). Jahangir (r. 1605–27 CE) and Shah Jahan (r. 1628–58 CE) also appeared before their subjects punctiliously. However, this ancient practice was discontinued by Aurangzeb during his 11th year of reign as he {{considered it a}} non-Islamic practice, a form of idol worship. In Agra Fort and Red Fort, the jharokha faces the Yamuna and the emperor <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> alone on the jharokha to greet his subjects.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} that HM Government would take a stake of up to 58% in the Royal Bank of Scotland in a move aimed at recapitalising the Group. HM Treasury subscribed for £5billion in preference shares and underwrote the issuance of £15bn of new ordinary shares offered to RBS shareholders and new institutional shareholders at the fixed price of 65.5p. As a consequence of the mismanagement which necessitated this rescue, the chief executive, Fred Goodwin (who secured the takeover of NatWest), offered his resignation, which was duly accepted. Chairman Sir Tom McKillop also confirmed he <b>would</b> <b>stand</b> down from that role when his contract expired in 2009. Goodwin was replaced by Stephen Hester, previously chief executive of British Land.|$|E
