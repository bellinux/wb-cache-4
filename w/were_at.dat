5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands.

If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they <b>were</b> <b>at</b> when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they <b>were</b> <b>at</b> when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E
