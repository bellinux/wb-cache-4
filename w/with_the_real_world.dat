25|$|By {{the end of}} 1989 EastEnders had {{acquired}} a new executive producer, Michael Ferguson, who had previously been a successful producer on ITV's The Bill.

25|$|Mordor {{has three}} {{enormous}} mountain ranges surrounding it, from the north, {{from the west}} and from the south. The mountains both protected the land from an unexpected invasion {{by any of the}} people living in those directions and kept those living in Mordor from escaping. Tolkien was reported to have identified Mordor with the volcano of Stromboli off Sicily, in terms of geographic equivalency <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{previous}} nineteen seasons were aired as half-hour episodes. This {{season is}} the first to be aired as 13 one-hour episodes, a move that is credited as helping MTV rank as the #1 network in the Wednesday 10pm - 11pm time slot among people age 12-34. MTV continued with this format with the following seasons. MTV has also supplemented the airings <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Real</b> <b>World</b> Dailies, an online series of unaired production footage launched in mid-April 2008 that, as of May 13, 2008, amassed 3 million hits by nearly 400,000 unique visitors.|$|E
25|$|Basic {{training}} commences with 'pep talks' {{to boost}} {{the morale of the}} new recruit. This is a ten-day phase in which the inductee is familiarised <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> of intelligence and espionage, as opposed to the spies of fiction. Common usages, tradecraft techniques and classification of information are taught. Financial and economic analysis, Space Technology, Information Security, Energy Security and Scientific knowledge is imbibed to the trainees. The recruit is made to specialise in a foreign language and introduced to Geo strategic analysis. Case studies of other agencies like CIA, KGB, ISI, Mossad and MI6 are presented for study. The inductee is also taught that intelligence organisations do not identify who is friend and who is foe, the country's foreign policy does. Basic classroom training in tactics and language are imparted to R officers at the residential Training and Language Institute in Gurgaon. A multi-disciplinary school of economic intelligence is also being set up in Mumbai to train intelligence officers in investigating economic crimes like money laundering for terror purposes etc.|$|E

[...] However, even after Satin entered New York University School of Law in 1992, he expressed no desire to abandon his project of helping to construct a post-liberal, post-Marxist ideology.

At first, she appears to have suffered some kind of trauma or mental illness, often carrying on conversations with herself or with her deceased boyfriend, as Andrea first notices in the prison. Michonne later admits to Rick Grimes that she has imaginary conversations with her dead boyfriend to keep herself from breaking down, and as a coping mechanism to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world's</b> horrors. In return, Rick shows her a rotary telephone he used to [...] "call" [...] his late wife, Lori.|$|R

2500|$|Incompleteness. Traditional logic {{requires}} additional axioms {{and constraints}} to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> {{as opposed to}} the world of mathematics. Also, it is often useful to associate degrees of confidence with a statement. I.e., not simply say [...] "Socrates is Human" [...] but rather [...] "Socrates is Human with confidence 50%". This was one of the early innovations from expert systems research which migrated to some commercial tools, the ability to associate certainty factors with rules and conclusions. Later research in this area is known as Fuzzy Logic.|$|E
2500|$|J.R.R. Tolkien {{wrote that}} the setting is {{intended}} to be our Earth several thousand years ago, although the geographical and historical correspondence <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> [...] is tenuous. The lands of Middle-earth were populated by Men and other humanoid races: Elves, Dwarves, and Orcs, as well as divine beings, Valar and [...] Maiar. The story concentrates on a man of the House of Hador, Túrin Turambar, and his sister Niënor Níniel, who are cursed along with their father Húrin by the Dark Lord Morgoth. The events take place more than 6,500 years before the War of the Ring.|$|E

They and their friends are forced to contend with [...] who still interact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> The series includes a trilogy consisting of The Red Pyramid (2010), The Throne of Fire (2011), and The Serpent's Shadow (2012), as well as three crossover books with the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series.|$|E

2500|$|Following a {{relatively}} unsuccessful inclination towards comedic storylines throughout 1989, Ferguson {{decided to take}} the soap in a new direction in 1990. Big changes were implemented both off-screen and on-screen. Ferguson altered the way the episodes were produced, changed the way the storylines were conceptualised and introduced a far greater amount of location work than had previously been seen. EastEnders scriptwriter Colin Brake has said that it was a challenging period, but [...] "the results on-screen were a programme with a new sense of vitality, and a programme more in touch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> than it had been for a while".|$|E
2500|$|The Poetry {{issue was}} {{followed}} in 1932 by the Zukofsky-edited An 'Objectivist' Anthology. This anthology featured far fewer contributors: Basil Bunting, Mary Butts, Frances Fletcher, Robert McAlmon, George Oppen, Ezra Pound, Carl Rakosi, Kenneth Rexroth, Charles Reznikoff, William Carlos Williams, Louis Zukofsky and Forest Anderson, T. S. Eliot, R. B. N. Warriston and Jerry Reisman. The anthology served {{to highlight the}} differences between these poets {{as much as their}} shared attitudes to writing. Much of the difference stemmed from Zukofsky's insistence on form over content, which conflicted with many of the other poets' concern <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> As Rakosi would later write: [...] "if Reznikoff was an Objectivist, Zukofsky is not and never was one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Virtual {{economies are}} {{observed}} in MUDs and massively multi player online role-playing games (MMORPGs). The largest virtual economies {{are found in}} MMORPGs. Virtual economies also exist in life simulation games which may have taken the most radical steps toward linking a virtual economy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> This can be seen, for example, in Second Life's recognition of intellectual property rights for assets created [...] "in-world" [...] by subscribers, and its laissez-faire policy on the buying and selling of Linden Dollars (the world's official currency) for real money on third party websites. Virtual economies can also exist in browser-based Internet games where [...] "real" [...] money can be spent and user-created shops opened, or {{as a kind of}} emergent gameplay.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Republican Congressman Paul Ryan {{said that}} Rand was [...] "the reason I got into public service", and he later {{required}} his staff members to read Atlas Shrugged. In April 2012, he disavowed such beliefs however, calling them [...] "an urban legend", and rejected Rand's philosophy. Ryan was subsequently mocked by Nobel Prize-winning economist and commentator Paul Krugman for reportedly getting ideas about monetary policy from the novel. In another commentary, Krugman quoted a quip by writer John Rogers: [...] "There are two novels {{that can change}} a bookish fourteen-year-old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> The other, of course, involves orcs." ...|$|E
