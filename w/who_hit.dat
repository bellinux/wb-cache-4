5|$|The 1956 team {{repeated}} as NL champions; {{the team}} was bolstered {{by the play of}} Duke Snider, <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> a league-leading 43 home runs and also led the league in walks. They fell to third place (84-70) in 1957.|$|E
5|$|A {{home run}} {{is a hit}} in which the player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never hit for the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E

5|$|Whack Ball is {{comparable}} to Breakout: the player controls a large ball with the Menacer to push a smaller on-screen ball into color-changing bricks that line the wall. One all of the bricks change color, the player moves to the next level. Some bricks are power-ups that change the larger ball's size or add extra small balls into play. Players <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> flashing bricks are punished. Inadvertently guiding the ball {{through a hole in}} the wall ends the game.|$|E
5|$|A double {{is a safe}} hit {{in which}} the batter reaches second base without being called out. This {{scenario}} often occurs when a ball is hit into the gaps between the outfielders, or down the foul line {{on either side of}} the playing field. Tris Speaker is the all-time leader in doubles in MLB history, with 792, one of which was part of a cycle; Speaker accomplished the feat for the Boston Red Sox on June 9, 1912, against the St. Louis Browns. Two of the other top five players in MLB history in doubles have hit for the cycle: Stan Musial (725 doubles; third all-time) completed the cycle on July 24, 1949; and Craig Biggio (668; fifth all-time) accomplished the feat on April 8, 2002. The single-season MLB leader is Earl Webb, the left-handed outfielder <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> 67 in 1931.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race Hamilton, Rosberg and Vettel {{maintained}} their grid positions into the first corner, while Daniil Kvyat managed to overtake team-mate Daniel Ricciardo for fourth. Trying to get past Nico Hülkenberg on the inside of turn five, Fernando Alonso made contact with Hülkenberg, <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> the wall but was able to continue, though {{at the back of the}} field. Alonso was reprimanded with a five-second penalty to serve at his first pit stop. Meanwhile, Felipe Massa made contact with Pastor Maldonado, damaging his front wing. Massa came into the pit lane for a new wing and equipped the harder tyre compound. Maldonado suffered from brake problems in the early laps, eventually retiring on lap seven.|$|E

5|$|Johnston then {{knocked over}} Charlie Barnett's stumps as the batsman leaned {{onto the front}} foot and inside edged the ball into his stumps for eight; this brought Godfrey Evanswho was given two livesto the crease at 6/60. Evans hit Johnston hard {{in the air to}} cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second {{catching}} opportunity went in the same direction before traveling through Bradman's hand and striking him in the abdomen. However, Johnston eventually snared Evans, <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> a ball strongly, but straight to short leg where Arthur Morris took the catch close in, as England reached 8/74.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Captain Philip Broke and HMS Shannon, a 38-gun frigate, were patrolling off {{the port}} of Boston on {{blockade}} duty. Shannon had been {{under the command of}} Broke since 1806 and, under his direction, the crew held daily great gun and small arms drills lasting up to three hours each. Crew members <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> their bullseye were awarded a pound (454g) of tobacco for their good marksmanship. Broke had also fitted out his cannons with dispart and tangent sights to increase accuracy as well as degree bearings on the decks and gun carriages to allowable the crew to focus their fire on a specific target. In this regard Chesapeake, with traditional gun practice and a crew that had only been together for a few months, was greatly inferior.|$|E
5|$|Spain were {{up against}} Portugal {{in the round}} of 16, and Villa {{would prove to be}} vital once again, as Xavi backheeled an Andrés Iniesta pass to the on-rushing Villa, <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> the back of the net on the rebound after having his first shot saved by Eduardo, proving enough to give Spain a place in the quarter-finals against Paraguay, where Villa scored a goal from a rebound after Pedro hit the post. Once again, Villa's goal proved to be the {{difference}} as the match finished 1–0, while Spain booked a game with Germany in the semi-finals, where Spain recorded yet another 1–0 victory with the only goal coming from Carles Puyol.|$|E

Stevenage's goalkeeper, Chris Day, parried a header from Barry Cogan which dropped at Stuart's feet <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> a low hard shot from ten yards out. Grays faced League One outfit Carlisle United away in the FA Cup first round on 8 November. In the 1–1 stalemate, Stuart scored Grays' only goal in the 52nd minute, with a ten-yard volley. In the New Year's Day fixture of 2009, Stuart scored with a header from a free-kick taken by Sam Sloma, to hand Grays a 3–1 victory over Ebbsfleet United. Following the {{departure}} of manager Wayne Burnett, Stuart took the role of assistant manager at Grays, alongside Stuart Elliott in late January 2009.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Kart {{features}} eight playable {{characters from}} the Mario series – Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Bowser, Donkey Kong Jr., Koopa Troopa and Toad. Each character's kart has different capabilities with differing levels of top speed, acceleration and handling. Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Bowser and Toad returned {{in all of}} the subsequent Mario Kart games starting with Mario Kart 64. During races, computer-controlled characters have special items, or superpowers, which they are able to use. These powers are specific to each character; for example, Yoshi drops eggs which cause players <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> them to lose coins and spin, while Donkey Kong Jr. throws bananas.|$|E
5|$|The Willie Mays World Series Most Valuable Player Award {{is given}} to the player who most {{contributes}} to his team's success in the final round of the Major League Baseball post-season. The award was originally given by the editors of Sport magazine, but is now decided by a combination of media members and Major League Baseball officials. On September 29, 2017, it was renamed in honor of Willie Mays in remembrance of the 63rd anniversary of The Catch. Mays never won the award himself. The current award holder is Houston Astros center fielder George Springer, <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> a record-tying five home runs in the 2017 World Series.|$|E

5|$|Two days later, Clark was reinstated. With Clark back in {{the lineup}} for a home game against St. Bonaventure Bonnies, Ron Everhart tried a new {{starting}} lineup: one that included Bolding and Monteiro, but left Senior Jason Duty on the bench. The Dukes took a 15point lead at half time, but the Bonnies came back. With less than thirty seconds left, Bill Clark drew a charging penalty which gave his team the ball, down by two. One quick possession by each team left it 67–69 {{in favor of the}} Bonnies. On the final play, Damian Saunders drove towards the basket before passing it out to Melquan Bolding, <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> a 3-point shot to put the Dukes up by one with 3.5 seconds remaining. Duquesne won 70–69, giving them their first win since December 22.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament, Temple Owls {{received}} a two seed {{by virtue of}} a 14–2 conference record and earned a bye into the quarterfinals. Due to La Salle beating St. Bonaventure in the first round, Temple Owls was matched up with La Salle. The Owls won the game 96–76, posting their most points {{of the season in}} the process. Five players scored more than nine, and Ramone Moore led the charge with 23 points. Kevin Anderson of Richmond scored 22, defeating the Owls in the semifinals 58–54 and ending Temple Owls' ten-game winning streak at Boardwalk Hall. Ramone Moore hit a layup to push the Owls ahead 54–53 with five minutes left. Richmond grabbed the lead 55–54 at the 3:48 mark as Justin Harper scored off a putback. Harper finished the game with 18 points and nine rebounds, and was involved in a controversial end-of-game play. With 30 seconds left, Khalif Wyatt attempted a 3-pointer and Harper came down on him, but no call was made. Wyatt proceeded to foul Harper, <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> the deciding free throws. Wyatt had 15 points, while Lavoy Allen added 12 points and 10 rebounds. Juan Fernandez made only 3 of his 17 field goal attempts.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1987–1988 season, Rodman steadily improved his stats, averaging 11.6points and 8.7rebounds and starting in 32 of 82 regular season games. The Pistons fought {{their way into}} the 1988 NBA Finals, and took a 3–2 lead, but lost in seven games against the Los Angeles Lakers. In Game Six, the Pistons were down by one point with eight seconds to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman just fell short of an offensive rebound and a putback which could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman's defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52minutes to go and to two with one minute to go. But then, he fouled Magic Johnson, <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39seconds to go, and the Pistons never recovered. In that year, he and his girlfriend Annie had a daughter they named Alexis.|$|E

5|$|Of these 27 players, 14 were {{right-handed}} batters, 11 were left-handed, and 2 were switch hitters. The San Francisco Giants and Boston Red Sox are {{the only}} franchises to see four players reach the milestone while on their roster: for the Giants, Mel Ott while the team was in New York, Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and most recently Bonds, and, for the Red Sox, Jimmie Foxx, Williams, and more recently Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz. Five 500 home run club members—Aaron, Mays, Eddie Murray, Rafael Palmeiro, and Alex Rodriguez—are also members of the 3,000 hit club. Gary Sheffield's 500th home run was his first career home run with the New York Mets, {{the first time that}} a player's 500th home run was also his first with his franchise. Rodriguez, at 32 years and 8 days, was the youngest player to reach the milestone while Williams, at 41 years and 291 days, was the oldest. The most recent player to reach 500 home runs is Ortiz, <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> his 500th home run on September 12, 2015. As of the end of the 2017 Major League Baseball season, Albert Pujols is the only active member of the 500 home run club.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright {{attended a}} duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each fired two shots and, as neither {{man had been}} injured, resolved their duel with a handshake. Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie {{was shot in the}} hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a butcher knife, and charged his attacker, <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then drew his sword cane and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel removed the bullets and patched Bowie's other wounds.|$|E
5|$|Waltrip {{took over}} the lead on lap 163, and an eighth caution was necessitated when Biffle made contact with Ragan, <b>who</b> <b>hit</b> Harvick, who spun heading into turn three but avoided hitting the {{barriers}} or other cars. Some drivers, including Waltrip, chose to pit for fresh tires and fuel during the caution. Montoya elected not to pit, and led the field at the restart on lap 169. The top six drivers quickly began {{to pull away from}} the rest of the field, as Stewart ran fourth and Harvick 16th by lap 172. Stewart and Montoya ran alongside each other at the line on lap 173, before Stewart moved in front for the lead one lap later. On the same lap, a second multi-car accident occurred necessitating a ninth caution when Edwards made contact with teammate Biffle going into turn three, and collected, Earnhardt, Harvick, Kyle Busch, Nemechek, Sorenson, Kenseth, Kvapil, Watrip, Dave Blaney and Montoya. The second red-flag of the race was shown shortly afterward to allow officials to clear debris from the track. The race was restarted twelve minutes later, as some drivers made pit stops.|$|E
