30|$|The attack model {{provides}} {{contextual information}} and elaborates {{the roles of}} the various agents. The attacker intends to subvert the integrity of peer vehicle communications by launching Sybil attacks. The attack has captured a certain number of legitimate identities (or keys) belonging to other vehicles. Such an attack model is practical, powerful, and has not been considered yet in related literature [1 – 6]. For example, a malicious parent could easily steal identities of multiple members of their family that have identities already provisioned. Clearly <b>with</b> <b>more</b> sharing <b>of</b> vehicles <b>today</b> (e.g., rental cars and car pools), the feasibility of skimming attacks in vehicles (or in related hardware) to steal identities is even <b>more</b> practical. <b>With</b> multiple legitimate identities in hand, the potency of an attacker is much higher. The mobile nature of vehicular networks makes detection of such identity thefts quite difficult in practice. It is assumed that the attacker will utilize all its Sybil identities to attack the network in an attempt subvert the network integrity. Note that in this paper, we consider for simplicity one attacker in the network. The protocols we propose can be directly applied to multiple (but non-colluding) attackers. Analyzing and enhancing protocols for thwarting colluding attackers is part of future workb.|$|R
