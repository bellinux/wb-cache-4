5|$|Industry Minister Kim Carr {{confirmed}} on 10 July 2013 {{that talks}} {{had been scheduled}} between the Australian government and Holden. On 13 August 2013, 1,700 employees at the Elizabeth plant in northern Adelaide voted to accept a three-year <b>wage</b> <b>freeze</b> in order to decrease the chances of the production line's closure in 2016. Holden's ultimate survival, though, depended on continued negotiations with the Federal Government—to secure funding for the period from 2016 to 2022—and the final decision of the global headquarters in Detroit, US.|$|E
5|$|Bernardo Grinspun, {{the first}} {{minister}} of the economy, arranged an increase in wages, reaching the levels of 1975. This caused inflation to reach 32%. He also tried to negotiate more favourable terms on the country's foreign debt, but the negotiations failed. Risking a default, he negotiated with the IMF, which requested spending cuts. International credits prevented default {{at the end of}} 1984, but he resigned in March 1985 when the debt reached $1billion and the IMF denied further credits. Grinspun was succeeded by Juan Vital Sourrouille, who designed the Austral plan. This plan froze prices and wages, stopped the printing of money, arranged spending cuts, and established a new currency, the Austral. The plan was a success in the short term, and choked inflation. Inflation rose again {{by the end of the}} year, the CGT opposed the <b>wage</b> <b>freeze,</b> and business community opposed the price freeze. Alfonsín thought that the privatization of some state assets and a deregulation of the economy might work, but those proposals were opposed by both the PJ and his own party.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 2013, the {{government}} announced that a four-year tentative agreement had been reached with the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Public and Private Employees (NAPE), the province's largest public sector union. The deal between the two was reached after 18 months of negotiations, during at which point NAPE released radio and television advertisements criticizing {{the government}} for saying the province's economy was booming while they laid off employees and told unions to expect a modest increase in pay. The tentative deal included a <b>wage</b> <b>freeze</b> {{during the first two}} years of the deal, a two per cent increase in pay during year three and a three per cent wage increase in year four. Full-time employees will also receive a $1,400 signing bonus, while temporary, seasonal and part-time workers will get a pro-rated bonus. As well a new job evaluation system would see significant monetary benefits for some employees. Two weeks after reaching an agreement with NAPE, {{the government announced}} tentative agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Association of Allied Health Professionals (AAHP). Both agreements had a similar structure as the one government reached with NAPE.|$|E
30|$|Firms {{elsewhere}} reduced wages {{through a}} combination of base <b>wage</b> <b>freezes</b> and cuts in flexible pay components: overall, slightly more than 30 % of employees experienced <b>wage</b> <b>freezes</b> in summer 2009, whereas <b>wage</b> <b>freezes</b> had affected, on average, less than 5 % of employees in the five years from 2003 through 2007. Thus, despite the presence of extremely slow growth and even negative inflation rates, downward nominal wage rigidity remained a binding constraint for firms’ wage bill adjustments.|$|R

A larger share of firms report base <b>wage</b> <b>freezes</b> compared to cuts in either base or non-base wage components. However, in the subsample of firms facing only strong negative shocks, the share of firms using base <b>wage</b> <b>freezes</b> or non-base <b>wage</b> cuts is similar.|$|R

25|$|Standard Gravure was a {{prominent}} printing company founded in 1922 by Barry Bingham Sr. Reduced revenues led to an employee <b>wage</b> <b>freeze</b> in 1982, and in 1986 the Bingham family sold the company. Standard Gravure's customers were retailers, {{many of which were}} in the process of going out of business, and at the same time, paper shortages were occurring in the marketplace.|$|E

3000|$|To {{construct}} {{a measure of}} DNWR, we use {{the information contained in}} the WDN 3 survey about base <b>wage</b> <b>freezes.</b> The survey asked managers of firms directly if they ever <b>froze</b> <b>wages</b> during the period 2010 – 2013. <b>Wage</b> <b>freezes</b> indicate that base wage cuts were prevented from taking place due to DNWR, and more so in a downturn, when economic conditions are likely to necessitate a cut in base wages. Then, following Dickens et al. (2007) and Dias et al. (2015) (see also Nickell and Quintini 2003), we regard firms that <b>froze</b> <b>wages</b> at any point during this period as facing nominal base wage rigidity.

Hosting Lanusse in an April 1971 summit with the CGT, Rucci persuaded the president to begin negotiations with Perón and other political leaders, and to return the late Eva Perón's remains to Argentina. At least as powerful a symbol among Peronists as the leader himself, Evita had been ordered hidden in Milan by the regime that overthrew Perón in 1955, and their repatriation would buy all concerned in the negotiations time.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} year as governor, Pawlenty {{inherited}} a projected two-year budget deficit of $4.3billion, the largest in Minnesota's history. After a contentious budget session with a Democrat-controlled Senate, he signed a package of fee increases, spending reductions, and government reorganization which eliminated the deficit. The budget reduced the rate of funding increases for state services, including transportation, social services, and welfare. It also enacted a perennial proposal to restructure city aid based on immediate need, rather than historical factors. In negotiations the governor agreed to several compromises, abandoning a desired public employee <b>wage</b> <b>freeze</b> and property tax restrictions.|$|E
25|$|The {{trade union}} movement, already powerful, grew rapidly, {{although}} {{the movement was}} split on the political question of conscription. It expelled the politicians, such as Hughes, who favoured conscription (which was never passed into law). The government sought to stabilize wages, much to the anger of unionists. the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8 and 12 per cent, {{it was not enough}} to keep up with inflation. Angry workers launched a wave of strikes against both the <b>wage</b> <b>freeze</b> and the conscription proposal. Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and {{it has been estimated that}} between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days being lost and a £4,785,607 deficit in wages.|$|E

30|$|Recently {{researchers}} {{have begun to}} examine wage adjustment in the Great Recession. Blundell et al. (2014) examine payroll data from the National Employment Survey (NES) for the UK and find {{that the number of}} workers experiencing <b>wage</b> <b>freezes</b> increased from approximately 5 % in 1990 to 12 % in 2011. However, they find a significant degree of downward wage flexibility; throughout the 1990 s and 2000 s, almost 20 % of stayers report a nominal wage cut. In contrast, Carneiro et al. (2014) find virtually no nominal wage cuts for job stayers in Portugal, even {{at the height of the}} crisis, reflecting the fact that such cuts are legally prohibited. Instead, they observe that <b>wage</b> <b>freezes</b> accounted for nearly 40 % of all observations by 2009.|$|R
25|$|The Ten Years' War in Cuba brought Cuban sugar {{planters}} to {{the country}} in search of new lands and security from the insurrection that freed their slaves and destroyed their property. Most settled in the southeastern coastal plain, and, with assistance from Luperón’s government, built the nation's first mechanized sugar mills. They were later joined by Italians, Germans, Puerto Ricans and Americans in forming {{the nucleus of the}} Dominican sugar bourgeoisie, marrying into prominent families to solidify their social position. Disruptions in global production caused by the Ten Years' War, the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War allowed the Dominican Republic to become a major sugar exporter. Over the following two decades, sugar surpassed tobacco as the leading export, with the former fishing hamlets of San Pedro de Macorís and La Romana transformed into thriving ports. To meet their need for better transportation, over 300 miles of private rail-lines were built by and serving the sugar plantations by 1897. An 1884 slump in prices led to a <b>wage</b> <b>freeze,</b> and a subsequent labor shortage was filled by migrant workers from the Leeward Islands—the Virgin Islands, St. Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, and Antigua (referred to by Dominicans as cocolos). These English-speaking blacks were often victims of racism, but many remained in the country, finding work as stevedores and in railroad construction and sugar refineries.|$|E
25|$|Six {{months after}} the pension deal was reached, however, Governor Paterson {{announced}} he would seek to prevent PEF members from receiving their scheduled 4 percent salary increase and seek furloughs of state workers to help close yet another budget deficit. Paterson raised the issues of furloughs in mid-August, just two {{months after the}} pension deal was reached. PEF countered once again by arguing that the state spent $3 billion a year on 23,000 consultants at a cost that was 62 percent higher than hiring a permanent worker. On April 1, 2010, Paterson demanded that PEF forgo its scheduled wage hike, but PEF refused to do so. About a week later, Paterson withheld the pay increase unilaterally, leading to strong denunciations by the union. Two weeks later, Paterson announced he would seek to furlough half the state's workforce one day a week {{for the rest of the}} year in addition to the <b>wage</b> <b>freeze,</b> and the state legislature appeared ready to agree to the plan. PEF began a legislative lobbying effort, but the legislature approved the furloughs. PEF and other unions sued to overturn the pay freeze and furloughs, and a federal district court temporarily prevented the state from implementing the furlough plan on May 11, 2010. The court also ordered the state to restore the wage increase. The court made the injunction permanent about two weeks later.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{marketing}} campaigns {{in the early}} 1980s was successful in increasing patronage of the Board's buses, culminating in an improvement of 10.3% being reported in the 1984 Annual Report. This was also a time of increasing economic troubles for the country, typified by a dramatic rise in inflation. Following {{the end of a}} price and <b>wage</b> <b>freeze,</b> inflation again began to rise sharply, prompting the Tramways Union to campaign for an increase in allowances to cover cost-of-living increases for its members. This resulted in a series of 24- and 48-hour strikes from 8 November 1985 when the Board was not agreeable to their demands, to which the Board responded with a lock-out on 3 December. Fifteen days of industrial action followed, at the conclusion of which the striking staff returned to work having failed to secure any concessions from the Board. Some conditions were curtailed, and the liberal approach to various employment matters that workers had enjoyed was replaced by a hard-liner stance. To make up for revenue forgone during the strikes, fares were raised by 33%. This did not bode well with passengers, and when combined with the loss of goodwill from the recent industrial action, they deserted the buses {{to the extent that the}} Board lost around half of the improvement in its patronage of recent years. With the general economic malaise that followed, patronage of the Board's services never recovered to previous levels.|$|E

25|$|Among PEF's major {{political}} initiatives {{at this time}} were a cost-of-living increase for worker pensions. Benson also said he would seek improvements to job security; accrual (rather than use-or-lose) for overtime, sick leave, and vacation; eliminate tiers in the pension plan; seek an end to penalties for early retirement; new workplace safety protections; {{an increase in the}} size of the state workforce; and new restrictions on contracting out. The state replied that it would seek a four-year <b>wage</b> <b>freeze.</b> Angered by the state's response in a time of budget surpluses, Benson led PEF workers in an extensive lobbying effort. He also said PEF would seek a three-year rather than four-year contract, and 5 percent per year wage increases. Benson also replaced the union's top negotiator in order to adopt a more aggressive stand with the state. The state countered with a 3 percent per year salary increase over four years, coupled with new restrictions on time off for union business, higher health care costs, and new worktime reporting requirements (all of which PEF rejected). At a rally at the state capital on January 5, 2000, some 5,000 (state estimate) to 25,000 (PEF estimate) workers peacefully confronted 25 Albany police and 300 New York State troopers. PEF revised its wage offer to 12 percent over three years. Benson accused the state in March 2000 of dragging out the negotiations, and began a statewide radio advertising campaign against the governor. In April, PEF accepted a contract with the New York State Canal Corporation with a 3 percent per year salary hike. Days later, after another state union accepted a contract containing a 13.6 percent raise over four years, about 2,000 PEF members held a noisy rally outside the governor's offices demanding faster negotiations. Two weeks afterward, PEF agreed to end its advertising campaign and rallies as a spur to negotiations. A week later, Governor George Pataki agreed to wage and pension COLAs. A tentative agreement reached on June 10, 2000, incorporated a 13 percent wage hike over four years, rejected the new working time data collection methods, and imposed slight increases in member health care payments. Union members approved the contract by a vote of 33,899 to 2,876.|$|E
