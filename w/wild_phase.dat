She finds it difficult to reconcile her old existence with her current situation, sometimes straining {{her relationship with her}} boyfriend. She finds comfort in talking to her Literature teacher whom she regularly meets as the cafe to talk about books as well as drink coffee. She obsesses about her nails, and fashion, and when her friend Amanda stole her boyfriend, she acted as if she didn't care, which deeply angered Amanda. Eventually, she loses all ties to her friends. She is potentially the most aggressive in combat. In the OVA, she seems to have given up on beauty and her fashionista ways, and acts much like an 'old woman'. However, due to all of her reading, she appears very smart, even designing a giant robot for battle. It was stated that she went through a <b>wild</b> <b>phase</b> in Osaka, in which she dressed in visual kei style clothing. Rose commented that it was like [...] "a costume party every day." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nanocomposite tool {{materials}} {{are very important}} in engineering field for their advantage in mechanical properties {{and have a good}} foreground in the coming years. However, there are lots of puzzles in the materials design theory. So in this paper, a new nanocomposite tool materials design method is proposed based on the interface debonding theory. The <b>wild</b> <b>phase</b> content can be fixed by calculating the debonding interface rate and the strength requirement of the tool materials. Therefore, an experiment is carried out to fabricate WC based nanocomposite tool materials under the guider of the interface debonding theory. Results show that the experimental data is in accordance well with the calculation and the model is proved to be correct...|$|E
30|$|Graphene, {{a single}} layer carbon {{material}} in a close arrangement of honeycomb two-dimensional lattice[1], has remarkable properties, such as Young's modulus, fracture strength, specific surface area and so on[2 – 4]. Significantly, graphene is a promising building block material for composites because of its large surface area. Furthermore, decoration of the graphene nanosheets with organic/inorganic materials can bring about an important kind of graphene-based composites[5 – 10]. However, the two-dimensional structure and huge specific surface area of graphene nanoplatelets {{made it easy to}} aggregate, which limited its application[11]. Thus it is necessary to overcome graphene's extreme hydrophobicity which leads to aggregation in polar liquids[12, 13]. Researches indicated that the modification of graphene nanoplatelets is arguably the most versatile and easily scalable method[14]. Meaningfully, the decoration of nanomaterials onto graphene nanosheets is helpful to overcome the aggregation of individual graphene nanosheets and nanomaterials themselves[15]. In recent years, researchers have shown an increasing interest in graphene-based composites[16, 17] in which graphene sheets are used as a <b>wild</b> <b>phase</b> to enhance mechanical properties[18]. Among all these materials, hybrid materials based on GNPs and silica nanoparticles have attracted significant scientific interest because of their remarkable properties that do not exist in the individual components[19 – 22]. Due to the synergistic effect, graphene nanoplatelets/SiO 2 hybrid materials have superior properties compared with bare graphene nanoplatelets and SiO 2 particles[23]. Considering the outstanding properties of graphene nanoplatelets and SiO 2, graphene/silica composite {{would be one of the}} greatly popular and interest topics in the field of nanomaterial and nanotechnology[24]. And this kind of composite materials have been explored as adsorbents[25, 26], catalysts[27], and fillers into resin for composites along with an excellent application potential[28, 29].|$|E

50|$|A lack {{in one of}} {{the pigment}} genes causes color exceptions. These color {{mutations}} are also called phases. The rare blue-phased green anole lacks xanthophores, which results in a blue, rather than red, often pastel blue, anole. These specimens have become popular recently in the pet trade market. When the anole is completely lacking xanthophores, it is said to be axanthic and the animal will have a completely pastel- or baby-blue hue. They are extremely rare—usually produced in one of every 20,000 individual anoles in the <b>wild.</b> Another <b>phase</b> is the yellow-phased green anole, which lacks cyanophores. Colonies of these rare color-phased anoles have been reported, but anoles with these color mutations rarely live for long, since the green color provides camouflage for hunting down prey, as well as hiding from predators.|$|R

In the DVD commentary for the film, director Charlie Ahearn explained that, when thinking about the key character named [...] "Phade", he had Phase 2 in mind (either to actually play the part or simply as a model) because Phase was a legendary writer from the past who was also involved in the hip-hop scene, as was the character of Phade. The role would ultimately be played by Fab 5 Freddy, himself a graffiti artist who along with Ahearn was the major creative force behind <b>Wild</b> Style. <b>Phase</b> 2 did take on an official role in another early hip-hop film when he worked as a consultant on the 1984 movie Beat Street.|$|R

The authors write that the perception in the recording industry during the late 1960s was typically that, because of the highly technical aspect of the Moog modular system, these pioneers were simply engineers rather than artists or musicians.

40|$|A bioenergetic {{model of}} marine <b>phase,</b> <b>wild</b> Atlantic salmon was {{constructed}} {{to investigate the}} potential effects on post-smolt growth of predicted changes in oceanic conditions. Short-term estimates of growth in weight were similar to measurements in captivity and simulated growth varied with water temperature and swimming speed as expected. Longer-term estimates of growth in length were less than that achieved by wild salmon, particularly with constant swimming assumed. The model was sensitive to parameters relating to maximum daily food consumption, respiration and the relationships between body energy content, length and weight. Some of the sensitive parameters were based on substantive information on Atlantic salmon and their realistic ranges {{are likely to be}} much narrower than those tested. However, other parameter values were based on scant data, farmed Atlantic salmon or other salmonid species, and are therefore less certain and indicate where future empirical research should be focussed. <br/...|$|R
60|$|The {{religion}} of Christ has, like many true things, been disproved an extraordinary number of times. It was disproved by the Neo-Platonist philosophers {{at the very}} moment when it was first starting forth upon its startling and universal career. It was disproved again by many of the sceptics of the Renaissance only a few years before its second and supremely striking embodiment, the {{religion of}} Puritanism, was about to triumph over many kings and civilise many continents. We all agree that these schools of negation were only interludes in its history; but we all believe naturally and inevitably that the negation of our own day is really a breaking up of the theological cosmos, an Armageddon, a Ragnorak, a twilight of the gods. The man of the nineteenth century, like a schoolboy of sixteen, believes that his doubt and depression are symbols {{of the end of the}} world. In our day the great irreligionists who did nothing but dethrone God and drive angels before them have been outstripped, distanced, and made to look orthodox and humdrum. A newer race of sceptics has found something infinitely more exciting to do than nailing down the lids upon a million coffins, and the body upon a single cross. They have disputed not only the elementary creeds, but the elementary laws of mankind, property, patriotism, civil obedience. They have arraigned civilisation as openly as the materialists have arraigned theology; they have damned all the philosophers even lower than they have damned the saints. Thousands of modern men move quietly and conventionally among their fellows while holding views of national limitation or landed property that would have made Voltaire shudder like a nun listening to blasphemies. And the last and <b>wildest</b> <b>phase</b> of this saturnalia of scepticism, the school that goes furthest among thousands who go so far, the school that denies the moral validity of those ideals of courage or obedience which are recognised even among pirates, this school bases itself upon the literal words of Christ, like Dr. Watts or Messrs. Moody and Sankey. Never in the whole history of the world was such a tremendous tribute paid to the vitality of an ancient creed. Compared with this, it would be a small thing if the Red Sea were cloven asunder, or the sun did stand still at midday. We are faced with the phenomenon that a set of revolutionists whose contempt for all the ideals of family and nation would evoke horror in a thieves' kitchen, who can rid themselves of those elementary instincts of the man and the gentleman which cling to the very bones of our civilisation, cannot rid themselves of the influence of two or three remote Oriental anecdotes written in corrupt Greek. The fact, when realised, has about it something stunning and hypnotic. The most convinced rationalist is in its presence suddenly stricken with a strange and ancient vision, sees the immense sceptical cosmogonies of this age as dreams going the way of a thousand forgotten heresies, and believes for a moment that the dark sayings handed down through eighteen centuries may, indeed, contain in themselves the revolutions of which we have only begun to dream.|$|R
50|$|At {{the onset}} of the Holocene, pottery appears early at Ounjougou, {{during the first half of}} the 10th {{millennium}} BC. The region was then confronted with the return of more humid conditions linked to a rapid return of the monsoons after the Younger Dryas and the development of an open grassland savanna on the Bandiagara Plateau. In this context, populations made pottery characterized especially by small bowls and imprinted décors. The appearance of pottery at Ounjougou is associated with a small bifacial point lithic industry. These innovations are quite likely linked to environmental changes during the establishment of tropical savannas during the Early Holocene, the new composition of hunted fauna that resulted and the development of edible <b>wild</b> grasses. This <b>phase</b> thus probably coincides with the establishment of a form of proto-agricultural economy, consisting of a strategy of selective and intensive gathering of grasses. In the layers dated to the 8th mill. BC, the pottery is also associated with grinding materials (grindstones and crushers). This occupation phase at Ounjougou was thus associated with an early Neolithic.|$|R
40|$|Domesticated species {{continually}} escaping and interbreeding {{with wild}} relatives impose a migration load on wild populations. As domesticated stocks become increasingly different {{as a result}} of artificial and natural selection in captivity, fitness of escapees in the wild is expected to decline, reducing the effective rate of migration into wild populations. Recent theory suggest that this may alleviate and eventually eliminate the resulting migration load. I develop a multivariate model of trait and wild fitness evolution resulting from the joint effects of artificial and natural selection in the captive environment. Initially, the evolutionary trajectory is dominated by the effects of artificial selection causing a fast initial decline in fitness of escapees in the <b>wild.</b> In later <b>phases,</b> through the counteracting effects of correlational multivariate natural selection in captivity, the mean phenotype is pushed in directions of weak stabilizing selection, allowing a sustained response in the trait subject to artificial selection. Provided that there is some alignment between the adaptive landscapes in the wild and in captivity, these phases are associated with slower rates of decline in wild fitness of the domesticated stock, suggesting that detrimental effects on wild populations are likely to remain a concern in the foreseeable future...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the interaction of}} polymyxin B and colistin with the surface and outer membrane components of a susceptible and resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The interaction between polymyxins and bacterial membrane and isolated LPS from paired wild type and polymyxin-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae were examined with N-phenyl- 1 -naphthylamine (NPN) uptake, fluorometric binding and thermal shift assays, lysozyme and deoxycholate sensitivity assays, and by 1 H NMR. LPS from the polymyxin-resistant strain displayed a reduced binding affinity for polymyxins B and colistin {{in comparison with the}} wild type LPS. The outer membrane NPN permeability of the resistant strain was greater compared with the susceptible strain. Polymyxin exposure enhanced the permeability of the outer membrane of the wild type strain to lysozyme and deoxycholate, whereas polymyxin concentrations up to 32 mg/ml failed to permeabilize the outer membrane of the resistant strain. Zeta potential measurements revealed that mid-logarithmic <b>phase</b> <b>wild</b> type cells exhibited a greater negative charge than the mid-logarithmic phase-resistant cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that the resistant derivative of K. pneumoniae can block the electrostatically driven first stage of polymyxin action, which thereby renders the hydrophobically driven second tier of polymyxin action on the outer membrane inconsequential...|$|R
40|$|When cultured in {{broth to}} the {{transmissive}} phase, Legionella pneumophila infects macrophages by inhibiting phagosome maturation, whereas replicative-phase cells are {{transported to the}} lysosomes. Here we report that the ability of L. pneumophila to inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion correlated with developmentally regulated modifications of the pathogen's surface, as judged by its lipopolysaccharide profile and by its binding to a sialic acid-specific lectin and to the hydrocarbon hexadecane. Likewise, the composition of membrane vesicles shed by L. pneumophila was developmentally regulated, based on binding to the lectin and to the lipopolysaccharide-specific monoclonal antibody 3 / 1. Membrane vesicles were sufficient to inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion by a mechanism independent of type IV secretion, since only ∼ 25 % of beads suspended with or coated by vesicles from transmissive <b>phase</b> <b>wild</b> type or dotA secretion mutants colocalized with lysosomal probes, whereas ∼ 75 % of beads were lysosomal when untreated or presented with vesicles from the L. pneumophila letA regulatory mutant or E. coli. As observed previously for L. pneumophila infection of mouse macrophages, vesicles inhibited phagosome-lysosome fusion only temporarily; by 10 h after treatment with vesicles, macrophages delivered ∼ 72 % of ingested beads to lysosomes. Accordingly, {{in the context of}} the epidemiology of the pneumonia Legionnaires' disease and virulence mechanisms of Leishmania and Mycobacteria, we discuss a model here in which L. pneumophila developmentally regulates its surface composition and releases vesicles into phagosomes that inhibit their fusion with lysosomes...|$|R
40|$|In {{most natural}} environments, {{association}} with a surface in a structure known as biofilm is the prevailing microbial life-style of bacteria. Polyphosphate (polyP), an ubiquitous linear polymer {{of hundreds of}} orthophosphate residues, has {{a crucial role in}} stress responses, stationary-phase survival, and it was associated to bacterial biofilm formation and production of virulence factors. In previous work, we have shown that Escherichia coli cells grown in media containing a critical phosphate concentration > 37 mM maintained an unusual high polyP level in stationary phase. The aim of the present work was to analyze if fluctuations in polyP levels in stationary phase affect biofilm formation capacity in E. coli. Polymer levels were modulated by the media phosphate concentration or using mutant strains in polyP metabolism. Cells grown in media containing phosphate concentrations higher than 25 mM were defective in biofilm formation. Besides, there was a disassembly of 24 h preformed biofilm by the addition of high phosphate concentration to the medium. These phenotypes were related to the maintenance or re-synthesis of polyP in stationary phase in static conditions. No biofilm formation was observed in ppk(-) ppx(-) or ppk(-) ppx(-) /ppk(+) strains, deficient in polyP synthesis and hydrolysis, respectively. luxS and lsrK mutants, impaired in autoinducer- 2 quorum sensing signal metabolism, were unable to form biofilm unless conditioned media from stationary <b>phase</b> <b>wild</b> type cells grown in low phosphate were used. We conclude that polyP degradation is required for biofilm formation in sufficient phosphate media, activating or triggering the production of autoinducer- 2. According to our results, phosphate concentration of the culture media should be carefully considered in bacterial adhesion and virulence studies...|$|R

Important thing is to select appropriate species for reintroduction which is not easy especially because of public opinion. Professional basis for the selection of species is the Red book but public opinion is in reintroduction programs very important and can be decisive. Attractive species get preference from the public view especially mammals and birds. Furthermore there are examples of successful reintroduction in the world in this work.
