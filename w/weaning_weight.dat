50|$|In {{beef cattle}} production, profits are derived almost entirely from the <b>weaning</b> <b>weight</b> of the calf. Milk {{from the mother}} {{supplies}} {{only half of the}} nutrients the calf needs to achieve its maximum growth rate and <b>weaning</b> <b>weight.</b> By offering creep feed, both the rate of weight gain and the <b>weaning</b> <b>weight</b> of the calf can be significantly improved. It is used primarily with spring-born calves, as pasture quality at this time is declining, preventing the calf from finding the other 50% of its nutritive needs by grazing. A calf requires approximately 10% of its body weight in milk daily; for a 100 lb calf, this means 10 lb of milk. As the calf grows, the amount of milk it requires begins to exceed the capacity of its mother to produce the milk. A 500 lb calf requires 50 lb of milk, but a beef cow only produces approximately 13 lb of milk a day. The 500-lb calf is therefore shorted nearly 40 lb of milk. This difference is made up for by offering creep feed. However, a calf's rumen is still small and poorly developed - for this reason, creep feed offered to beef calves must be very energy-dense.|$|E

While producers individually {{have no effect}} on prices, <b>weaning</b> <b>weights</b> and productive life have genetic influences and hence can be altered by selection programs implemented by producers. We investigate the impact of a mutation in the leptin gene (exon 2; single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] 305) on cow-calf profitability. Prior research shows that this mutation has effects on performance and traits of fed cattle and milk production in dairy cows. Using data from a teaching-research herd, we find that it is also associated with calf <b>weaning</b> <b>weights</b> and cow productive life. A bio-economic stochastic simulation demonstrates that the mutation has statistically positive impacts on profits, suggesting that producers can profitably make use of this information.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Current genetic {{evaluation}} schemes for growth of beef cattle allow {{a wide range}} of ages for individual traits. For instance, BREEDPLAN considers weights recorded between 80 and 300 days as <b>weaning</b> <b>weights,</b> and permits ranges of 200 days for yearling and final weights. Whilst differences in age at recording are taken into account - adjusting records to a common age - this practice assumes constant heritabilities over the range of ages assumed. Recent results from a series of univariate analyses of weights of Brazilian Nelore calves, from birth to about 20 months of age, showed distinct changes in estimates of genetic parameters with age (Albuquerque and Meyer 2001), especially for ages regarded as <b>weaning</b> <b>weights.</b> In particular, direct heritabilities were lowest and maternal heritabilities were highest from 180 to 210 days of age, suggesting that weights recorded at these ages were most informative for the estimation of maternal genetic or "milk" breeding values.

Feed intake data for 106 finishing pigs between 140 and 210 d of age and the resulting weights and feed conversion ratios were analyzed by breed type. Least square means for body <b>weights</b> (birth, <b>weaning</b> and to 240 d) were estimated with Proc Mixed in SAS 9. 2 for fixed effects such as crossbreed and days of age within the sire breed. The differences within fixed effects were compared using least significant differences with DIFF option.

Unfortunately, crossbreeding can add complexity to maintain a consistent cowherd and can drive the need to purchase replacement females from outside the producer’s own herd. This has led some producers to pursue straightbreeding to provide their own supply of replacements {{and the opportunity to}} more narrowly select for individuals suited to a carcass quality grid marketing system. The subject of this thesis is a Red Angus based cowherd that breeds females to Red Angus sires in early parities. The same cowherd is bred to Simmental sires in later parities to produce a terminal F 1 cross. It is the objective of this thesis to explore whether this operation’s straghtbred or crossbred calf crop provides an economic advantage to the other treatment. Mortality data were collected during pre-weaning for both steers and heifers. Mortality data were collected for steers during backgrounding and feedlot phases. <b>Wean</b> <b>weights</b> and feed conversion performance during the backgrounding phase was unavailable for use in this study. Feedlot and carcass data were captured for steers from both treatments. The straightbred treatment showed an advantage in carcass quality. The composite treatment showed a slight advantage in mortality cost during pre-weaning and feedlot phase, and a slight advantage in feed conversion and cost per pound of gain while in the feedlot. The composite treatment showed a significant disadvantage during the backgrounding phase. The primary advantage for the composite treatment was the difference in actual <b>wean</b> <b>weights.</b> This difference in <b>wean</b> <b>weight</b> carried over to a higher start weight during the feedlot phase.
