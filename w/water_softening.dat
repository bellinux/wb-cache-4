25|$|Ion {{exchange}} {{has long}} {{been used as a}} <b>water</b> <b>softening</b> process, although usually on a single-home basis. Traditional anion exchange resins are effective in removing As(V), but not As(III), or arsenic trioxide, which doesn't have a net charge. Effective long-term ion exchange removal of arsenic requires a trained operator to maintain the column.|$|E
25|$|Ion {{exchange}}: Ion exchange systems use {{ion exchange}} resin- or zeolite-packed columns to replace unwanted ions. The most common case is <b>water</b> <b>softening</b> consisting of removal of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions {{replacing them with}} benign (soap friendly) Na+ or K+ ions. Ion exchange resins are also used to remove toxic ions such as nitrite, lead, mercury, arsenic and many others.|$|E
25|$|Citric acid is an {{excellent}} chelating agent, binding metals by making them soluble. It is used to remove and discourage the buildup of limescale from boilers and evaporators. It {{can be used to}} treat water, which makes it useful in improving the effectiveness of soaps and laundry detergents. By chelating the metals in hard water, it lets these cleaners produce foam and work better without need for <b>water</b> <b>softening.</b> Citric acid is the active ingredient in some bathroom and kitchen cleaning solutions. A solution with a six percent concentration of citric acid will remove hard water stains from glass without scrubbing. In industry, it is used to dissolve rust from steel. Citric acid can be used in shampoo to wash out wax and coloring from the hair.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a one to four year {{comparison}} study are presented for different design types of radon-in-water mitigation systems: diffused bubble aerator with and without <b>water</b> <b>softener,</b> shallow tray aerator with <b>water</b> <b>softener,</b> and spray and diffused aerator tank with charcoal tank. The four wells which supply these mitigation systems vary in radon content from an arithmetic mean of 43, 894 pCi/L to 457, 807 pCi/L. The diffused bubble aerator with <b>water</b> <b>softener</b> provided the most successful mitigation with 99. 9 % radon removal efficiency, while the spray and diffused aerator tank with charcoal filter tank produced the least successful radon removal efficiency at 77. 7 %. Various problems observed of these radon-in-water mitigation systems are documented. The implications of these findings are discussed, as well as mitigation effects upon naturally occurring radium and uranium...|$|R
500|$|When {{drilling}} through {{loose materials}} such as sand or gravel, salt may {{be added to the}} drilling fluid to provide a stable [...] "wall" [...] to prevent the hole collapsing.

The ship's empty fuel tanks were filled with local mud to keep the ship's centre of gravity and draft at the correct levels, as these critical factors had {{been affected by the}} removal of the various components and structure. Only the aft engine room and [...] "shaft alley", at the stern of the ship, would be spared. Remaining space would be used for storage or office space.|$|E

50|$|The water {{provided}} by East Peoria Public Works (which services most, {{if not all}} of East Peoria homes and businesses) is extremely hard, at 28 grains/gallon as calcium, or roughly 479 mg/L.

2500|$|PR {{suffered}} frequent locomotive failures. In 1934 its locomotives averaged [...] between failures, {{whereas the}} figure for locomotives in Great Britain {{for the same}} year was [...] Staff error caused 17% of failures but far more were caused by poor water, which PR's General Manager reported was [...] "the most pressing of all the railway problems". PR sought to alleviate this by building <b>water</b> <b>softening</b> plants at the main watering points on its network, frequently chemically testing the water and eventually fitting all locomotives with blowing down apparatus with which the driver could purge sludge from the boiler.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the cycles}} of {{concentration}} increase, the water {{may not be able}} to hold the minerals in solution. When the solubility of these minerals have been exceeded they can precipitate out as mineral solids and cause fouling and heat exchange problems in the cooling tower or the heat exchangers. The temperatures of the recirculating water, piping and heat exchange surfaces determine if and where minerals will precipitate from the recirculating water. [...] Often a professional water treatment consultant will evaluate the make-up water and the operating conditions of the cooling tower and recommend an appropriate range for {{the cycles of}} concentration. The use of water treatment chemicals, pretreatment such as <b>water</b> <b>softening,</b> pH adjustment, and other techniques can affect the acceptable range of cycles of concentration.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{springs in}} the caves such as Yamatu-gā, Susakadā, Bisa-gā, Bora-gā and Kubaka-gā. There is only one river flowing on the surface, Sakida-gā, only [...] long. The largest spring, called Susakadā, covered all areas of Miyakojima; but after the drought of 1971, the water source of Sodeyama was developed. After the drought of 1993, water sources of Ōno, Nyātsu, Sokohara were developed. There are Sodeyama Purification Plant and Kajidō Purification Plant, and service {{reservoirs}} are at Hisamatsu, Shijō, Karimata and Bora. Two underground reservoirs were completed in 1989 in Susakadā, both 40,000 cubic meters. The water in Miyakojima is hard water, which is unsatisfactory both in taste and in the handling of metallic tableware. In 1999, adjustments to the pH were started at Sodeyama with <b>water</b> <b>softening</b> using lime softening in a pellet-reactor. Strict surveillance {{of the quality of}} the water supply is being done to prevent contamination through infiltration by fertilizers and other sources of local drainage.|$|E

5000|$|Calgon is a brand {{registered}} trademark of <b>water</b> <b>softener,</b> and bath and beauty products. The original product consisted of powdered sodium hexametaphosphate (amorphous sodium polyphospate), which in water would complex with ambient calcium ion and certain other cations, preventing formation of unwanted salts and interference by those cations with {{the actions of}} soap or other detergents. Its name was a portmanteau derived from the phrase [...] "calcium gone". Originally promoted for general use in bathing and cleaning, it gave rise to derivative products which have diverged from the original composition. Today, Calgon <b>water</b> <b>softener</b> contains the active ingredients zeolite and polycarboxylate, which are less problematic in wastewater treatment than phosphates.|$|R
