60|$|This was done, and the ship's {{course was}} laid {{parallel}} to the shore. The wind was now nearly northwest, and she lay down until the <b>water</b> was several <b>planks</b> up her deck. The crew were all lashed to windward, clustering {{where they would be}} most out of danger, should the mast go.|$|R
25|$|In 656, Safiyya {{sided with}} caliph Uthman ibn Affan, and defended {{him at his}} last meeting with Ali, Aisha, and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. During the period when the caliph was besieged at his residence, Safiyya made an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to reach him, and supplied him with food and <b>water</b> via a <b>plank</b> placed between her dwelling and his.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps Stephen {{guessed the}} {{thought in the}} mind of his companion, for he stared also. The music in the cabin came to an abrupt pause, and only the {{tumbling}} of <b>waters</b> through the <b>planks</b> of the great wheels broke the silence. They were both startled by laughter at their shoulders. There stood Miss Russell, the picture of merriment, her arm locked in Anne Brinsmade's.|$|R
6000|$|Finally, a grand {{flooding}} takes place, and {{the decks}} are remorselessly thrashed with dry swabs. After which an extraordinary implement--a sort of leathern hoe called a"squilgee"--is used to scrape and squeeze the last dribblings of <b>water</b> from the <b>planks.</b> Concerning this [...] "squilgee," [...] I think something of drawing up a memoir, and reading {{it before the}} Academy of Arts and Sciences. It is a most curious affair.|$|R
5000|$|French {{engineer}} Joseph Louis Etienne Cordier {{published a}} description of the wire footbridge in 1820:"The bridge of iron wire erected over the Schuylkill near Philadelphia is also worth describing as it is the very first to have been built in this manner. It is attached to one of the window mullions of an iron wire factory on the one bank, and to a great tree on the other. The two curves which carry the bridge are made up of three iron wires which, taken together, have a diameter of 3/8". From time to time, vertical iron wires are hung from these curves. These in turn support the iron wires which carry the deck 16 feet above the <b>water.</b> The <b>planks</b> of the footpath are 2' long, 3" [...] wide and 1" [...] thick. 8 iron wires attached on either side, serve as guide rails.A bridge of this type can be erected in 15 days in summer, the total cost being less than 300 dollars." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour later they heard a boat come alongside, and the voices of the sailors. Then they heard the {{creaking}} of cordage as the sails were let fall in readiness for a start. Half an hour later another boat came alongside. There was a trampling of feet on the deck above them, and the bey's voice giving orders. A few minutes later the anchor was raised, there was more talking on deck, and then they heard a boat push off, and knew by the rustle of <b>water</b> against the <b>planks</b> beside them that the vessel was under way.|$|R
60|$|But the boat's bow is naïvely perfect: {{complete}} without an effort. The {{man who made}} it knew not he was making anything beautiful, as he bent its planks into those mysterious, ever-changing curves. It grows under his hand into {{the image of a}} sea-shell; the seal, as it were, of the flowing of the great tides and streams of ocean stamped on its delicate rounding. He leaves it when all is done, without a boast. It is simple work, but it will keep out <b>water.</b> And every <b>plank</b> thence-forward is a Fate, and has men's lives wreathed in the knots of it, as the cloth-yard shaft had their deaths in its plumes.|$|R
60|$|The sea {{would have}} been far heavier than it now was in another two hours' time, but the water was still very shallow on the sands, and this broke the force of the waves. The boat was now running along the narrow channel of deep water leading between the Spitway Buoy and the Bell Buoy, and almost at right angles to the course they had before been following. The wind was almost on their beam, and even under the reduced canvas the Bessy was lying far over, the <b>water</b> {{covering}} three <b>planks</b> of her deck on the starboard side. They could see the buoy, and presently could hear its deep tolling as the hammers struck the bell with every motion of the buoy.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{best man}} I ever worked with. Now turn 'im, turn 'im!" [...] he yelled, {{reaching}} over Jennings' wrist. [...] "Grab under my wrist. There! won't ye never {{learn how to}} turn a hawg? Now, out with 'im!" [...] was his next wild yell, as the steaming hog was jerked out of the <b>water</b> upon the <b>planking.</b> [...] "Now try the hair on them ears! Beautiful scald," [...] he said, clutching his hand full of bristles and beaming with pride. [...] "Never see anything finer. Here, Bub, a pail of hot water, quick! Try one of them candlesticks! They ain't no better scraper than {{the bottom of an}} old iron candlestick; no, sir! Dum your new-fangled scrapers!

5000|$|On September 21, 2009, the {{sanctuary}} of All Saints flooded due to vandals who broke a stained glass window and fed a running hose through the opening. Workers discovered the hose on Saturday morning and believed it was running for several hours. [...] Because {{the sanctuary}} floor was wooden <b>planks,</b> <b>water</b> seeped through causing damage in the basement, but did not cause compromise the structureal integrity of the building, nor did it interfere regularly-scheduled worship services. [...] One church official suspected that the damage was due a reaction to an article about All Saints' food pantry services, noting that individuals attending the All Saints food pantry events and the residents of Ravenswood were from economically disparate backgrounds. The article referred to {{the church as a}} place that keeps [...] "fellow citizens from drowning." [...] Others, however, believe that the vandalism was a basic prank.|$|R
500|$|The three then form a plan, {{which has}} Ed sitting {{alone on a}} bench in the {{playground}} with a [...] "Don't Touch!" [...] sign around his neck. Jonny (David Paul Grove) soon walks by, carrying his imaginary friend Plank, who is a board of wood. Impressed with Ed's hair cut, Jonny ignores the sign and rubs Plank against Ed's head. Eddy and Double D then jump out from behind a nearby bush and capture Jonny, accusing him of being the serial toucher. Eddy interrogates Jonny and Plank after tying them to chairs in Double Dee's garage and hooking them up to a homemade lie detector. However, when they give him no answers, he resorts to using chinese <b>water</b> torture on <b>Plank.</b> This makes Jonny need to use the bathroom and in his desperation, he falsely confesses to the crime. The Eds then collect their money and punish Jonny by trapping him in a tire.|$|R
60|$|Upon the {{following}} day the ship anchored, and remained for two days in some port. Provisions were brought on board and carried down into the hold, and the prisoners {{had no doubt that}} they were in harbour on the coast of either Sicily, or the south of Italy. They had not set sail many hours, when the motion of the ship told them that the wind was getting up, and by night the vessel was rolling heavily, the noise made by the dashing of the <b>water</b> against her <b>planks</b> being so great, that those below could scarcely hear each other speak. Their spirits had risen with the increase of the motion, for the opportunity for which they had been waiting was now at hand. In a gale the vessels would keep well apart from each other, to prevent the danger of a collision, and any outcry would be drowned by the noise of the wind and water.|$|R

60|$|Coming back {{we saw a}} gang of half-grown boys bathing {{from the}} slimy shoals, running down to the <b>water</b> on <b>planks</b> laid over them, and {{splashing}} joyously into the filthy solution with the inextinguishable gladness of their years. They looked like boys out of the purlieus of Dickens's poverty-world, and all London waterside apparitions {{are more or less}} from his pages. The elderly waiter of the forlorn out-dated hotel to which we went for our whitebait lunch at Greenwich was as much of his invention as if he had created him from the dust of the place, and breathed his elderly-waiter-soul into him. He had a queer pseudo-respectful shuffle and a sidelong approach, with a dawning baldness {{at the back of his}} head, which seemed of one quality with these characteristics: his dress-coat was lustrous with the greasiness of long serving. Asked for whitebait, he destroyed the illusion in which we had come at a blow. He said he could send out and get us some whitebait if we could wait twenty minutes, but they never had any call for it now, and they did not keep it. Then he smiled down upon us out of an apparently humorous face in which there was no real fun, and added that we could have salmon mayonnaise at once. Salmon mayonnaise was therefore what we had, and except that it was not whitebait, it was not very disappointing; we had not expected much of it. After we had eaten it, we were put in relations with the landlord, regarding a fly which we wished to take for a drive, in the absence of whitebait. But a fly required, in Greenwich, an interview with a stableman and a negotiation which, though we were assured it would be fairly conducted, we decided to forego, and contented ourselves with exploring the old hostelry, close and faint of atmosphere and of a smell at once mouldy and dusty. The room that was called Nelson's, for no very definite reason, and the room in which the ministry used to have their whitebait dinners in the halcyon days before whitebait was extinct in Greenwich, pretended to some state but no beauty, and some smaller dining-rooms that overhung the river had the merit of commanding a full view of the Isle of Dogs, and in the immediate foreground--it was as much earth as water that lapped the shore--a small boy wading out to a small boat and providing himself a sorrowful evening at home with his mother, by soaking his ragged sleeves and trousers in the solution. Some young men in rowing costume were vigorously pulling in a heavy row-boat by way of filling in their outing; a Dutch steamer, whose acquaintance we had made in coming, was hurrying to get out of the river into the freshness of the sea, and this was all of Greenwich as a watering-place which we cared to see.|$|R
