25|$|In 1990, {{he flew to}} Baghdad {{to attempt}} to {{negotiate}} the release of aircraft passengers and other British nationals taken hostage <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> invaded Kuwait. After the events of Black Wednesday in 1992, he stated in the House of Commons that government should build a fund of reserves to counter currency speculators.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, the Iraqi Special Tribunal {{announced}} that Saddam Hussein and six co-defendants would face trial on 21 August 2006, {{in relation to}} the Anfal campaign. In December 2006 Saddam was put on trial for the genocide during Operation Anfal. The trial for the Anfal campaign was still underway on 30 December 2006, <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> was executed {{for his role in the}} unrelated Dujail Massacre.|$|E
25|$|Iraq {{had been}} {{listed as a}} State sponsor of {{terrorism}} by the U.S. since 1990, <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> invaded Kuwait. Iraq had also been on the list from 1979 to 1982; it was removed so that the U.S. could provide material support to Iraq in its war with Iran. Hussein's regime had {{proven to be a}} problem for the UN and Iraq's neighbors due to its use of chemical weapons against Iranians and Kurds in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Husseins</b> Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990, British Secretary of State for Defence Tom King soon {{announced}} that the UK military contribution to the region was to be increased. A coalition of nations was formed, and a combined naval force entered the Persian Gulf and sailed north, neutralising the Iraqi Navy as it went, and then began conducting naval gunfire support and mine counter-measure missions {{in preparation for the}} main amphibious landing force.|$|R
50|$|In the lead-up to the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq {{and during the}} fighting, Senor was a Pentagon and White House adviser based in Doha, Qatar, at U.S. Central Command Forward; he was subsequently based in Kuwait, working with General Jay Garner during {{the final days of}} the invasion and was in southern Iraq <b>when</b> the <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> regime fell.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} damage {{occurred in}} the early 1990s, <b>when</b> the <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> government of Iraq undertook a series of major destructive drainage projects, at least partly in reprisal for the 1991 uprisings. Reports suggested that {{the flow of the}} Euphrates had been diverted into the Third River, a huge drainage canal. By 2002, the Hammar Marshes and the Haur al-Hammar had entirely disappeared.|$|R
25|$|However, <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> rose to power, {{things began}} to change for the Assyrians in Iraq. Assyrians were {{deprived}} of their cultural and national rights {{while at the same}} time the Ba'athist regime tried to co-opt their history. The 1972 proclamation was reversed and Hussein began a strict campaign of Arabization on any non-Arabs in Iraq, including Assyrians as well as other groups such as Kurds, Iraqi Turkmen, and Armenians. During the Iran–Iraq War, many Assyrians were recruited to the armies of both sides. This resulted in Assyrians in Iraq killing Assyrians in Iran. It was estimated that 60,000 Assyrians were killed during the conflict.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> {{suppressed}} Kurdish uprisings in 1991, Archer, {{with the}} Red Cross, {{set up the}} charity Simple Truth, a fundraising campaign {{on behalf of the}} Kurds. In May 1991, Archer organised a charity pop concert, starring Rod Stewart, Paul Simon, Sting and Gloria Estefan, who all performed for free. Archer claimed that his charity had raised £57,042,000, though it was later revealed that only £3 million came from the Simple Truth concert and appeal, the rest from aid projects sponsored by the British and other governments, with significant amounts pledged before the concert. The charity would later result in further controversy. Having been previously rejected, Archer was made a life peer on 27 July 1992 as Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare, of Mark in the County of Somerset. Prime Minister John Major recommended him largely because of Archer's role in aid to the Kurds. Archer and Major had been friends for a number of years.|$|E
500|$|Halfway {{through the}} school year, Ali's family moves to the more {{peaceful}} Kurdish region in Northern Iraq but after living there for several months, Ali {{says that he is}} homesick and misses the action and noise of Baghdad. Mohammad, feeling lonely, [...] "adopts" [...] a bird with a broken wing and a mouse he finds in the house. This brings him some comfort, but his mother later demands that he get rid of the mouse as she does not want [...] "vermin" [...] in the house. Mohammad's family rejoice <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> is sentenced, and feel that his later execution was justified, as to do otherwise would have made the Iraqi people look weak. Conversely, Anmar's family is upset at his execution, as they feel that the people who came into power were no better than Hussein was. Hyder's mother says that many Iraqi people were hopeful about the arrival of American forces, and that it is wrong to blame America for all of the problems in Iraq. She notes that the bloodshed has yet to stop as the Sunni continues to kill the Shiite, and vice versa. As the film continues, Hyder's family loses its income and they start to sell their furniture to earn extra money.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> Iraqi President <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> {{began to}} redeploy his forces {{along the border}} of Kuwait in late 1994, Tripoli was sent as the initial show of force. Assuming duties with other ships in the Northern Persian Gulf, Tripoli {{prepared}} to conduct amphibious operations in response to any further Southward movement by Iraqi forces. Operation Vigilant Warrior resulted in the withdrawal of Husseins forces away from Kuwaits border.|$|R
50|$|A Map of Home {{is set in}} Palestinian-Israeli conflict, {{specifically}} {{during the}} Gulf War. The story is first set in Kuwait, then Egypt, and ends in Texas. There is political, cultural, and social turmoil throughout Kuwait, <b>when</b> eventually <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> invades Kuwait in 1990. This forces the family to flee to Kuwait. The author, Randa Jarrar, grew up in Kuwait and Egypt, moving to America soon after the Gulf War; This story is loosely autobiographical. A Map of Home discusses the Gulf War, warfare and bombings, the invasion of Kuwait, and more political and social turmoil.|$|R
5000|$|Almost all Muslim {{political}} and religious leaders condemned the attacks. The leaders vehemently denouncing the attacks included the leaders of Egypt (Hosni Mubarak), the Palestinian Authority (Yasser Arafat), Libya (Muammar Gaddafi), Syria (Bashar al-Assad), Iran (Mohamed Khatami) and Pakistan (Pervez Musharraf). The sole exception was Iraq, <b>when</b> the then-president <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> said of the attacks that [...] "the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity". Saddam would later offer sympathy to the Americans killed in the attacks.|$|R
2500|$|Iran {{has taken}} {{an active role in}} Iraq. Talks between the two nations (Iran and Iraq) have been successful, with Iran even {{going so far as to}} build a major Iranian Bank branch inside Iraq. Iran {{stresses}} that it supports the government of Iraq. Indeed, the main party that supports the Iraqi government and the US coalition, SCIRI, is also close to Iran. [...] Its leader, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, who has been invited at the White House, was a refugee in Iran <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> was the leader of Iraq. On 21 February 2007, his own son, coming from Iran with armed guards, was arrested by US forces and later released with excuses by US forces.|$|E
2500|$|The Iraqi Air Force {{was founded}} in 1931, during British control of Iraq after {{the defeat of the}} Ottoman Empire in WW1, with only a few pilots. Aside from a brief period during the Second World War, the Iraqi Air Force {{operated}} mostly British aircraft until the 14 July Revolution in 1958, when the new Iraqi government began increased diplomatic relationships with the Soviet Union. The air force used both Soviet and British aircraft throughout the 1950s and 1960s. <b>When</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> came to power in 1979, the air force grew very quickly when Iraq ordered more Soviet and French aircraft. Its peak came after the long and bloody Iran–Iraq War, which ended in 1988, when it consisted of 1029 aircraft of all types (of which 550 were combat ready), becoming the largest air force in the region. Its downfall came during the Gulf War (1990–91) and continued while coalition forces enforced no-fly zones. The remains of Iraq's air force were destroyed during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
50|$|Later, Salmasi trained Iraqi weightlifters and {{continued}} teaching Iranian students there. <b>When</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> took power, Salmasi left Iraq {{and moved to}} Iran with his family.|$|E
5000|$|The Columbia World Dictionary of Islamism reports that, {{having lost}} Saudi support <b>when</b> it {{supported}} <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> and Pakistani support after 1994, [...] "the remainder of Hizb-i Islami merged into al-Qaeda and the Taliban." [...] The Jamestown Foundation describes it having been [...] "sidelined from Afghan politics" [...] {{for a decade}} or so after the Taliban takeover of Kabul. Hekmatyar opposed the 2001 American attack on Afghanistan, and since then has aligned his group with remnants of the Taliban and al-Qaeda against the current Afghan government.|$|R
5000|$|When {{he became}} Mayor of Baghdad in early 1970s, {{he was more}} preoccupied by [...] "morality" [...] and [...] "righteous behaviour" [...] than other duties. He ordered the {{security}} service and police force to spray paint on legs of any woman wearing short skirts, and tearing the bell-bottom trousers worn by any male or female. These trousers were fashionable at the time. These actions against any [...] "Westernised" [...] contemporary trends only lasted {{for a few weeks}} and were terminated abruptly, probably <b>when</b> Vice President <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> intervened. These [...] "trendy" [...] fashions subsequently spread {{all over the country and}} ironically had been worn even by Talfah's own sons and daughters.|$|R
500|$|After {{four years}} of self-imposed exile Aflaq {{returned}} to Iraq In 1974, {{a year before the}} Lebanese Civil War broke out. He refrained from taking part in Iraqi politics. He published several works during this period, the most notable being The Struggle Against Distorting the Movement of Arab Revolution in 1975. Aflaq regained some of his influence <b>when</b> he befriended <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> President of Iraq from 1979 until 2003. During the Iran–Iraq War the Iranian leadership accused Hussein of being under the control of a Christian, and Aflaq himself was labelled [...] "a Christian infidel". Effectively, throughout his tenure as Secretary General in Iraq, Aflaq was given all due honour as the founder of the Ba'ath movement, but on policy-making, he was ignored.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> invaded Kuwait in 1990, Tom Lynch and {{his fellow}} {{contractors}} John White decided {{to get out of}} Iraq while they still could, but were captured by Iraqi soldiers and taken to a notorious prison in Baghdad, where they must listen to inmates being tortured to death.|$|E
50|$|Arba'een's {{performance}} has been banned in some periods, {{the last of}} which was <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> was president of Iraq. For nearly 30 years under Saddam's regime, it was forbidden to mark Arba'een publicly in Iraq. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the observance in April 2003 was broadcast worldwide.|$|E

50|$|Gujral {{resigned}} from the Indian National Congress party in the 1980s. Then he joined the Janata Dal. In the Indian general election, 1989, Gujral was elected from Jalandhar in Punjab. He served as Minister of External Affairs in Prime Minister V. P. Singh's eleventh cabinet of India. In 1989, Singh sent him to Srinagar {{to negotiate with the}} perpetrators of the 1989 kidnapping of Rubaiya Sayeed. He also brought about controversy during the Gulf War <b>when</b> he hugged <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> as a show-of-good-faith to ensure Indian expatriates would be safe. In the Indian general election, 1991, Gujral contested from Patna in Bihar. However, the election was countermanded following complaints of 'irregularities'. In 1992, Gujral was selected to the Rajya Sabha with the help of Lalu Prasad Yadav.|$|R

2500|$|In 2002, Goldberg's [...] "The Great Terror" [...] {{published}} in The New Yorker {{argued that the}} threat posed to America by <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> was significant, discussing the possible connection between <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> and Al Qaeda {{as well as the}} Iraqi nuclear program, averring that there was [...] "some debate among arms-control experts about exactly <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> will have nuclear capabilities.

There is little doubt what Saddam might do with an atomic bomb or with his stocks of biological and chemical weapons." ...|$|R
50|$|Revolutionary and counter-revolutionary: These {{can either}} be inspiring {{activity}} or counter activity, often against a violent state apparatus.

50|$|In 1987, Jamal {{together}} with his fellows in the army were accused to be against the Ba’athist regime, and 1988 were sentenced in a military court to serve time in jail. In 1990, they were released <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> decided to invade Kuwait, as he badly needed Sunni tribes to support his family and regime.|$|E
50|$|In August 1996 <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> {{appeared}} to be planning to invade Kuwait again, 3/8 CAV deployed along with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division to Kuwait for a combat mission. Upon arrival in theatre, Saddam Hussein withdrew his forces and the mission became a training mission. The battalion redeployed to Fort Hood in December.|$|E
50|$|Iraq-Saudi {{relations}} are {{the relations between}} the Republic of Iraq and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Under <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> relations were manageable, especially after the Iraq-Iran War began in 1980. These manageable relations were soon quelled at the Gulf War, <b>when</b> <b>Saddam's</b> Iraq invaded Kuwait, leading to international sanctions on Iraq and a significant deterioration in Iraqi-Saudi relations.|$|R

5000|$|Ayatollah Yousef Sanei said {{clerical}} {{authorities have}} quietly expressed {{opposition to the}} development {{of weapons of mass destruction}} for many years, and he described it as the reason that Iran never retaliated with chemical weapons <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> used them to kill Iranian troops and Iran-backed Kurds during the 1980- 88 Iran-Iraq war. [...] "You cannot deliberately kill innocent people," [...] he said.|$|E

Bush was apprehensive about the plan, prompting Thatcher to remark to him during a telephone conversation that [...] "This {{was no time to}} go wobbly!" [...] Thatcher's government supplied military forces to the international coalition in the build-up to the Gulf War, but she had resigned by the time hostilities began on 17 January 1991. She applauded the coalition victory as a backbencher, but warned that [...] "the victories of peace will take longer than the battles of war". It has since been made public that Thatcher suggested threatening Saddam with chemical weapons after the invasion of Kuwait.|$|R
