5|$|Despite such unpromisingly reactionary trappings the Schimmelpenninck regime {{actually}} accomplished more in its short existence {{than the}} previous regimes had accomplished in the ten years since 1795. This <b>was,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> mainly due to the diligent preparatory work that Agents like the ubiquitous Gogel; Johannes Goldberg, for National Economy; and Johannes van der Palm, for National Education; had done.|$|E
5|$|What {{were the}} factors {{leading to the}} first {{escapement}} clock in China? The chief tradition leading to Yi Xing (AD 725) <b>was</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> the succession of 'pre-clocks' which had started with Zhang Heng about 125. Reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow turning movement of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes {{by means of a}} water-wheel using clepsydra drip, which intermittently exerted the force of a lug to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar-axis shaft. Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere, and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which had become so widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century.|$|E
5|$|While Speer had {{tremendous}} power, he <b>was</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> subordinate to Hitler. Nazi officials sometimes went around Speer by seeking direct {{orders from the}} dictator. When Speer ordered peacetime building work suspended, the Gauleiters (Nazi Party district leaders) obtained an exemption for their pet projects. When Speer sought the appointment of Hanke as a labor czar to optimize the use of German and slave labor, Hitler, {{under the influence of}} Martin Bormann, instead appointed Fritz Sauckel. Rather than increasing female labor and taking other steps to better organize German labor, as Speer favored, Sauckel advocated importing more slave labour from the occupied nations– and did so, obtaining workers for (among other things) Speer's armament factories, often using the most brutal methods.|$|E

5|$|I <b>was</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> {{happy to}} meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
5|$|Martinengo {{had been}} ill {{for some time}} before his death and had left the music of San Marco in a fragile state. The choir had been {{neglected}} and the administration overlooked. When Monteverdi arrived to take up his post, his principal responsibility was to recruit, train, discipline and manage the musicians of San Marco (the capella), who amounted to about 30 singers and six instrumentalists; the numbers could be increased for major events. Among the recruits to the choir was Francesco Cavalli, who joined in 1616 {{at the age of}} 14; he was to remain connected with San Marco throughout his life, and was to develop a close association with Monteverdi. Monteverdi also sought to expand the repertory, including not only the traditional a cappella repertoire of Roman and Flemish composers, but also examples of the modern style which he favoured, including the use of continuo and other instruments. Apart from this he <b>was</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> expected to compose music for all the major feasts of the church. This included a new mass each year for Holy Cross Day and Christmas Eve, cantatas in honour of the Venetian Doge, and numerous other works (many of which are lost). Monteverdi was also free to obtain income by providing music for other Venetian churches and for other patrons, and was frequently commissioned to provide music for state banquets. The Procurators of San Marco, to whom Monteverdi was directly responsible, showed their satisfaction with his work in 1616 by raising his annual salary from 300 ducats to 400.|$|E

The riddle also appears in the riddles of Gestumblindi in Hervarar saga.|$|E
25|$|George Berkeley {{argued in}} Alciphron {{that the lack}} of human {{artifacts}} in deeper excavations suggested a recent origin of man. Evidence of absence <b>was,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> seen as problematic to establish. Gottfried Leibniz in his Protogaea produced arguments against identification of a species via morphology, without evidence of descent (having in mind a characterisation of humans by possession of reason); and against the discreteness of species and their extinction.|$|E

25|$|The Flamingos, a Dutch touring side, {{was formed}} in 1921, and later made several tours of England. Tours by English teams also {{continued}} in this period. The 1930s {{are said to be}} the heyday of Dutch cricket. In 1934, the first Dutch women's league was formed, and the women's national team played two games against Australia in 1937, losing heavily in both. Cricket <b>was</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> curtailed after the German invasion in 1940.|$|E
25|$|The roundarm {{controversy}} {{came to a}} head {{before the}} 1827 season and MCC agreed to the staging of three trial matches between Sussex and All-England. Roundarm's supporters made the grandiose claim that their campaign was a march of intellect. It is difficult to discern anything intellectual about propelling a cricket ball with arm outstretched vis-à-vis propelling it with hand below elbow, but there we are. What the bowlers were really after <b>was</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> to claim an advantage over the batsmen.|$|E
25|$|Cutting a leg-break {{is always}} dangerous, and cutting Wright {{is a form}} of suicide. Why a bowler of his skill failed to get more test-match wickets always mystified me; there <b>was</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> the marked {{tendency}} to bowl no-balls, but he sent down so many good ones, and worried and beat the batsmen so often, that he should have had better results...he seemed always likely to get wickets. It is one of the toughest problems of captaincy to know when to remove a man like that from the firing -line.|$|E

25|$|Their state {{reflected}} the general languishing {{of the war}} spirit on both sides, not on one only, as Charles discovered {{when he learned that}} Lord Wilmot, the lieutenant-general of his horse, was in correspondence with Essex. Wilmot <b>was</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> placed under arrest, and was replaced by the dissolute General Goring. But it was unpleasantly evident that even gay cavaliers of the type of Wilmot had lost the ideals for which they fought. Wilmot had come to believe that the realm would never be at peace while Charles was King.|$|E
25|$|In 1939 Helms {{had married}} Julia Bretzman Shields, a sculptress six years his senior. Julia brought two {{children}} into the marriage James and Judith. Together they had a son Dennis, who {{as a young man}} briefly worked at CIA; he later became a lawyer. Julia apparently favored the Democratic Party. Helms <b>was,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> very non-committal politically. He played tennis. This marriage came to an end in 1967. Later Helms married Cynthia McKelvie, originally from England. She would write two books, both of which included her public experiences during their long marriage.|$|E
