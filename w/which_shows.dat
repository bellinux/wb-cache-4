40|$|Temperature-sensitive mutants of {{adenovirus}} type 5 {{have been}} examined by various serological techniques. Cells infected with these mutants at the non-per-missive temperature responded in different ways and four main serological groups could be assigned {{on the basis of}} complement fixation tests, namely group I, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> no major differences in the production of capsid antigens; Group II, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> no production of any of the capsid antigens; Group III, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> no production of fibre antigen; and Group IV, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> limited production of hexon antigen and variable yields of penton base antigen. Fluorescent antibody tests further subdivided the latter group into mutants <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> no production of hexon antigen and those <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> production of hexon antigen, although with an abnormal distribution. These results were in good agreement with the complementation data although within most of the serological groupings there was more than one complementation group...|$|R
