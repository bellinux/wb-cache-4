5|$|Edwards' next {{fraudulent}} scheme involved forging {{letters to}} cotton brokers in New Orleans, {{and using the}} signatures obtained from their replies to forge letters to brokers in New York City, saying that the fake John Caldwell– Edwards' alias– had {{a large amount of}} cotton on deposit with the New Orleans brokers. Edwards used those letters to secure fraudulent loans from brokers on the security of the non-existent cotton. Two New York brokers– Brown Bros. & Co. and Jacob Little– gave Edwards bank drafts for $25,000 each. Edwards then cashed the drafts pretending to be Caldwell, but without attempting to disguise his appearance. Unluckily for Edwards, in September 1841 Brown Brothers was informed by the New Orleans brokers that there was no cotton on account for Caldwell, and this prompted the bankers to offer a reward for information on the forger. The police began to search for the forger of the letters, but were unsuccessful until Edwards attempted to distract their attention to an acquaintance, Alexander Powell, who happened to look much like him. Edwards sent an anonymous letter to the New York police, stating that the forger they were hunting was sailing to England, as Powell <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Edwards assumed that by the time the police acted, Powell's ship would already have sailed. The ship was delayed and the police were able to catch Powell, who told them that Edwards was their forger.|$|E
25|$|There {{was now a}} tumult arisen at Alexandria, {{between the}} Jewish {{inhabitants}} and the Greeks; and three ambassadors were chosen out of each party that were at variance, who came to Gaius. Now one of these ambassadors from the people of Alexandria was Apion, (29) who uttered many blasphemies against the Jews; and, among other things that he said, he charged them with neglecting the honors that belonged to Caesar; for that while all who were subject to the Roman empire built altars and temples to Gaius, and in other regards universally received him as they received the gods, these Jews alone thought it a dishonorable thing for them to erect statues in honor of him, {{as well as to}} swear by his name. Many of these severe things were said by Apion, by which he hoped to provoke Gaius to anger at the Jews, as he was likely to be. But Philo, the principal of the Jewish embassage, a man eminent on all accounts, brother to Alexander the Alabarch, (30) and one not unskillful in philosophy, was ready to betake himself to make his defense against those accusations; but Gaius prohibited him, and bid him begone; he was also in such a rage, that it openly appeared he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them some very great mischief. So Philo being thus affronted, went out, and said to those Jews who were about him, that they should be of good courage, since Gaius's words indeed showed anger at them, but in reality had already set God against himself.|$|E

500|$|Isaacson {{completed}} forty-five sorties with Bomber Command, {{when the}} likelihood of surviving an operational tour of thirty missions was never more than 50% and, at times, much less. Promoted to acting flight lieutenant, he was chosen in May 1943 to captain Lancaster Q-for-Queenie on a landmark flight from England to Australia across the Pacific Ocean, and then from Melbourne to New Zealand and back, non-stop in both directions. He was awarded the Air Force Cross on 27August 1943 for this mission, the citation noting that it was [...] "the first occasion on which an aircraft has flown to Australia by this route and the direct flights between Melbourne and New Zealand are the first of their kind". The Lancaster was brought to Australia {{so that it could}} serve as a template for local production of the type, but this never took place and it was instead used for exhibition flights to encourage purchase of war bonds. On 22October 1943 Isaacson flew Q-for-Queenie under the Sydney Harbour Bridge, flouting a 1931 regulation that prohibited such activity; the Lancaster remains the largest aircraft to have been flown under the bridge. Isaacson gave his crew no warning of what he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and when asked later why he did it, replied [...] "Because it was there". It was, however, reported {{at the time that he}} undertook the stunt to support the war loan effort for which he and his crew were actively fundraising.|$|E
500|$|Production in Sydney {{commenced}} {{the week}} beginning 1 October and lasted for 18 days. The main cast and Sean Pertwee were flown out {{along with a}} skeleton crew. Additional staff were drawn from those already working for Granada Australia, the Australian production arm of Granada Productions, as flying a complete British crew overseas would have been prohibitively expensive. Filming locations included Hyde Park, Kirribilli, Double Bay and the Northern Beaches. The scenes of Shawn's barbecue were filmed in Palm Beach and the facade of a terraced house in Paddington was used for an establishing scene of Lucy's apartment. The wedding scenes were set in the grounds of Strickland House, Vaucluse. Another scene was filmed on location outside the Sydney Opera House. While preparing for the scene, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst were distracted {{by a group of}} British tourists yelling that Karen should leave David after David's affair in Series 3. The group remained quiet when the scene was being shot. Karen and David's apartment was filmed at a building near Luna Park in Milsons Point. A stunt team co-ordinated the fight scene between Mark and David but could not convincingly choreograph a headbutt between Mark and David. The stunt co-ordinator and Pertwee, who was already experienced in stunt fighting, agreed Pertwee would get a better reaction from Bathurst by almost headbutting his face for real, instead of [...] "hitting air". Initially startled by the move, Bathurst conceded that it was better for him to be surprised as he might have flinched if he had known what Pertwee <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Hermione Norris found the scene upsetting insofar as it was unusual to see Robert Bathurst playing David in such an emotional state.|$|E

Pharaoh told Joseph his dreams, and Joseph told him that the two dreams were one, a prediction of what God <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The seven good cattle and the seven good ears symbolized seven years of plenty, and the seven lean cattle and the seven empty ears symbolized seven years of famine that would consume thereafter. The dream was doubled because God had established the thing and would shortly bring it to pass. Joseph recommended that Pharaoh set over Egypt a man discreet and wise, that he appoint overseers to take up a fifth of the harvests during the years of plenty, and that he store that food for the years of famine. Pharaoh agreed, questioning whether anyone could find a man such as Joseph in whom the spirit of God was. The second reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

The men went on to Sodom, while Abraham remained standing before God. Abraham pressed God whether God would sweep away the innocent along with the guilty, asking successively if there were 50, or 45, or 40, or 30, or 20, or 10 innocent people in Sodom, would God not spare the city {{for the sake of the}} innocent ones, and each time God agreed to do so.

Eyewitness accounts of the event differ at this point, but Moss did not comply with the officer's order, and she was bumped by his vehicle and fell to the ground. Moss was arrested, and a search of his vehicle revealed a joint amounting to less than a gram of marijuana in his ashtray. Initially charged with felony Suspicion of Assault with a Deadly Weapon and a misdemeanor marijuana possession, Moss spent the night in jail and was released the following morning. [...] Moss pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor traffic violation and was ordered to pay a $1,200 fine and perform 40 hours of community service. While the criminal charges were thus disposed of, the civil lawsuit filed by the traffic control officer brought a substantial penalty fine [...] "in the low to mid six figures".

The 8th Infantry Regiment was ordered to make the initial D-Day landing on Utah Beach as part of the invasion. [...] As they sailed to France from England on the night of June5 aboard the navy's USS Barnett on the rough English channel, they heard Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower's exhortation to the troops over the radio, [...] "Together, we shall achieve victory". Afterwards, the company commanders were summoned by the 2nd Battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Carlton MacNeely, to Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.'s {{quarters}} for a final briefing before the invasion. When the meeting ended near midnight, Schroeder later recounted, the officers [...] "wished each other well and shook hands", and MacNeely put his arm around Schroeder's shoulders. Addressing the young captain by his nickname, [...] "Moose", MacNeely said, [...] "Well, Moose, this is it. Give 'em hell!" [...] Schroeder said they both [...] "choked up" [...] and he replied, [...] "Well, colonel, I'll see you on the beach!" [...] Roosevelt said, [...] "Moose, take me in your boat when you go ashore". At 2:30a.m. on June 6, Schroeder's company left the Barnett to board their LCVP landing craft.
