5|$|The Churches of Christ {{generally}} {{combine the}} lack of any historical evidence that the early church used musical instruments in <b>worship</b> and the belief that there is no scriptural support for using instruments in the church's <b>worship</b> service to decide that instruments should not be used today in <b>worship.</b> Churches of Christ have historically practiced a cappella music in <b>worship</b> services.|$|E

5|$|Christian Lee Novetzke of the University of Washington {{suggests}} that Vithoba's <b>worship</b> migrated from Karnataka to the formerly Shaiva city of Pandharpur {{some time before}} 1000CE; but under the possible influence of a Krishna-worshipping Mahanubhava sect, the town {{was transformed into a}} Vaishnava center of pilgrimage. This proposal is consistent with contemporary remnants of Shaiva <b>worship</b> in the town.|$|E

Her <b>worship</b> is also prescribed for those who wish to defeat their foes. Dhumavati's <b>worship</b> is considered ideal for unpaired members of society, such as bachelors, widows, and world renouncers as well as Tantrikas. In her Varanasi temple, however, she transcends her inauspiciousness and acquires the status of a local protective deity. There, even married couples <b>worship</b> her.

5|$|Gods were worshiped in cult temples {{administered}} by priests {{acting on the}} king's behalf. At {{the center of the}} temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public <b>worship</b> or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public <b>worship.</b> Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could <b>worship</b> private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos. After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct <b>worship</b> of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.|$|E

Dhumavati is also described a being partial to single persons and especially partial to widows. Widows are considered the only beings who can withstand her power.|$|E
