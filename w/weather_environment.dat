2500|$|The {{choice of}} holding the Super Bowl {{outdoors}} in a cold <b>weather</b> <b>environment</b> generated some controversy. When it was released in August 2013, the [...] "Winter Outlook" [...] section in the 2014 Farmers' Almanac predicted that a winter storm would hit {{just about the time}} Super Bowl XLVIII kicked off; this generated the attention of several media sources, including ESPN's Rick Reilly in a piece that aired on ESPN's Monday Night Countdown on October 21, 2013. In a radio interview broadcast on WFAN, Fox studio analyst Terry Bradshaw stated that he opposes the idea of a cold Super Bowl, stating [...] "I don't want it to be bad ... What if we get two passing teams?" [...] In a piece published on Sports Illustrateds [...] "Monday Morning Quarterback" [...] site, Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman also opposed holding the game at MetLife Stadium, stating that [...] "it's the league's responsibility to show its audience the best possible product, and this can't happen in the snow". The decision to play the game in New Jersey was made even more controversial {{by the fact that the}} NFL informed the Miami Dolphins that Sun Life Stadium would never host another Super Bowl until they put a roof over the stadium for fear of rain.|$|E

50|$|To {{determine}} how accurate EPDs are for an individual, samples {{of all of}} a bull’s offspring are looked at and compared to what their expected outcome should have been. The EPDs can then be changed based on the values that are gathered. The higher the accuracy rate, the closer most of the progeny will be to the EPD values listed. Accuracy is not an indicator of beneficial EPDs, but rather shows how close the EPD is to the true genetic potential of the animal. The closer an accuracy value is to 1, the more accurate the EPDs can be thought to be. Other factors can affect the progeny as well, such as non genetic effects including feed, <b>weather,</b> <b>environment,</b> as well as random Mendelian sampling.|$|E
