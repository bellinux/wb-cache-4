25|$|Conservation – As {{with the}} {{intraspecific}} relationship, the interspecific O–A relationship implies that species <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> {{at risk of}} extinction due to low abundance, but because species with low abundance {{are expected to have}} restricted distributions, they are at risk of local catastrophe leading to global extinction. This may be confounded by the difficulty in surveying locally rare species due to both their low detectability, and restricted distribution (see above). Finally, because rare species are expected to have restricted distributions, conservation programmes aimed at prioritizing sites for multi-species conservation will include fewer habitats for rare species than common species.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} a {{suspicion}} of cancer, biopsy is performed, usually under general anaesthetic. This provides histological proof of cancer type and grade. If the lesion appears to be small and well localised, the surgeon may undertake excision biopsy, where an attempt is made to completely remove the tumour {{at the time of}} first biopsy. In this situation, the pathologist <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> able to confirm the diagnosis, but can also comment on the completeness of excision, i.e., whether the tumour has been completely removed. A full endoscopic examination of the larynx, trachea, and esophagus is often performed at the time of biopsy.|$|E

50|$|The crucial {{decade of}} his career was that {{between the end of}} World War I and the Wall Street Crash.

2500|$|There {{are several}} Christian eschatologies that further define the New Covenant. [...] For example, an inaugurated eschatology defines and {{describes}} the New Covenant {{as an ongoing}} relationship between Christian believers and God that will be in full fruition after the Second Coming of Christ; that is, it <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> in full fruition in believing hearts, but in the future external world as well. The connection between the Blood of Christ and the New Covenant is seen in most modern English translations of the New Testament {{such as in the}} statement: [...] "this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood".|$|E
2500|$|Woodhouse and Collingridge {{claim that}} the essence of being “strategic” lies in a {{capacity}} for [...] "intelligent trial-and error" [...] rather than strict adherence to finely honed strategic plans. Strategy {{should be seen as}} laying out the general path rather than precise steps. Means are as likely to determine ends as ends are to determine means. [...] The objectives that an organization might wish to pursue are limited by the range of feasible approaches to implementation. (There will usually be {{only a small number of}} approaches that <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> technically and administratively possible, but also satisfactory to the full range of organizational stakeholders.) In turn, the range of feasible implementation approaches is determined by the availability of resources.|$|E

50|$|EPSSs {{can help}} an {{organization}} {{to reduce the}} cost of training staff while increasing productivity and performance. They can empower employees to perform tasks with a minimum amount of external intervention or training.

The actual soldier of 1862-'65, North and South, with all his ways, his incredible dauntlessness, habits, practices, tastes, language, his fierce friendship, his appetite, rankness, his superb strength and animality, lawless gait, and a hundred unnamed lights and shades of camp, I say, will never be written--perhaps must {{not and should not}} be.|$|R
2500|$|Human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA) typing of embryos, so {{that the}} child's HLA matches a sick sibling, availing for cord-blood stem cell donation. The child is in this sense a [...] "savior sibling" [...] for the recipient child. HLA typing has meanwhile become an important PGD indication in those countries where the law permits it. The HLA matching can be combined with the diagnosis for monogenic diseases such as Fanconi anaemia or beta thalassemia in those cases where the ailing sibling is affected with this disease, {{or it may be}} exceptionally performed on its own for cases such as children with leukaemia. The main ethical argument against is the possible exploitation of the child, although some authors maintain that the Kantian imperative is not breached since the future donor child <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> a donor but also a loved individual within the family.|$|E
2500|$|Liane Bonin Starr of HitFix {{also gave}} the episode a {{positive}} review, opining that [...] "the show kicks off with one [...] I think (and hope) <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> great, naughty fun {{but will also}} help to aggregate storylines that started to feel scattered and rambling last season." [...] Alyse Whitney of Wetpaint praised the beginning scene with Emma giving birth, saying [...] "the one standout moment {{was in the first}} minutes, showcasing Jennifer Morrison’s best acting to date. As Emma gave birth to Henry — and the electricity flickered, which could be a hint at her magic — and then refused to see him since she [...] "can’t be a mother," [...] our hearts sank. It was an emotional way to kick things off, but was the perfect way to show how far she’s come as she heads to save Henry with everyone on the Jolly Roger." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his public}} {{statements}} and private correspondence, Lee {{argued that a}} tone of reconciliation and patience would further the interests of white Southerners better than hotheaded antagonism to federal authority {{or the use of}} violence. Lee repeatedly expelled white students from Washington College for violent attacks on local black men, and publicly urged obedience to the authorities and respect for law and order. In 1869–70 he was a leader in successful efforts to establish state-funded schools for blacks. He privately chastised fellow ex-Confederates such as Jefferson Davis and Jubal Early for their frequent, angry responses to perceived Northern insults, writing in private to them as he had written to a magazine editor in 1865, that [...] "It should be the object of all to avoid controversy, to allay passion, give full scope to reason and to every kindly feeling. By doing this and encouraging our citizens to engage in the duties of life with all their heart and mind, with a determination not to be turned aside by thoughts of the past and fears of the future, our country <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> restored in material prosperity, but will be advanced in science, in virtue and in religion." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the {{historian}} Benny Morris, documents show that Jabotinsky favored {{the idea of}} the transfer of Arab populations if required for establishing a (still-proposed) Jewish state. Jabotinsky's other writings state, [...] "We do not want to eject even one Arab from either the left or the right bank of the Jordan River. We want them to prosper both economically and culturally. We envision the regime of Jewish Palestine [...] as follows: most of the population will be Jewish, but equal rights for all Arab citizens <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> guaranteed, they will also be fulfilled." [...] Jabotinsky was convinced {{that there was no way}} for the Jews to regain any part of Palestine without opposition from the Arabs. In 1934, he wrote a draft constitution for the Jewish state which declared that Arabs would be on an equal footing with their Jewish counterparts [...] "throughout all sectors of the country's public life." [...] The two communities would share the state's duties, both military and civil service, and enjoy its prerogatives. Jabotinsky proposed that Hebrew and Arabic should enjoy equal status, and that [...] "in every cabinet where the prime minister is a Jew, the vice-premiership shall be offered to an Arab and vice versa." ...|$|E

The second part then evaluates the CAPEX and OPEX performance of Ethernet core networks and competitive network architectures. The results propose that Ethernet <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> soon <b>be</b> mature enough for deployment in backbone networks but also provide huge cost advantages to providers. A novel complete, cost-effective and service-oriented infrastructure layer in the area of core networks will arise.

6000|$|THE TENTH DIRECTION.--Cry to God that {{he would}} inflame thy will also with the things of the other world. For when a man's will is fully set to do such or such a thing, then {{it must be a}} very hard matter that shall hinder that man from {{bringing}} about his end. When Paul's will was set resolvedly to go up to Jerusalem, (though it was signified to him before, what he should there suffer,) he was not daunted at all. Nay, saith he, [...] "I <b>am</b> ready (or <b>willing)</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> to <b>be</b> bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus." [...] His will was inflamed by love to Christ; and therefore, all the persuasions, that could be used wrought nothing at all.|$|R

60|$|Should {{the reader}} require an example {{a little more}} within {{historical}} range, or a little more subject to critical tests, than the above prehistoric anecdote (which I need not say was revealed {{to me in a}} vision) it would be easy enough to supply them both in a hypothetical and a historical form. It is obvious enough in a general way that if we begin to subject diverse countries to an identical test, there <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> rivalry, but what is far more deadly and disastrous, superiority. If we institute a competition between Holland and Switzerland as to the relative grace and agility of their mountain guides, it will be clear that the decision is disproportionately easy; it will also be clear that certain facts about the configuration of Holland have escaped our international eye. If we establish a comparison between them in skill and industry in the art of building dykes against the sea, it will be equally clear that the injustice falls the other way; it will also be clear that the situation of Switzerland on the map has received insufficient study. In both cases there <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> rivalry but very unbalanced and unjust rivalry; in both cases, therefore, there <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> enmity but very bitter or insolent enmity. But so long as the two are sharply divided there can be no enmity because there can be no rivalry. Nobody can argue about whether the Swiss climb mountains better than the Dutch build dykes; just as nobody can argue about whether a triangle is more triangular than a circle is round.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{interpret}} {{the problem of}} “climate change” in relation to Heidegger's critics of metaphysics and its accomplishment, the technical era.

With {{the domain of the}} <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> nature <b>is</b> reduced to a mere source of resources, but also the reality in general <b>is</b> understood <b>only</b> as objectivity. Its counterpart is the serenity. We will see that the serenity is based on a phenomenological-ethical approach that aspires to be a rescue of things. That ethical dimension will be discovered as a rescue of the others (things, nature and human beings) and even as love. Finally we will argue that climate change does not require an environmental ethics, but rather an ethics of letting be...|$|R
