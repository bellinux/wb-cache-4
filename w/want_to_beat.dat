We are quite used to that though as we have had some big fights in the past four or five years." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He is a queer fellow," [...] Pinkerton said, [...] "one {{never knows}} {{what he can do}} and what he can't. At the last exam Glover said that the papers he sent in were far and away the best, but that he had only done the {{difficult}} questions and hadn't sent in any answers at all to the easy ones, so that instead of coming in first he was five or six down the list. I believe myself he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> me, because if he had he would have been head of the house, {{and that would have been}} altogether too much trouble for him.
