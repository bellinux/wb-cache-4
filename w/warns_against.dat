5|$|Fairman {{discusses}} {{the efforts of}} conservatives in the United States to censor the word from common parlance in the country, and says these acts {{are opposed to the}} First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fairman <b>warns</b> <b>against</b> a tendency toward self-censorship. He explains that those who choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process. He argues that this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word.|$|E
5|$|Wary {{and quick}} to flee, leopard sharks pose almost no danger to humans. There {{is a single}} record from 1955 of a leopard shark harassing a skin diver with a nosebleed, though no {{injuries}} resulted. This species is caught by commercial fisheries using gillnets and longlines, and by recreational anglers and spearfishers; it is also caught as bycatch in bottom trawls. The meat is considered excellent eating and is sold fresh or frozen. However, leopard sharks living alongside human development may accumulate pollutants such as mercury, pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) within their bodies, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife <b>warns</b> <b>against</b> eating them regularly. The leopard shark is prized by the aquarium trade for its attractive appearance and hardiness; this led to many newborn pups being captured with hook-and-line off southern California in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It may live for over 20 years in captivity.|$|E

25|$|In Spain, Ovid is both praised {{and criticized}} by Cervantes in his Don Quixote where he <b>warns</b> <b>against</b> satires that can exile poets, as {{happened}} to Ovid. In the 16th century, Ovid's works were criticized in England. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London ordered that a contemporary translation of Ovid's love poems be publicly burned in 1599. The Puritans {{of the following}} century viewed Ovid as pagan, thus as an immoral influence.|$|E
25|$|The Ebers Papyrus, conserved at the University of Leipzig, is {{considered}} one of the oldest treaties on medicine and the most important medical papyri. The text is dated to about 1550 BCE and measures 20 meters in length. The text includes recipes, a pharmacopoeia and descriptions of numerous diseases as well as cosmetic treatments. It mentions how to surgically treat crocodile bites and serious burns, recommending the drainage of pus-filled inflammation but <b>warns</b> <b>against</b> certain diseased skin.|$|E
25|$|The vǫlur {{were known}} for their art of seduction, {{which was one of}} the reasons why they were {{considered}} dangerous. One of the stanzas in Hávamál <b>warns</b> <b>against</b> sexual intercourse with a woman who is skilled in magic, because the one who does so runs the risk of being caught in a magic bond and also risks getting ill.

25|$|Conditions in the {{predominant}} agricultural sector kept deteriorating between 1929 and 1939, {{which resulted in}} rural unrest and a progressive radicalization of the Polish peasant movement that became increasingly inclined toward militant anti-state activities. It was firmly repressed by the authorities. According to Norman Davies, {{the failures of the}} Sanation regime (combined with the objective economic realities) caused a radicalization of the Polish masses {{by the end of the}} 1930s, but he <b>warns</b> <b>against</b> drawing parallels with the incomparably more destructive precedents of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union under Stalin.|$|E
25|$|The {{route from}} Scafell Pike to Scafell (or its reverse) {{is one of}} the most {{frustrating}} in the Lake District. What seems like a direct route is in fact very hazardous as it has to negotiate Broad Stand crag, which is a dangerous and exposed scramble that has caused many accidents and injuries. It is usually treated as a rock climb, with appropriate ropes and belay protection. Wainwright <b>warns</b> <b>against</b> its dangers to walkers. Its dangers are more obvious travelling from Scafell Pike, but travelling from Scafell, the route loses a lot of height before the danger is seen.|$|E
25|$|Marie de France's lai was {{composed}} {{at a time}} when the story of King Arthur was not fully developed, and probably before the story of the love between Lancelot and Queen Guinevere had been added to it by Chrétien de Troyes in his Knight of the Cart. Thomas Chestre describes a 10-year period during which Launfal prospers at Arthur's bachelor court, followed by Arthur's marriage to Guinevere. In the 13th-century French Arthurian romances, Merlin <b>warns</b> <b>against</b> this marriage; in Chestre's poem, he arranges it, betraying Chestre's willingness to adapt an established legend in his own way.|$|E

25|$|The Brisbane River {{is home to}} a {{very large}} {{population}} of bull sharks, thus swimming is not advised due to the dangers imposed by this predator. Ipswich City Council <b>warns</b> <b>against</b> swimming as far up as Colleges Crossing. There have been four recorded shark attack deaths in the river (1862, 1880, 1901 and 1921), and numerous other fatal attacks in surrounding rivers and estuaries. There have also been numerous attacks on family pets, such as dogs. The shark can be aggressive, grow up to between 7-11.5 feet (2.1-3.5 m) in length and is unusual for a shark species because it can inhabit water containing less than 50% seawater.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations Committee against Torture {{reports that}} the use of Tasers can be a form of torture, due to the acute pain they cause, and <b>warns</b> <b>against</b> the {{possibility}} of death in some cases. The use of stun belts has been condemned by Amnesty International as torture, not only for the physical pain the devices cause, but also for their heightened abuse potential. Amnesty International has reported several alleged cases of excessive electroshock gun use that possibly amount to torture. They have also raised extensive concerns about the use of other electro-shock devices by American police and in American prisons, as they can be (and according to Amnesty International, sometimes are) used to inflict cruel pain on individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} novel, The Writing on the Wall, an anti-war {{novel and}} roman à clef {{based on a}} possible John McCain presidency in 2008, <b>warns</b> <b>against</b> war with Iran by portraying a worst-case scenario of its outcomes. In it, author Hannes Artens portrays a global depression {{as a result of}} the oil price shooting past $140 per barrel and depicts the falsity of thinking that limited aerial strikes on Iran will end the problem. The story shows them eventually leading to a ground invasion and a military draft in the United States. The book ends with the Iran war escalating into a conflagration seizing the entire Middle East and ultimately culminates in a nuclear showdown between Pakistan and India after an Islamist coup in Pakistan.|$|E
