2500|$|Chief Red Shirt was lionized by the British {{press and}} photographed by reporters {{wherever}} he went. His handsome features and stately bearing caused reporters {{to hang on}} his every word and he became the most quoted Wild Wester celebrity of Cody’s trip to England. Red Shirt explained to a reporter from Sheffield: “I started from my lodge two moons ago knowing nothing, and had I remained on the Native Reservations, I should have been as a blind man. [...] Now I can see a new dawn. I have seen the great houses (ships) which cross the mighty waters, the great villages which have no end where the pale faces swarm like insects in the summer sun. Our people will wonder at these things <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> to the Native Reservation {{and tell them what}} we have seen.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The white man’s lodges for the Great Spirit, whose pinnacles {{reach the}} sky, and which have stood for more seasons than the red man reckon, all struck me with terrible wonder. And the Great Spirit speaks to me {{sometimes}} since I have been here. [...] When I {{was in the}} Great Spirit Lodge (Westminster Abbey) where the kings are buried, I laid my face upon my hands. [...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy. [...] Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw {{in a blaze of}} light the girls with wings and they beckoned me. [...] And I was so certain that what I saw was that, I called out to my young men who were with me ‘Come and see what this is,’ and the young men replied, “You have been dreaming.’ But what I saw was true, for when I looked around the great lodge afterwards, I saw on the walls the same girls with wings as I saw in my dreams. [...] Our people will wonder at these things, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> to the Native Reservation and tell them what we have seen.” ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{thing the}} commissioners {{did not learn}} before their {{departure}} was that General Sir Henry Clinton had been ordered to evacuate Philadelphia, even though his orders had been issued one month before they left. [...] Carlisle was {{of the opinion that}} the administration had done this intentionally, since they might not otherwise have gone at all. [...] Carlisle wrote to his wife of the situation, [...] "We all look grave, and perhaps we think we look wise. [...] I fear nobody will think so <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> ... I don't see {{what we have to do}} here." [...] Upon learning of the planned withdrawal, Carlisle appealed to Clinton to delay it, but, in rejecting the appeal, Clinton cited his orders to act without delay. This prompted Carlisle to observe that the administration wanted the commission to be [...] "a mixture of ridicule, nullity, and embarrassments." [...] Eden was upset that he wasn't told of Clinton's orders, since the British intent to withdraw further stiffened American resolve. [...] On June 13, the commissioners sent a package of proposals to Congress, which was then holding sessions in York, Pennsylvania. [...] Congress replied insisting that either American independence be recognised, or that all British forces first withdraw from the states, terms the commission was not authorised to accept. [...] The commission attempted to appeal to public opinion, with warnings of widespread destruction, but was unsuccessful. [...] Johnstone tried to bribe some Congressmen, and the Marquis de Lafayette challenged Carlisle to a duel over some anti-French statements he had made.|$|E
