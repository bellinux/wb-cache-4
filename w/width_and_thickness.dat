40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parametric {{study on the}} stability and control performance of proportional velocity feedback control with square piezoceramic patch actuators of various <b>widths</b> <b>and</b> <b>thicknesses,</b> used to suppress the vibration of a thin rectangular plate. A simple stability-performance formula has been derived, which, using the open loop sensor-actuator frequency response function, gives the maximum control performance that can be produced by such a feedback loop at resonance frequencies of the lower order modes of the plate. The parametric study {{has been carried out}} using simulated sensor-actuator frequency response functions. The results have been validated using measured frequency response functions on sets of rectangular panels with a square piezoceramic patch of various <b>widths</b> <b>and</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> The parametric study has shown that the control performance is significantly improved by increasing the <b>width</b> <b>and</b> reducing the <b>thickness</b> of the square actuator...|$|R

60|$|General Appearance.--Valves white, {{more or less}} {{translucent}} and thick, with a {{tinge of}} blueish-grey, from the underlying corium; sometimes brownish cream-coloured, rarely with a tint of purple. Surfaces smooth, with traces of very fine lines radiating from the umbones, sometimes rather plain on the basal part of the scuta. Length {{in proportion to the}} breadth of the capitulum variable, owing to the varying degree to which the scuta and terga have their apices produced. Scuta with the occludent margin either considerably curved or nearly straight. The internal tooth of the right-hand scutum, close to the umbo, varies in size and form, being either pointed, square, or obliquely truncated on either side, or it has a notch on the summit; internal basal rim of the scuta either plainly developed or nearly absent. In many specimens (Pl. I, fig. 1), on the scuta, or on the scuta and terga, (and sometimes more {{on one side of the}} individual than on the other,) a nearly straight line, running diagonally across the capitulum, of slight, quadrilateral depressions, of a dirty greenish colour, with the edges blending away, is either conspicuously developed, or can only just be discerned. These marks increase in size from the umbones to the margins of the valves. There are sometimes two or even three rows on the scuta. They are formed by the retention of a portion of the chitine membrane, which is cast off the rest of the surface; the margins of the valves are occasionally notched slightly on the line of marks; there is no difference along this line in the underlying corium. Specimens both with and without a barbed carina are thus characterised. Carina; the interspace between the carina and the scuta and terga is not wide. The carina exteriorly, is either convex and smooth, or furnished with knobs or with extremely sharp, long teeth (Pl. I, fig. 1 b); small specimens, with the capitulum under half an inch in length, are generally most strongly barbed.[26] Apex more or less acuminated; <b>width</b> <b>and</b> <b>thickness</b> variable; sides strongly furrowed. Fork (fig. 1 a) generally less wide than the widest upper part of the valve, with the two prongs diverging from each other at less than a right angle; their sharpness and precise form variable; rim between them reflexed (figs. 1 a and b), making a slight notch behind. Peduncle smooth, wrinkled, length in proportion to that of the capitulum varying, from barely equalling it, to six or seven times as long. I have noticed a specimen including mature ova, with a capitulum under half an inch long.|$|E

This is demonstrated with a series of high magnification images of the experimental observations for varying parylene strip <b>widths</b> <b>and</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> Thus, the findings demonstrate the possibility to culture cells on ultra-thin layers of parylene-C and localize single cells on thin strips. Such work is of interest and significance to the Neuroengineering and Multi-Electrode Array (MEA) communities, as it provides an alternative insulating material in the fabrication of embedded micro-electrodes, which can be used to facilitate single cell stimulation and recording in capacitive coupling mode...|$|R
