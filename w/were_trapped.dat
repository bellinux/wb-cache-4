5|$|Alex's outer rainbands {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} across Virginia, peaking at over 7inches (178mm) {{in the center}} of the state. The rainfall caused localized flooding, but there was no reported damage in the state. In Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, rip currents produced by the storm injured three people. A few young children had to be rescued when they <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> by a jetty. In New Jersey, the strong surf and rip currents hospitalized at least five swimmers.|$|E
50|$|A knight which reaches {{one of the}} two far ranks <b>is</b> <b>trapped,</b> as <b>is</b> a pawn which captures {{and thus}} {{promotes}} there. Likewise, a pawn that reaches the far rank <b>is</b> <b>trapped,</b> as <b>is</b> a knight which captures there. A lance <b>is</b> also <b>trapped</b> at the far rank, but can escape if it captures there and thus demotes to a silver. A silver which captures in the far rank and therefore promotes to a lance <b>is</b> <b>trapped.</b>|$|R

5|$|Approximately 1000 {{passengers}} <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> {{in darkness}} {{for several hours}} inside two Eurostar trains {{on the night of}} 19/20 February 1996. The trains stopped inside the tunnels due to electronic failures caused by snow and ice. Questions were raised at the time about the ability of the train and tunnel electronics to withstand the mix of snow, salt and ice which collect in the tunnels during periods of extreme cold.|$|E
5|$|Ferret-legging was an {{endurance}} test or stunt in which ferrets <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> in trousers worn by a participant. Also known as put 'em down and ferret-down-trousers, {{it seems to}} have been popular among coal miners in Yorkshire, England. Contestants put live ferrets inside their trousers; the winner is the one who is the last to release the animals. The world record is five hours and thirty minutes.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{during the}} Antarctic summer when {{phytoplankton}} bloom was apparent, {{the lake was}} studied, along with several others in the Vestfold Hills area to assess the reduced sulfuric gases by gas chromatography. The gases <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> in a solid adsorbent – a molecular sieve with 5 Å pores (80–100 mesh) – and reduced sulfur compounds (RSCs) were detected. The most apparent RSCs were dimethyl sulfide (DMS), carbonyl sulfide and hydrogen sulfide.|$|E

5|$|The {{extensive}} flooding stranded {{many residents}} who {{were forced to}} stay in place long after Hurricane Katrina had passed. Stranded survivors dotted the tops of houses citywide. Some <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> inside attics and were unable to escape. Many people chopped their way onto their roofs with hatchets and sledge hammers, which Mayor Nagin had residents urged to store in their attics in case of such events. Clean water was unavailable, and power outages were expected to last for weeks.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005 Uranus {{is known}} to have nine {{irregular}} moons, which orbit it at a distance much greater than that of Oberon, the furthest of the large moons. All the irregular moons are probably captured objects that <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> by Uranus soon after its formation. The diagram illustrates the orbits of those irregular moons discovered so far. The moons above the X axis are prograde, those beneath are retrograde. The radius of the Uranian Hill sphere is approximately 73million km.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse {{arrived at}} Cap-Français on 15 August. He {{immediately}} dispatched {{his response to}} Rochambeau's note, which {{was that he would}} make for the Chesapeake. Taking on 3,200 troops, De Grasse sailed from Cap-Français with his entire fleet, 28 ships of the line. Sailing outside the normal shipping lanes to avoid notice, he arrived at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay on August 30, and disembarked the troops to assist in the land blockade of Cornwallis. Two British frigates that were supposed to be on patrol outside the bay <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> inside the bay by de Grasse's arrival; this prevented the British in New York from learning the full strength of de Grasse's fleet until it was too late.|$|E

5|$|In New York City, {{more than}} 90% {{of the workers}} and {{visitors}} {{who died in the}} towers had been at or above the points of impact. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above the point of impact <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> and died of smoke inhalation, fell or jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed in the building's eventual collapse. The destruction of all three staircases in the tower when Flight 11 hit made it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact died as well.|$|E
5|$|On January 24, 1945, the 3rd Belorussian Front led by General Chernyakhovsky, {{surrounded}} {{the capital city}} of East Prussia, Königsberg. The 3rd Panzer Army and around 200,000 civilians <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> inside the city. In response to this, General Georg-Hans Reinhardt, commander of the Army Group Center, warned Hitler of the imminent Soviet threat, but the Führer refused to act. Due to the rapid approach of the 2nd Belorussian Front led by General Rokossovsky, Nazi authorities in Königsberg decided to send trains full of refugees to Allenstein, without knowing that the town had already been captured by the Soviet 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps.|$|E
5|$|The CGS {{warned that}} {{aftershocks}} were {{expected in the}} days following the earthquake and they could possibly continue for months. They recommended that buildings be evacuated {{in the event of an}} aftershock. The mining regulator's chief inspector of mines David Msiza asked mining companies in affected areas, including Klerksdorp, Carletonville and Rustenburg, to undertake underground inspections to ensure no miners <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> and the working conditions were safe for miners. AngloGold Ashanti denied responsibility for the earthquake, saying it occurred away from its mining infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|The carrier's crew {{suffered}} 811 fatalities, mainly {{among the}} aircraft mechanics and armorers stationed on the hangar decks and the ship's engineers, {{many of whom}} <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> below in the boiler and engine rooms by uncontrolled fires raging on the decks above them. Twenty-one of the ship's aviators were killed. The loss of Kaga and the three other IJN carriers at Midway (Hiryū was also sunk during the battle), with their aircraft and veteran pilots, was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage caused}} to the North Tower {{destroyed}} any {{means of escape}} at the impact zone or above it. All stairwells and elevators from the 92ndfloor up were rendered impassable, trapping 1,344people. According to the Commission Report, hundreds were killed instantly by the impact; the rest <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> and died from the subsequent fire and smoke, the eventual collapse, or (in some cases) after jumping or falling from the building. Elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel through the building. At least one elevator shaft carried burning fuel downward, exploding on the 77thfloor, the 22ndfloor, and at street level on the West Side Lobby.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the lahar {{contained}} boulders and cobbles which would have crushed anyone in their path, while the slower parts were dotted by fine, sharp stones which caused lacerations. Mud moved into open wounds and other open body parts – the eyes, ears, and mouth – and placed pressure capable of inducing traumatic asphyxia {{in one or two}} minutes upon people buried in it. Martí and Ernst state in their work Volcanoes and the Environment that they believe that many who survived the lahars succumbed to their injuries as they <b>were</b> <b>trapped,</b> or contracted hypothermia – though the latter is unlikely, given that survivors described the water as warm.|$|E

5|$|The known fossil {{material}} of Limusaurus consists of large assemblages of individuals mired in mud pits. These pits range in depth from , and were likely created by soil liquefaction from {{the footsteps of}} sauropods or other large dinosaurs. The size of these assemblages {{can be attributed to}} the tendency of smaller animals to become trapped in the mud (other animals that <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> by these deposits include individuals of Guanlong, along with small ornithischians, crocodyliforms, turtles, mammals, and tritylodontid cynodonts), and may also hint at the possible gregarious (group-living) tendencies of Limusaurus.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} his {{leadership}} and his coup d'œil, {{the ability to see}} at a glance what needed to be done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King's brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered Lusatia, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight.|$|E
5|$|As both battalions {{headed for}} the railway line, gliders {{carrying}} the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade's vehicles and artillery arrived at landing zone 'L'. The KOSB still defending the area were holding out against repeated German attacks but the landing ground was in range of the Germans guns. At the same time 10 Para, closely followed by German armoured vehicles and under mortar fire, reached the clearing. The leading companies had just cleared the woods and started across open ground when the gliders arrived. In the confusion, with both groups under fire, each thought {{the other was the}} enemy and began shooting back. The Polish anti-tank battery was virtually destroyed and although some vehicles got away the majority of their guns <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> in the burning gliders. Some of the pursuing German troops tried to cross the landing zone only to suffer heavy casualties {{at the hands of the}} defending KOSB companies. In the confusion, 'A' Company KOSB, covering the withdrawal of 10 Para, was cut off and eventually forced to surrender.|$|E
