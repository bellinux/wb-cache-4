Heavy, irreparable damage and near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other <b>wide</b> <b>span</b> overhang type <b>structures</b> are common. Mobile and manufactured homes are often flattened. Most trees, except for the heartiest, are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas.

40|$|AbstractOver {{the last}} few years our {{practice}} has been responsible for the structural design of a number of lightweight structures that achieve their structural stability by inflating elements of fabric structure. The paper will explain the design rationale of key examples; describing the structural forms, methods of analysis and design, and the detailing, materials, and methods of fabrication. The largest and most complex of these structures to date is a demountable stage set structure for the Cirque du Soleil “Toruk: First Flight” show, comprising two 15 metre high and 20 metre wide structures. The stage set structures form ‘trees’ on which acrobats climb and perform. Each structure incorporates a high level access gantry with acrobat suspension and counterweight systems, as well as a secondary inflatable skin cladding. The entire primary structure and cladding system is constructed from inflated fabric elements using internal pressures ranging from 0. 5 KN/m 2 up to 90 KN/m 2, and are deflated down to less than 5 % of their erected volume for transport between venues. Other examples of our work described will include temporary pavilions with clear spans of up to 25 metres, using a combination of air tight and air permeable elements. Also a range of <b>wide</b> <b>span</b> <b>structures</b> that we describe as “semi-permanent” that are capable of resisting full environmental wind and snow loading, and that are fully demountable but that can also be erected for extended periods of time in a single location...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{preliminary}} shape design of three-dimensional bridge <b>structures.</b> For crossing <b>wide</b> <b>spans,</b> lightweight truss <b>structures</b> are well-suited. Due to their complex equilibrium state involving a geometrically nonlinear behaviour, the generation of an equilibrated system requires numerical form finding methods, namely the force density method for truss structures. To enforce geometric restrictions, a constrained force density method is developed. Then, {{the scope of the}} form finding method is extended to the search of optimal configurations by combining the force density method with multiobjective genetic algorithms within an integrated design process. Large scale applications illustrate the proposed strategy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The world's first facility dedicated to hockey, the Westmount Arena was built in Montreal in 1898 while the first industrial refrigeration equipment for making artificial ice in Canada was installed in 1911 by Frank and Lester Patrick for their new arenas in Vancouver and Victoria. The Mutual Street Arena, with its artificial ice surface, was built in Toronto in 1912. With the development of <b>wide</b> <b>span</b> roof <b>structures</b> the construction of large indoor ice rink stadiums became possible. These two technologies were used to build the Montreal Forum, home of the legendary Montreal Canadiens hockey team, in Montreal in 1924 and Maple Leaf Gardens home of the Toronto Maple Leafs, in that city in 1931. Baseball's facilities were upgraded with construction of the new Maple Leaf Stadium on Lake Shore Boulevard in Toronto in 1926 and the De Lormier Downs Stadium (Hector Racine Stadium), in Montreal in 1927. Civic Stadium, now Ivor Wynne Stadium, was built in Hamilton, Ontario in 1930, to host the British Empire Games held there that year.|$|R

In the end, the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission (NFBC) paid the IRC $615,000 to purchase the right-of-way of the old bridge as well as the rights to construct the new one.The future Rainbow Bridge was royally dedicated by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth on June 7, 1939, just hours after the couple dedicated the QEW.|$|R
