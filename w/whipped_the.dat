25|$|In late 1852 {{one of his}} Chinese {{servants}} {{died after}} being accused of theft. Greenwell {{was arrested and charged}} with second degree murder. Asher B. Bates was prosecutor, William Little Lee judge, and a jury of British subjects was found for the trial in January 1853. Witnesses testified that Greenwell had beaten or <b>whipped</b> <b>the</b> man, but others said the man was already ill and that Greenwell treated his employees fairly.|$|E
25|$|He {{thought it}} was me at first and chatted away quite happily to Dave, whose French was near enough non-existent. Well, {{it was not long}} before he sensed {{something}} was wrong and <b>whipped</b> <b>the</b> scarf off the poor lad's face. He stormed over to my cabin and dragged me out, half asleep, on to the track. That was that! He and the other officials kept their eyes on us after that and we had little chance of getting away with any more larks like that.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>whip</b> cracker spins <b>the</b> <b>whip</b> {{anti-clockwise}} (if right-handed) {{over his}} or her head. When <b>the</b> <b>whip</b> is approximately 90 degrees {{to the right of}} <b>the</b> <b>whip</b> cracker, he or she swings <b>the</b> <b>whip</b> in <b>the</b> opposite direction. It is one of the simplest techniques, yet it {{can be one of the}} loudest used in whip cracking.|$|R
25|$|The fear of Japanese {{invasion}} {{during the}} Burma Campaign and the implementation {{by the military}} of a 'denial policy' implemented in 1942 caused considerable hardship to the delta region. A devastating cyclone and tidal waves <b>whipped</b> <b>the</b> coastal region on October 26 but relief efforts were hindered due to bureaucratic interference. On August 3, a number of prisoners were shot down in Dhaka jail but no inquiry could be held again due to bureaucratic intervention. Another severe strain on the administration was caused when the Congress launched the Quit India movement on August 9, which was followed by British political repression. The entire province reverberated with protest. The situation was further complicated when Mukherjee resigned bitterly complaining against the interference of the governor {{in the work of}} the ministry.|$|E
25|$|The British {{troops were}} horrified and enraged. Upon {{learning}} of the massacre, the infuriated British garrison engaged in a surge of violence against the local population of Cawnpore, including looting and burning of houses, with the justification {{that none of the}} local noncombatants had done anything to stop the massacre. Brigadier General Neill, who took the command at Cawnpore, immediately began a program of swift and vicious drumhead military justice (culminating in summary execution) for any sepoy rebel captured from the city who was unable to prove he was not involved in the massacre. Rebels confessing to or believed {{to be involved in the}} massacre were forced to lick the floor of the Bibighar compound, after it had been wetted with water by low caste people, while being <b>whipped.</b> <b>The</b> sepoys were then religiously disgraced by being forced to eat (or force fed) beef (if Hindu) or pork (if Muslim). The Muslim sepoys were sewn into pig skins before being hanged, and low-caste Hindu street sweepers were employed to execute the high-caste Brahmin rebels to add additional religious disgrace to their punishment.|$|E
500|$|The Commission {{recommended}} various changes. On {{the criminal}} law side, they supported reducing {{the use of the}} death penalty, although [...] "wilful murderers" [...] were still to be executed, and the abduction of a child under 16 was to be considered a capital crime. They also suggested allowing prisoners access to lawyers in any case where the prosecution was permitted representation and allowing witnesses for the defence to give evidence under oath. Legal aid was also considered, although the rejection of a case where legal aid was given would result in the defendant being sent to a workhouse for a month and <b>whipped.</b> <b>The</b> abolition of peine forte et dure as a way to avoid the forfeiture of land was also proposed.|$|E

5000|$|Signal whips (or signalwhips) are {{a type of}} single-tailed whip, {{originally}} designed to control dog teams. A signal whip usually measures between 3 and 4 feet in length. Signal whips and snake whips are similar. What distinguishes a signal whip from a snake <b>whip</b> is <b>the</b> absence of a [...] "fall". A fall {{is a piece of}} leather attached {{to the end of the}} body of <b>the</b> <b>whip.</b> In a snake <b>whip,</b> <b>the</b> [...] "cracker" [...] attaches to the fall. In a signal <b>whip,</b> <b>the</b> cracker attaches directly to the body of <b>the</b> <b>whip.</b>|$|R

500|$|Brown {{returned}} to first-class cricket in 1947–48, scoring 192 runs at 38.40 {{in the first}} three matches of the season. The season saw an Indian tour of Australia. The selectors initially dropped Barnes to pair Brown with Morris to open the batting. Apart from two Tests during the 1936–37 season against England, Brown had not played Test cricket on Australian soil. He had only one opportunity with the bat in the First Test in Brisbane, making 11 as India fell to an innings defeat. It was to be his only innings and Test match on his home ground. Brown's participation in the series was overshadowed by his controversial run out by Indian left arm orthodox spinner Vinoo Mankad in the Second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground in December 1947. Brown was run out for 18, when in the act of delivering the ball, Mankad held on to it and <b>whipped</b> <b>the</b> bails off at the non-striker's end. Brown was well out of his crease while he was backing-up the striker, so that he could get a head start in case he attempted a run. This was the second time during the season that Mankad had dismissed Brown in this fashion—as he had previously done so a match against an Australian XI in November. On that occasion, Mankad had warned Brown before running him out. The local press strongly accused Mankad of being unsportsmanlike, although some Australians—including Bradman—defended Mankad's actions. For his part, Brown took full blame and made light of the incident through humorous gestures in later matches, which referred to the event. After this incident, if a batsman is given out this way, he {{is said to have been}} [...] "Mankaded".|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after my}} arrival, Gabby flew the first F-86E to arrive on base in {{simulated}} combat {{over the field}} against an F-86A and <b>whipped</b> <b>the</b> other guy badly, with every Sabre jock on the base as witness. After he landed he briefed all pilots and announced that {{the limited number of}} E’s would be reserved for flight leaders. [...] I never forgot his response, when someone asked about the problem of wingmen staying with leaders. [...] He replied “Wingmen are to absorb firepower” and I never knew him well enough to judge whether he had a dry sense of humor, but he made the right choice. One thing I know for sure, Gabby proved himself the greatest at our skills and talents, when he added 6 ½ MIG kills to his 28 victories in WW II and become the all-time American Fighter Ace, and I MIGht [...] add, he did it in the P-47, not the better air-to-air P-51. [...] And he didn’t have a chance to fly the much more powerful F-86F, which arrived after us.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} Frazier was 15 years old, {{he was working}} on a farm for a family named Bellamy. They were both white men: Mac, who was the younger of the two and more easy going, and Jim, who was a little rougher and {{somewhat}} backward. One day a little black boy of about 12 years old accidentally damaged one of the Bellamys' tractors. Jim Bellamy became so enraged he took off his belt and <b>whipped</b> <b>the</b> boy with his belt right there in the field. Joe saw the event {{and went back to the}} packing house on the farm and told his black friends what he had seen. It wasn't long before Jim Bellamy saw Joe and asked him why he told what he had witnessed. Joe then told Bellamy he didn't know what he was talking about, but Bellamy didn't believe Joe and told Joe to get off the farm before he took off his belt again. Joe told him he better keep his pants up because he wasn't going to use his belt on him. Jim then analyzed Joe for a bit and eventually said [...] "Go on, get the hell outta here." [...] Joe knew from that moment it was time for him to leave Beaufort; he could only see hard times and low-rent for himself. Even his Momma could see it. She told Joe [...] "Son, if you can't get along with the white folks, then leave home because I don't want anything to happen to you." ...|$|E

[...] " [...] (Grandsons)," [...] Talking God said, [...] "We {{have come to}} run a race with you." [...] "We will see how fit you have become," [...] said Water Sprinkler. [...] They agreed to race around the mountain. [...] The boys ran fast, and the two Holy People ran slower. [...] But soon the boys became tired and the Holy People came up behind them and began taunting them and {{whipping}} them with switches of mountain mahogany. [...] As they approached home, Talking God and Water Sprinkler ran past them and won the race. [...] "We will return in four days to race again," [...] they said, and departed. [...] In the evening, the boys were sore and tired. , the Wind came to them and said, [...] "Practice each day and grow stronger." [...] In four days, Talking God and Water Sprinkler returned, and the four raced again around the mountain. [...] It was a faster pace, but just as before, Talking God and Water Sprinkler ran just behind the twins and whipped them with switches. [...] Again the Holy People said they would return in four days to race again. [...] And again in the evening [...] came and encouraged them and urged them to train. [...] Each day the boys trained, and in the third race, Talking God and Water Sprinkler no longer <b>whipped</b> <b>the</b> twins, but had to run their strongest to win the race at the end. [...] Four days later they returned to race a final time. [...] Again, the boys started very fast, but this time they did not tire and slow their pace. [...] They led the whole way and won the race. [...] "Well done, ," [...] said Talking God and Water Sprinkler. [...] "You have grown into what we wanted you to become. Now you can serve well those who have nurtured you." ...|$|E
