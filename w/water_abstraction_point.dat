Drinking water resource protection usually comprises active and passive measures. Passive measures, consisting of different protection zones surrounding the recharge area of the drinking <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> <b>point,</b> are the most important and most widely used measures. In the paper is illustrated how the protection of drinking water is implemented through the Water Framework Directive. Protection zones are defined basedon the classification of drinking water resource types. They are divided into two groups; groundwater and surface water bodies. All of them are further divided into subgroups; groundwater into intergranular, karstic and fissured aquifers;surface water intostagnant and flowing water bodies. For all drinking waterre sources three protection zones aredefined:inner,middleand outer zone. The outer zone was defined as the total recharge zone of the water quantities abstracted. Insideof inner zone, abstraction point zone is defined,which is protected from unauthorized access. Protectionzones for intergranular aquifers are determined according to the isochrones based on travel times. Karstic aquifers are protected on the basis of intervention times and the level of the recharge zone karstification. Fissured aquifersare protected according to groundwater flow velocities;if the flow is laminar,the method of intergranular aquifers is used, otherwise the method of karstic aquifer is implemented. For surface water protection zones limitation method of distances, method of isochrones and dilution and method of intervention times are used...|$|E

Yet, observations of river discharge often fail to support this attribution. Evidence of the association between severe salt intrusion and water use is weak and inconclusive. The present study asks to what extent water use contributes to salt intrusion and freshwater shortages.

The contribution of water use in causing severe salt intrusion events is assessed by first quantifying monthly sectorial water use and next comparing it with threshold discharges from the graded salt intrusion warning system. The case study region is the Pearl River Delta, China. Sectorial water use is found to substantially vary between months. In particular in the dry month in which water shortages are reported, water use can be more than 25 % of discharge and thus exacerbates salt intrusion.

40|$|The global {{public health}} {{community}} has closely monitored {{the unfolding of}} the 2009 H 1 N 1 influenza pandemic to best mitigate its impact on society. However, {{little attention has been}} given to the impact that our response to a pandemic might have on the environment. Antiviral and antimicrobial drugs prescribed to treat influenza and influenza-associated complications are poorly metabolized in vivo. Once ingested, they are subsequently excreted into wastewater in a biologically-active form potentially affecting the functioning of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and contaminating receiving rivers. In order to evaluate this systemic risk we couple a global spatially structured epidemic model that simulate the quantities of drugs used during an influenza pandemic to a wastewater and river flow model applied to the Thames basin in Southern England. The model projects drug concentrations in the WWTPs and receiving rivers during pandemics of varying severity. Projections indicate no ecotoxicologic risk for a situation consistent with the 2009 H 1 N 1 influenza pandemic. In the case of a more severe pandemic, however, between 5 % to 40 % of the length of the Thames River receiving WWTP effluent is projected to exceed thresholds for microbial growth-inhibition from antibiotics, introducing considerable risks of eutrophication, fish kill, and ultimately the contamination of drinking <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> <b>points...</b>|$|R

In these rivers, {{it is expected that}} anthropogenic pressures largely modify low-flow components of the flow regime with consequences for aquatic habitat and diversity in invertebrate species. First, by using a simple hydrological index (IARI) river segments of the Celone stream (southern Italy) whose hydrological regime is significantly influenced by anthropogenic activities have been identified. Hydrological alteration has been further classified through the analysis of two metrics: the degree (Mf) and the predictability of dry flow conditions (Sd 6). Measured streamflow data were used to calculate the metrics in present conditions (impacted). Given the lack of data from pristine conditions, simulated streamflow time series were used to calculate the metrics in reference conditions. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to estimate daily natural streamflow. Hydrological alterations associated with <b>water</b> <b>abstractions,</b> <b>point</b> discharges and the presence of a reservoir were assessed by comparing the metrics (Mf, Sd 6) before and after the impacts. The results show that the hydrological regime of the river segment located in {{the upper part of the}} basin is slightly altered, while the regime of the river segment downstream of the reservoir is heavily altered.

This study investigated whether the size of zebra mussels is {{a significant factor in}} the concentration of protozoan Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia cysts and microsporidian spores. Zebra mussels were collected in Lough Arrow, a small Irish lake, which is utilized for drinking <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> and is subject to agricultural and human wastewater pollution drivers, both recognised risk factors for human waterborne pathogens. Zebra mussels were cleaned, divided into size (5 mm) interval classes based on their shell length and made up to 150 g samples (wet weight with shell). Combined fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques were utilized as biomolecular techniques to assess the presence and concentration of the pathogens. PCR analysis provided source-tracking information on human and animal pollution sources. There was no significant relationship between the size of D. polymorpha and pathogen loads in similar sized samples, indicating that different sites in the same or different waterbody can be compared in terms of relative concentrations of human waterborne parasites irrespective of the zebra mussels’ size. Cryptosporidium was the most abundant species, with lower counts of Giardia and the microsporidian Encephalitozoon hellem, respectively.

Recruitment of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) has reduced by over 90 % {{since the early}} 1980 's, {{in part due to}} the effect of riverine barriers on its catadromous migration. There is a legislative requirement to restore free passage, increase habitat availability, and limit anthropogenic losses at intakes to aid eel recovery and good ecological status; necessitating an improved understanding of underlying processes. Escapement, route choice, delay at structures, and entrainment at <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> <b>points</b> of downstream migrating silver eels were examined using acoustic and Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) telemetry in the heavily regulated lower river Stour, UK. Downstream migrating adult eel (n = 69) were trapped approximately 10 km upstream of the tidal limit, surgically implanted with an acoustic transducer and PIT transponder, and released between October and December in 2009 and 2010. Movements of tagged individuals were monitored by a linear array of 19 fixed acoustic receivers extending from the release site, through the last 9. 2 km of the freshwater catchment. Three groups of water control structures, two <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> intakes and several possible routes of migration are present in the reach. Seventy six and 65 % of tagged eels escaped from the study reach in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Entrainment at a single intake was the principal cause of loss and positively related to rapid increases in abstraction whilst eels were {{in the vicinity of the}} intake. Route choice into the estuary was dependent on discharge over a large intertidal weir; opening regimes of a tidal gate at the termination of the alternative channel; and abstraction rate at a nearby water intake. Long delays (up to 68. 5 days) and recurrent behaviour were associated with several structures in the study reach; high variability between individuals reflected the management of spill at weirs.

These streams had lower flows and more frequent droughts than predicted by the official hydrological model used in this region. Three of these rivers were sometimes dry, whereas there were predicted by the model to be permanently flowing. Meanwhile, there has been no decrease in annual precipitation.

40|$|Anticipatory {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} in the water resources sector is essential to reduce or avoid expected impacts on water resources availability and management. Anticipating how water systems are likely to respond to a changing climate is a challenging task, due to the difficulties in detecting clear signals of anthropogenic climate change from hydrological observations, along with uncertainties in future climate change impacts. To date in Ireland, studies with regard to climate change have focused on the traditional top-down, climate-scenario-driven impact assessments. Little research has gone beyond this traditional approach and examined how uncertain information on the future resource availability and on the vulnerability of water supply systems to climate change, can be incorporated into decision-making. In addressing these challenges this thesis first examines observations of river flows from a network of near-natural catchments for evidence of climate-driven trends. Selected flow indicators relevant to water resource management are extracted and analysed for climate-driven trends, using different approaches including fixed periods of record and moving windows tests, to explore the nature of change in observations. Results indicate that the derived time series of median and low flow indicators in Ireland are dominated by natural variability, which makes the detection of a climate change signals in river flows rather difficult. The trends obtained for observed summer flows indicate a disagreement with established Irish climate change projections of drier summers and more extreme drought conditions. Given the shortage of coherent trends, the magnitude and amount of time required for change to be detected suggest that change signals will not be detected, using conservative significance levels, in the time frame required for adaptation. Therefore, anticipatory adaptation in the water resources sector cannot only rely on observed flow information but also needs {{to be based on the}} assessment of vulnerabilities to projected future changes. In developing a tool to support water resources decision-making in Ireland, a physically based hydrological model (HYSIM) is coupled with a water resources model (WEAP) and applied to 12 different case study surface <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> <b>points</b> in Ireland to explore the effectiveness of selected adaptation options. The tool incorporates uncertainties in Irish future climate scenarios and hydrological model application. To facilitate application to un-gauged river reaches, from which water is abstracted, the tool incorporates a proxy-basin method, incorporating hydrological model uncertainty to obtain feasible ranges of future hydrological conditions. Non-climatic pressures such as population growth projections are also included in the modelling framework. Threshold-based indicators are employed to assess the water resources system performance for selected robust adaptation options of demand and leakage reductions. Results indicate that the sensitivity of individual water resource systems to future changes and adaptation decisions is context specific. This is due to the particular hydrological and water supply system characteristics and requires case-by-case analysis. For a number of <b>abstraction</b> <b>points</b> examined in the east of the country, the tested scenarios are not sufficient to reduce vulnerability for a considerable proportion of the uncertainty space considered. Additional or different adaptation options will be required in these situations to increase system performance.

Using before-after, control-impact (BACI) designed experiments, weirs and diversions were created to experimentally decrease discharge by over 85 % in each ot three small streams, ranging from pristine to low water quality. The response of invertebrates to short-term (one-month) discharge reduction was to accumulate in the decreased available area, increasing local invertebrate density. After a year of reduced flow, the density of invertebrates and percentage of mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies decreased at the pristine site, whereas only taxonomic richness decreased at the mildly polluted stream. Reduced discharge had no affect on the invertebrate community at the stream with the lowest water quality. Reduced discharge had little influence on leaf decomposition rates, but distances travelled by released coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) increased with increasing discharge. The effects of reduced discharge on primary production were not consistent between streams. Overall, the severity (magnitude/duration) of flow reduction appeared to influence invertebrate responses to <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> although the outcomes of <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> were dependent on the invertebrate assemblage present in each stream...|$|R

Existing river {{pollution}} and <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> in the Ennerdale Lake-River Ehen system is shown to have caused a major deterioration in the conditions in the Ehen fishery. This is reflected {{by the fact that}} catches of salmon, sea trout and smelts on the Ehen have all fallen to roughly 6 % of the 1965 level; wich is far worse than the deterioration shown in salmon catches for S. W. Cumberland as a whole. Recommendations are made, in the light of proposals by North West Water Authority to increase <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> in West Cumbria, to prevent further deterioration in the Ehen fishery in the short term and to improve the situation in the longer term. It contains sections on pollution, <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> and fisheries background, flow statistics for and discussion of high water-droughts on the River Ehen, effects of droughts on Tidal Water and a discussion of N. W. W. A. Paper entitled `Water Resources in West Cumbria’ in the light of conditions on the River Ehen...|$|R
50|$|In most {{countries}} {{there is no}} charge for abstracting water directly from rivers, lakes and aquifers. However, some countries do levy volumetric charges or fees for <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> rights. These charges are typically levied on industries, utilities and farmers. Fees for <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> and discharge exist for example in France, where revenues are significant and are re-invested in the water sector by water agencies established in major basins. In Germany abstraction fees exist only for groundwater and only in some states, and their proceeds go into the general state budget. Mexico also charges for <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> and returns proceeds to utilities, but not to industries. Outside the OECD countries few countries charge <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> fees. Where they are applied the level of fees tends to be nominal, such as in Morocco, or enforcement is partial, such as for groundwater abstraction fees in Jordan. In almost all countries that have introduced abstraction fees agriculture, the major water user worldwide, is exempted from abstraction fees. Some countries allow water rights to be traded, so that the price for water itself is formed in the market. Such water trading exist in parts of Australia, Chile and the Southwestern United States).|$|R

This article presents {{a new approach to}} analysing applications of market-based instruments for water resources in China. Expanding the analysis beyond a rational choice approach, it demonstrates the institutional dimension of policy implementation at the local level in China. Four peculiar features of China's water institutions influence local governments in dealing with <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> differently from how regulators might expect. This explains local governmental failures and the implementation of <b>water</b> <b>abstraction</b> policies in several ways, including the setting of charges at low levels, a lack of necessary monitoring and sanctions, few incentives to collect charges diligently, and failure to provide accessible information for the public. 19 page(s...|$|R
