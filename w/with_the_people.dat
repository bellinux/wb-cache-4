5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of the Arab world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to {{rumors that the}} Baghdad Pact countries were attempting to topple Syria's leftist government. Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further elevating his prestige in the Arab world, and particularly among Syrians.|$|E

He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.|$|E

5|$|Forster's {{attitude}} {{brought him}} into conflict <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of the different nations he encountered and made him welcome nowhere, as he was too revolutionary and antinational for Germans, proud and opposing in his dealings with Englishmen, too unconcerned about Polish science for Poles, and too insignificant politically and ignored while in France.|$|E
5|$|Living {{alone in}} Mysore, Narayan {{developed}} {{an interest in}} agriculture. He bought an acre of agricultural land and tried his hand at farming. He was also prone to walking to the market every afternoon, {{not so much for}} buying things, but to interact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> In a typical afternoon stroll, he would stop every few steps to greet and converse with shopkeepers and others, most likely gathering material for his next book.|$|E

5|$|After reigning two years, Amon {{was assassinated}} by his servants, who conspired against him, and was succeeded {{by his son}} Josiah, {{who at the time}} was eight years old. After Amon's {{assassination}} his murderers became unpopular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> and were ultimately killed. Some scholars, such as Abraham Malamat, assert that Amon was assassinated because people disliked the heavy influence that Assyria, an age-old enemy of Judah responsible for the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel, had upon him.|$|E
5|$|Anne {{became a}} general {{favourite}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> she met either at The Hague {{or at the}} Princess of Orange's country house at Teylingen. She was very attractive and stylish, and attracted many men. One of the first men {{to fall in love}} with Anne was Spencer Compton, a son of the Earl of Northampton. However, Anne quickly fell in love with Henry Jermyn, who returned her feelings. Anne dismissed Jermyn just as quickly when she met James, Duke of York, the son of the deposed king. On 24 November 1659, two or three years after she first met him, James promised he would marry Anne. Charles, James' brother, forced him reluctantly into this, saying that her strong character would be a positive influence on his weak-willed brother.|$|E

5|$|As Minton grew older, he was {{frequently}} in trouble <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in his neighborhood. In 1904, {{he was arrested}} for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk. He was taken before a justice of the peace and fined three dollars, an incident he later credited with changing his outlook on life and sparking his desire to become a lawyer. To accomplish that goal, and continue supporting his family, he traveled with his older brother Herbert to Fort Worth, Texas, to take a job at the Swift and Company meat packing plant. His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Boston's British {{military}} leaders, General Thomas Gage and Admiral Samuel Graves, {{both had}} reason to do business <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Machias. Gage required lumber to build barracks for the additional troops arriving in the besieged city. Graves wanted to recover the guns from the HMS Halifax shipwreck, which been intentionally run aground in Machias Bay by a local pilot in February 1775. The ship's guns were reported to {{be of interest to}} the Patriots of Machias. Graves authorized Ichabod Jones, a Tory Machias merchant, to take flour and other food supplies aboard his ships Unity and Polly to exchange for Gage's needed lumber. To guarantee that this trade would happen, Graves sent James Moore, a midshipman from his flagship HMS Preston, to command the armed schooner Margaretta and accompany the two merchant vessels. Moore had additional orders to retrieve what he could from the wreck site of the HMS Halifax.|$|E
5|$|By April 1896 the Welsh Football Union had sanctioned a {{subscription}} of 1,000 shillings to be {{contributed to the}} Gould testimonial. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) complained and the IRFB reacted by informing the WFU that only a plate up {{to the value of}} a hundred pounds sterling could be given to Gould, and that the remaining funds should be donated to charity; otherwise Wales would lose their international fixtures. The WFU stood down and withdrew their subscription. The reaction in Wales was one of anger, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> feeling that the WFU had bowed to English pressure, and had been bullied into a decision against the people's wishes.|$|E

5|$|Discontent with Richard's actions {{manifested}} itself in the summer after he {{took control of the}} country, as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.|$|E
5|$|His {{controversial}} first mandate, {{marked by}} a political crisis and oscillating support from the PNL's leader Ion I. C. Brătianu, {{played a part in}} legislating land reform and repressed communist activities, before being brought down by the rally of opposition forces. His second term of 1926–1927 brought a much-debated treaty with Fascist Italy, and fell after Averescu gave clandestine backing to the ousted Prince Carol. Faced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> Party's decline, Averescu closed deals with various right-wing forces and was instrumental in bringing Carol back to the throne in 1930. Relations between the two soured over the following years, and Averescu clashed with his fellow party member Octavian Goga over the king's attitudes. Shortly before his death, he and Carol reconciled, and Averescu joined the Crown Council.|$|E
5|$|Information {{is largely}} absent {{regarding}} any major administrative changes Salih {{made to the}} Emirate of Aleppo. His only known institutional innovation was the post of shaykh al-dawla (chieftain of the state) or raʾīs al-balad (municipal chief), who served as Salih's trusted confidant and permanent representative <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Aleppo. The post emulated that of the shaykh, who played a secondary role to an amīr in a princely Kilabi clan. The shaykh al-dawla played an important political role {{in the city and}} came from a prominent leading family. Salih assigned Ibn Mustafad to the post and utilized the aḥdāth, which consisted of young armed men from the city's lower and middle classes, as a police force. Although they cooperated with Salih, the aḥdāth were still an independent force. Sometime during his reign, Salih also acquired a number of Turkish ghilmān, though details about them are lacking in the sources.|$|E

He is a psychotic and highly impulsive youngster. He has his eyes on club dancer Jahnavi (Anjali Lavania), but she rejects him as she adores Jaidev.|$|E
