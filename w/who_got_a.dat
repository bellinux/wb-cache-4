The winner of this {{special election}} served the rest of the Senate term, which ended in January 2013. Unlike most senate elections, this was a non-partisan election in which the candidate <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> majority of the vote wins, and if the first place candidate did not get 50%, a runoff election with the top two candidates would have been held.

25|$|Northamptonshire {{recorded}} {{their fourth}} win {{of the season}} thanks to their top order batting and their spin bowling. They had won the toss and batted, placing themselves well at 224 for 4, but the last six wickets yielded only 63 runs, and Lancashire seamer Dominic Cork could take three late wickets to end with four for 27. Northamptonshire were bowled out early on the second morning for 289, but immediately hit back, Damien Wright dismissing Lancashire's captain Mark Chilton for 0. In a bowling effort dominated by spinners - Jason Brown and Monty Panesar sharing 68 of the 94 overs bowled - Northamptonshire tugged away, and but for Stuart Law's 111, the hosts might have got a first innings lead.

Glavine was finished and the Braves changed pitchers five times. Next inning, Edgar Renteria walked, stole second and scored on Jim Edmonds's double off of Andy Ashby. John Burkett hit Fernando Vina with a pitch leading off the sixth, then Edmonds's one-out RBI double made it 9–2 Cardinals.

At the conclusion of the game Bobby Clarke, Philadelphia's general manager, attempted to enter the Senators' dressing room to confront their head coach, Jacques Martin, but was restrained by a colleague. Clarke said that he would not have hit Martin, but that he had wanted to challenge Martin about the unbalanced fight pairings.
