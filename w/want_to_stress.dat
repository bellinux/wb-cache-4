25|$|In {{the years}} 2000s, Italian {{nationalism}} {{seems to have}} gained a moderate support by the society, in particular during important days such as the National Day Festa della Repubblica (Republic day) and the Anniversary of the Liberation. The President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has often praised patriotism among Italians by mentioning in his speeches national events including Risorgimento or Resistenza, and national symbols like the Flag of Italy and the National Anthem, although he seems to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> self-confidence rather than nationalism. In 2011, the 150th Anniversary of Italian Unification showed a moderately renewed interest in Italian nationalism among the society. Nationalist ideologies are often present during Italian anti-globalisation protests. Today, Italian nationalism is mainly supported by right-wing political parties including Brothers of Italy-National Alliance who has gained nine seats in the Italian Parliament in the last general election, and by far-right-wing political parties like The Right or Tricolour Flame. Nonetheless, in recent times Italian nationalism has been occasionally embraced {{as a form of}} banal nationalism by liberal parties like Forza Italia, centrist parties like the Union of the Centre or even by centre-left parties like the Democratic Party.|$|E

[...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> that Russian foreign policy will in the future be organized in a strictly pragmatic way, based on our capabilities and national interests: military and strategic, economic and political.

5000|$|Many {{languages}} make {{a distinction}} between singular and plural: English, for example, distinguishes between man and men, or house and houses. In some languages, in addition to such singular and plural forms, there is also a dual form, which is used when exactly two people or things are meant. In many languages with dual forms, use of the dual is mandatory as in some Arabic dialects using dual in nouns as in Hejazi Arabic, and the plural is used only for groups greater than two. However, use of the dual is optional in some languages such as other modern Arabic dialects including Egyptian Arabic. In other languages such as Hebrew, the dual exists only for words naming time spans (day, week, etc.), a few measure words, and for words that naturally come in pairs and are not used in the plural except in rhetoric: eyes, ears, and so forth. In Slovene, the use of the dual is mandatory, except for nouns that are natural pairs, such as trousers, eyes, ears, lips, hands, arms, legs, feet, kidneys, breasts, lungs, etc., for which the plural form has to be used, unless you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> out that something is true for both one and the other part. For example, one says [...] "oči me bolijo" [...] (my eyes hurt), but if they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> that both their eyes hurt, they say [...] "obe očesi me bolita". When using the pronoun [...] "obe/oba" [...] (both), the dual form that follows is mandatory.|$|E

However, present-day Georgia is not Yeltsin’s Russia. At the same time, present-day Georgia is not President Vladimir Putin's Russia, where political opponents are persecuted or arrested, where televisions are closed down. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> that television, freedom of speech is untouchable. Mr. Patarkatsishvili can be engaged in politics, business - but he {{will not be able to}} blackmail the authorities through his own television or influence".|$|E

5000|$|As {{explained}} above, the President {{determined that}} it was necessary following September 11 to create an early warning detection system.

5000|$|Precisely {{one week}} after the last regular season AFL game --- Sunday, December 7, 1941 --- Pearl Harbor was {{attacked}} by Japanese military forces. The euphoria of a successful season gave way to the realization that the military demands of the American participation in World War II would put the continued success of the AFL (and the NFL, for that matter) into question. As both major football leagues were losing personnel to military service, both made plans for a 1942 season (the AFL as a six team loop with a new Detroit franchise). [...] Ironically, the NFL came close to suspending operations, but continued as a ten-team league, but on September 2, 1942, the AFL suspended operations “until the end of the war.” AFL president William Cox announced the suspension, stating “We do not have the time to go into the football business this fall.

5000|$|Ellul {{identified}} himself as a Christian Anarchist. Ellul explained his view in this way: [...] "By anarchy I mean first an absolute rejection of violence." [...] And, [...] "...Jesus {{was not only a}} socialist but an anarchist - and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> here that I regard anarchism as the fullest and most serious form of socialism." [...] For him, this meant that nation-states, as the primary sources of violence in the modern era, should neither be praised nor feared, but continually questioned and challenged. For Ellul, human government is largely irrelevant in that the revelation of God contained in Scripture is sufficient and exclusive. That is, being a Christian means pledging absolute allegiance to Christ, which makes other laws redundant at best or counter to the revelation of God at worst. Despite the initial attraction of some evangelicals to his thinking because of his high view of Biblical texts (i.e., generally eschewing the historical-critical method), this position alienated some conservative Protestants. Later, he would attract a following among adherents of more ethically-compatible traditions such as the Anabaptists and the house church movement. Similar political ideas to Ellul's appear in the writings of a corresponding friend of his, the American William Stringfellow, and long-time admirer Vernard Eller, author of Christian Anarchy. Ellul identified the State and political power as the Beast in the Book of Revelation.|$|E

The test gave teams the opportunity to assess major aerodynamic upgrades before racing them.

Both Lotus's trackside operations director Alan Permane and Red Bull Racing driver Mark Webber questioned the value of testing at the Mugello circuit as the characteristics of the circuit were unlike any of the circuits the championship was due to visit after the test, while Caterham driver Vitaly Petrov was critical of the choice of Mugello as a testing venue as he felt it was not safe enough for Formula One. Petrov's comments came shortly after Fernando Alonso crashed on the final morning of the test. Red Bull Racing and Lotus team principals Christian Horner and Éric Boullier were also critical of the test as they felt that the costs of conducting in-season testing outweighed any benefits, with Horner stating his opposition to continuing mid-season testing in the future.
