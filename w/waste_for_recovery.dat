40|$|The {{number and}} {{capacity}} of mechanical-biological treatment (MBT) plants in Europe increased {{significantly in the}} past two decades as a response to the legal obligation to limit the landfilling of biodegradable waste in landfills and to increase recycling and energy recovery from waste. The aim of these plants is to prepare residual municipal <b>waste</b> <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> and disposal operations, including especially separation and stabilization of the easily biodegradable fraction (the biofraction). The final products of MBP technology are recyclables, stabilate, high calorific fraction which is used for the production of refuse derived fuel (RDF) and the remaining residual fraction. The shares of the output fractions, especially of the recyclables and RDF determine the overall efficiency of MBT technology in diverting waste from landfills. In this paper results of an assessment of one exemplary MBT plant are provided. The analysis was performed within a comparative study in which 20 selected MBT plants in Poland were subject to a detailed analysis, focusing, both at the design parameters as well as operational ones. The selected plant showed relatively higher overall materials recovery efficiency. With the view to circular economy targets, increased automation of the mechanical waste treatment will be required to support achieving high level diversion from landfills. The study reviled that stabilisation of biofraction should be improved by a better control of process conditions, especially moisture content...|$|E

Legislative and financial measures introduced to reduce landfill {{disposal of waste}} in the UK, have impacted on the way Local Authorities operate their household waste and recycling collection services. This paper reports {{on the performance of}} Charnwood Borough Council (CBC), a Local Authority in England, it is responsible for the collection and recycling of waste from 67, 000 households. This service is carried out by a private company, Serco, who operate household waste collections for 15 UK Local Authorities. To improve recycling performance CBC has changed the collection frequency and increased the number of materials segregated from residual <b>waste</b> <b>for</b> <b>recovery.</b> There have also been actions and campaigns to raise public awareness. Together these have improved recycling and composting rates in the CBC area from 16 % in 2002 / 03 to 46. 1 % in 2010 / 11. This paper is a case study and progress report on the details of how this was achieved. It compares performance with other Local Authorities, explores the impact of local operational and policy issues on the amount of household waste collected for recycling. The research has concluded that differences in how the household waste services were provided and local policies influenced the amount of recyclates recovered.

These possibly include storing {{large volumes of}} waste material in a safe manner, rendering wastes stable or sterilized for extended periods of time, and/or processing <b>wastes</b> <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> of vital resources. This is further complicated because future missions remain ill-defined with respect to waste stream quantity, composition and generation schedule. Without definitive knowledge of this information, development of requirements is hampered. Additionally, even if waste streams were well characterized, other operational and processing needs require clarification (e. g. resource recovery requirements, planetary protection constraints). Therefore, the development of solid waste management (SWM) subsystem requirements for long duration space missions is an inherently uncertain, complex and iterative process. The intent {{of this paper is}} to address some of the difficulties in writing requirements for missions that are not completely defined. This paper discusses an approach and motivation for ALS SWM requirements development, the characteristics of effective requirements, and the presence of those characteristics in requirements that are developed for uncertain missions.

40|$|Within {{the study}} {{presented}} here {{the use of}} energy recovery from <b>waste</b> was analysed <b>for</b> several industrial facilities, focussing on cement plants, kilns in the lime and gypsum industry, steel works and plants {{for the production of}} non ferrous metals. 44 German cement plants dispose of an own clinker production. Presently 31 plants have a permit for recovering energy from waste. The total permitted capacity <b>for</b> energy <b>recovery</b> in German cement kilns amounts to nearly 2, 6 Mio. t/a. Mainly waste oil, old tyres, fuel derived from processed production-specific and municipal waste, plastics, scrap wood and waste paper are co-incinerated. In 1998 / 99 a total amount of roughly 945. 000 t refuse was processed in 30 units of the studied facilities. In five furnaces at three steel works waste can be used for energy or material recovery. The approved total capacity of high calorific <b>waste</b> <b>for</b> energy <b>recovery</b> comes to nearly 350, 000 t/a. Especially industrial plastics and packaging waste from DSD, plastics processed in scrap mills and shreddered waste and granulated paint sludge are used. In 1998 the facilities processed only old plastic, representing a total amount of nearly 109. 000 t. At present seven facilities in the non ferrous metal industry have a permit <b>for</b> energy <b>recovery</b> from <b>waste.</b> The maximum capacity amounts on national level to nearly 140. 000 t/a.

To meet the rising demand for energy and to address environmental concerns, a conversion from conventional energy systems to renewable resources is essential.

Several technologies are available for realizing the potential of solid waste as an energy source, ranging from very simple systems for disposing of dry waste to more complex technologies capable of dealing with large amounts of industrial waste. There are three main pathways <b>for</b> conversion of <b>waste</b> material to energy: thermo chemical, biochemical and physicochemical.

40|$|Water {{injection}} in {{the compressor}} exhaust, to recuperate waste heat, {{is considered a}} possible route to improve the electric efficiency and overall performance of the micro Gas Turbine turbine (mGT). Many research exists on water injection in mGTs, however a generic study to determine the optimal route <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> is still missing. To determine the optimal cycle settings <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> through water injection, we have performed simulations using a two-step method. In a first step, the thermodynamic limit for water injection is sought using a black box method. In a second step, the cycle layout is designed by means of composite curve theory. This paper summarizes the results of two scenarios. In the first scenario, the black box is considered as adiabatic and no fixed stack temperature is imposed (thus allowing condensation of the exhaust gasses). One of the major concerns when injecting water is the water consumption, which can be compensated in some cases through condensation and recycling the condensate. Therefore, in the second scenario, the cycle is made self-sufficient with water. In this case, the black box is no longer considered adiabatic and heat exchange with the environment is allowed for condensation of the flue gasses. Black box simulations showed that lowering the stack temperature to 53 Â°C results in an injection of 17 %wt of water {{and an increase in}} electric efficiency of 9 % absolute. To keep the mGT cycle layout simple, low cost and not too complex, a maximum of two heat exchangers was imposed for the heat exchanger network design. Although black box analysis indicated a large potential for water introduction, this potential could not be achieved with the considered networks in this paper. Finally, injection of preheated water was identified as the optimal water injection scheme <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> resulting in 4. 6 % absolute electric efficiency increase and a final stack temperature of 62 Â°C. Results of simulations of the second case indicate that the stack temperature needs to be lowered under 26 Â°C {{in order to make the}} cycle self-sufficient with water. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to select {{appropriate}} heat exchangers out of available gas-gas heat exchangers for used in a proposed power plant.

In selecting an optimum heat exchanger for use, the PCHE was identified as the best candidate <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> and recuperation. In order to ascertain the viability of this assertion the PCHE was designed and a 1 D modeling performed in MATLAB using the conditions that the heat exchanger <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> would be subjected to. The choice of using the conditions that the waste recovery heat exchanger would be subjected to was due to the fact that, it is the heat exchanger that would be subjected to much harsh conditions (thus higher temperatures of up to 650 ÂºC). The PFHE was also designed and similarly a 1 D modeling performed in MATLAB. The decision to consider the design of the PFHE was to offer a platform to compare and contrast the performance of the PCHE in order to have a strong basis for deciding on whether to stick to the choice for the PCHE or otherwise. The results obtained from the 1 D modeling of the design of the heat exchangers indicates that the PCHE performed better with regards to pressure drops across the heat exchangers (with values of 1. 17 and 2. 47 % for the cold and hot sides respectively), compactness (with a value of 1300 m 2 /m 3 for the PCHE compared to the 855 m 2 /m 3 recorded from the PFHE), however the PFHE recorded higher heat transfer coefficients, and a subsequent higher overall transfer coefficient. Results obtained from the simulation of the 3 D model buttress the decision to employ the PCHE as heat exchangers to be used <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> heat <b>recovery</b> and recuperation as a wise one, with an effectiveness of 0. 94 as against the design value of 0. 90, and with pressure drops as desired of the optimum heat exchanger...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of solid residues derived from municipal solid waste-derived solid recovered fuel incinerated in a circulating fluidized-bed boiler for concrete production. The concrete mixtures casted by partially replacing the natural aggregates with bottom ash (27 %) and exhausted sand (13 %), according to the European standards for concrete, may be classified in the C 16 / 20 class. The leaching tests performed on monolithic concrete samples showed that the concentrations measured in the leachates were lower than limit values <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>recovery,</b> with the only exception of nickel for the mixture made with the exhausted sand...|$|R
