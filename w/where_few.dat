5|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas <b>where</b> <b>few</b> trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} Democrats’ {{support of}} civil rights issues culminated when Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which ended legal segregation and provided federal enforcement of voting rights for blacks.

25|$|A related {{issue is}} {{publication}} bias: researchers {{are more likely}} to submit trials that report a positive finding for publication, and journals prefer to publish positive results. Publication bias has been particularly marked in alternative medicine journals, <b>where</b> <b>few</b> of the published articles (just 5% during the year 2000) tend to report null results. Regarding the way in which homeopathy is represented in the medical literature, a systematic review found signs of bias in the publications of clinical trials (towards negative representation in mainstream medical journals, and vice versa in alternative medicine journals), but not in reviews.|$|E
25|$|Benny's comic persona {{changed over}} the course of his career. At some point he {{developed}} a miserly persona. This stage character was everything that Jack Benny was not: cheap, petty, vain and self-congratulatory. His comic rendering of these traits was the linchpin to the success of his show. Benny set himself up as comedic foil, allowing his supporting characters to draw laughs at the expense of his own flaws. With his humanism and vulnerability in an era <b>where</b> <b>few</b> male characters were allowed such character traits, Benny made what could have been unlikable into an everyman character.|$|E

25|$|Triops longicaudatus (commonly called longtail tadpole shrimp, American tadpole shrimp, or rice tadpole shrimp) is a {{freshwater}} crustacean of {{the order}} Notostraca, resembling a miniature horseshoe crab. It is characterized by an elongated, segmented body, a flattened shield-like brownish carapace covering {{two thirds of the}} thorax, and two long filaments on the abdomen. Triops refers to its three eyes, and longicaudatus refers to the elongated tail structures. Triops longicaudatus is found in freshwater ponds and pools, often in places <b>where</b> <b>few</b> higher forms of life can exist. Like its relative Triops cancriformis, the longtail tadpole shrimp is considered a living fossil because its basic prehistoric morphology has changed little in the last 70 million years, exactly matching their ancient fossils. Triops longicaudatus {{is one of the oldest}} animal species still in existence.|$|E
25|$|Commissioners have various privileges, such {{as being}} exempt from member state taxes (but not EU taxes), and having {{immunity}} from prosecution for doing official acts. Commissioners have sometimes {{been found to have}} abused their offices, particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations. This resulted in one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. By contrast to the ECJ's relaxed approach, a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed <b>where</b> <b>few</b> Commissioners had 'even the slightest sense of responsibility'.

500|$|The {{construction}} of the Édifice Price was heavily criticized in the 1920s, both because it showed disrespect for Price Sr.'s intention of relocating the Price Brothers company's operations to its original business centre of Kénogami (now Jonquière), and because the monumental construction was perceived as out of proportion in a mixed commercial and residential area <b>where</b> <b>few</b> buildings exceeded four or five floors. Criticism continued after the construction, {{and a few years}} later the city council passed a by-law limiting building heights in the old town to [...] — a size only exceeded by one other building at the time: the then seven-floor Hôtel-Dieu de Québec.

500|$|Davis gave {{speeches to}} {{soldiers}} and politicians but largely ignored the common people, {{who came to}} resent the favoritism shown to the rich and powerful; Davis thus failed to harness Confederate nationalism. One historian speaks of [...] "the heavy-handed intervention of the Confederate government." [...] Economic intervention, regulation, and state control of manpower, production and transport were much greater in the Confederacy than in the Union. Davis did not use his presidential pulpit to rally the people with stirring rhetoric; he called instead {{for people to be}} fatalistic and to die for their new country.

500|$|Flash {{flooding}} is {{the process}} where a landscape, most notably an urban environment, is subjected to rapid floods. [...] These rapid floods occur more quickly and are more localized than seasonal river flooding or areal flooding and are frequently (though not always) associated with intense rainfall. Flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving thunderstorms and is usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it. Flash floods are most common in densely populated urban environments, <b>where</b> <b>few</b> plants and bodies of water are present to absorb and contain the extra water. Flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure, such as bridges, and weakly constructed buildings. Plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated {{by the force of}} raging water. Automobiles parked within affected areas can also be displaced. Soil erosion can occur as well, exposing risks of landslide phenomena.|$|E

500|$|Weisman's thought {{experiment}} pursues two themes: how nature {{would react}} to the disappearance of humans and what legacy humans would leave behind. To foresee how other life could continue without humans, Weisman reports from areas where the natural environment exists with little human intervention, like the Białowieża Forest, the Kingman Reef, and the Palmyra Atoll. He interviews biologist E. O. Wilson and visits {{with members of the}} Korean Federation for Environmental Movement at the Korean Demilitarized Zone <b>where</b> <b>few</b> humans have penetrated since 1953. He tries to conceive how life may evolve by describing the past evolution of pre-historic plants and animals, but notes Douglas Erwin's warning that [...] "we can't predict what the world will be 5 million years later by looking at the survivors". Several chapters are dedicated to megafauna, which Weisman predicts would proliferate. He profiles soil samples from the past 200 years and extrapolates concentrations of heavy metals and foreign substances into a future without industrial inputs. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and implications for climatic change are likewise examined.|$|E

Simon Nelson, BBC Vision controller of multiplatform and portfolio, said that this was an opportunity for the BBC to develop its expertise in drama production by exploiting the creative potential of the Internet to create a new online drama <b>where</b> <b>few</b> have succeeded. EastEnders: E20 primarily operates as a standalone series but also cross-references storylines of the main soap. According to Santer, the series also explores the stories of the soap's anonymous bystanders. He said, [...] "There are always other people [...] milling round the market and houses that we never go into. There are four or five parallels you could do.

500|$|By 1863 Beato {{had moved}} to Yokohama, Japan, joining Charles Wirgman, {{with whom he had}} {{travelled}} from Bombay to Hong Kong. The two formed and maintained a partnership called [...] "Beato & Wirgman, Artists and Photographers" [...] during the years 1864–1867, one of the earliest and most important commercial studios in Japan. Wirgman again produced illustrations derived from Beato's photographs, while Beato photographed some of Wirgman's sketches and other works. (Beato's photographs were also used for engravings within Aimé Humbert's Le Japon illustré and other works.) Beato's Japanese photographs include portraits, genre works, landscapes, cityscapes, and a series of photographs documenting the scenery and sites along the Tōkaidō Road, the latter series recalling the ukiyo-e of Hiroshige and Hokusai. During this period, foreign access to (and within) the country was greatly restricted by the Shogunate. Accompanying ambassadorial delegations and taking any other opportunities created by his personal popularity and close relationship with the British military, Beato reached areas of Japan <b>where</b> <b>few</b> westerners had ventured, and in addition to conventionally pleasing subjects sought sensational and macabre subject matter such as heads on display after decapitation.
