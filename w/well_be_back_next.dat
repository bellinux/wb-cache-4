60|$|He <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>next</b> {{morning with}} a glue-pot, and divided his time between boiling {{it up on the}} kitchen stove and {{wandering}} about the house in search of things to stick.

60|$|Strictly {{it should}} have been Gammon; but in the hurry of the moment, my fault (I can only hope) passed unperceived. At the same time I caught the eye of the postmaster.

After the final buzzer sounded his players formed two lines for him, with sticks raised to form an arch to walk between while he acknowledged the cheers of the crowd.|$|R
5000|$|In the 14 years we've {{been doing}} South Park {{we have never}} done a show that we couldn't stand behind. We {{delivered}} our version of the show to Comedy Central and they made a determination to alter the episode. It wasn't some meta-joke on our part. Comedy Central added the bleeps. In fact, Kyle's customary final speech was about intimidation and fear. It didn't mention Muhammad at all but it got bleeped too. We'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>next</b> week with a whole new show about something completely different and we'll see what happens to it.|$|R
