Historian Salvatore Mercogliano (c. 2000) states that the initial commander of the MSTS was [...] "Rear Admiral William M. Callaghan (subsequently promoted to Vice Admiral)" [...] and a 1962 ship directory states that [...] " [...] first commander, Rear-Admiral William Callaghan, was soon promoted to vice-admiral, and the M.S.T.S. has been a ' three-star' command ever since" [...] (p.41). Another article by Mercogliano (2000) states that Callaghan was still ranked a Rear Admiral in early July 1950. Two other sources, a later article by Mercogliano (2009) and Military Sealift Command's timeline, state that MSTS's first commander was Vice Admiral William M. Callaghan. It is not clear whether these last two sources were simply reporting Callaghan's rank at the time of <b>writing,</b> <b>well</b> after 1949, or whether they were implying that Callaghan was already a Vice Admiral before taking command of the MSTS.|$|E
500|$|Since the 1980s it {{has become}} common to speak of Post-Boom writers, {{most of whom were}} born during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, such as Roberto Bolaño, the post Boom Spanish {{language}} writer who has made the greatest impact on world literature. It is difficult to clearly situate the Post-Boom as many of its writers were active {{before the end of the}} Boom. [...] Indeed, some writers, like Jose Donoso could be said to belong to both movements. [...] His novel The Obscene Bird of Night (El obsceno pájaro de la noche, 1970) is considered, as Philip Swanson notes, [...] "one of the classics of the Boom." [...] His later work, however, fits more comfortably into the post-Boom. [...] Manuel Puig and Severo Sarduy are considered writers whose works embody the transition from the Boom to the Post-Boom. It is important to note that this uneasiness in categorization is perpetuated by the fact that major writers of the Boom (Fuentes, García Márquez and Vargas Llosa) continued <b>writing</b> <b>well</b> after the end of the Boom. [...] The post-Boom is distinct from the Boom in various respects, most notably in the presence of female authors such as Isabel Allende, Luisa Valenzuela, Giannina Braschi, Cristina Peri Rossi, and Elena Poniatowska. [...] While Valenzuela and Poniatowska were both active writers during, and in Poniatowska's case even before, the Boom period, Allende is considered [...] "a product of the Boom." [...] Shaw also identifies Antonio Skármeta, Rosario Ferre and Gustavo Sainz as Post-Boom writers. [...] The Post-Boom writers challenge the perceived elitism of the Boom by using a simpler, more readable style and going back to realism.|$|E

60|$|DEAR SIR,--The parcels {{contained}} some {{letters and}} verses, all (but one) anonymous and complimentary, and very anxious for my conversion from certain infidelities into which my good-natured correspondents conceive {{me to have}} fallen.

The 'Bioscope' contained an MS. copy of very excellent verses, from whom I know not, but evidently the composition of some one in the habit of writing, and of <b>writing</b> <b>well.</b> I do not know if he be the author of the 'Bioscope' which accompanied them; but whoever he is, if you can discover him, thank him from me most heartily.

I had also a letter from Mr. Walpole on matters of this world, which I have answered.|$|E

For some ten minutes his eyes went rapidly down the lines, but he found that his mind did not follow what he was reading. He struggled again, but still his thoughts were on the letter. He did not wish to open it, having some vague idea that, till the letter should have been read, there was a chance of escape. The letter would not become due to be read till the next day. It should not have been there now to tempt his thoughts on this night. But he could do nothing while it lay there. 'It shall {{be a part of the}} bargain that I shall never have to see him,' he said to himself, as he opened it. The second line told him that the danger was over.|$|E
