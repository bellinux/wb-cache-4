40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} design {{solutions}} for the Harvester. It is a machine designed for the extraction of timber in large quantities. Its major place of employment is in coniferous forests. The machine is able to cut down the tree, remove branches from the tree and cut it into requested segments suitable for the removal and all in one step. The main aim of the thesis {{is to create an}} original shape solution for the Harvester, a machine for the wood harvesting, with a view to future development. The total concept is based on the present progressive, constructional technology solutions. Machine design is based on the the fundamental ergonomic requirements that make it easier for drivers to work. In the proposal I use a combination of a <b>wheeled</b> <b>harvester</b> with a walking robot design...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the test results}} of exhaust emissions from the engine of a <b>wheeled</b> <b>harvester.</b> On {{the basis of the}} present analysis, the ranges of most frequently used engine loads and speeds were determined. The obtained time density characteristics (distribution of engine speeds and loads in time) of the engines were referred to the measuring points of the exhaust emission homologation test. During the measurement of the exhaust emissions, the machine was in the forest engaged in tree cutting. Exhaust emission tests from non-road vehicle engines are currently performed on engine test beds in the NRSC and NRTC tests. The present methodology is a new solution {{that could be used in}} the future as a basis for the development of harvesting technology aimed at reducing exhaust emissions from engines. During the tests, the authors also measured the amount of timber harvested during the felling process in order to be able to relate the emission results to the amount of the generated product. Harvesters are more and more often used in forest operations but they still have to compete with handheld (gasoline powered) chainsaws and that is why in this paper the authors included a comparison of the exhaust emissions from a chainsaw with the emissions from the engine of a harvester. The authors used a portable analyzers (SEMTECH DS and LAM manufactured by SENSORS) for the measurement of the exhaust emissions. The said analyzer can measure the concentrations of exhaust gas components in an on-line mode, while the engine is running under field conditions...|$|E

40|$|Excavators are {{commonly}} used in forest harvesting in Brazil as an option to typical forestry harvesters, mainly because of their lower cost and also because some models are being manufactured locally, which means more units sold, facilitating dealer’s support and purchase of parts. Problems with excavators are related to high cost of tracks maintenance and difficulties to operate on steep ground terrain, when compared with <b>wheeled</b> <b>harvesters.</b> This study compared excavators, used as forestry <b>harvesters,</b> with <b>wheeled</b> <b>harvesters</b> to fall Eucalyptus tree plantations located on flat terrain. The productivities of both machines were quite similar, but the higher cost per effective hour of <b>wheeled</b> <b>harvesters,</b> concerned the models utilized in this study, favored the use of excavators, as base machines, to fall trees in a clear-cut system on flat terrain...|$|R
40|$|In the bachelor’s {{thesis is}} made the basic {{division}} of harvesters according to types of chassis, technology process {{of trees and}} sizes of harvesters. The next point of thesis is about construction of harvesters and about mechanical parts, especially harvester heads. In the next part division of some operational and technical arguments of Czech machines and foreign machines is made. There was critical classification of machines in groups, {{on the basis of}} these arguments. Critique was oriented mainly on <b>wheel</b> <b>harvesters.</b> This group was chosen because of its biggest representation in Czech Republic. Some structural specialities of harvesters and progress of harvester‘s technique were presented...|$|R
50|$|The bullwheel began use in farm {{implements}} with the reaper. The term described the traveling wheel, traction wheel, drive <b>wheel,</b> or <b>harvester</b> <b>wheel.</b> The bullwheel powered all {{the moving parts}} of these farm machines including the reciprocating knives, reel, rake, and self binder. The bullwheel's outer surface provided traction against the ground and turned when the draft animals or tractor pulled the implement forward. Cyrus McCormick used the bullwheel to power his 1834 reaper and until the early 1920s when small internal combustion engine gasoline engines like the Cushman Motor began to be favored.|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of bachelor´s thesis is description of harvester and its main parts. Then research of four six – <b>wheeled</b> forestry <b>harvesters</b> was developed. Features of compared harvesters {{are similar to the}} task. The next point was theoretical part with equations needed for calculation of rolling and inertial resistances. Based on the theory an enumeration of powers of particular driving modes was done. Then performances for work devices of harvester were calculated. From the single values were determined total powers of machine, which were transparently organized into table and graph. Based on the maximal total power were chosen three appropriate engines. From the three was selected the most suitable one...|$|R
50|$|In 1954 {{the company}} became Arbos-Bubba and {{launched}} a wheeled tractor with a 35 HP Perkins P4TA diesel engine, followed by a tracked version, {{with a choice of}} two engines, the next year: Perkins P4TA or the 32 HP Deutz F2L514. The tractors were not very successful: by the end of December 1955 it had sold only 33 wheeled versions and 9 tracked. In 1956 the brand dropped the Bubba name, and became simply Arbos. It produced the 100 C combine <b>harvesters,</b> <b>wheeled</b> and tracked, and the Allodola 650 with a diesel Fiat engine. These were followed by the 1000 Super and the 750 Super.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the results of}} changes in soil compaction after the passages of combine harvester. The research was done on the maize-stubble; the soil was the mold formed in the sand. The measured parameter was a penetration of resistance in range of depth 0 – 60 cm. The measurements were done in the ruts after the passages {{the front and rear}} <b>wheel</b> of combine <b>harvester.</b> During the experiment two levels of vertical load of wheels were applied – these levels were dependent on filling of grain tank of harvester. Moreover, the influence of the lateral tilt of harvester on the soil compaction was analyzed (the harvester was equipped with the leveling system which allowed to obtain the tilt). The obtained results shows that the increase in vertical load caused greater compaction in ruts. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} passage of tilted harvester caused lower compaction than the harvester without tilt...|$|R
40|$|Uniform {{seed spacing}} has been {{demonstrated}} to bea significant factor in quality and yield for somecrops such as sugarbeets. With uniform spacing,the roots can grow to a uniform size and fill the row space without being pushed out of the row by a neighboring root. This ensures that all of each root can be gathered from the row by the harvester. With uneven plant spacing, some roots may be {{too small to be}} gathered by the harvester, or some roots may be too large, and may be damaged by the topping implements, or the lifting <b>wheels</b> of the <b>harvester</b> (Jaggard, 1990). Traditional methods of sugarbeet planting have involved planting excess seed and thinning the resulting plants to obtain the desired plant population at a uniform plant spacing. Until the 1970 s nearly all the sugarbeet crop in the world, including the United States, was planted with excess seed and the resulting plants thinned to a final stand. Advancements in plant establishment practices such a...|$|R
40|$|High value {{crops such as}} peas for {{the frozen}} {{vegetable}} market have to be harvested at the optimum point for quality, regardless of field conditions. Six <b>wheeled</b> pea <b>harvesters</b> with a gross weight of 27 t, giving a wheel load of 4. 5 t are required to move from field to field with optimum timeliness. In order to achieve road speeds of 25 km/h an inflation pressure of 2. 2 bar {{is required for the}} specific tyre load speed rating. Typically, in field conditions, this inflation pressure is not reduced and therefore the likelihood of soil damage is increased. This study was undertaken {{to examine the effects of}} tyre section width and inflation pressure on rolling resistance, rut depth and sub-surface soil deformation. Under controlled laboratory conditions three tyres, at three inflation pressures, with a load of 4. 5 t were passed over a soil at three different initial bulk densities. Measurements of dry bulk density, rut depth, rolling resistance, cone penetrometer resistance and soil deformation through the profile were taken before and after the passage of the tyres. The results show that by increasing the tyre size and reducing the inflation pressure the depth at which compaction occurs and rut depth decrease by 44 %. The 800 mm section tyre causes less compaction than any of the other tyres tested especially when inflated to 1. 6 bar. Rolling resistance is reduced when the tyre is inflated to the optimum for each tyre. The change in bulk density when plotted against either initial bulk density or penetration resistance results in a set of curves which can be used by the manufacturer, farmer or operator to select the correct tyre section width and inflation pressure for field conditions. As a result of this study the harvester manufacturers are investigating the engineering requirements of increasing tyre section width to 800 mm and are now equipping pea harvesters with central tyre inflation systems. The benefits of which would be to significantly reduce the amount of soil compaction, reduce rolling resistance and save the operator £ 455 000 per annum in fuel costs...|$|R
40|$|PMC Harvesters Ltd is an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) for the pea {{and bean}} market. Their primary product {{line is a}} self {{propelled}} harvester known as the 979 CT harvester. The 979 CT is of considerable proportions being 4 m x 4 m x 12 m in overall dimensions, six wheel drive and weighs 29, 620 kg GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight) when fully laden. The aim of this work was to identify and outline possible solutions for the support system (tyre or track and undercarriage), quantify the performance of each system, produce a design and evaluation method to determine an optimal structural specification and to produce a design recommendation for the application. Analysis of the current 979 CT <b>harvester</b> <b>wheel</b> configuration highlighted many constraining factors in tyre choice. The most pertinent of these was that the wheels have a very limited operating space and following {{a study of the}} possible tyre options it became apparent only two manufactures, Michelin and Trelleborg, could provide tyres which met the vehicle parameters. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of the three chosen tyre options. From the findings of these tests {{it was clear that the}} optimal tyre for the PMC configuration was the Trelleborg Twin Radial tyre, operating at minimum road inflation pressure (1. 6 bar) as designated by Trelleborg. When operating the harvester in its normal working environment the tyre pressure should be set at minimum road inflation for in-field conditions with a DBD (Dry Bulk Density) of > 1. 3 g/cm 3, as excess damage caused by operating above minimum field operating pressure is superficial. The use of low compaction equipment such as CTIS (Central Tyre Inflation System) or tracks would not be beneficial to the PMC application. The track tested created a hardened track pan, thus requiring more effort to rectify post harvest. A CTIS increases the consumption of diesel and offered no reduction in soil compaction below plough depth as shown by the findings from operating the optimal tyre at minimum field inflation pressure (1. 2 bar). The primary objective of this project was to offer solutions to reduce the effects of the PMC harvester’s weight on its operating medium. The first natural step was to assess the vehicles main structure in order to improve its performance to weight ratio. The initial phase of this process was to validate the modelling and analyses techniques used to assess the structure. This was done within a controlled test environment at CU@S and from this work a factor of safety of 10 % was designated to be applied to all analysis in order to authenticate results and generate a “worst case” answer. Revisions of the main chassis, main pivot and rear axle assemblies were created and analysed. Test metrics were defined which represented operating patterns of the harvester. The findings from these tests saw a 22. 6 % weight reduction, 43. 1 % increase in life expectancy and 10. 2 % reduction in peak stress in the main chassis and main pivot. Unlike the other two key assemblies, the rear axle was deemed fit for purpose and would not benefit from any further design changes...|$|R
