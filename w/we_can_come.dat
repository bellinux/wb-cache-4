500|$|Speaking to The BoomBox, Usher {{explained}} {{that he wanted to}} work with Swedish House Mafia ever since they both performed together at the 2010 American Music Awards. The group agreed to work with Usher, saying [...] "We'll see if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> to Atlanta, and if we can, we'll start to work on some tracks, writing, and moving the ball forward." [...] In an interview with MTV News, regarding the collaboration with Usher, Steve Angello commented, [...] "We met Usher couple of years ago, we did the AMA's together and then we came to hang-out in Ibiza. We were in Atlanta and we were all working together for five days. He has always been a great artist and he always knows what he wants so it is a good collaboration all in all. We rather work with somebody who we respect, than to rather work with just big name." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Clark Gregg stated he {{believed}} the season would be shown in a block of 10 episodes, then breaking for Agent Carter, before airing the remaining 12. Explaining this decision, Bell said, One of our challenges last year was to produce 22 episodes that aired over, what, 40 weeks? 36 weeks? Something like that. And the age of re-runs is dead. Re-runs are death, and so you're trying to commit to the habit of the show and [...] tune in to something else or a re-run and they'll get pissed off. They'll go away. What this allows us to do is minimize repeats. We're showing ten episodes, and {{there has to be}} a gap or two because it's physically impossible to produce ten shows and get through post production in time, we can't do that so there's going to be a Marvel special at some point. But pretty much every week you're showing up and we're there, and then instead of a repeat showing up mid-run and losing momentum, Agent Carter comes in and has its own cool stuff, and they're running eight weeks in a row, then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> back and run twelve in a row with no interruptions. We're still producing our show every week but it just gives us time, barely, to finish 22 on schedule. It takes out the need for repeats in the back half.|$|E

2500|$|The {{story of}} the life of the Mexican divinity, Quetzalcoatl, closely resembles that of the Savior; so closely, indeed, that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> to no other {{conclusion}} than that Quetzalcoatl and Christ are the same being.

He said halting these payments to newborns {{from the end}} of the year – and the top-up payments – would save £520m.

2500|$|According to Cernat, his {{articles}} for Integral show Fondane {{as an ally}} of the [...] "anti-political" [...] and lyrical side of Surrealism, a poet placing his trust in [...] "the negative-soteriological, liberating function of poetry". The impact of existentialist philosophy was even traced to the [...] "cine-poems" [...] by Martin Stanton (who called the pieces [...] "amazing"). In contrast to the Surrealists, Fondane {{did not believe in}} a need to circulate poems as universal messages, but rather saw them as the basis for a very personal relationship with the reader: [...] "This is not a time for print. Poetry is seeking its friends, not an audience. [...] Poetry will be for the few—or it will not be at all." [...] Chitrit, who parallels Fondane's definitions with the similar views of Romanian poet and Holocaust survivor Paul Celan, concludes: [...] "This is probably the closest that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> to seeing contemporary poetry." [...] Fondane's other literary works also evidence the impact of his philosophical preoccupations. With Le Féstin de Balthazar, the writer modified his earlier Monologul by adopting Shestivist themes (introducing allegorical characters who discuss Aristotelianism, capitalism and revolution) and by introducing some elements from the burlesque. Originally conceived in 1918 and completed in 1933, Philoctète reworked Sophocles' play of the same title, interpreting it through the style of Gide's dramas.|$|E
