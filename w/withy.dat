5|$|Manchester Liners {{had been}} partly owned by Furness <b>Withy</b> from the beginning, {{and they became}} a {{subsidiary}} in 1970. Furness <b>Withy</b> was itself taken over in 1980 by the C. Y. Tung Group of Hong Kong. Robert B. Stoker retired in 1979 as Chairman of Manchester Liners after 47years service with the company.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ultimately}} {{the number of}} men that joined the units of the 2nd AIF from the Militia was in fact lower than anticipated, a large number of such personnel left to seek an opportunity to serve overseas. In this time the 61st Battalion lost many of its experienced senior officers and non-commissioned officers to the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions that were raised in Queensland, {{as well as to the}} Royal Australian Air Force. Of note was the loss of the battalion's pipe and drum band, which joined the 2/25th en masse. A 61st Battalion officer, Major Charles <b>Withy,</b> also went across with them serving initially as the second in command and then later as the 2/25th's commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|By 1904 {{the line}} was {{operating}} fourteen steamships of between four and seven thousand tons, several built by the associated Furness <b>Withy</b> shipyards. Services to ports in eastern Canada were supplemented by regular sailings to Boston, Philadelphia, and the southern US cotton ports of New Orleans and Galveston. Between 1904 and 1908 ML deployed three vessels including the Manchester City to the River Plate route, serving other UK ports as well Manchester. The main return cargo was frozen and chilled meat, and the City set a record for the largest meat consignment up to that time. Lord Furness, as he had become, died in 1912 and was succeeded as ML's chairman by R. B. Stoker {{until his death in}} 1919. ML's fleet was maintained at 14vessels during the last few years before the First World War. Eleven of their ships were deployed on the Canadian routes, carrying mainly manufactured goods outwards and meat and grain inbound.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Withies</b> {{traditionally}} {{serve to}} mark minor tidal channels in UK harbours and estuaries. In many places they remain in use [...] {{and are often}} marked on navigation charts. At high tide the tops {{of a line of}} <b>withies</b> stuck in the mud on one or both sides of a channel will show above water to indicate where the deeper water lies. Note the images of international navigation-chart symbols for <b>withies</b> (port and starboard).|$|R

5|$|Smallpeice {{initially}} held {{discussions in}} 1965 with {{the newly formed}} Overseas Containers group, which {{was focused on the}} UK to Australia and Far East routes, about Cunard's Port Line subsidiary and Ronald Vestey's Blue Star Line joining British and Commonwealth Shipping, Furness <b>Withy,</b> P and the Ocean Steamship Company in the joint venture. Their approaches were rebuffed, and it was quickly decided that Cunard and Blue Star Line should try to form a rival group, which would be called Associated Container Transportation. The venture was formed in late 1965 and early 1966, with the first board meeting taking place on 12 January 1966. Cunard's Port Line and Vestey's Blue Star Line were joined by Ben Line, Ellerman Lines and Harrison Line in the venture. Alexander Hull from Ellerman Lines was the inaugural chairman, but following his death in April 1967, Smallpeice took over as chairman of Associated Container Transportation.|$|E

25|$|In 1913, Willochra was {{chartered}} by the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand. She {{was used}} as a troopship. In November 1914, Willochra was requisitioned, continuing her trooping duties. In 1919, Willochra was sold to Furness <b>Withy.</b> She was refitted and renamed Fort Victoria. Initially, she was operated by the Quebec Steamship Co, Montreal but in 1921 she was transferred to the Bermuda & West Indies Steamship Co, Hamilton, Bermuda. Both companies were owned by Furness <b>Withy.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{with several}} other willows, the shoots, called <b>withies,</b> are often used in basketry.|$|R
50|$|An Osier bed {{is where}} {{historically}} willows were planted and coppiced to produce <b>withies</b> which {{were used for}} basket making, fish-traps, and other purposes. The willow species salix viminalis was typically grown for this purpose. Willow rods (cuttings) would be planted, which root easily in moist ground, {{and the growth of}} the willow <b>withies</b> would be cut every one or two years.|$|R
50|$|The {{trees at}} <b>Withybed</b> support various invertebrates, most visibly the butterflies, like the purple and green {{hairstreak}} or the speckled wood.|$|R
25|$|At {{some point}} Commander Henry <b>Withy</b> assumed command. On 4 August 1809, Captain Thomas Byam Martin of Implacable, while off Hogland, {{assigned}} Erebus to patrol between Aspo and Sommars rock. Her {{mission was to}} harry Russian shipping and give warning should she spot the Russian fleet exiting Kronstadt.|$|E
25|$|Andes had 458 crew but carried {{only about}} 470 passengers, {{and in the}} 1960s this generous ratio became less economic. Also the cost of bunker oil was rising and {{competition}} in the cruise market was increasing. In December 1970 Furness, <b>Withy</b> announced {{that a number of}} RML ships would be withdrawn from service, including Andes.|$|E
25|$|In 1965 Furness, <b>Withy</b> {{took over}} RML. Andes {{cruising}} became increasingly diverse. In 1966 she visited Livorno {{for the first}} time, and she returned to Akureyri {{for the first time}} since she landed Allied troops there to join the occupation of Iceland in 1940. In 1967 she made her first visits to Mahé in the Seychelles and Tobago in the Caribbean.|$|E

25|$|In 1969 British and Commonwealth Shipping, Furness <b>Withy,</b> P and The Ocean Steamship Company {{established}} Overseas Containers Limited ('OCL') {{to exploit}} containerisation.

P was merged with Nedlloyd in 1996 to form P Nedlloyd.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{the scale of}} the {{architecture}} changed as the east side of Corporation Street attracted substantial broad based buildings. The neo-Baroque building designed by F. E. L. Harris for the Co-operative Wholesale Society was erected between 1905 and 1909, and dated 1907. It was constructed in red brick with polished granite and sandstone dressings. The façade has full height pilasters and Corinthian columns, and the roof is concealed by parapet walls. The Mitchell Memorial Hall was lost in the Manchester Blitz, and the 1907 building has been extended to fill the whole block. A further Classical sandstone building on Corporation Street to the north of Hanover Street is owned by the CWS. This was designed by W. A. Johnson in 1928 and opened in 1930. It is symmetrical in design, with further full height pilasters and a large central entrance arch, topped with a mansard roof with dormer windows. By 1908 a new Chief Office for the Co-operative Insurance had been built at 109 Corporation Street, Manchester, which served as their head office until 1962 when they moved to the CIS Tower on Miller Street, barely 100 yards distant. Footage captured in 1901 shows the junction of Cross Street and Corporation Street with horse-drawn carriages. The junction with <b>Withy</b> Grove became the northern offices of a national newspaper.|$|E
