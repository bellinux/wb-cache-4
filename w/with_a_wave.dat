5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly a discrete genre known as rock and roll evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music, which came to include diverse styles like heavy metal and punk rock. During the 1970s most of these styles were evolving in the underground music scene, while mainstream audiences began the decade <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of singer-songwriters who drew on the deeply emotional and personal lyrics of 1960s folk rock. The same period saw the rise of bombastic arena rock bands, bluesy Southern rock groups and mellow soft rock stars. Beginning in the later 1970s, the rock singer and songwriter Bruce Springsteen became a major star, with anthemic songs and dense, inscrutable lyrics that celebrated the poor and working class.|$|E

5000|$|Lasagnette {{is a type}} of ribbon pasta. It is a {{narrower}} version of lasagna. Characteristics of lasagnette differ based on the form of their edges. Different kinds could have edges <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>waved</b> cut on both sides, straight cut edges on both side, or a variation including one side <b>with</b> <b>a</b> straight cut and the other <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>waved</b> cut. Lasagnette can be prepared in various forms; the two most popular involve a thinner version of the traditional layered Italian lasagna. The second version combines ingredients of the recipe with the pasta, and is served tossed on a plate.|$|R

5|$|The {{invasion}} commenced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of 234 German dive {{bombers and}} medium bombers attacking Belgrade, escorted by 120 fighters. This force reached Belgrade at 07:00, {{where it was}} met by the 51st Fighter Group, without an IK-3 from the 161st Fighter Squadron, that had developed engine trouble after takeoff {{and was unable to}} engage. The other five IK-3s were the first to meet the initial bomber wave but they were almost immediately attacked by Bf 109Es of Jagdgeschwader 77. The pilots of the IK-3s claimed five German aircraft and one aircraft from each Yugoslav squadron was lost. Poljanec had claimed a twin-engined bomber and a Bf 109E but when he returned to Zemun in his badly damaged aircraft, he was strafed by a Messerschmitt 110, which further damaged his aircraft and wounded him. After this encounter, only three IK-3s were serviceable, including the IK-3 that had developed engine difficulties prior to the first German wave.|$|E
5|$|The {{single largest}} niche {{industry}} {{is based on}} Latin music. Latin music has long influenced American popular music, and was an especially {{crucial part of the}} development of jazz. Modern pop Latin styles include a wide array of genres imported from across Latin America, including Colombian cumbia, Puerto Rican reggaeton, and Mexican corrido. Latin popular music in the United States began <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of dance bands in the 1930s and 1950s. The most popular styles included the conga, rumba, and mambo. In the 1950s Perez Prado made the cha-cha-cha famous, and the rise of Afro-Cuban jazz opened many ears to the harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic possibilities of Latin music. The most famous American form of Latin music, however, is salsa. Salsa incorporates many styles and variations; the term can be used to describe most forms of popular Cuban-derived genres. Most specifically, however, salsa refers to a particular style that was developed by mid-1970s groups of New York City-area Cuban and Puerto Rican immigrants, and stylistic descendants like 1980s salsa romantica. Salsa rhythms are complicated, with several patterns played simultaneously. The clave rhythm forms the basis of salsa songs and is used by the performers as a common rhythmic ground for their own phrases.|$|E

New York boomed during the Roaring Twenties, before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and skyscrapers expressed the energy of the city. New York City was the site of successive tallest buildings in the world from 1913 to 1974.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{struggled}} {{to cut costs}} in order to compete <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of new, low-cost carriers in the region. The airline lost RM443.4million (US$137.4million) {{in the first quarter}} of 2014. The second quarter—the first in the aftermath of Flight 370's disappearance - saw a loss of RM307.04million (US$97.6million), which represented a 75% increase over losses from the second-quarter of 2013. As a result, MAS has not made a profit since 2010. In the previous three years, the airline had booked losses of: RM1.17billion (US$356million) in 2013, RM433million in 2012, and RM2.5billion in 2011. Industry analysts expect MAS to lose further market share and face a challenging environment to stand out from competitors while addressing their financial plight. The company's stock, down as much as 20% following the disappearance of Flight370, had fallen 80% over the previous five years, which contrasts with a rise in the Malaysian stock market of about 80% over the same period.|$|E

25|$|The Red Army, which vastly outnumbered the Polish defenders, {{achieved}} its targets {{by using}} strategic and tactical deception. Some 230,000 Polish {{prisoners of war}} had been captured. The campaign of mass persecution in the newly acquired areas began immediately. In November 1939 the Soviet government ostensibly annexed the entire Polish territory under its control. Some 13.5 million Polish citizens who fell under the military occupation were made into new Soviet subjects following mock elections conducted by the NKVD secret police in the atmosphere of terror, the results of which were used to legitimize the use of force. A Soviet campaign of political murders {{and other forms of}} repression, targeting Polish figures of authority, such as military officers, police and priests, began <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of arrests and summary executions. Over the next year and a half, the Soviet NKVD sent {{hundreds of thousands of people}} from eastern Poland to Siberia and other remote parts of the Soviet Union in four major waves of deportation between 1939 and 1941.|$|E
25|$|By early 1942, Italy's {{military}} position {{had become}} untenable. After the defeat at El Alamein {{at the end}} of 1942, the Axis troops had to retreat to where they were finally defeated in the Tunisia Campaign in early 1943. Italy suffered major setbacks on the Eastern Front as well. The Allied invasion of Sicily brought the war to the nation's very doorstep. The Italian home front was also in bad shape as the Allied bombings were taking their toll. Factories all over Italy were brought to a virtual standstill because raw materials, such as coal and oil, were lacking. Additionally, there was a chronic shortage of food, and what food was available was being sold at nearly confiscatory prices. Mussolini's once-ubiquitous propaganda machine lost its grip on the people; a large number of Italians turned to Vatican Radio or Radio London for more accurate news coverage. Discontent came to a head in March 1943 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of labor strikes in the industrial north—the first large-scale strikes since 1925. Also in March, some of the major factories in Milan and Turin stopped production to secure evacuation allowances for workers' families. The German presence in Italy had sharply turned public opinion against Mussolini; for example, when the Allies invaded Sicily, the majority of the public there welcomed them as liberators.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{inquiry and}} {{preliminary}} {{hearings on the}} 1886 Normanton Incident fell under the consular jurisdiction of the Kobe foreign settlement. On October 24, the cargo ship Normanton, belonging to a steamboat company at the Yokohama settlement, sank in the waters {{off the coast of}} Wakayama Prefecture. The boat's 25 Japanese passengers, who were riding along with the cargo, all died. Although 11 British crewmen boarded lifeboats and survived, not a single Japanese passenger made it out alive, and so suspicion emerged that the captain and crew had been negligent in saving the passengers. Under the consular jurisdiction guaranteed by the Ansei Treaties, the hearings for the case were heard over five days beginning on November 1 in the Kobe foreign settlement, but the British consul James Troup found the crew innocent. The governor of Hyōgo Prefecture, Utsumi Tadakatsu, was dissatisfied with the verdict and accused the captain of murder. On November 20, preliminary hearings were held on this charge in the foreign settlement, and on December 8 public hearings were held in Yokohama; both of these found the captain guilty. As the initial inquiry over the incident had found the crew blameless, doubts and criticism of the right to consular jurisdiction arose domestically in Japan, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> of anti-British sentiment. This initial inquiry is a black spot in the otherwise positive history of foreign–Japanese relations in the Kobe foreign settlement.|$|E
