50|$|Sodium {{alginate}} {{is the one}} of {{the main}} ingredients that is responsible for Easy Cheese's pseudoplastic characteristics. More specifically, it contributes to the integrity of the gel-like network formed by the casein and salts. The newly formed network is made possible through cation binding, which converts the hydrophilic sodium alginate into hydrophobic calcium alginate. Guluronic acid residues that are linked together demonstrate a high affinity for calcium ions. Sodium alginate works in conjunction with the destabilization of the casein micelle where calcium ions can interact with guluronic chains. Due to a mixture of these interactions, a gel-like structure is formed rather than a true gel structure. About 0.05-0.5% <b>weight</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume</b> of sodium alginate at a 5.4-5.7 range must be added to the cheese mixture to exhibit these properties during extrusion.|$|E

Standardized Prescribed Concrete (SPC) mix design is mostly adopted in mass concreting to high strength concreting applications in most developing nations.

The physical properties of the constituent concrete materials, fine aggregate, 12 mm and 19 mm sized coarse aggregates were determined. The strength of SPC mix of ST 2, ST 4 and ST 5 to British standard were determined when batched <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> and their <b>volume</b> equivalents mix-design batch determined.

Both biological and non-biological test aerosols were used: Bacillus atrophaeus, MS 2, polystyrene latex (PSL), and sodium chloride (NaCl). The B. atrophaeus endospores had an aerodynamic diameter of 900 nm, whereas MS 2 virion par-ticles ranged from 10 to 80 nm.
