5|$|Currently, astronomers {{know little}} about the shape and size of our galaxy {{relative}} to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> other galaxies; {{it is difficult to}} observe the entire Milky Way from the inside. A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars.|$|E
25|$|Traditional phonics {{instruction}} has marked benefits. Early reading {{often involves}} significant expansion of a child's mental lexicon, which includes {{all the words}} the child has been exposed to and their meanings. By focusing {{on the principle of}} linking specific sounds and characters, the child has the ability to recognize new words and derive meaning from them. Being able to adapt <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> language to new words they experience is crucial to expanding their mental lexicon; this allows for productive reading that is the ability to read new words. It also produces higher achievement for beginning readers and the difference is the greatest for those at risk of failing to learn to read. While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, some need explicit instructions on phonics rules. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics are better at reading, spelling and comprehension.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{it is very}} difficult, and {{at times}} arguably impossible, to adopt {{the point of view}} of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know {{everything}} about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> the situation. However, if this approach is na√Øvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.|$|E

2500|$|The series had two interns, dubbed [...] "Mythterns": Discovery Channel contest winner Christine Chamberlain and viewer {{building}} contest-winner Jess Nelson. During {{the first}} season, the program featured segments with folklorist Heather Joseph-Witham, who explained {{the origins of}} certain myths, and other people who had first-hand experience with the myths being tested, but those elements were phased out early during the series. The MythBusters still commonly consult with experts for myths or topics for which they need assistance. These topics include firearms, for which they mostly consult Lt. Al Normandy of the South San Francisco Police Department, and explosives, for which they consult retired FBI explosives expert Frank Doyle and Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the Alameda County Sheriff's Office. The MythBusters often ask other people, such as those supplying the equipment being tested, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> the myth under investigation. When guests are on the show, the MythBusters generally consult them or include them in the experiments.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the text}} of most pages, there are usually {{a large number of}} {{hypertext}} links to other pages within the wiki. This form of non-linear navigation is more [...] "native" [...] to a wiki than structured/formalized navigation schemes. Users can also create any number of index or table-of-contents pages, with hierarchical categorization or whatever form of organization they like. These may be challenging to maintain [...] "by hand", as multiple authors and users may create and delete pages in an ad hoc, unorganized manner. Wikis can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages. Some wikis, including the original, have a backlink feature, which displays all pages that link to a given page. It is also typically possible in a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite others to share <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> a subject new to the wiki. Wiki users can typically [...] "tag" [...] pages with categories or keywords, {{to make it easier for}} other users to find the article. For example, a user creating a new article on cold weather cycling might [...] "tag" [...] this page under the categories of commuting, winter sports and bicycling. This would make it easier for other users to find the article.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{in-depth}} interviews with members Justice After Acquittal - a self-help and campaign group {{formed by the}} families of victims of homicide where offenders are seen to have been unjustly acquitted - this study describes and analyses the issues, problems and injustices that the families? experienced at each stage {{of the criminal justice}} process, from initial police investigations though to the trial and beyond. The families craved information about {{what had happened to the}} victim and what would subsequently happen in response, and they understandably became preoccupied with the details of the police investigation and court case. In order to help them comprehend the homicide and adapt to their trauma, families developed narratives in an attempt to understand the events and individuals surrounding the case. They drew their knowledge from <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the deceased and their lives, the details they had gleaned about the events surrounding the homicide itself, and often also <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the moral character of the suspected offenders. Acquittal, however, smashed those narratives. Families? outlooks were once again shaken, exacerbating their trauma. This forced them to examine and re-examine the police?s initial investigation, the trial, and the main participants that had acquitted, or aided the acquittal of the defendants, and it lead them to lose all faith in the criminal justice system...|$|R
