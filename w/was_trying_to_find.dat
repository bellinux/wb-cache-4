5|$|In 1982, Sid Sheinberg, the {{president}} of MCA and Universal City Studios and a seasoned attorney, <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{a way to get}} his company into the booming video game market. In April, he learned of the success of Nintendo's Donkey Kong video game and sent Robert Hadl, vice president of legislative matters, to investigate. Hadl's analysis was that Donkey Kongs storyline was based on that of King Kong and was thus an infringement of Universal's rights to that film's characters and scenario.|$|E

25|$|In Egypt, Abu Kamil {{extended}} algebra {{to the set}} of irrational numbers, accepting square {{roots and}} fourth roots as solutions and coefficients to quadratic equations. He also developed techniques used to solve three non-linear simultaneous equations with three unknown variables. One unique feature of his works <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> all the possible solutions {{to some of his}} problems, including one where he found 2676 solutions. His works formed an important foundation for the development of algebra and influenced later mathematicians, such as al-Karaji and Fibonacci.|$|E

Impressed by Lowell's manuscript, Giroux published the collection Lord Weary's Castle immediately, and it {{went on to win the}} 1947 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. In a PBS documentary on Lowell, Giroux states that it was the most successful book of poems that he ever published.|$|E

25|$|The {{season was}} rocked with scandal in early February {{when it came}} to light that Phoenix Coyotes Assistant Coach Rick Tocchet was found to be {{involved}} in a $1.6 million illegal sports gambling ring with Mafia ties. Apparently, no betting on NHL games was being done, but bets were being placed on college and professional football and college and professional basketball. Although Coyotes Head Coach Wayne Gretzky denied any knowledge or involvement in the ring, initial reports stated that wiretapped phone conversations he had proved that he not only knew about the ring, but <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> ways to conceal his wife's involvement in it. He was later cleared of these accusations, but long-term implications to his reputation are still unknown. For more information, see Operation Slapshot.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after, Watson took full {{responsibility}} for the operation, {{saying that he had}} planned it, had picked the team, and had seen that the attackers did their job. Prime Minister Steingrímur Hermannsson announced that Iceland <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the men and criticised the police for the initial delay that allowed them to escape. Watson traveled to Iceland in 1988 to face prosecution as Sea Shepherd's leader where he was detained for 24 hours before being deported without cause. A spokesperson for Iceland's largest whaling company told The New Yorker that Watson is persona non grata in the country. With their escape, Coronado and Howitt have never been charged with any wrongdoing in Iceland. Both have admitted responsibility but the statute of limitations for the act has passed.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 1997, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Edward Ferns sentenced 28-year-old Anthony Gabriel Rodriguez, 22-year-old Manuel Rosales, Jr., and 18-year-old Hugo David Gomez to 54 {{years and}} eight months {{to life in}} state prison. At that point, 17-year-old Augustin Lizama was to be retried. During the {{sentencing}} of the three convicted murderers, Margaret Fregoso, Rodriguez's grandmother, defended him and said that people outside of the court speculated that the Kuhen automobile traveled through the neighborhood so one or more occupants could purchase recreational drugs. Robynn Kuhen, the mother of Stephanie Kuhen, said that her family <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a shortcut home and said that Fregoso's statements were not true. The defense in the trial suggested that the Kuhen family knew {{the layout of the}} area and would not have found themselves lost in their car. On Friday, August 29, 1997, Lizama agreed to a plea bargain in which he received a conviction for assault.|$|E

500|$|... "I'll Make a Man Out of You" [...] {{was written}} by {{composer}} Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel, who were hired to write the songs for Mulan because, according to co-director Tony Bancroft, [...] "Disney <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> different songwriters that ... would give kind of different sound {{to each of the}} songs." [...] While Zippel, a Broadway lyricist, was recruited because the directors were impressed by the songwriter's work on Disney's Hercules (1997), at the time Wilder, a pop singer and record producer, was best known for his hit single [...] "Break My Stride".

500|$|Rockville Records {{refused to}} pay Uncle Tupelo any royalties, even though the band's first two albums, No Depression and Still Feel Gone, sold a {{combined}} 40,000 copies. Consequently, Margherita <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a new recording deal for the band. On a recommendation by singer Gary Louris of The Jayhawks, talent scout Joe McEwen pursued the band for a contract with Sire Records. McEwen was impressed by how the band {{was willing to go}} against trends, calling the band [...] "an alternative to the alternative". Executing an out-clause in their contract with Rockville, Uncle Tupelo signed a seven-record deal with Sire in 1992. The deal guaranteed the release of at least two albums, with a $150,000 budget for the first.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Arthur Pierson, and was produced by Glenn Goodwin, while Wayne Isham {{was in charge of}} photography. At the time of the song's release, Madonna's style of dress was catching on as a fashion statement among club kids and her fans. The most prominent among her fashion accessories were the crucifixes she wore as earrings and necklaces. Madonna commented that wearing a rosary and a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes seem to go with my name." [...] In reality, she <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a separate image for herself, being inspired by then artists like Boy George, Cyndi Lauper and David Bowie, and their constantly shifting image and persona. Madonna realized the importance of her music videos and its popularity via MTV—launched in 1981—was instrumental in popularizing her image.|$|E

But lo and behold, he finds that this is a case that {{for all intents and purposes}} is an X-File. It's been given to him by a man he's never looked at as an ally, Skinner. So it's an interesting establishing of a relationship between them." [...] Producer J.P. Finn described the episode as a departure from Carter's usual work as it did not deal with an alien subject matter.|$|E
