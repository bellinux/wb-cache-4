Having learned that John Archibald Campbell, an Alabaman serving on the Supreme Court, had decided to resign {{in light of his}} state's secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln's cabinet approved, and the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his resignation, {{and by the time he}} definitely determined to resign, Lincoln had changed his mind regarding Crittenden's nomination.|$|E
5|$|However, lacking {{requested}} reinforcements from McClellan, now {{commanding the}} Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run {{in the summer}} of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second time. The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS Virginia, formerly the USS Merrimack, damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the Battle of Hampton Roads.|$|E

At 8:26 of the fourth quarter Roethlisberger connected with Nate <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 50-yard touchdown pass. Pittsburgh's Moore scored his third touchdown of the day—his second rushing—and Hines Ward's 16-yard touchdown reception gave the Steelers 31points to the Bengals' ten. Moore finished the game with 120yards rushing, while Santonio Holmes lead the Steelers with 89Receiving yards.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why {{the president should be}} guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|E
5|$|The first bomb {{assembly}} {{team was}} formed in August 1947, followed by a second in December and a third in March 1948. Experience with assembling the bombs convincingly demonstrated the requirement, in Sandia if not in <b>Washington,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> much larger unit. Groves reluctantly approved a 109-man special weapons unit, and Montague converted the three lettered companies of the 38th Engineer Battalion into special weapons units. In 1948, they began training a Navy special weapons unit, as the Navy foresaw delivery of nuclear weapons with its new North American AJ Savage bombers from its s. This unit became the 471st Naval Special Weapons Unit on its certification in August 1948. Two Air Force units were created in September and December 1948, which became the 502d and 508th Aviation Squadrons. An additional Army special weapons unit was created in May 1948, and in December, the 38th Engineer Battalion (Special) became the 8460th Special Weapons Group, with all seven special weapons units under its command. The four Army units were then renamed the 111th, 122d, 133d and 144th Special Weapons Units. During the late 1940s the Air Force gradually became the major user of nuclear weapons, {{and by the end}} of 1949, it had twelve assembly units, and another three in training, while the Army had only four, and the Navy three, one for each of the three Midway-class carriers.|$|E

Almost immediately the Navy and President Harding were incensed by an apparent demonstration of naval weakness just after Harding had announced on July 10 invitations to other naval powers {{to gather in}} <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> conference on the limitation of naval armaments. Statements asserting the obsolescence of the battleship by disarmament proponents in Congress such as Senator William Borah heightened official anxiety.

25|$|Unalgas {{schedule}} of summers in Alaska and winter assignments with the Northern Division continued unchanged after the Treasury Department resumed {{control of the}} Coast Guard. Duties performed included search and rescue, fisheries patrols, treaty enforcement, delivery of supplies and mail to remote areas, transport of officials and prisoners, medical care, and law enforcement. A portion of each winter in the years 1922 to 1926 was spent on maintenance availabilities and repair work to the cutter. In February 1927, Unalga arrived at Winslow, <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> six-week overhaul, leaving 15 April for regular patrol duties in Alaska.

25|$|In {{response}} to organized crime, on August 25, 1953, the FBI created the Top Hoodlum Program. The national office directed field offices {{to gather information}} on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers. After the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO Act, took effect, the FBI began investigating the former Prohibition-organized groups, which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns. All of the FBI work was done undercover and from within these organizations, using the provisions provided in the RICO Act. Gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups. Although Hoover initially denied {{the existence of a}} National Crime Syndicate in the United States, the Bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families, including those headed by Sam Giancana and John Gotti. The RICO Act is still used today for all organized crime and any individuals who may fall under the Act's provisions.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Mark Jones gave the Buccaneers {{the ball at}} their own 49-yard line on a 24-yard punt return. Tampa Bay's offense then went on a 7-play, 51-yard drive that ended with quarterback Chris Simms' two-yard {{touchdown}} run. In the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay drove to the Redskins 19-yard line, but linebacker Lemar Marshall tackled fullback Mike Alstott for no gain on third down and 1, and then Simms threw an incomplete pass on fourth down. Buccaneers defensive back Brian Kelly intercepted a pass from Mark Brunell on the Redskins' next drive and returned it to the Redskins 35-yard line. With three {{minutes left in the}} game, Tampa Bay wide receiver Edell Shepherd caught {{what appeared to be a}} 35-yard touchdown reception, but he lost control of the ball as he was coming down in the end zone for an incomplete pass. The Buccaneers got one last chance to tie the game when they received a punt at their own 46-yard line with 1:05 left in regulation, but Simms threw a pass that was tipped at the line of scrimmage and went into the arms of Marcus <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> game-ending interception.|$|E

However, with the help of strong fitness reports from his superiors, Rear Admirals William D. Leahy and Adolphus Andrews, he was selected in January 1936 and, after passing the required physical and professional examinations, was promoted on 11 January 1937.

500|$|On 17 June 1985, National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane wrote a National Security Decision Directive {{which called}} for the United States to begin a {{rapprochement}} with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The paper read:Dynamic political evolution is taking place inside Iran. Instability caused by {{the pressures of the}} Iraq-Iran war, economic deterioration and regime in-fighting create the potential for major changes inside Iran. The Soviet Union is better positioned than the U.S. to exploit and benefit from any power struggle that results in changes from the Iranian regime...The U.S should encourage Western allies and friends to help Iran meet its import requirements so as to reduce the attractiveness of Soviet assistance...This includes provision of selected military equipment. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was highly negative, writing on his copy of McFarlane's paper: [...] "This is almost too absurd to comment on...like asking Qaddafi to <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cozy chat." [...] Secretary of State George Shultz was also opposed, stating that having designated Iran a State Sponsor of Terrorism in January 1984, how could the United States possibly sell arms to Iran? Only the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency William Casey supported McFarlane's plan to start selling arms to Iran.|$|E

[...] McAdoo summoned MacNeil to <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> meeting, and then ordered von Engelken to provide MacNeil with all the facilities and help he would need at the Philadelphia Mint—von Engelken had intended that the redesign take place at the sculptor's expense. [...] On January 17, the Mint released the first Standing Liberty quarters, dated both 1916 and 1917, into circulation. [...] On January 30, 1917, von Engelken instructed Joyce to give MacNeil full facilities, and told the Mint Superintendent, [...] "see that Mr. Barber keeps his objections to himself while Mr. MacNeil is there". [...] George T. Morgan, who had worked under Barber for the Engraver's entire 37-year tenure, was assigned to assist MacNeil.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of May 15, Waco's {{courthouse}} quickly filled to capacity {{in anticipation of the}} trial: the crowd nearly prevented some jurors from entering. Observers also filled the sidewalks around the courthouse; over two thousand spectators were present. Attendees were almost entirely white, but a few quiet members of Waco's black community were present. As Washington was led into the courtroom, one audience member pointed a gun at him, but was quickly overpowered. As the trial commenced, the judge attempted to keep order, insisting that the audience remain silent. Jury selection proceeded quickly: the defense did not challenge any selections of the prosecution. Bernstein states that the trial had a [...] "kangaroo-court atmosphere". [...] The judge asked <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> plea, and explained the potential sentences. Washington muttered a response, possibly [...] "yes", interpreted by the court as a guilty plea. The prosecution described the charges, and the court heard testimony from law enforcement officers and the doctor who examined Fryer's body. The doctor discussed how Fryer died, but did not mention rape. The prosecution rested, and Washington's attorney asked him whether he had committed the offense. Washington replied, [...] "That's what I done [...] " [...] and quietly apologized. The lead prosecutor addressed the courtroom and declared that the trial had been conducted fairly, prompting an ovation from the crowd. The jury was then sent to deliberate.|$|E
