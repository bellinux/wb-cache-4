5|$|Among Mahler's fellow {{students}} at the Conservatory was the future song composer Hugo Wolf, with whom he formed a close friendship. Wolf was unable {{to submit to the}} strict disciplines of the Conservatory and was expelled. Mahler, while sometimes rebellious, avoided the same fate only by writing a penitent letter to Hellmesberger. He attended occasional lectures by Anton Bruckner and, though never formally his pupil, was influenced by him. On 16 December 1877, he attended the disastrous premiere of Bruckner's Third Symphony, at which the composer was shouted down, and most of the audience walked out. Mahler and other sympathetic students later prepared a piano version of the symphony, which they presented to Bruckner. Along with many music students of his generation, Mahler fell under the spell of Richard Wagner, though his chief interest <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the music rather than the staging. It is not known whether he saw any of Wagner's operas during his student years.|$|E
25|$|German {{machine gun}} crews in the towers that guarded the western {{approach}} to the bridge opened up on the advancing American troops. At 3:20 pm, Friesenhahn made the last connections to the detonator and twisted the handle, but nothing happened. He tried again and all they heard <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> American shells hitting the area around them. Both Friesenhahn and Bratge knew the dire consequences to them personally and to the German defensive situation if they failed to destroy the bridge.|$|E

25|$|In Camp Kanombe, the bugle call {{immediately}} after the crash was taken by soldiers to mean that the Rwandan Patriotic Front had attacked the camp. The soldiers rushed to their units' armories to equip themselves. Soldiers of the paracommando brigade Commandos de recherche et d'action en profondeur assembled on the parade ground at around 9 pm while members of other units gathered elsewhere in the camp. At least one witness stated that about {{an hour after the}} crash there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> gunfire in Kanombe. Munitions explosions at Camp Kanombe were also initially reported.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} proceedings, no one actually identified who fired the gun that killed Aquino, but Rebecca Quijano, another passenger, testified {{that she saw}} a man behind Aquino (running from the stairs towards Aquino and his escorts) point a gun {{at the back of}} his head, then there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a gunshot. A post-mortem analysis disclosed that Aquino was shot in the back of the head at close range with the bullet exiting at the chin at a downward angle, which supported Quijano's testimony. More suspicions were aroused when Quijano described the assassin as wearing a military uniform.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} plans to {{relaunch}} the Jazz FM Records label with CD and download sales. The first CD released by Jazz FM <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> Jazz FM 2008 on 20 October 2008. WARL have been appointed to advertise the relaunched station prior to its launch, including {{the return of the}} Jazz FM chameleon and Listen In Colour branding used previously on 102.2 Jazz FM. The station raised awareness of the relaunch through email and social networking websites as well as a nationwide campaign through posters, national newspapers and magazines featuring the Jazz FM chameleon in 3D and listen in colour branding.|$|E

500|$|While most of {{the other}} songs on the Spice album {{required}} two or three days of studio time, [...] "Wannabe" [...] was recorded in less than an hour. The solo parts were divided between Brown, Bunton, Chisholm, and Halliwell. Victoria Adams missed {{most of the}} writing session and communicated {{with the rest of the}} group on a mobile phone. In her autobiography, she wrote: [...] "I just couldn't bear not being there. Because whatever they said about how it didn't matter, it did matter. Saying 'Yes, I like that' or 'Not sure about that' down the phone is not the same." [...] She contributed backing vocals and sings during the chorus. Rowe stayed up all night working on the song, and it was finished by morning, the only later addition <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> Brown's footsteps as she ran to the microphone.|$|E
500|$|To obtain certain {{snow and}} ice sound effects, sound {{designer}} Odin Benitez traveled to Mammoth Mountain, California, to record them at a frozen lake. However, the foley work for the film was recorded on the foley stage on the Warner Bros. lot by a Warner Bros. crew. The foley artists received daily deliveries of 50 pounds (22.6kg) of snow ice while working, to help them record all the necessary {{snow and ice}} sounds for the film. Because the film's visuals were finalized so late, five separate versions of nearly every footstep on snow were recorded (corresponding to five different types of snow), then one was later selected during mixing to match the snow as rendered in {{the final version of}} each scene. One issue that the production team was [...] "particular" [...] about <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> Elsa's footsteps in the ice palace, which required eight attempts, including wine glasses on ice and metal knives on ice; they ended up using a mix of three sounds.|$|E
500|$|NME {{ranked the}} album number 411 {{on their list}} of the 500 {{greatest}} albums of all time, describing it as [...] "stoner humour and mind-bending beats from a hip-hop dream team" [...] and stating that [...] "MF DOOM and Madlib might not have invented underground rap, but they damn well perfected it". Pitchfork ranked the album at number 13 in their list of the top 100 albums of 2000–2004, commenting, [...] "While Madlib's special power played tricks on your ears – a sample you were sure <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> cars rolling by on the street might sound like the hiss of a record on a different day ("Rainbows") – MF Doom unfurled his clever lyrics like a roll of sod on earth... and the album curved in on itself like a two-way mirror."Pitchfork also ranked Madvillainy as the 25th best album of the 2000s, describing it as [...] "a preternaturally perfect pairing of like-minded talents" [...] who [...] "have each been responsible for tons of great, grimy underground hip-hop". Tiny Mix Tapes considered the album the fourth best of the 2000s. Rhapsody named the ranked the album 1st on its [...] "Hip-Hop's Best Albums of the Decade" [...] list. PopMatters positioned it at number 49 on their list of the 100 best albums of the 2000s and praised MF DOOM, who [...] "free-associates culture high and low, from Hemingway to Robh Ruppel, across tongue-tied internal rhymes", and Madlib's [...] "fusion breaks, psych soul, and Steve Reich", and called the album [...] "the best chemistry of either’s career, {{and one of the}} best of hip-hop, period". In 2016 Q listed Madvillainy among the albums that didn't appear in their list of the best albums of last 30 years, stating that [...] "underground hip-hop's cracked geniuses, Madlib and MF DOOM, unite on a labyrinth of weed-stained vignettes that combine invention and accessibility". Spin ranked it number 123 on their list of the 300 best albums of the past 30 years (1985–2014), calling it [...] "a genius cross-pollination of seemingly divergent styles". The magazine also positioned the album at number eight on the list of the 50 best hip hop debut albums since Reasonable Doubt. Stylus Magazine ranked the album number 13 on their list of the top 50 albums of 2000–2005, praising Madlib's production, based on [...] "an endless supply of funk, soul, and jazz samples", and stating that the album was [...] "displaying the future of hip-hop".|$|E

2500|$|BBC's Steve Holden called Bennington the [...] "voice of a generation", {{saying his}} voice was arguably Linkin Park's {{greatest}} asset. Jonathan McAloon of The Daily Telegraph commented, [...] "Bennington’s death {{will have an impact}} on many millennials because his voice <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> their millennium". Writing for The Guardian, Ben Beaumont-Thomas noted [...] "Bennington’s decision to sing clearly and openly was, therefore, more radical than he is given credit for, and indeed more socially valuable". The journalist continued to discuss Bennington's impact, commenting, [...] "His cleanly articulated tales of emotional struggle gave millions the sense that someone understood them, and the huge sound of his band around him magnified that sense, moving listeners from the psychic space of their bedrooms into an arena of thousands of people who shared their pain". James Hingle echoed this sentiment, writing for Kerrang! he said that Bennington [...] "was one of the most honest vocalists out there when it came to his mental health". In the same topic, William Goodman from Billboard said Bennington and fellow musicians Chris Cornell and Scott Weiland [...] "helped define a generation of the hard rock sound, who were tied together artistically and personally".|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{arrived at}} the scene around 11:45p.m. After about ten minutes, a man walked up to Hollis' driver-side door and flashed a {{flashlight}} in his face, blinding him. Hollis, {{not sure if it}} was a prank or if he had been mistaken for someone else, told the man, [...] "Fellow, you've got me mixed up with someone else. You've got the wrong man." [...] The man had a pistol and told him something like, [...] "I don't want to kill you fellow, so do what I say", and ordered them {{to get out of the}} car. They both got out through the driver-side door. The man told Hollis to [...] "take off your [...] britches." [...] Larey pleaded with Hollis to please take them off, believing that if he did they would not be hurt, but, after Hollis removed his trousers, he was struck twice in the head with a heavy, blunt object.
