50|$|In 1870, {{the light}} at Wicklow Head was fitted with Wigham's patent {{intermittent}} flashing mechanism, <b>which</b> <b>timed</b> <b>the</b> gas supply by means of clockwork.

5|$|There was {{a period}} of renewed {{lobbying}} for a road crossing in the 1920s and 1930s, at <b>which</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> only vehicle crossing was a single passenger and vehicle ferry. Sir William Denny championed the expansion of that service in the 1930s, providing and operating on behalf of the London and North Eastern Railway two additional ferries that aimed to supplement the services of the adjacent railway bridge. Their success allowed for the addition of two more craft in the 1940s and 1950s, by <b>which</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> ferries were making 40,000 crossings annually, carrying 1.5 million passengers and 800,000 vehicles.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, {{an increase}} in wind shear caused the eye to disappear, and the convection decreased significantly. On December1, the IMD estimated Agni weakened to cyclonic storm status, around <b>which</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> center became exposed from the convection. The cyclone continued its steady weakening continued due to the wind shear, the presence of dry air, and cooler water temperatures, and by December2, the IMD downgraded Agni to depression status, which was its final warning on the system. As it approached the coast of Somalia, it turned westward due to {{the building of a}} ridge over Saudi Arabia. Despite unfavorable conditions, thunderstorms briefly reformed over the circulation, which allowed the storm to maintain its intensity. By late on December3, Agni weakened to below tropical storm status, and the JTWC issued its final warning while the storm was about 450km (275mi) south-southeast of Cape Guardafui—the easternmost point of the Horn of Africa. The circulation became difficult to locate by early on December4, by <b>which</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> system had little remaining convection. It turned southwestward and later to the south, moving ashore on eastern Somalia before dissipating on December5 near Ceel Huur over water.|$|E

5|$|After the {{collapse}} {{of the power of the}} Howards, the county of Suffolk was controlled by an oligarchy of Protestant gentry by the 17th century and did not play a prominent part in the English Civil War that occurred between 1642–6. Framlingham Castle escaped the slighting that occurred to many other English castles around this time. Hitcham's bequest had meanwhile become entangled in the law courts and work did not begin on the poorhouse until the late 1650s, by <b>which</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> internal buildings of castle were being broken up for the value of their stone; the chapel had been destroyed in this way by 1657.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{formed on}} November9 {{to the east}} of Diego Garcia, possibly the result of the MJO. A circulation was evident by November11, and the following day it developed into Tropical Disturbance 2 about 830km (515mi) southeast of Diego Garcia. Also on November12, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 02S. It moved to the southwest, but looped back to the east on November13, during <b>which</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> MFR upgraded it to tropical depression status. Later that day, the agency ceased issuing advisories, but the system reorganized on November14. On November17, it turned back to the southwest, but the MFR discontinued advisories on the next day.|$|E
5|$|An {{inventory}} {{taken in}} 1634 after Zouche's death listed the library as having 250 {{books and a}} collection of mathematical instruments, and revealed that the maids' chamber was of a very high standard.

5|$|Around 05:00UTC on November9, the cyclone made {{landfall}} at {{peak intensity}} in eastern India, near the state borders of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, {{and close to}} the city of Ichchapuram. Although the IMD officially estimated peak winds of 120km/h (75mph), winds could have been as high as 150km/h (95mph), based on the damage and estimates from the Dvorak technique. After moving ashore, the storm turned more to the north and rapidly weakened over land. By 12:00UTC on November9, the JTWC discontinued advisories. The storm weakened into a depression over the northern Bihar state early on November10. On the next day, the system degenerated into a remnant low, by <b>which</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> system had turned to the northeast and spread into Nepal. The circulation dissipated, although moisture and convection from the storm spread through Nepal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{in the second half of}} the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at <b>which</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> country would have another election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of the high degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, often seen as a single non-homogenous class.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d'Ayen {{was looking}} to marry off some of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed a good match for his 12-year-old daughter, Marie Adrienne Françoise, and the duc spoke to the boy's {{guardian}} (Lafayette's uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by the duc's wife, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing {{not to mention the}} marriage plans for two years, during <b>which</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> two spouses-to-be would meet {{from time to time in}} casual settings and get to know each other better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together from the time of their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.|$|E
