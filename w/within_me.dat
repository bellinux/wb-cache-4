The album, intended by the band to be a worship album split between covers and original songs, was recorded following the band's tour with Audio Adrenaline in promotion of their previous studio album Coming Up to Breathe (2006).

The band wrote so many songs at the studio that they decided not to include any cover songs; all of the songs on the album but were written or co-written by the band. The album was described as being a rock and worship album, being aimed directly at a Christian audience.|$|E

25|$|I set out alone, having neither fellow-traveller {{in whose}} {{companionship}} I might find cheer, nor caravan whose part I might join, but swayed by an overmastering impulse <b>within</b> <b>me</b> {{and a desire}} long-cherished in my bosom to visit these illustrious sanctuaries. So I braced my resolution to quit my dear ones, female and male, and forsook my home as birds forsake their nests. My parents being yet in the bonds of life, it weighed sorely upon me to part from them, and both they and I were afflicted with sorrow at this separation.|$|E

60|$|Yet had {{not all of}} sentience departed; for the {{consciousness}} and the sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic intuition. I appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence of one who leans over him, so, sweet Una, I still dully felt that you sat by my side. So, too, when the noon of the second day came, I was not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side, which confined <b>me</b> <b>within</b> the coffin, which deposited <b>me</b> <b>within</b> the hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered <b>me</b> <b>within</b> it, which heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.|$|R

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Academy Bax visited Dresden, where {{he saw the}} {{original}} production of Strauss's Salome, and first heard the music of Mahler, which he found [...] "eccentric, long-winded, muddle-headed, and yet always interesting". Among the influences on the young Bax was the Irish poet W. B. Yeats; Bax's brother Clifford introduced him to Yeats's poetry and to Ireland. Influenced by Yeats's The Wanderings of Oisin, Bax visited {{the west coast of}} Ireland in 1902, and found that [...] "in a moment the Celt <b>within</b> <b>me</b> stood revealed". His first composition to be performed â€“ at an Academy concert in 1902 â€“ was an Irish dialect song called [...] "The Grand Match".|$|E

30|$|There is a {{significant}} difference in the presence of CN within the two collections compared. CN was identified in the majority of vessels as the primary polymer in the Cypriot collection. However <b>within</b> the <b>ME</b> collection CN is less frequently used as the primary adhesive, and much more frequently used as an additional resin in PVAc formulations. As reported by Nel et al. [34] the presence of CN in the Cypriot collection is clustered as two identifiably different formulations correlating with two bulk accession periods. Whereas the ME collection has seven accession periods. Adhesive types are broadly spread both across and <b>within</b> the <b>ME</b> collection accession groups (TableÂ  1). These differences may be attributable to a variety of acquisition approaches. The ME collection acquisition process was significantly unstructured, resulting in a broader range of object provenance and pathways into the Universityâ€™s collection.|$|R

500|$|The band {{ultimately}} wrote so many songs {{while in}} the studio that they ditched the idea of including any cover material.

The final song to be recorded for the album, it resulted from Millard had contacting Chapman over the Internet. He sent Millard some few recordings of songs he had failed to complete while working on his own record. Upon getting to what would become [...] "You Reign", Millard was interested by the verse, and paired it with a chorus that he had previously written but could never write a verse for; the chorus Chapman had originally written for the song became its bridge.|$|E
500|$|Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms gave All That is <b>Within</b> <b>Me</b> 9 out of 10 stars, {{calling it}} [...] "the Texas group's best album for years, crammed {{as it is}} with well crafted songs of faith and worship and {{produced}} with considerable skill by Brown Bannister". Lauren Summerford of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, praising it as a strong effort but also saying that it is [...] "nothing out of the ordinary" [...] for the band. Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars, saying it [...] "demonstrates why artists shouldn't be rushed: the album simply doesn't live up to the better moments from MercyMe's previous recordings". Although he praised the band as being one of the best adult contemporary and pop rock bands, he described it as being a [...] "side-step" [...] and having an [...] "overall thrown-together feel".|$|E

How can this be explained?" [...] In May 1933, as he {{continued to}} deny Koussevitzky, Sibelius wrote in his diary that he was deeply immersed in composition: [...] "It is as if I had come home... I'm taking everything in another way, more deeply. A gypsy <b>within</b> <b>me.</b> Romantic." [...] Later that summer he informed a journalist that his new symphony was nearly complete: [...] "It will be the reckoning of my whole existence â€“ sixty-eight years. It will probably be my last. Eight symphonies and a hundred songs. It has to be enough." ...|$|E
