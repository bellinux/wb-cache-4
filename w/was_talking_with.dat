Two days later, when the Imperial army paraded for the archduke's inspection, Mélac believed that a relief army under Catinat was at hand and he made preparations to defend against an assault. When the French commander finally realized what was going on, the frustrated Mélac sent a message asking where Joseph's headquarters was located so he could bombard it. Joseph, whose headquarters was out of range anyway, replied that the Frenchman must do his duty. The archduke visited the siege lines and even aimed some of the cannon.

[...] The cockpit recording captured Dahl moaning and Jarrah telling him in English {{to sit down and}} to stop touching something (presumably the controls); Jason Dahl's wife, Sandy Dahl, listening to the cockpit {{voice recorder}}, determined that Jarrah [...] "was fussing at my husband...he was speaking in English, and he spoke Arabic anytime he <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> the other hijackers.

500|$|Following this, {{the band}} {{set out to}} record 18tracks and work began on {{recording}} Joel Ekman's drum tracks. However, Ekman {{was forced to leave}} the studio after four weeks because of his young son's diagnosis of a brainstem glioma. With the fate of the album in jeopardy, Stone Sour recruited Mayorga, ex-Soulfly, as a session drummer. Mayorga recorded drums for all but two tracks on the album, Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin performed on the track [...] "30/30-150" [...] and guitarist Root performed drums on the bonus track [...] "The Day I Let Go". In an interview with Revolver during the recording process, the vocalist Taylor talked about the differences between this album and their previous album, Stone Sour. He said that pressures from fans and the record label were much larger, also noting that he [...] "thrives on the pressure, because it gets [...] going". While promising, [...] "The album's gonna be miles above the first one," [...] Taylor explained that it is [...] "more melodic and darker". In late March 2006, drummer Joel Ekman officially left Stone Sour and the band <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> a few drummers who could replace him. On April 7, 2006, the recording sessions for Come What(ever) May concluded. A month later, Mayorga joined Stone Sour full-time [...]|$|E
500|$|The first {{stages of}} {{development}} began in late 2006 {{after the completion of}} Jump Ultimate Stars. Up to that point, developer Ganbarion had only ever worked on licensed titles, and the team wanted to do something original. When Nintendo asked whether they wished to work on an original intellectual property due to being impressed by their work, Ganbarion accepted and pitched them the idea. The initial concept was how something pure had been corrupted and needed to be purified once again, with the main theme being love. The concept of the heroine needing to eat meat did not come until much later, when producer Chikako Yamakura <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> another staff member about the then-prevalent fashion for ekiben, boxed lunches served on trains, and the idea came to her [...] "out of the blue". Only the basic elements of the story had been decided by then, and despite reservations by Nintendo's then-CEO Satoru Iwata, the project was greenlit as Iwata felt that they deserved the chance to work on a fresh project. The long development cycle was the result of continuous problems faced by the team which ran from the use of the Wii remote to mixed responses from testers on the mechanics surrounding Elena which necessitated some aspects surrounding the character to be scrapped and redone from scratch. This latter measure needed to be undertaken just a year before the game's release. Despite this, the final game came out relatively close to their initial vision.|$|E

500|$|Williams officially joined {{before the}} Nashville Now appearance, but the band {{still did not}} have a record deal at this point. They {{continued}} to record demos in Prout's garage with assistance from Monty Powell, who had previously hired Roe and Olander for recording jingles, but wanted to produce commercial music. Powell was a friend of audio engineer Mike Clute, who would later become one of the band's producers, and songwriters Tim DuBois and Van Stephenson. DuBois <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> record executive Clive Davis about creating a country music branch of Arista Records called Arista Nashville; Stephenson would later sign to the label in 1993 as a member of Blackhawk. Initially, DuBois was hesitant about signing the Tennessee River Boys, as he felt that there were too many popular bands in country music, and he was about to sign both Asleep at the Wheel and Exile. He expressed interest in signing Roe as a solo artist, but at Powell's insistence, he agreed to see the band open for George Jones at a May 1989 concert, and officially signed them to Arista Nashville in 1990. The band members also decided to choose a new name, as they thought that Tennessee River Boys sounded more suitable for a bluegrass or gospel group than a country one. Among the names they had chosen were Kilroy and T-Town Mavericks, the latter of which was rejected by Arista executives. Prout suggested Diamond Rio, after the truck manufacturing company Diamond Reo Trucks. The name had been previously rejected by another country band, Shenandoah, whose lead singer Marty Raybon (also a former member of Heartbreak Mountain) gave Prout permission to use the name even though Shenandoah [...] "conducted business" [...] under that name.|$|E
