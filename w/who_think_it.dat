5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} two interpretations of Chen's actions during the {{election}} in terms of independence politics. The first {{is that he is}} ideologically committed to advancing Taiwan independence and that his actions are intended to systematically remove the constraints which prevent this from occurring. Seen in this light, his actions are intended to provoke a crisis in which the PRC must either start a war or accept independence, with the expectation that the PRC would back down. Ironically, this interpretation of his actions is shared both among his most fervent supporters (<b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a good thing) and his most bitter opponents (who think that it is a bad thing). It is largely to counter this possibility that the PRC has issued statements that it will definitely go to war if certain red lines are crossed. However, they in reality carry little meaning, as Beijing has made such statements warning against electing former President Lee and Chen in the 1996 and 2000 elections, which both failed to materialize. Some people regard these statements now as reverse psychology, as Lee and Chen may help to weaken ROC and advance the unification process.|$|E

500|$|Many {{philosophers}} consider {{experience to}} be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively. [...] But if consciousness is subjective and not visible from the outside, why do {{the vast majority of}} people believe that other people are conscious, but rocks and trees are not? [...] This is called the problem of other minds. [...] It is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of philosophical zombies, that is, people <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness. Related issues have also been studied extensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois. and Colin Allen a professor at Indiana University regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids.|$|E

"When {{money is}} lent on a {{contract}} to receive not only the principal sum again, but also an increase by way of compensation for the use, the increase is called interest by those <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> lawful, and usury by those who do not." [...] (William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England).|$|E
2500|$|Some FEE-based {{analyses}} {{suggest that}} the famine {{was a result of}} policy failure or bungling. Others assert that prioritised distribution and the denial policies reflected the War Cabinet's callous willingness to [...] "supply the Army's needs and let the Indian people starve if necessary" [...] when weighing how to allocate wartime resources. In this view, economic policies were designed to serve externally oriented British military goals at the expense of internally oriented Indian interests, and so the UK government bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths. [...] The policies may have met their intended goals, but only at the cost of harrowing, large-scale dislocations in the domestic economy. Far from being accidental, this argument maintains, these dislocations were fully recognised beforehand as fatal for identifiable Indian groups whose economic activities did not directly, actively, or adequately advance military goals. The analysts split into two broad camps: those who think the government unwittingly caused or was unable to respond to the crisis, and those <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> willfully ignored the plight of starving Indians. The former see the problem as a series of avoidable war-time policy failures and [...] "panicky responses" [...] from a government that was spectacularly inept, overwhelmed and in disarray, the latter as a conscious miscarriage of justice by the [...] "ruling colonial elite" [...] who abandoned the poor of Bengal.|$|E

5000|$|Additionally, {{elementary}} school teachers have decided to challenge results from the Stanford study by showing children the importance of not being deceived by what is fake.

5000|$|... "Nancy Boy" [...] {{revolves}} around the themes of drugs, sex and bisexuality. In 1997, Molko reportedly said, [...] "Sonically, we tried to capture a kind of drug-induced sexual rush". The line [...] "Eyeholes in a paper bag/greatest lay I ever had" [...] is saying that the character in the song is ugly, but is trying to reach some sort of beauty, as Molko said [...] "I guess it’s saying you can be ugly and be an amazing lay; it doesn’t really matter." [...] The song also criticizes people <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> [...] "fashionable to be gay", meaning people <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> cool because there is other people who they know who are gay. Molko noted that [...] "In the song, I’m questioning people’s reasons for sleeping with people of the same sex.

As for me I respect neither women nor men for their gender, nor own any sex in a pen.
