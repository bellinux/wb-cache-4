Makedonsko Devojče {{turned out to be a}} commercial and critical success, becoming the best-selling album in Macedonia in the year of its release and receiving the award for Best World Music Album at the 2008 Sunčane Skale festival in Montenegro.

25|$|At her {{original}} audition, show's composer Andrew Lloyd Webber had asked <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be interested if he wrote anything he thought appropriate for her voice.

25|$|Four {{days before}} the election, the Social Democrats {{contacted}} Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf to inform her that she would probably receive {{a substantial number of}} votes. Widmer-Schlumpf reportedly did not state <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> accept or decline her possible election. At the same time, the Christian Democratic party chief, Christophe Darbellay, publicly indicated his opposition to Blocher and hinted that he would accept if elected in his stead. On the eve of the elections, the leaders of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Christian Democrats secretly agreed to support Widmer-Schlumpf, after a test ballot in the Christian Democratic parliamentary group indicated {{that a majority of the}} group did not support Blocher. During the night, the Greens withdrew Recordon's candidacy and the center-left party leaders sought out support among individual representatives of the Free Democrats (FDP). All the while, Widmer-Schlumpf's name was kept secret to prevent her party from exerting pressure on her and to prevent her from appearing as a candidate of the Left. Only immediately before the elections were most center-left members of parliament asked by their leadership to support Widmer-Schlumpf.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{went on to}} earn her Juris Doctor (J.D.) {{degree from}} Harvard Law School in 1988. By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her {{confidence}} had grown; [...] "This time around, {{there was no doubt}} in her mind that she had earned her place". Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said that she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law, of <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton, believing that she concluded she could be [...] "both brilliant and black." ...|$|E

Wie shot rounds of 73 and 80, missing the cut by nine strokes.|$|R

500|$|An issue arising in his {{election}} to Congress {{was whether the}} candidates would vote to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA); while Hayworth was considered more progressive on gay rights than most Republicans, she did not explicitly say <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> vote to repeal, stating her belief that the New York law allowing same-sex marriage made it a settled issue, for which Maloney criticized her. Following the Supreme Court's ruling which struck down provisions of DOMA, Maloney remarked {{at a press conference}} he was [...] "no longer seen as less-than in the eyes of my country," [...] having previously faced discrimination in the House, with his partner not eligible for benefits as most heterosexual members' partners would be.|$|E
500|$|According to Avalon Production, Makedonsko Devojče 2 was {{the best-selling}} album in Macedonia {{in the year}} of its release. The songs were well {{received}} by the concertgoers in Macedonia and Serbia and were among the audience's favorites later on. During an interview with the television channel N1, Gočeva revealed that all the songs had become evergreens in Macedonia. When asked about her future projects and <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> return to recording pop music as she did before the release of music inspired by Macedonian folklore as in Makedonsko Devojče 1 and Makedonsko Devojče 2 or she would continue {{in the same direction as}} those two albums, Gočeva said that [...] "there is no reason why I would not make one more project like that".|$|E
500|$|After {{two years}} of development, the team ran into {{limitations}} on the PlayStation hardware and faced a critical choice: either terminate the project altogether, alter their vision to fit {{the constraints of the}} hardware, or continue to explore more options. The team decided to remain true to Ueda's vision, and began to use the Emotion Engine of the PlayStation 2, taking advantage of the improved abilities of the platform. [...] Character animation was accomplished through key frame animation instead of the more common motion capture technique. [...] Ico is {{recognized as one of the}} first games to incorporate bloom lighting into video games, a feature that is common in later seventh generation console video games. The game took about four years to create. [...] Ueda purposely left the ending vague, not stating whether Yorda was alive, <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> travel with Ico, or if it was simply the protagonist's dream.|$|E

Mrs. Woodward had much doubted <b>whether</b> or no <b>she</b> <b>would</b> take Linda or Katie with her, but at last she {{resolved}} to go alone. Harry, <b>she</b> thought, <b>would</b> {{be more willing to}} speak freely to her, to open his heart to her, if there were nobody by but herself.|$|R

[...] She noted that Evanescence was still together as a band but that she found touring to be monotonous. She reiterated that she was continuing to write songs, although she did not yet know what purpose they would serve.|$|R
500|$|The storyline used {{elements}} of suspense, {{created by the}} use of [...] "shared secrets" [...] between Peggy and her daughter-in-law Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon), who invented elaborate cover stories to mask Peggy's trips to hospital from her sons and partner. Tension was deliberately built for viewing pleasure, posing the questions of whether Peggy's lump was benign or malignant and <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> die, but also in terms of Peggy's relationships, whether her children would discover the truth or if George would end their relationship. Henderson has suggested that: [...] "such devises [...] pathos to Peggy's treatment path. Audiences [...] that she [...] terrified and about to discover her biopsy results, but must watch as she is casually castigated by her son Grant for pestering his wife Tiffany to accompany her to 'the dentist'." [...] Hospital scenes were also played for narrative pace to build tension and drama.|$|E
500|$|Kapadia {{separated}} from Khanna in April 1982, {{leaving the house}} with her two daughters back to her parents. She returned to acting two years later. In a 1985 interview with India Today, she remarked, [...] "The life and happiness in our house {{came to an end}} the day I and Rajesh got married," [...] sharing her unhappy marital experience and calling their marriage [...] "a farce". Asked in Filmfare <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> want to marry again, Kapadia replied, [...] "I'm very happy and content. Why do I need to get married again? Once was more than enough." [...] In 2010, reporter Dinesh Raheja stated that [...] "the bitterness between Rajesh and Dimple washed away", noting that they are seen together at parties and that Dimple campaigned for Khanna's election and also worked in his film Jai Shiv Shankar. In a later interview she reflected back positively on her marriage, referring to it as her [...] "biggest high".|$|E
500|$|... "Lecture Circuit" [...] was {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis and written by Mindy Kaling, who also plays Kelly Kapoor in the show. The first episode included a cameo performance by Rashida Jones, a regular cast member during the third season, where she played Jim Halpert's love interest Karen Filippelli. [...] "Lecture Circuit" [...] aired just two months before Jones began her regular role as Ann Perkins in the NBC comedy series Parks and Recreation, which was created by Office producers Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. Dan Goor, a future writer for Parks and Recreation, made a cameo as Karen's husband in the photographs featured in the part one episode. Rob Huebel, a comedian {{best known for the}} MTV sketch comedy series Human Giant, guest starred as Holly's boyfriend, A.J. Amy Ryan, who played Holly Flax in previous episodes, did not appear in either [...] "Lecture Circuit" [...] episode, although the decision by Michael and Pam to visit Holly {{at the end of the}} first episode led to speculation about <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> appear in the second.|$|E
60|$|The sun sank, the {{darkness}} closed about her, and <b>she</b> wondered <b>whether</b> ever again <b>she</b> <b>would</b> see the dawn. Her brave heart quailed a little, and she gripped the dagger hilt beneath her splendid, borrowed robe, thinking to herself {{that perhaps it}} might be wisest to drive it into her own breast, and not wait until a balked madman did that office for her. Yet not so, for it is always time to die when one must.|$|R
5000|$|On <b>whether</b> or not <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have a [...] "big storyline", Davidson {{called it}} a [...] "multi-leveled and {{complicated}} story" [...] which would [...] "bring in lots of different characters".

The actress has confessed {{that she is a}} lot more like Kristen than Ashley Abbott, [...] "except for the evil part".|$|R
60|$|Mr. William Linville {{took a small}} house, furnished, {{like the}} cottage at Passy, and, also like that little villa, {{standing}} in its own garden. Here, with a cook and a maid, Iris set up her modest menage. To ask <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> was happy <b>would</b> be absurd. At no time since her marriage had she been happy; to live under the condition of perpetual concealment is not in itself likely to make a woman any the happier. Fortunately she {{had no time to}} experience the full bitterness of the plan proposed by her husband.|$|R
