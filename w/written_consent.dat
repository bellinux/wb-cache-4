25|$|David Kilgour and David Matas {{say that}} the Chinese government’s {{response}} to their investigation in 2006 contained “a good deal of invective, but no factual information which contradicts or undermines our conclusions or analysis.” In particular, the Chinese government response centered on the charge that Falun Gong is an “evil cult”; questioned the motives and independence of the researchers; and noted a captioning error where their report had mislabeled the location of two Chinese cities. The government’s response also stated that China prohibits the sale of human organs and requires <b>written</b> <b>consent</b> of the donor—claims which Kilgour and Matas say are belied by the evidence.|$|E
25|$|The debtor may {{not make}} a {{contract}} which purports to dispose of any property of his insolvent estate. Furthermore, he may not, without the <b>written</b> <b>consent</b> of the trustee, {{enter into a contract}} which adversely affects his estate or any contribution which he is obliged to make towards his estate. That contribution is what is claimable by the trustee in terms of section 23(5) from moneys earned by the insolvent {{in the course of his}} profession, occupation or employment. The contribution becomes due to the trustee only once the Master has expressed the opinion that the moneys in question are not necessary for the support of the insolvent and his dependents. It follows that, prior to the Master’s assessment of a contribution, the insolvent need not obtain the trustee’s consent to enter into the contract.|$|E
