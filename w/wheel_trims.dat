25|$|Also {{specified}} on {{the first}} GT Falcon was a Hurst shifter for the four-speed gearbox, deep-dish sports steering wheel, sports instrumentation, chrome full-cover <b>wheel</b> <b>trims,</b> and thick 'GT stripes' along the lower panels between front and rear wheels.|$|E
25|$|SLX: was {{the second}} tier variant fitted with the 1.8-litre engine in coupled to either a {{five-speed}} manual or three-speed automatic transmission. The SLX also featured full plastic <b>wheel</b> <b>trims,</b> {{as opposed to the}} steel centre hubcap fitted to the SL.|$|E
25|$|The final E-series model, the EL Falcon, {{was merely}} a {{facelift}} of the EF intended to keep sales strong until the sixth generation AU Falcon was launched. The most obvious change visually, was {{the return of the}} grille on the GLi and Futura spec levels. The new oval grille tied in with Ford's global lineup of the time. Cosmetic updates extended further with the bonnet, front bumper and headlamps also receiving a revised design. New grilles were now prominent on the luxury variants (Fairmont and Fairmont Ghia), and the quad-headlamps of the XR sport models gained minor changes. New <b>wheel</b> <b>trims</b> were featured on all trim levels, and station wagon variants gained white tinted indicator lenses, replacing the amber tint which had been common since the introduction of the EA.|$|E

50|$|As a {{farewell}} to the MR2, Toyota produced 1000 limited-production V-Edition cars for Japan and the UK. They are distinguished by different color wheels, titanium interior accents, minor body changes, a helical limited slip differential, and different steering <b>wheel</b> <b>trim.</b>|$|R
25|$|In Romania, it was {{initially}} available with four trim levels: Ambiance, Preference, Laureate and Ambition. The basic level Ambiance featured driver airbag, body-colored bumpers, <b>wheel</b> <b>trims</b> and central locking. The second level Preference added passenger airbag, power steering, electric front windows, radio, two rear seat head restraints and remote locking. The third level Laureate added front fog lights, air conditioning, trip computer, electric mirrors, three rear seat head restraints and a multi-adjustable driver seat. The top level Ambition also had ABS, electric rear windows, CD player and alloy wheels. The 1.6-litre gasoline engine was available {{only on the}} Preference level and above. In September 2005, the 1.5-litre diesel engine was introduced, initially not being available on the Ambition level. In January 2006, a new intermediate trim level called Laureate Plus was added, which {{in addition to the}} Laureate level featured ABS, electric rear windows and CD player. Also, the diesel engine became available for the Ambition level.|$|E
500|$|The 1995 VS Commodore {{served as}} a {{mechanical}} update of the VR, destined to maintain sales momentum {{before the arrival of}} an all-new VT model. The extent of exterior changes amounted to little more than a redesigned Holden logo and <b>wheel</b> <b>trims.</b> An overhauled Ecotec (Emissions and Consumption Optimisation through TEChnology) version of the Buick V6 engine coincided with changes to the engine in the United States. The Ecotec engine packed 13percent more power for a total of , cut fuel consumption by 5percent, increased the compression ratio from 9.0:1 to 9.4:1 and improved on the engine's previous rough characteristics. Holden mated the new engine with {{a modified version of the}} GM 4L60-E automatic transmission, improving throttle response and smoothing gear changes. The Series II update of June 1996 included elliptical side turn signals, interior tweaks and the introduction of a supercharged V6 engine for selected trim levels, and the introduction of a new Getrag manual transmission. The new supercharged engine slotted between the existing V6 and V8 engines in the lineup and was officially rated at , just [...] below the V8.|$|E
500|$|Further {{aerodynamic}} refinements {{were carried}} out in Exeter {{with the development of}} new body shells which produced further reductions in the vehicle's drag. However, it was felt that something was lacking in the design and a 23-year-old industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, was brought in to refine the shell's appearance. He had won a Sinclair-sponsored electric vehicle design competition at the Royal College of Art and was hired on his graduation to set up an in-house car design studio at Sinclair's Metalab in Cambridge, of which he became the first employee. It was not only Desbarats' first project but, as he later said, [...] "day one of my working life", when he turned up at Sinclair's premises. He was taken aback when he saw the C5 for the first time, as he had been expecting a [...] "proper" [...] electric car. He said later that he thought [...] "the concept looked futuristic but was short on practicality. There were no instruments, nowhere to put anything and no security features." [...] Desbarats told Sinclair that the design would have to be redone from scratch, [...] "asking what we were doing about visibility, rear view mirrors, range indications...". It was far too late for this, however; all the key design decisions had already been made. Desbarats told Sinclair that he would need four months to revisit the design and was given eight weeks instead. He created the styling that was used for the final production model of the C5, with <b>wheel</b> <b>trims</b> and a small luggage compartment being added subsequently. Desbarats was also responsible for the creation of the High-Vis Mast accessory, as he felt uncomfortable being so close to the ground with other drivers potentially not being able to see him. He later described his contribution as [...] "convert an ugly pointless device into a prettier, safer, and more usable pointless device".|$|E

5000|$|The Comet was {{available}} as 2- and 4-door sedans and in base (1971-1977), and [...] "muscle car" [...] Comet GT series (2-door sedan-only 1971-1975). The GT featured a blacked-out grille, dual body-side tape stripes, high-back bucket seats, <b>wheel</b> <b>trim</b> rings, dual racing mirrors, bright window frames, black instrument panel, deluxe door trim panels, and a simulated hood scoop.|$|R
5000|$|The {{convertible}} {{was generally}} more lavishly equipped than the sedan with dual rear ashtrays, twin map pockets, a visor vanity {{mirror on the}} passenger side, rear stone shields, and through 1969, <b>wheel</b> <b>trim</b> rings. Many of these items did not become available on other Beetles until {{the advent of the}} optional [...] "L" [...] (Luxus) Package of 1970.|$|R
2500|$|The XW also {{gained a}} GS ('Grand Sport') option, {{which could be}} optioned with the , [...] six-cylinder, or [...] Windsor V8 engines, but not the [...] Windsor V8 on Falcon 500, Futura, and Fairmont. It offered the same dash as the GT with sports instruments, sport <b>wheel</b> <b>trims,</b> and stripes. The GS lasted until the 1978 XC series I model, longer than the GT, which {{finished}} with the XB.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, several {{improvements}} {{were introduced}} to the range, such as a new button for the trunk-lid, a new knob for the gear lever, crystal rear lamps, as well as new designs for the <b>wheel</b> <b>trims</b> and the alloy wheels and three new paint colors. Also, the new top of the range level Prestige was introduced, which featured larger door mirrors, body-colored bumpers (entirely), side moldings and door handles, leather-trimmed gear lever and steering wheel, as well as other interior refinements. It was only available with a new 1.6-litre 16-valve gasoline engine, which developed [...]|$|E
2500|$|Toyota {{introduced}} a refreshed [...] "regular" [...] Camry XV40 design in January 2009 at the North American International Auto Show. Visual changes include an updated front fascia, including grille and bumper with larger air intakes, larger projector headlamps, redesigned tail lamp lenses incorporating LEDs on all models (previously hybrids only), and revised <b>wheel</b> <b>trims</b> among other design changes. The interior received revised trim, improved power window switches, and a revamped audio system. The audio system now supports satellite radio (in North America) and added USB connectivity, with the dashboard-mounted screen now integrating a backup camera for models fitted with satellite navigation.|$|E
50|$|A hubcap, rim, {{wheel cover}} or <b>wheel</b> <b>trim</b> is a {{decorative}} disk on an automobile wheel that covers {{at least a}} central portion of the wheel, called the hub. An automobile hubcap is used to cover the wheel hub and the wheel fasteners to reduce the accumulation of dirt and moisture. It also has the function of decorating the car.|$|R
5000|$|... 70 series sedan, {{wagon and}} panel van {{variants}} {{were introduced in}} October 1981 with a 1.3-litre engine. Facelifted models was offered from October 1983, with a 1.6-litre engine now available as an option. A special edition sedan called the [...] "Corolla Spirit" [...] arrived in early 1984; it received a boot spoiler, the 1.6-litre engine, chromed <b>wheel</b> <b>trim,</b> stripes, and some additional equipment.|$|R
50|$|Only 2499 Cutlass Calais coupes were {{equipped}} with the Hurst/Olds W-30 package, featuring unique aluminum <b>wheels</b> <b>trimmed</b> with gold paint, an exclusive console-mounted Hurst Dual Gate floor shifter, special gold over black or white two-tone paint and an otherwise unavailable Oldsmobile 350 V8 with a four-barrel carb and dual outlet exhausts. It is estimated that only 537 cars with the H/O package had T-Tops.|$|R
2500|$|A revised WK {{series was}} {{launched}} in May 2003, with a facelift. The curvaceous front and rear end styling of the WH was abandoned in favour of angular lines, starting with the headlights borrowed from the VY Calais. From the rear, the redesigned taillights were now separated by sheet metal, rather than being joined with a horizontal strip of plastic. The redesign had the after effect of lowering the WK's drag coefficient to 0.30. Other changes {{came in the form}} of revised bumpers, <b>wheel</b> <b>trims,</b> with the interior dashboard and centre console receiving a major overhaul. Powertrains carried over from the previous model, but the Generation III V8 engine was now rated at [...] for the Statesman and [...] for the Caprice. Other engineering changes were made to the structural integrity of the car. The reinforced front flooring and sills gives the upshot of a 70percent reduction in lower limb injuries in offset frontal crash tests at 60km/h (30mph).|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1982, Rover {{unveiled}} the Cowley-built, facelifted {{line to the}} public. These cars benefited mostly from small cosmetic changes on the exterior {{as well as a}} quite extensively redesigned interior. Car spotters can distinguish the two series by the headlights, which were chrome-rimmed and flush fitting on the later, recessed on the earlier series, the deeper rear window, now fitted with a rear wash wipe, and the new plastic wrap around bumpers which replaced the three-piece rubber and stainless steel ones. Other details, which are not as easy to assign include the full-width rear badge strip under the tail lights, engine size badges on front wings, and a range of new <b>wheel</b> <b>trims</b> and alloy wheels. [...] The automatic gearbox was now a GM180 model, still offering three speeds but better ratios. [...] The electric window switch pack moved from the centre console to the driver's door (and is well remembered for lacking edge finishing trim around the recesses), and a fully automatic choke appeared – eliminating the manual choke lever which had a tendency to break.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{media event}} on February 28, 2011, Holden {{unveiled}} the Australian assembled Cruze sedan in facelifted [...] "Series II" [...] guise, {{otherwise known as}} the JH series. Prime Minister Julia Gillard attended the February launch to drive the first example off Holden's production line before full-scale production commenced in March. Holden has confirmed an initial local content level of between 40 and 50percent if assessed by retail value, with an aim of increasing Cruze localization over time. Series II styling revisions to the grille, lower air intake, and bumper have softened the front-end to bear a closer resemblance to Holden's larger VE II Commodore. Further differentiation from the original has been achieved via the fitment of amber front indicator lights, jewelled bezel headlamps, remodelled <b>wheel</b> <b>trims,</b> and through adjustments to the lower portion of the rear bumper. Carrying over largely unchanged is the 1.8-liter petrol inline-four, tweaked to yield slight enhancements in drivability. When automatic transmission is specified, the 1.8-liter is now teamed with GM's six-speed 6T30 unit, lighter and more compact than the previous 6T40. Diesel remains optional for [...] "CD" [...] and [...] "CDX" [...] specifications over the standard 1.8-liter petrol. Alterations to the 2.0-liter turbodiesel have resulted in an additional [...] and [...] and a slight reduction in fuel consumption for the manual variant, now a six-speed unit. However, the headline change is {{the release of the}} turbocharged 1.4-liter engine, dubbed iTi by Holden for intelligent turbo induction. The inclusion of the 1.4 also brings an upgrade to electric (as opposed to hydraulic) power steering and affixes a Watt's linkage to the torsion beam rear suspension. Linked with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions, the 1.4 is fitted as standard to the new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] sports-oriented trims, but is available at extra cost on the base [...] "CD". The new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] models have their respective badges embossed onto the grille insert, are fitted with their own front bumper design, and feature side skirts, chrome exterior door handles, a rear lip spoiler, and five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels. Over the [...] "CD", [...] "SRi" [...] gains a leather-covered steering wheel rim and shift lever, with the [...] "SRi-V" [...] extending this upholstering to the seating. A heat function for the front seats, keyless entry with push-button engine start, reversing sensors, and seven-inch LCD multimedia unit are also part of the [...] "SRi-V" [...] equipment list. This multimedia system integrates satellite navigation, the CD and DVD players, and a 10GB internal hard disk drive. In mid-November 2011, Holden released the MY12 update to the Series II Cruze. This update coincided with the release of the hatchback body variant and saw Bluetooth telephone connectivity standard across the range.|$|E
50|$|Plastic has now largely {{replaced}} steel as {{the primary}} material for manufacturing hubcaps and trims, and where steel wheels are still used, the wheels are now generally painted black so the wheel is less visible through cutouts in the <b>wheel</b> <b>trim.</b> On modern automobiles, full-wheel hubcaps are most commonly seen on budget models and base trim levels, while upscale and performance-oriented models use alloy wheels. Modern aluminum alloy wheels generally use small removable center caps, similar in size to the earliest hubcaps.|$|R
5000|$|The last Calibra Turbos were {{produced}} {{in the beginning of}} 1997, before a final run of Calibra Turbo Limited Editions were rolled out. These were all finished in jet black paintwork with Irmscher spoiler, BBS RX 16" [...] alloys and colour-coded body fittings. This final incarnation was also lowered by 35mm on Irmscher springs and dampers. The interior was heated cream leather, with a steering <b>wheel</b> <b>trimmed</b> in grey leather and a plaque showing the build number mounted on the centre console.|$|R

50|$|The New Zealand Avenger {{initially}} {{was similar to}} the British line but there was just one engine and trim level to start: the 'Super' (two headlights, vinyl trim, 1.5 L single carburettor engine, manual 4-speed gearbox.). In 1971 Todd's added a unique-to-NZ, sporty, 1.5-litre twin-carburettor 'TC' model with all-black interior trim, dashtop rev counter, side striping, high-back 'tombstone' front seats, special bright paint colours and new <b>wheel</b> <b>trims,</b> among other detail changes.
