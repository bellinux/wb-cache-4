25|$|Examples of {{surgical}} procedures for cancer include mastectomy for breast cancer, prostatectomy for prostate cancer, and lung cancer surgery for non-small cell lung cancer. The {{goal of the}} surgery can be either the removal of only the tumor, or the entire organ. A single cancer cell is invisible {{to the naked eye}} but can regrow into a new tumor, a process called recurrence. For this reason, the pathologist <b>will</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> surgical specimen to determine if a margin of healthy tissue is present, thus decreasing the chance that microscopic cancer cells are left in the patient.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic {{programming}} algorithms {{are often}} used for optimization. A dynamic programming algorithm <b>will</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> previously solved subproblems and will combine their solutions to give the best solution for the given problem. In comparison, a greedy algorithm treats the solution as some sequence of steps and picks the locally optimal choice at each step. Using a greedy algorithm does not guarantee an optimal solution, because picking locally optimal choices {{may result in a}} bad global solution, but it is often faster to calculate. Some greedy algorithms (such as Kruskal's or Prim's for minimum spanning trees) are however proven to lead to the optimal solution.|$|E

25|$|If {{heart failure}} ensues after a {{myocardial}} infarction due to scarring and aneurysm formation, reconstructive surgery {{may be an}} option. These aneurysms bulge with every contraction, making it inefficient. Cooley and coworkers reported the first surgical treatment of a left ventricular aneurysm in 1958. They used a linear closure after their excision. In the 1980s, Vincent Dor developed a method using a circular patch stitched {{to the inside of}} the ventricle (the endoventricular circular patch plasty or Dor procedure) to close the defect after excision. Dor's approach has been modified by others and is today the preferred method for surgical treatment of incorrectly contracting (dyskinetic) left ventricle tissue, although a linear closure technique combined with septoplasty might be equally effective. The multicenter RESTORE trial of 1198 participants demonstrated an increase in ejection fraction from about 30% to 40% with a concomitant shift in NYHA classes, with an early mortality of 5% and a 5-year survival of 70%. It remains unknown if surgery is superior to optimal medical therapy. The STICH trial (Surgical Treatment for IschemiC Heart Failure) <b>will</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> role of medical treatment, coronary artery bypass surgery and left ventricle remodeling surgery in heart failure patients. Results are expected to be published in 2009 and 2011.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2013, the Islamic Da'wah Centre of South Australia {{questioned}} the [...] "reliability, independence and veracity" [...] of the Middle East Media Research Institute after it posted what the centre called a [...] "sensational de-contextualised cut-and-paste video clip... {{put together in}} a suggestive manner" [...] of a sermon by the Sheikh Sharif Hussein on an American website. According to the two-minute video, which was a heavily condensed version of the Sheikh's 36-minute speech delivered in Adelaide on 22 March, Hussein called Australian and American soldiers [...] "crusader pigs" [...] and stated [...] "O Allah, count the Buddhists and the Hindus one by one. O Allah, count them and kill them to the very last one." [...] According to MEMRI's translation, he also described US President Barack Obama as an [...] "enemy of Allah, you who kiss the shoes and feet of the Jews" [...] and predicted that [...] "The day will come when you are trampled upon by the pure feet of the Muslims." [...] MEMRI's rendition moved leading Liberal senator Cory Bernardi to write to the Police Commissioner charging that under Australia's anti-terrorism laws, the video clip was [...] "hate speech", and requesting that action be taken against Hussein. [...] The South Australian Islamic Society and the Australian Buddhist Councils Federation also condemned Hussein's speech. Widespread calls from the public for the deportation of Hussein and his family followed news reports of the video. [...] A police spokeswoman stated [...] "Police <b>will</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> entire content of the sermon to gain the full context and determine whether any crime has been committed." [...] Hussein himself declined any comment on {{the contents of the}} video. However, the Da'wah Centre charged that by omitting the context of Hussein's statements, MEMRI had distorted the actual intent of the speech. While admitting that the Sheikh was emotional and used strong words, the Centre stated that the speech was delivered in relation to rape cases in Iraq, the birth defects due to use of depleted uranium and the Burmese Buddhist massacre. This, the Centre claimed, was omitted from the edited MEMRI video.|$|E

This thesis <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> interaction between the creation and use of memory and the conceptualisation of place within the Northern Irish conflict of the late 20 th century. This project <b>will</b> <b>examine</b> how place and memory interact in order to create violent conflict. First, it <b>will</b> <b>examine</b> how <b>the</b> construction of religious communities that acted in conflict with each other used lived spaces, through the establishment and de-establishment of "no go areas", checkpoints and development of security provisions. Second, it <b>will</b> <b>examine</b> how <b>the</b> concept of space is destabilised through the reconfiguration of typical structures of order, such as within prisons, or through the conscious self-destruction of lived environments. Third, it <b>will</b> <b>examine</b> how <b>the</b> memories of the conflict are utilised within the tourist sector at present, as sites of violence and trauma have been reconstructed in order to provide economic and social benefits for both local communities and international tourists.
