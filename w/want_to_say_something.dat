Key is probably best understood as {{the tone of the}} dialogue which can change numerous times during an interaction. Signaling a change in key is one way that framing often takes place, “special brackets will have to be introduced should he <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> in a relatively serious way: [...] "Kidding aside," [...] "Now, I'm really serious about this," [...] and other such tags become necessary as a means of momentarily down keying the flow of words.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Of {{painting}} portraits, Van Gogh wrote: [...] "in {{a picture}} I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> comforting as music is comforting.

2500|$|Charlie Rose interviewed Octavia Butler in 2000 {{soon after}} the award of a MacArthur Fellowship. The {{highlights}} are probing questions that arise out of Butler's personal life narrative and her interest in becoming not only a writer, but a writer of science fiction. Rose asked, [...] "What then is central to {{what you want to}} say about race?" [...] Butler's response was, [...] "Do I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> central about race? Aside from, 'Hey we're here!'?" [...] This points to an essential claim for Butler that the world of science fiction is a world of possibilities, and although race is an innate element, it is embedded in the narrative, not forced upon it.|$|E

I'm sure from his eye he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Kelmscott." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Wait," [...] she said. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> Elam, {{if you do}} this insane thing, I won't marry you. I {{refuse to}} marry you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you." [...] Nat <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> more, but {{his voice}} {{suddenly}} broke and he turned away to hide his emotion, and then walked away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't think that. He was riled up, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> extra mean. And it was mean--as mean as dirt!" [...] added Andy.|$|R
60|$|I went to {{the window}} because, undoubtedly, {{it would be easier to}} address her {{severely}} from behind, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> that would sting her.|$|R

60|$|Perhaps, {{but it is}} an open question, Steve is the one who is most {{surprised}} to hear this. He seems to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> on the subject, but a look of entreaty from Alice silences him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'd say the truth, Mr Daly--divil a less--and I'd {{do as much}} as that now; but I thought Mr Lynch was <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> {{about the}} property?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "John," [...] said Jess, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to you. When {{people are}} delirious, or when {{delirium}} is coming on, they sometimes {{say things that}} they are not responsible for, and which had better be forgotten." ...|$|E

6000|$|... ‘My dear Eddy,’ said Rosa, {{when they}} had turned out of the High Street, and had got among the quiet walks in the {{neighbourhood}} of the Cathedral and the river: ‘I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> very serious to you.

60|$|The {{captain said}} that he did, and stood silent awhile, with {{the air of a}} man who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> but is half afraid to. At last, with a desperate {{appearance}} of resolution, he bent down to the old man’s ear.|$|R
60|$|The squire was livid. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>{{something}}</b> awful, {{something that}} would crush the fearless lad before him--but the words would not come. He caught up his silk hat and waved it fiercely {{in the face of}} Ralph and his mother.|$|R
