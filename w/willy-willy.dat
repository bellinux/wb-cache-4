For example, on 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in Duhamel, Alberta, Canada, and the Department of National Defence sent two investigators, who concluded that it was artificially made but couldn't make definite conclusions on who made them or how. The most famous case is the 1966 Tully [...] "saucer nest", when a farmer said he witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise 30 or [...] up from a swamp and then fly away. When he went to investigate the location where he thought the saucer had landed, he found a nearly circular area 32 feet long by 25 feet wide where the grass was flattened in clockwise curves to water level within the circle, and the reeds had been uprooted from the mud. The local police officer, the Royal Australian Air Force, and the University of Queensland concluded that it was most probably caused by natural causes, like a down draught, a <b>willy-willy</b> (dust devil), or a waterspout. In 1973, G.J. Odgers, Director of Public Relations, Department of Defence (Air Office), wrote to a journalist that the [...] "saucer" [...] was probably debris lifted by the causing <b>willy-willy.</b> Hoaxers Bower and Chorley said they were inspired by this case to start making the modern crop circles that appear today.|$|E

In Aboriginal myths, willy-willies represent spirit forms, parents may warn their children that if they misbehave, a spirit will emerge from the spinning vortex of dirt and chastise them. There {{is a story of}} the origin of the brolga in which a bad spirit descends from the sky and captures the young being and abducts her by taking the form of a <b>willy-willy.</b>|$|E
