The opening lines of the song: [...] "And as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the streets of Arklow, oh the colours of the day warm, and our heads were filled with poetry, in the morning coming onto dawn" [...] were said to [...] "contain the thematic seeds of the whole album: nature, poetry, god, innocence re-found and love lost" [...] by PopMatters critic John Kennedy.|$|E

60|$|From {{the time}} when we left St. Ives, <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the last part of our journey much faster than <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the first; faster, perhaps, than the reader may have {{perceived}} from these pages. When we stopped at the town of St. Columb Major, to visit the neighbouring vale of Mawgan, we had already advanced half way up the northern coast of Cornwall. Throughout this part of the county the towns lay wide asunder; and, as pedestrian tourists, we were obliged to lengthen our walks and hasten our pace accordingly.|$|E

60|$|Some one is with me, but I cannot see him, and <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> the forest, pushing our way {{among the}} tangled vines that cling about our feet, and {{every now and}} then, between the giant tree-trunks, we catch glimpses of the noisy street.|$|R

60|$|We {{all three}} strode {{down the street}} in silence, Rupert feverish, myself dazed, Basil, to all appearance, merely dull. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> grey street after grey street, turning corners, {{traversing}} squares, scarcely meeting anyone, except occasional drunken knots of two or three.|$|E

6000|$|In {{a moment}} {{we were in a}} French village. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> a great factory of some sort, where men and women and little {{children}} were toiling in heat and dirt and a fog of dust; and they were clothed in rags, and drooped at their work, for they were worn and half starved, and weak and drowsy.

60|$|You may {{be certain}} we kept our ears and {{eyes wide open}} as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the village toward the Pigeon Quarter, and I was greatly {{disappointed}} because our way did not lead us past where the horses of Simcoe's Rangers were stabled, although certain it is, it would have given me greatest pain to have seen Silver Heels roughly used.|$|E

60|$|I am {{sure the}} old lady was right when {{she said it was}} the most {{beautiful}} part of England. The first day we was here we carried an umbrella as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> all this verdant loveliness, but yesterday morning we went to the village and bought a couple of thin mackintoshes, which will save us a lot of trouble opening and shutting umbrellas.|$|E
60|$|We {{then took}} a {{hackney-coach}} and drove away to the neighbourhood of Leicester Square. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> some narrow courts, for which Mr. George apologized, and soon came to the shooting gallery, the door of which was closed. As he pulled a bell-handle which hung by a chain to the door-post, a very respectable old gentleman with grey hair, wearing spectacles, and {{dressed in a black}} spencer and gaiters and a broad-brimmed hat, and carrying a large gold-beaded cane, addressed him.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> {{the palm}} and orange grove {{to where the}} {{building}} stood finely placed upon a mound. It was well-constructed {{of a kind of}} coral rock, and a glance showed us that it had been gutted by fire; the discoloured walls told their own tale. The interior was now full of shrubs and creepers, and an ugly, yellowish snake glided from what had been the stone altar. Without, the graveyard was enclosed by a broken wall, only we could see no trace of graves. Near the gateway, however, was a rough mound.|$|E

We {{were told that the}} old gentleman was in his library, and together we entered the room. Mr. Havelot was sitting by a table on which were lying several open volumes of an encyclopedia. When he turned and saw us, he closed his book, pushed back his chair and took off his spectacles. [...] "Upon my word, sir," [...] he cried; [...] "and so {{the first thing you do}} after they pull you out of the earth is to come here and break my commands." ...|$|E
60|$|Across {{the empty}} cornfield the {{partridges}} were running. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> the September haze slowly, {{because he was}} feeble on his legs. As he became tired he ceased to talk. We leaned for some time on a gate, in the brief glow of the transient afternoon, and he was stupid again. He did not notice the brown haste of the partridges, {{he did not care}} to share with me the handful of ripe blackberries, and when I pulled the bryony ropes off the hedges, and held the great knots of red and green berries in my hand, he glanced at them without interest or appreciation.|$|E
60|$|With {{one of his}} benignant smiles {{the captain}} resumed his progress. In a few minutes I heard the clink of hammers, and, soon after, came to a {{singular}} cavern. It {{was a place where}} the lode had been very wide and rich. Years before it had been all cut away from level to level, leaving a void space so high and deep that the rays of our candles were lost in obscurity. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> it in mid-air, as it were, supported on cross beams with planks laid thereon. Beyond this we came to a spot where a number of miners were at work in various places and positions.|$|E

It is a subtle tribute to Stockholm, and has in recent years been voted the most popular song about the Swedish capital (in a poll by Radio Stockholm).

We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) for quality assessment and to explore the relationship between samples, perform differential gene expression analysis, and visually explore the results.
