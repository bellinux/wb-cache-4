5|$|The Drapier's fourth letter, To the Whole People of Ireland, A <b>Word</b> <b>or</b> <b>Two</b> to the People of Ireland, A Short Defense of the People of Ireland, {{was written}} on 13 October 1724 and was either {{published}} on 21 October 1724 or on 22 October 1724, the day Lord Carteret arrived in Dublin. Throughout the letter, the Drapier pretends that Carteret's transfer to Ireland to enforce Wood's patent was a rumour produced by Wood's allies, although Swift had knowledge to the contrary.|$|E

He returned to the stage at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in August 2008 in a critically acclaimed performance as Julius Caesar in George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra directed by Tony winner Des McAnuff; this production was videotaped and shown in high-definition in Canadian cinemas on January 31, 2009 (with an encore presentation on February 23, 2009) and broadcast on April 4, 2009 on Bravo! in Canada. Plummer returned to the Stratford Festival {{in the summer of}} 2010 in The Tempest as the lead character, Prospero (also videotaped and shown in high-def in cinemas), and again in the summer of 2012 in the one-man show, A <b>Word</b> <b>or</b> <b>Two,</b> an autobiographical exploration of his love of literature. In 2014, Plummer presented A <b>Word</b> <b>or</b> <b>Two</b> again, at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles.|$|E

5000|$|Tumbuka has a tonal accent {{but in a}} {{very limited}} way, in that every word, spoken in isolation, has the same falling tone on the {{penultimate}} syllable (which also coincides with stress). It is therefore not possible in Tumbuka to contrast <b>two</b> different <b>words</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> different tenses tonally, {{as it is in}} Chichewa and other Bantu languages. However, this penultimate falling tone occurs not on every word, but only on the last word of a phonological phrase; e.g. in the following sentence, only the second word has a tone, the first being toneless: ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1884, {{his parents}} {{returned}} to America, but 20-year-old Stieglitz remained in Germany and collected books on photography and photographers in Europe and the U.S. Through his self-study, he saw photography {{as an art}} form. In 1887, he wrote his very first article, [...] "A <b>Word</b> <b>or</b> <b>Two</b> about Amateur Photography in Germany", for the new magazine The Amateur Photographer. He then wrote articles on the technical and aesthetic aspects of photography for magazines in England and Germany.|$|E

50|$|The {{phenomenon}} of initial assimilation in the Fuqing dialect occurs in polysyllabic lexemes (i.e. lexical items <b>or</b> <b>words</b> of <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more syllables or Chinese characters) and semantic groups. Usually, within the lexico-semantic groups, all syllables {{apart from the}} first undergo initial assimilation. But if the initial of the following syllable is a nasal or l , then no initial assimilation occurs.|$|R

2500|$|The song's message {{recalls that}} of Dylan's September 1965 single [...] "Positively 4th Street", as Harrison {{appears to be}} ending a relationship, {{possibly}} with a lover. The lyrics adopt an accusatory stance from the opening line: [...] "I've got a <b>word</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> {{to say about the}} things that you do." [...] Author Ian Inglis describes the song as [...] "a withering attack" [...] in which [...] "Harrison's blunt 'I left you far behind' and Dylan's curt 'It's not my problem' [...] could be spoken by the same voice." [...] Harrison also incorporates Dylan-esque surrealism in his reference to [...] "opaque" [...] minds and in the line [...] "the good things that we can have if we close our eyes".|$|E
2500|$|One vocal {{critic of}} the Douro Wine Company was the British {{winemaker}} Joseph James Forrester. Despite being British, Forrester was well integrated into the Portuguese community and even received the title [...] "Baron" [...] {{for his work in}} defending the Portuguese wine growers and creating the first extensive maps of the Douro river and its wine region. In his 1844 pamphlet [...] "A <b>Word</b> <b>or</b> <b>Two</b> about Port Wine" [...] he criticized the Douro Wine Company for its control over the Port wine industry and its encouragement of producers to add substantial amounts of brandy to the wine. In Forrester's view, the best wines of the Douro were [...] "natural"-meaning without fortification or, if used, in very small amounts. With its monopolistic control over the brandy used in fortification, it was in the Douro Wine Company's interest to encourage extensive fortification.|$|E
2500|$|New York Times {{art critic}} John Russell wrote…Fekner {{is an artist}} who works not only in New York but with New York. The city in its more disinherited aspects is the raw {{material}} with {{which he has been}} working ever since he got a studio space in P.S. 1 in Long Island City in 1976 and learned to regard the huge dilapidated building as [...] "an elderly person who has acutely perceived his experience of life." [...] He went on to work outdoors in Queens and in the Bronx in ways that gave point and urgency to places long sunk in despair. With a <b>word</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> (Decay, for instance, or Broken Promises), he brought an element of street theater into disaster areas. With a single stenciled phrase (Wheels Over Indian Trails, for instance) he mingled present with past {{on the side of the}} Pulaski Bridge near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. What in other hands might have been vandalism had a salutary effect. People in desolate parts of the city saw more, felt more, thought more and came out of their apathy.|$|E

40|$|Semantic {{relatedness}} between {{words is}} important to many NLP tasks, and numerous measures exist which {{use a variety of}} resources. Thus far, such work is confined to measuring similarity between <b>two</b> <b>words</b> (<b>or</b> <b>two</b> texts), and only a handful utilize the web as a corpus. This paper introduces a distributional similarity measure which uses internet search counts and also extends to calculating the similarity within word-groups. The evaluation results are encouraging: for word-pairs, the correlations with human judgments are comparable with state-ofthe-art web-search page-count heuristics. When used to measure similarities within sets of 10 words, the results correlate highly (up to 0. 8) with those expected. Relatively little comparison has been made between the results of different search-engines. Here, we compare experimental results from Google, Windows Live Search and Yahoo and fin...|$|R

5000|$|In Slavic languages, iotified vowels are {{preceded by}} a palatal approximant [...] before a vowel, at the {{beginning}} of a <b>word,</b> <b>or</b> between <b>two</b> vowels in the middle of a word, creating a diphthongoid, a partial diphthong. In the Greek alphabet, the consonant is represented by iota (ι). For example, the English apple is cognate to Russian яблоко (jabloko): both come from Proto-Indo-European stem *ābol-. As a result of the phenomenon, no native Slavic root starts with an [...] or an [...] but only with a [...] and although other vowels are possible.|$|R
