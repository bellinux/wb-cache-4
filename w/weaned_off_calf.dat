40|$|Background. Intestinal {{failure is}} {{associated}} frequently with liver injury, which persists after <b>weaning</b> <b>off</b> parenteral nutrition. We compared features of liver remodeling in intestinal failure {{during and after}} <b>weaning</b> <b>off</b> parenteral nutrition. Methods. Liver biopsies and serum samples were obtained from 25 intestinal failure patients at a median age of 9. 7 years (interquartile range: 4. 6 - 18) and from age-matched control patients. Seven patients had been receiving parenteral nutrition for 53 months (22 - 160), and 18 patients had been <b>weaned</b> <b>off</b> parenteral nutrition 6. 3 years (2. 4 - 17) earlier, after having received parenteral nutrition for 10 months (3. 3 - 34). Expression of alpha smooth muscle actin, collagen 1, proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was measured. Results. Significant increases in immunohistochemical expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen 1 were observed predominantly in portal areas and were similar to increases seen in patients currently receiving parenteral nutrition and in patients <b>weaned</b> <b>off</b> parenteral nutrition. Gene and protein expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen were interrelated. Gene expression of ACTA 2, encoding alpha-smooth muscle actin, was increased only in patients who were receiving parenteral nutrition currently. Comparable upregulation of interleukin- 1 (alpha and beta), epidermal growth factor, integrin-beta 6, and MMP 9 gene expression was observed in both patient groups, irrespective of whether they were receiving parenteral nutrition currently. Liver expression and serum levels of TIMP 1 and MMP 7 were increased only in the patients on parenteral nutrition currently but were not increased after <b>weaning</b> <b>off</b> parenteral nutrition. Conclusion. Intestinal failure is characterized by abnormal activation of hepatic myofibroblast and accumulation of collagen both during and after <b>weaning</b> <b>off</b> parenteral nutrition. Persistent transcriptional upregulation of proinflammatory and fibrogenic cytokines after <b>weaning</b> <b>off</b> parenteral nutrition suggests that factors other than parenteral nutrition may contribute to intestinal failure associated liver disease...|$|R

50|$|Weaning in cattle {{can be done}} by many methods. Dairy calves {{are usually}} <b>weaned</b> <b>off</b> their mother at birth. Beef calves are not usually <b>weaned</b> <b>off</b> their dams until the calves are between 8 and 10 months of age. Before a <b>calf</b> is {{completely}} <b>weaned</b> <b>off</b> of milk, for both dairy and beef cattle, the calf must have developed a fully functioning rumen. For beef cattle, there are many methods of weaning that are used. The use of these methods depends on farm management style, feed availability, condition and age of cow (dam), type of production and whether or not the calves are heifers. Results vary between farms, and methods are still being researched as studies have shown contradicting results on stress levels of calves from different methods of weaning.|$|R

500|$|Forage {{conversion}} to milk with Shetland ewes is excellent, {{second only to}} Lleyn ewes in the UK. Because of the Shetland ewe's forage conversion efficiency, lamb growth is fast.

A heavier Shetland ewe at 80 lbs (36 kg) can wean 60 lb (27 kg) purebred twins. What makes the Shetland ewe an optimal maternal base for grassfed lamb production is her prowess in producing hybrid market lambs: take the same ewe and breed her to, for example, a Leicester, Texel, Charollais or Berrichon ram, and keep her on the same pasture management system.

After adjustment for propensity scores for dialysis weaning, Cox proportional hazards models showed successful weaning from dialysis (adjusted hazard ratio 0. 06; 95 % confidence interval 0. 01 to 0. 35), along with a history of hypertension and serum albumin, were independent protectors for early death. Conversely, a history of stroke, peripheral arterial disease and cancer predicted the occurrence of early mortality.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAcute {{retention}} of urine (AROU) is commonly occurred {{in patients with}} geriatric hip fractures after surgeries. It is common that the catheters cannot be <b>weaned</b> <b>off</b> after insertion. ObjectivesWe compared an approach using unified Trial Without Catheter (TWOC) protocol with non-unified management plans in patients with {{retention of}} urine after hip fracture surgery, to compare these approaches in terms of (1) rate of successful catheter removal, (2) duration required for successful catheter removal, (3) number of episodes of urinary tract infection, and (4) length of hospital stay. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of 250 patients who failed to <b>wean</b> <b>off</b> a urinary catheter. 140 out of 1349 patients between December 2012 and September 2014 formed the intervention group (treated with unified TWOC protocol), and 110 out of 1193 patients between July 2006 and December 2008 were the control group (treated with different AROU management approaches). The efficiency and effectiveness of the urological management in both groups were compared. ResultsAs expected, the rate of successful TWOC was higher in intervention group (before discharge, 68. 6 % versus 38. 2 %; after discharge, 20. 0 % versus 18. 2 %, overall, 88. 6 % versus 56. 4 %). Despite trial of <b>weaning</b> <b>off</b> urinary catheters, 16 patients in intervention group and 8 patients in control group failed with permanent catheter required. Forty patients in control group were discharged with permanently catheters without a trial of TWOC. ConclusionThe TWOC program provides structured and standardized urological management for patients suffered from AROU after geriatric hip fracture surgeries. To reiterate, indwelling urethral catheters must not be placed permanently without carrying out urological assessment in patients with geriatric hip fractures...|$|R
