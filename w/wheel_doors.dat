5|$|On 12 May 1962, a PBY Catalina {{flying boat}} (registration CF-IHA) crashed during landing at Nuuk Airport. The {{accident}} {{was caused by}} a mechanical malfunction in the nose <b>wheel</b> <b>doors</b> preventing them from closing during landing on water, resulting in the aircraft sinking. The accident killed 15 of the 21 people on board.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1944, {{the first}} P-51A-1-NA, 43-6003. was fitted and tested with a {{lightweight}} retractable ski kit replacing the wheels. This conversion {{was made in}} response to a perceived requirement for aircraft that would operate away from prepared airstrips. The main oleo leg fairings were retained, but the main <b>wheel</b> <b>doors</b> and tail <b>wheel</b> <b>doors</b> were removed for the tests. When the undercarriage was retracted, the main gear skis were housed in the space in the lower engine compartment made available by the removal of the fuselage [...]50in (12.7mm) Brownings from the P-51As.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} June 1944, a {{decision}} was taken to fit tropical air filters as standard, similar to those fitted to the three Typhoons which {{had been sent to}} North Africa in 1943. One thousand sets of the filters were to be manufactured and fitted to front line Typhoons as Mod. 421. It was estimated that these could be fitted to all Typhoons on the production lines by the end of September. Research shows that late Typhoons starting in the RB--- series were fitted with the filters, as were some rebuilt aircraft from earlier production batches. Mod. 421 appeared as a streamlined rectangular [...] "hump", just behind the main radiator fairing and between the inner <b>wheel</b> <b>doors,</b> where the updraught carburettor intake was located.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first flight}} of the first Typhoon prototype, P5212, made by Hawker's Chief test Pilot Philip Lucas from Langley, was delayed until 24 February 1940 because of the {{problems}} with the development of the Sabre engine. Although unarmed for its first flights, P5212 later carried 12 [...]303 in (7.7mm) Brownings, set in groups of six in each outer wing panel; this was the armament fitted to the first 110 Typhoons, known as the Typhoon IA. P5212 also had a small tail-fin, triple exhaust stubs and no <b>wheel</b> <b>doors</b> fitted to the centre-section. On 9 May 1940 the prototype had a mid-air structural failure, at the join between the forward fuselage and rear fuselage, just behind the pilot's seat. Philip Lucas could see daylight through the split but instead of bailing out, landed the Typhoon and was later awarded the George Medal.|$|E
2500|$|Grumman {{had been}} working on a {{successor}} to the F4F Wildcat since 1938 and the contract for the prototype XF6F-1 was signed on 30 June 1941. The aircraft was originally designed to use the Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone two-row, 14-cylinder radial engine of 1,700hp (1,268kW) driving a three-bladed Curtiss Electric propeller. Instead of the Wildcat's narrow-track, hand-cranked main landing gear retracting into the fuselage that it had inherited, little changed in design from the 1931-debuted Grumman FF-1 fighter biplane, the Hellcat had wide-set, hydraulically actuated landing gear struts which rotated through 90° while retracting backwards into the wings, much like that of the earlier Chance Vought F4U Corsair, but with full <b>wheel</b> <b>doors</b> fitted to the struts that covered the entire strut and the upper half of the main wheel when retracted, and twisted with the main gear struts during retraction. [...] The wing was mounted lower on the fuselage and was able to be hydraulically or manually folded, with each panel outboard of the undercarriage bay folding backwards from pivoting on a specially oriented, Grumman-patented Sto-Wing diagonal axis pivoting system much like the earlier F4F, with a folded stowage position parallel to the fuselage with the leading edges pointing diagonally down.|$|E

5000|$|In 2000, rain-sensing {{windshield}} wipers and xenon headlamps became standard on the 540i, and were newly available for 528i models. The [...] "M Sport" [...] package was added (replacing the standard sport package), and included the M Sport steering <b>wheel,</b> <b>door</b> sills, and shift knob. The 528i versions also gained the 540i's standard stability control system. All models now had daytime running lights, and fog lamps.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the first}} Groups to arrive in England for a ninety-day tour was the 28th Bombardment Group which {{deployed}} from Rapid City AFB, South Dakota, to RAF Scampton during 1948. 28th BG aircraft carried a Black R within a Black circle {{on both sides of}} the fin. The R denoted the Group while the circle identified the parent unit, the 15th Air Force. Many units later carried their parent numbered Air Force unit badge on the base of the fin. These aircraft also had various colored nose <b>wheel</b> <b>doors</b> and fin tips denoting their respective squadrons.|$|E
50|$|B-36s made regular {{visits to}} England for {{exercises}} between 1951 and 1959. On one occasion, an RB-36H (51-5744) of the 72d Bombardment Wing {{was making a}} fly-by during RAF St Mawgan's Battle of Britain display (September 1952) when it developed engine trouble. The aircraft landed, giving the crowd an opportunity to closely inspect an SAC B-36. The aircraft was natural metal with a large Black triangle and S letter code on the fin. The last three digits of the serial were positioned on the forward fuselage sides, the fin tip was Black and the nose <b>wheel</b> <b>doors</b> were Black with a diagonal White stripe.|$|E
50|$|Schempp-Hirth metal {{air brakes}} are fitted {{on the upper}} surface of the wing, and later models {{received}} modified brakes with an additional panel due to the somewhat disappointing effectiveness. The wings are held in place with two main pins. Up to 80 kg of water ballast can be carried. The tail unit is also of glassfibre/foam sandwich, and the horizontal tailplane has a fixed stabilizer. The fibreglass fuselage is built without the honeycombs that were used on the ASW 15B and ASW 17. It has a winch hook, which is covered by the main <b>wheel</b> <b>doors,</b> and an aerotow hook situated approximately one foot from the nose.|$|E
