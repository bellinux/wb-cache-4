While Hardin and Helm {{discussed}} business, Hardin's 14-year-old daughter, Lucinda, {{entered the room}} to show her father a map she had drawn. Helm later claimed it <b>was</b> <b>love</b> <b>at</b> first sight, and began to pursue Lucinda's affections. They courted for seven years, married in 1830 and had six daughters and five sons together. One of his sons, Benjamin Hardin Helm, was a Confederate general in the Civil War and was killed at the Battle of Chickamauga.|$|E
25|$|According to Malcolm MacDonald's account, {{both were}} in unhappy marriages and it <b>was</b> <b>love</b> <b>at</b> first sight. Rather than {{enter into a}} clandestine affair, they laid the matter before their {{respective}} spouses. The two couples met together and agreed amicably on the divorces which would allow John and Maud to marry, though they did not in fact do so until 1932. They were to have two children: John Patrick born in 1916 and a daughter Marybride in 1922.|$|E

Although they had one son, Muhammad Gaddafi (b. 1970), their relationship was strained, and they divorced in 1970. Gaddafi's second wife was Safia Farkash, [...] el-Brasai, a former nurse from Obeidat tribe born in Bayda. They met in 1969, following his ascension to power, when he was hospitalized with appendicitis; he claimed that it <b>was</b> <b>love</b> <b>at</b> first sight.

500|$|In November 1899 Barney met {{the poet}} Pauline Tarn, better known by her pen name Renée Vivien. For Vivien it <b>was</b> <b>love</b> <b>at</b> first sight, while Barney became fascinated with Vivien after hearing her recite {{one of her}} poems, which she {{described}} as [...] "haunted by the desire for death." [...] Their romantic relationship was also a creative exchange that inspired both of them to write. Barney provided a feminist theoretical framework which Vivien explored in her poetry. They adapted the imagery of the Symbolist poets along with the conventions of courtly love to describe love between women, also finding examples of heroic women in history and myth. Sappho was an especially important influence and they studied Greek so as to read the surviving fragments of her poetry in the original. Both wrote plays about her life.|$|E
500|$|In June 1986, Stephen Cook from TV Week {{announced}} that Daphne would accept a proposal from either Des or Shane, which would definitely result in her getting married. Smith told Cook [...] "I don't know whether Daphne actually needs {{a man in}} her life but she's certainly got two men there. It's a triangle that's developed, but to try and give a rational explanation to it is next to impossible." [...] Smith thought Daphne was ideal for Shane and that she {{had a great deal of}} love for him. On the other hand, Daphne also loved Des, who she trusted and had become good friends with. O'Brien stated that as far as Shane was concerned, Daphne was the only woman he ever loved and thought that he was more suited to her than Des. Keane commented that despite being engaged five times and stood up once by Daphne, Des had always loved her. He added [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>love</b> <b>at</b> first sight for Des." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Irwin met Terri Raines, an American naturalist from Eugene, Oregon, who {{was visiting}} {{wildlife}} rehabilitation facilities in Australia and {{had decided to}} visit the zoo. According to the couple, it <b>was</b> <b>love</b> <b>at</b> first sight. Terri said at the time, [...] "I thought {{there was no one}} like this anywhere in the world. He sounded like an environmental Tarzan, a larger-than-life superhero guy." [...] They were engaged four months later and were married in Eugene on 4 June 1992. Together they had two children: a daughter, Bindi Sue Irwin (born 24 July 1998), and a son, Robert Clarence [...] "Bob" [...] (named after Irwin's father) Irwin (born 1 December 2003). Bindi Sue is jointly named after two of Steve Irwin's favourite animals: Bindi, a saltwater crocodile, and Sui, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier who died on 23 June 2004. Irwin was as enthusiastic about his family as he was about his work. He once described his daughter Bindi as [...] "the reason [...] was put on the Earth." [...] His wife once said, [...] "The only thing that could ever keep him away from the animals he loves are the people he loves even more." [...] Although the Irwins were happily married, they did not wear wedding rings; they believed that in their line of work, wearing jewellery could pose a hazard to them and/or the animals.|$|E

500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it <b>was</b> <b>love</b> <b>at</b> first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E

Steve would later say that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>love</b> <b>at</b> first sight." [...] A [...] "whirlwind romance" [...] followed: They were engaged after only four months, and eight months later, on June 4, 1992, they married in Eugene, Oregon. Their first television documentary was filmed on their honeymoon. The footage, shot by John Stainton, became the first episode of The Crocodile Hunter, which later became successful in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Oates {{attended}} the same one-room school her mother attended as a child. She {{became interested in}} reading {{at an early age}} and remembers Blanche's gift of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) as [...] "the great treasure of my childhood, and the most profound literary influence of my life. This <b>was</b> <b>love</b> <b>at</b> first sight!" [...] In her early teens, she devoured the writing of Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë, Fyodor Dostoevsky, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, and Henry David Thoreau, whose [...] "influences remain very deep". Oates began writing at the age of 14, when Blanche gave her a typewriter. Oates later transferred to several bigger, suburban schools and graduated from Williamsville South High School in 1956, where she worked for her high school newspaper. She was the first in her family to complete high school. As a teen, Oates also received early recognition for her writing by winning a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.|$|E
2500|$|Reddy {{recalled}} her 1966 {{appearance at}} the Three Rivers Inn in Syracuse, New York – [...] "there were like twelve people in the audience" [...] – as typical of her early U.S. performing career. Her lack of a work permit {{made it difficult to}} obtain any singing jobs in the U.S., and she was forced to make several trips to Canada which did not require work permits for citizens of Commonwealth countries like Australia. In the spring of 1968, Martin St. James – a hypnotist/entertainer and fellow Australian she had met in New York City – threw Reddy a party with an admission price of $5 to enable Reddy – then down to her last $12 – to pay her rent. It was on this occasion that Reddy met her future manager and husband Jeff Wald, a 22-year-old secretary at the William Morris Agency who crashed the party: Reddy told People in 1975, [...] " [...] didn't pay the five dollars, but it <b>was</b> <b>love</b> <b>at</b> first sight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lexa's {{relationship}} with Clarke {{is presented as}} intense, complex, {{and the one thing}} that manages to soften Lexa's outlook on life. Debnam-Carey said the characters progression from being allies to becoming romantic [...] "stems from a connection that they both share—which is similar experiences and similar positions" [...] in that they are [...] "both very young leaders with great authority, a lot of responsibility. They have to lead a huge amount of people. They have a lot of expectations riding on them." [...] She said the sudden responsibilities they faced, the need to make the right decisions, and the fact they both grieved over past lovers helped connect them further, and it is a connection they do not have with others. Rothenberg originally stated that while he would not go as far to say that it <b>was</b> <b>love</b> <b>at</b> first sight for Lexa, [...] "it definitely {{was a bit of a}} thunderbolt moment for her when she first saw Clarke." [...] He said Clarke's attraction to Lexa [...] "developed a little bit more slowly, but by the end [...] they were very much intrigued at the possibility of a romantic relationship." [...] He later said [...] "Lexa was definitely smitten—like love at first sight, probably", but maintained it took longer for Clarke to develop romantic feelings for Lexa.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Love</b> <b>at</b> First Sight (1885) by James Brander Matthews, [...] "As soon as {{the doctor}} saw her {{he felt that he}} loved her with the whole force of his being; no stroke of <b>love</b> <b>at</b> first sight <b>was</b> ever more sudden or more irresistible", said of a human chess game where the queen is the one who <b>is</b> <b>loved</b> <b>at</b> first sight.|$|R
