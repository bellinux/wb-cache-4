5|$|The Yale Union Laundry Building {{was built}} to house a {{commercial}} laundry during an era, roughly 1900 to 1950, when many urban U.S. households sent out their laundry for cleaning rather than doing it at home.

5|$|The {{reduction}} of sulphur emissions {{had been an}} important factor since the station was in the design stages, as {{it was one of}} the main worries of those who protested the construction of the station. The London Power Company began developing an experimental technique for <b>washing</b> the flue gases in 1925. It used water and alkaline sprays over scrubbers of steel and timber in the flue ducts. The gases were subject to continuous <b>washing,</b> and with the presence of the catalyst iron oxide, sulphur dioxide was converted into sulphuric acid. Battersea Power Station was one of the first commercial applications of this technique in the world. This method of <b>washing</b> was stopped in the B Station in the 1960s, when it was discovered that the discharge of these products into the Thames was more harmful to the river than the gases would be to the atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|The Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> is {{especially}} favorable {{when combined with}} the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit. The combination and advantageous interconnections between a Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit and a Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> lead to smaller equipment and better operability. The gas coming from the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit {{can be sent to}} the Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> at low temperature (directly from the methanol absorber without being warmed up). Since part of the purified gas is reheated in the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit, small fluctuations in flow and temperatures can easily be compensated leading to best operability. To improve the hydrogen recovery, an integrated hydrogen recycle from the Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> to the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit can be installed, which uses the already existing recycle compressor of the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit to recycle the hydrogen-rich flash gas from the Liquid Nitrogen <b>Wash</b> back into the feed gas of the Rectisol <b>Wash</b> Unit. This leads to extremely high hydrogen recovery rates without any further equipment.|$|R
