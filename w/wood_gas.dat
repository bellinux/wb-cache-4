5|$|In 1930, an NSB Class Cmb1 diesel {{multiple}} unit was taken into use, {{and the number of}} daily trips increased to four. On days with heavy traffic, it hauled a trailer, which was normally stationed at Sandnes Station. On 10 November 1935, the new Ganddal Station opened, simplifying the stopping at the station. During World War II, the {{multiple unit}}s were disused, and instead the trains were hauled with steam locomotives. From 1 May 1944, the line was converted to standard gauge, and NSB Class 14 multiple units were taken into use, running on <b>wood</b> <b>gas</b> {{until the end of the}} war. In 1945, there were four daily round trips, but at the start of 1946, the number of daily round trips increased to six, and from mid-1946, to ten. From 1947 to 1953, there were eight or nine daily round trips, and from 1953 ten. Class 14 was eventually replaced with NSB Class 86 and NSB Class 87 in 1953. By then, the driving time from Ålgård to Sandnes had been reduced from 38 to 25minutes.|$|E

25|$|During both world wars, {{especially}} the World War II, {{the need for}} fuel produced by gasification reemerged due to the shortage of petroleum. <b>Wood</b> <b>gas</b> generators, called Gasogene or Gazogène, were used to power motor vehicles in Europe. By 1945 there were trucks, buses and agricultural machines that were powered by gasification. It is estimated that there were close to 9,000,000 vehicles running on producer gas all over the world.|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, a {{gas mixture}} {{including}} carbon monoxide {{was used to}} keep motor vehicles running {{in parts of the}} world where gasoline and diesel fuel were scarce. External (with a few exceptions) charcoal or <b>wood</b> <b>gas</b> generators were fitted, and the mixture of atmospheric nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and small amounts of other gases produced by gasification was piped to a gas mixer. The gas mixture produced by this process is known as <b>wood</b> <b>gas.</b> Carbon monoxide was also used on a large scale during the Holocaust at some Nazi German extermination camps, the most notable by gas vans in Chełmno, and in the Action T4 [...] "euthanasia" [...] program.|$|E

50|$|Exhaust gas {{emission}} from an {{internal combustion engine}} is significantly lower on <b>wood</b> <b>gas</b> than on petrol.

50|$|Gassifier wood boilers use {{secondary}} combustion air to burn additional <b>wood</b> <b>gases.</b> The most sophisticated systems use computer controls to direct air {{at different stages}} of the burn process at variable volume. Outdoor wood boilers are a topic of environmental controversy. An improperly used or built outdoor wood boiler can produce wood smoke with excessive unburned particulate matter, but when properly burned, studies show that burning wood {{is still one of the}} most environmentally friendly heating options. In 2007, EPA began a voluntary program to encourage manufacturers to reduce particulate levels. In 2015, the U.S. EPA updated its clean air standards for residential wood heaters, this is a mandatory standard for sales in the United States. The revised regulations apply only to new products and will not affect existing wood heaters. At this point, the only boilers that pass these emission controls are gasification models.|$|R

5000|$|A wood {{gasifier}} takes wood chips, sawdust, charcoal, coal, rubber {{or similar}} materials as fuel and burns these incompletely {{in a fire}} box, producing <b>wood</b> <b>gas,</b> solid ash and soot, the latter of which have to be removed periodically from the gasifier. The <b>wood</b> <b>gas</b> can then be filtered for tars and soot/ash particles, cooled and directed to an engine or fuel cell. Most of these engines have strict purity requirements of the <b>wood</b> <b>gas,</b> so the gas often has to pass through extensive gas cleaning in order to remove or convert, i.e., [...] "crack", tars and particles. The removal of tar is often accomplished by using a water scrubber. Running <b>wood</b> <b>gas</b> in an unmodified gasoline-burning internal combustion engine may lead to problematic accumulation of unburned compounds.|$|E
