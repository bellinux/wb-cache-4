25|$|Since {{the mutual}} {{violence}} of the peasants and the police, among whom there were units of freshly created riot police, <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand, on August 20 SL leadership decided to stop the strike. The police, which at first was shocked at {{the magnitude of the}} protest, took their revenge, pacifying villages and beating participants. This in return provoked hatred of the villagers. First processes of the arrested peasants began in December 1937 in the court in Przemyśl. Altogether, around 1000 people were sentenced to up to 5 years. Many of them stayed behind bars until September 1939, when prison guards left their posts behind, escaping the advancing German troops.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} sound in films had created new {{opportunities}} for musicians, and Montaner launched on a new career as a film performer. After a musical number in a 1934 film, she made two films in 1938. Radio, too, was developing as a mass medium which was wide open to musical talent. La Montaner was to {{make good use of}} both these opportunities. But by now her temperament <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control. Gonzalo Roig detailed the story of her sacking from the Lecuona show, María la O, at the Teatro Martí. During a duet with the tenor about the rekindling of betrayed love, she began to tear his clothes off on stage! That was a step too far for the management.|$|E
25|$|The Great Revolt {{began in}} the year 66 CE, {{originating}} in Roman and Jewish ethnic and religious tensions. The crisis escalated due to anti-taxation protests and attacks upon Roman citizens. The Roman governor, Gessius Florus, responded by plundering the Jewish Temple, claiming the money was for the Emperor, {{and the next day}} launching a raid on the city, arresting numerous senior Jewish figures. This prompted a wider, large-scale rebellion and the Roman military garrison of Judaea was quickly overrun by the rebels, while the pro-Roman king Herod Agrippa II, together with Roman officials, fled Jerusalem. As it became clear the rebellion <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control, Cestius Gallus, the legate of Syria, brought in the Syrian army, based on Legion XII Fulminata and reinforced by auxiliary troops, to restore order and quell the revolt. Despite initial advances and conquest of Jaffa, the Syrian Legion was ambushed and defeated by Jewish rebels at the Battle of Beth Horon with 6,000 Romans massacred and the Legion's aquila lost. During 66, Judean Free Government was formed in Jerusalem including former High Priest Ananus ben Ananus, Joseph ben Gurion and Joshua ben Gamla elected as leaders. Yosef ben Matityahu was appointed the rebel commander in Galilee and Eleazar ben Hanania as the commander in Edom. Later, in Jerusalem, an attempt by Menahem ben Yehuda, leader of the Sicarii, {{to take control of the}} city failed. He was executed and the remaining Sicarii were ejected from the city. Simon bar Giora, a charismatic, but radical peasant leader, was also expelled by the new government.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} using entirely analogue equipment until post-mastering. Grohl {{said it was}} done that way because he felt digital recording <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control: [...] "when I listen to music these days, and I hear Pro Tools and drums that sound like a machine- it kinda sucks {{the life out of}} music." [...] According to Grohl, the analog strategy would make the record [...] "sound rawer and somewhat imperfect", something which guitarist Chris Shiflett agreed was beneficial, declaring that [...] "rock n'roll is about flaws and imperfections". Bassist Nate Mendel added that [...] "we grew up making records on tape, which has a certain sound, certain limitations", and drummer Taylor Hawkins said that the digital recording in contemporary rock n' roll lead to an artificial sound : [...] "they kinda played it and then how someone else manipulated it in a computer, to make them sound a certain way." [...] Hawkins believed an analog project would help the band reclaim its artistic freedom.|$|E

500|$|Accum paid {{particular}} attention to beer, introducing the subject with the comment: [...] "Malt beverages, and especially port, the preferred drink of the inhabitants of London and other large cities, is among the items which is most frequently adulterated {{in the course of}} supply." [...] He claimed that English beer was occasionally mixed with molasses, honey, vitriol, pepper and even opium. Among the most shocking customs he pointed out was the practice of adding fishberries, part of the Menispermaceae family, to port. It became evident during the French Revolutionary Wars that the practice <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand, and Accum attributed the intoxicating power of the drink to the addition of this plant matter. Accum used various sources to substantiate his claims. As evidence for his claims about Cocculus indicus he used, among others, import statistics, which he complemented with observations about when the price of Cocculus indicus from commodity price lists of brewing materials merchants increased. He also looked at historic price trends for the same commodities.|$|E

Glass Spider was {{a recording of}} a live two-hour concert filmed in Sydney, Australia in November 1987. The Symphony Sessions included ten compositions by Foster presented as a [...] "collage of video images" [...] in performance with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. Recorded {{over a period of}} five nights in Vancouver, Foster wrote, arranged, produced and played piano for the project (which included a recording of the theme for the 1988 Winter Olympics) with the assistance of Jeremy Lubbock, David Paich, and Lee Ritenour. The music video for [...] "Check It Out", a song that appears on Mellencamp's 1987 album The Lonesome Jubilee, was filmed live at Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, Indiana on December 11, 1987. Directed by Marty Callner, Stevie Nicks: Live at Red Rocks is an hour-long recording of a live concert filmed at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado with special guests Mick Fleetwood and Peter Frampton. The music video for U2's [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] was filmed on the roof of a Los Angeles liquor store. During the filming process, police ordered the band to stop the shoot [...] "due to fears the crowd <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand".

Tremaine {{accepted}} the rough draft for $850, and announced it in the June 1934 issue, with a full-page editorial and a three-quarter-page advertisement. The novel was published in the August 1934 through February 1935 issues.

2500|$|The Moffat/ANZ rumours did {{not come}} to fruition, and the team built a new plain white VL Commodore SS Group A SV for the 1990 season.

A few other minor sponsors were picked up for the endurance races, where Tomas Mezera co-drove. After a good showing at the 1990 Sandown 500, the pair pulled off a third-place finish at Bathurst, after narrowly missing the win after a safety-car mix up when Perkins was help up in pit lane (the win went to the HRT Commodore of Allan Grice and Win Percy). The pair picked up a win a few weeks later at the newly opened Eastern Creek Raceway in the 1990 Nissan Sydney 500.

2500|$|His {{last term}} in office was marked by tension between the NSW and Victorian Governments and a view that Askin <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> touch with the voters. Late in 1974, Askin {{announced}} his resignation, and his last intervention was to support his Minister for Lands, Thomas Lewis, in his bid to be Askin's successor instead of the Deputy Leader and Minister for Education, Sir Eric Willis. It was reported that Lewis had offered to upgrade Askin's knighthood from Knight Commander (KCMG) to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) of the Order of St Michael and St George, while Willis was uncommitted. Askin retired from politics in January 1975 and was succeeded by Lewis as Premier. On 14 June 1975 he was elevated to Knight Grand Cross, for his service as Premier. [...] His resignation began a turbulent year for the government. [...] Lewis was ousted in a party room coup by Willis in 1976, but Willis only lasted four months before losing the 1976 election to Labor, ending the longest unbroken run for a non-Labor government since World War I. Askin remains {{the only person to}} take the Coalition into more than one election as the sitting Liberal Premier.|$|E

I would like someday to rework those songs and give them the attention and time that they deserve." [...] McGuinness disagrees that the band did not have enough time, saying, [...] "It got an awful lot of time, actually.
