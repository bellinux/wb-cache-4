50|$|In P. remota, the {{division}} of labor is based on the age of the worker. There are 7 different tasks that have been observed in the nest of P. remota and each of them occur at different times in the workers life. The first task that workers perform usually involves either using cerumen to build the bars between combs and walls or building and maintaining the storage pots and the connecting cerumen bar. This occurs a few days after emerging. The second task that workers do involves working on the old combs, helping the young bees to emerge, feeding them, and then gnawing off the remains of the cell. This happens when they are between the ages of 6 and 30 days. The third task is building the cells, which is limited to bees that are 12-24 days old. This is also the task where the fewest number of bees participate. The fourth task workers <b>do</b> <b>is</b> called dehydration, which simply describes the collection of nectar from the pots. This <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> workers that <b>are</b> older than 18 days or by the males. The fifth task is receiving nectar from foragers which <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> workers that <b>are</b> older than 24 days. The sixth task is foraging and it <b>is</b> normally <b>done</b> in the final stage of the workers' lives, which starts at day 30. The seventh task involves work around the royal chamber for the gynes, which include reconstruction and maintenance and <b>are</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> workers between the ages of 23 and 85 days. Task 1 <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 94% of the workers, task 2 <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 21% of the workers, task 3 <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 12% of the bees, task 4 <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 69%, task 5 <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 60%, task 6 <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 46% and task 7 <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 27% of the workers.|$|R

60|$|Now the {{deductions}} which I {{am going}} to append to these figures may sound extravagant, but they are not. I take them from Miscellaneous Documents No. 50, second session 45th Congress, and they are official and trustworthy. To-day, the work of those 2,000,000 cotton-ginners <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 2,000 men; that of the 6,000,000 stocking-knitters <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 3,000 boys; that of the 2,000,000 thread-spinners <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 1,000 girls; that of the 500,000 screw makers <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 500 girls; that of the 400,000 reapers, binders, etc., <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 4,000 boys; that of the 1,000,000 corn shelters <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 7,500 men; that of the 40,000 weavers <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 1,200 men; {{and that of the}} 1,000 stitchers of shoe soles <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> 6 men.

Now then, how many of that ignorant race--our fathers and grandfathers--with their ignorant methods, would it take to do our work to-day? It would take forty thousand millions--a hundred times the swarming population of China--twenty times the present population of the globe. You look around you and you see a nation of sixty millions-- apparently; but secreted in their hands and brains, and invisible to your eyes, is the true population of this Republic, and it numbers forty billions! It is the stupendous creation of those humble unlettered, un-college-bred inventors--all honor to their name.|$|R
