2500|$|BBC {{diplomatic}} correspondent Bridget Kendall in her 2007 article, after {{describing the}} [...] "scarred decade" [...] of the 1990s with [...] "rampant hyperinflation", harsh Yeltsin's policies, population decrease rate {{like that for}} a nation in a war, the country turning [...] "from superpower into beggar", wonders: [...] "So <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> Russians for welcoming the relative stability Putin has presided over during the past seven years, even if other aspects of his rule have cast an authoritarian shadow? In the back-to-front world of Russian politics, it is not too little democracy that many people fear, but too much of it. This, I discovered, is why some are calling for Putin to stay on for a third term. Not because they admire him—privately, many say that he and his cronies are just as corrupt and disdainful of others as their communist predecessors were—but because they mistrust the idea of democracy, resent the West for pushing it, and fear what might happen as a result of next year's elections. Recent experience has taught them that change is usually for the worse and best avoided." ...|$|E

50|$|Haslam and Ryan {{say their}} {{studies show that}} people believe women are better-suited to lead stressed, unhappy {{companies}} because they are felt to be more nurturing, creative, and intuitive. These researchers argue that female leaders are not necessarily expected to improve the situation, but are seen as good people managers <b>who</b> <b>can</b> take the <b>blame</b> for organizational failure.|$|R

Johnny Loftus of Allmusic rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of five and commented [...] "...Avenged Sevenfold gets all the pieces right, and sound like they're having more fun here than in the scattershot approach of the first couple records". The British version of the German magazine, Metal Hammer gave the album an eight out of ten rating with Katie Parsons concluding [...] "They have done it their way, they're having fun and <b>who</b> the hell <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> them?".|$|R
40|$|And that’s not all [...] . I wholeheartedly {{concur with}} Chorley, McGrath and Finlay, and their observa-tions and {{conclusions}} about the pain associated with treatment that we inflict on our patients. 1 I would add a similar consequence of our treatment: habitua-tion and addiction to the narcotics we inflict on some patients whose pain we try to alleviate. Often the pain that we first believe is acute transpires to be chronic. Once the dose of a drug has been titrated {{in pursuit of a}} level of relief that seems to become ever more elusive, the patient develops numerous adverse symptoms, including hyperes-thesia, constipation, hyperhydrosis and endocrine disorders, such as testos-terone suppression. Habituation often leads to addiction. But when we awaken to the situation, we are con-fronted with the prospect of having to induce most uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. <b>Who</b> then <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> us for occasionally turning a blind eye to patients in pain rather than risk such an outcome...|$|R

50|$|After {{the rape}} and murder of 5 {{elementary}} schoolgirls, a crime which deeply upsets the entire country, a fleeing suspect is shot and killed by the police. This leads to bad publicity because the guilt of the suspect cannot be proved, and the real attacker may still be at large. Under pressure from the Blue House, a senior police official assigns Choi, a corrupt captain, on a highly sensitive mission, namely to find a former child rapist <b>who</b> <b>can</b> take the <b>blame</b> in exchange for money for his family. Choi, in return, is promised a promotion and the dismissal of an internal investigation against him, which was caused by his illicit collaboration with Jang, a corrupt businessman. Meanwhile, a corrupt prosecutor named Joo cancels the criminal charges against a corrupt businessman named Kim.|$|R

60|$|At last he stopped, on April 6th, to {{take another}} observation. This showed him to be within {{a few miles of}} the Pole, and if he went wild with joy, <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> him?

6000|$|The news soon {{spread around}} the ranch that the [...] "tenderfeet" [...] had killed a big bobcat, and all the hands came {{to get a look}} at the beast.

5000|$|However, Yesi’s narrators are introspective {{and aware}} that {{they are part of}} what’s happening. The novel Paper Cut-outs (剪紙) is {{composed}} of two story lines, each about the narrator’s interaction with a female friend. The two story lines can be read as separate stories, yet, they contrast and complement each other in details and contents. Both his friends faced a catastrophe nearly {{at the end of the}} story, and the narrator says: 人與人之間的關係互相牽連，混合了我們這些其他人的感情。我們這些旁觀者一下子也牽涉其中了，我們可以指責某種偏激行為…但當不幸的事發生了，我們可以置身事外嗎?” (161)(Translation: A relationship would be affected by other relationships.

60|$|The {{gates of}} the fort were shut, and the captains summoned.

60|$|With such surroundings, almost {{those of}} a sybarite, <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> me for being lulled into security, and telling myself that my {{troubles}} were nearly at an end?

60|$|<b>Who</b> <b>can</b> <b>blame</b> her, poor girl? For Lancelot's humility {{was even}} more irresistible than his eloquence. He assumed no superiority. He demanded her assent to truths, {{not because they were}} his opinions, but simply for the truth's sake; and on all points which touched the heart he looked up to her as infallible and inspired. In {{questions}} of morality, of taste, of feeling, he listened not as a lover to his mistress, but rather as a baby to its mother; and thus, half unconsciously to himself, he taught her where her true kingdom lay,- -that the heart, and not the brain, enshrines the priceless pearl of womanhood, the oracular jewel, the 'Urim and Thummim,' before which gross man can only inquire and adore.|$|E

And then he knew that if he told you he would never be asked here, and would perhaps never see me again.

It was {{a declaration of war}} to me, as I saw at once; though I declare I was willing enough to have received the boy well on his coming amongst us, and to have lived with him on terms of friendliness.
