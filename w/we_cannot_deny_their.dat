60|$|But the {{scientific}} coincidence {{is even more}} strict and close. It affects not only the general question of miracles, but the particular question of possession. This is the very last element in the Christian story that would ever have been selected by the enlightened Christian apologist. Gladstone would defend it, {{but he would not}} go {{out of his way to}} dwell on it. It is an excellent working model of what I mean by finding an unexpected support, and finding it in an unexpected quarter. It is not theological but psychological study that has brought us back into this dark underworld of the soul, where even identity seems to dissolve or divide, and men are not even themselves. I do not say that psychologists admit the discovery of demoniacs; and if they did they would doubtless call them something else, such as demono-maniacs. But they admit things which seem almost as near to a new supernaturalism, and things quite as incredible to the old rationalism. Dual personality is not so very far from diabolic possession. And if the dogma of subconsciousness allows of agnosticism, the agnosticism cuts both ways. A man cannot say there is a part of him of which he is quite unconscious, and only conscious that it is not in contact with the unknown. He cannot say there is a sealed chamber or cellar under his house, of which he knows nothing whatever; but that he is quite certain that it cannot have an underground passage leading anywhere else in the world. He cannot say he knows nothing whatever about its size or shape or appearance, except that it certainly does not contain a relic of the finger-joint of St. Catherine of Alexandria, or that it certainly is not haunted by the ghost of King Herod Agrippa. If there is any sort of legend or tradition or plausible probability which says that it is, he cannot call a thing impossible where he is not only ignorant but even unconscious. It comes back therefore to the same reality, that the old compact cosmos depended on a compact consciousness. If we are dealing with unknown quantities, <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>deny</b> <b>their</b> connection with other unknown quantities. If I have a self of which I can say nothing, how can I even say that it is my own self? How can I even say that I always had it, or that it did not come from somewhere else? It is clear that we are in very deep waters, whether or no we have rushed down a steep place to fall into them.|$|E

En estos autores moda e imitación se retroalimentan creando tensiones en el individuo y en su sociedad. El cambio, la asimilación, el poder y las jerarquías se conjugan en un juego de paradojas que se presentan en nuestra cotidianidad de forma frívola pero que distan de serlo. Las obras de estos autores tratan temas que tienen pertinencia en el mundo actual y que, por esto, no podemos rechazar. This article aims to be a {{reflection}} of the philosophical aspects of fashion and imitation in the works of two nineteenth century thinkers: the German Georg Simmel and the French Gabriel de Tarde. On their works, fashion and imitation feedback themselves creating tensions between the individual and society.

Rochas, minerais e conchas são mergulhados em soluções sobressaturadas de substâncias solúveis em água, seleccionadas entre aquelas que cristalizam com relativa facilidade. A beleza dos cristais produzidos, quer na forma de grandes monocristais, maclas, agregados ou whiskers, incentiva os alunos a aprofundar os seus estudos, não só em relação aos factores intervenientes no crescimento, mas também nas áreas científicas que partilham o interesse por este tema, seja ele por aspectos ligados à purificação, produção, caracterização, ou ao estudo de propriedades apetecíveis para aplicações tecnológicas. Nesta publicação resume-se o método {{experimental}} nas suas principais componentes: o que usar como suporte; quais as substâncias que cristalizam com facilidade e qual o interesse do seu estudo; qual a técnica apropriada em cada caso; que reacções ou outros efeitos se estabelecem entre as substâncias e os suportes. Finalmente, ao fazer um levantamento do que tem sido feito, interessa-nos salientar as suas potencialidades no campo do empreendorismo. Como complemento do trabalho experimental sugere-se a exploração de conceitos da química descritiva dos elementos, especialmente a dos metais, o que a torna muito menos árida e susceptível de memorização, pois os alunos ao começarem as suas colecções de substâncias cristalinas, têm tendência a catalogar as suas propriedades físicas e químicas, as suas fórmulas e estruturas. Curiosamente, o método foi testado pela primeira vez em 1993, numa aula de Laboratório de Química Geral de Engenharia de Materiais. Por razões históricas e não só, achamos curial a sua publicação na área de Materiais. Crystals are of {{an increasing}} importance in our Society. In {{the beginning of}} the XXI century, Crystal Engineering started to develop, emerging from the main area of Crystallography. In spite of the dominating Bio- and Bio-logical trends in modern Technology, we cannot ignore our life on Earth (and other planets?) surrounded by natural crystals, in the composition of rocks, minerals, metals, and as the basic units of solids, a lot of them being inorganic. Therefore we must understand them, improving our knowledge on them. We can’t afford to neglect the classical Sciences like Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry related to their studies: they seem as if they became out of fashion (at least in our country!), but <b>we</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>deny</b> <b>their</b> importance for understanding Mineralogy, Geology, Materials Sciences, Environmental studies, Bioinorganic Sciences (the role of metals in our bodies as active centres of enzymes…) etc [...] If we neglect and dismember Chemistry, the future generations will very fast loose the skills to understand our surroundings and furthermore, their own bodies! On the Rocks is a research project for inorganic chemical education, consisting on crystal growth on rough surfaces, (rocks, minerals, shells, metallic wires, etc.) [1 - 10]. These substrates, acting as "hosts", are introduced in supersaturated solutions of chemicals, promoting a faster nucleation and strongly stimulating crystal growth. Only substances that can afford large single crystals easily are chosen. Mainly ionic salts fairly soluble in water have been studied, a few of them here described. The technique requires inexpensive glassware and is feasible in schools poorly equipped, under close surveillance and strict safety rules. The large single crystals embedded on the host rocks look like "minerals" (synthetic!), and their beauty is a powerful tool to attract students for Chemistry and other Sciences sharing a common interest on crystals. Many concepts can be introduced during and after the preparation of the samples, especially those regarding group chemistry, and no background on crystal growth is required. The diversity of compounds and hosts one might choose, plus the reactions and interactions that might occur between them turns the method very interesting and creative. This research project started in 1993 and two years later a large network started as a co-operative project between our University Research Centre, Industry, and many Portuguese schools with very interesting results...|$|E
