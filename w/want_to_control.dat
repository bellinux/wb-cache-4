5|$|Cú Chulainn {{has many}} lovers, but Emer's only jealousy comes when he {{falls in love}} with Fand, wife of Manannán mac Lir. Manannán has left her and she has been {{attacked}} by three Fomorians who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the Irish Sea. Cú Chulainn agrees to help defend her as long as she marries him. She agrees reluctantly, but they fall in love when they meet. Manannán knows their relationship is doomed because Cú Chulainn is mortal and Fand is a fairy; Cú Chulainn's presence would destroy the fairies. Emer, meanwhile, tries to kill her rival, but when she sees the strength of Fand's love for Cú Chulainn she decides to give him up to her. Fand, touched by Emer's magnanimity, decides to return to her own husband. Manannan shakes his cloak between Cú Chulainn and Fand, ensuring the two will never meet again, and Cú Chulainn and Emer drink a potion to wipe the whole affair from their memories.|$|E

They also thought it was selfish of parents to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> their children and that this did not give room for the child to grow as their own person.|$|E

2500|$|U.S. News and World Report editor Robert Morse, {{argued that}} [...] "a couple of journalists {{are making the}} case for the U.S. News rankings, {{explaining}} why the actions of a group of college presidents who have signed [...] the letter boycotting the U.S. News peer survey may not be {{in the best interests of}} prospective students and their parents." [...] In fact, Morse refers to an article published in a right-wing journal, the National Review, entitled They Protest Too Much, published on 28 June 2007 in which he quotes John J. Miller as stating, [...] "the magazine's editors and writers aren't interfering with higher education so much as responding to a consumer demand for more information about it. The demand exists because colleges and universities are among the least accountable institutions in American life [...] the U.S. News rankings indisputably measure something—and something is better than nothing, which is why parents of high school students pore over the magazine's tables and charts. This is rational behavior for people on the verge of spending more huge sums of money on the education of a single child. Like wise investors, they want to know if they're getting a good deal." [...] He also refers to the 27 June 2007 Washington Post op-ed, A College Course in Cynicism, in which he quotes Robert Samuelson as stating, [...] "hat's so shameful about this campaign against the rankings is its anti-intellectualism. Much information is in some way incomplete or imperfect. The proper response to evidence that you dislike or dispute is to supplement or discredit it with better evidence. The wrong response is to suppress it. And yet, that's the agenda of these college presidents. By not cooperating with the U.S. News survey, they hope to sabotage the rankings. They say they'll provide superior information. But they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> what parents and students see. This is soft censorship.What their students will learn, if they're paying attention, is a life lesson in cynicism: how eminent authorities cloak their self-interest in high-sounding, deceptive rhetoric." ...|$|E

Whatever her people's {{politics}} she will naturally, as your wife, come in time to take your views; and besides, there is no harm, rather the reverse, in keeping up a connection with that side. You must see as well as I do that the time is fast coming when there will be a considerable change in politics. Even now we are far nearer, upon all important points, to the Tories than we are to these Radical fellows who at present vote with us, but who in time will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> us. The Tories have come much nearer to us, and we to them. Already we are scarcely in a majority on our own side of the house, and it will not be many years before we shall have to concede the demand to give a large share of ministerial appointments to Radicals. We shall then perceive that we must choose between becoming the followers of men whose ways and politics we hate, or the allies of men of our own stamp, whose way of looking at things differs but very little from our own. Therefore, I should say it would be just as well for you to choose a wife from their ranks as from your own.' ...|$|E
