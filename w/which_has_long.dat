Other comparable antibiotics include teicoplanin (trade name Targocid, a glycopeptide like vancomycin), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid, a combination of two streptogramins, not active against E. faecalis), and daptomycin (Cubicin, a lipopeptide), and some agents still being developed, such as ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, and telavancin. Linezolid is the only one that can be taken by mouth. In the future, oritavancin and iclaprim may be useful oral alternatives to linezolid—both are in the early stages of clinical development.|$|E
5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding on the bridge in order to block out the lights of nearby Long Beach, California. To make it look like it was raining during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E

The Argonauts were a fixture on the Toronto sports scene for decades, with attendance peaking in the 1970s. In May 2015 it was announced that a consortium of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment's Larry Tanenbaum (via the Kilmer Group) and Bell Canada would acquire the team. The sale included a scheduled move to MLSE run BMO Field for the 2016 season, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> been proposed given attendance under-utilization at Rogers Centre and plans to install natural grass at the domed stadium, rendering it unfit for football.|$|E

These releases fueled rumors and fear that Final Fantasy XIII and Tekken 6, two highly anticipated exclusive PlayStation 3 games at the time, would also be available for Xbox 360, the PlayStation 3's primary competitor and at E3 2008, it was announced that Final Fantasy XIII would be simultaneously released on the Xbox 360 in Europe and North America; later on October 8, 2008, it was announced that Tekken 6 would also be releasing on the Xbox 360. After the multiplatform releases of these games, the fifth installment of the Metal Gear series, , has also been announced for the Xbox 360; L.A. Noire, which was announced as an exclusive since the beginning of its development, has also been released for the Xbox 360; Dark Souls, the spiritual successor to Demon's Souls, has also been released on Xbox 360; the Persona series, which {{has a long history of}} being PlayStation exclusive, found the seventh generation installment, Persona 4 Arena multiplatform; however, Metal Gear Solid 4, Yakuza 3, Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection ONLINE, and Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice still remain PlayStation 3 exclusives. Sony has blamed lower-than-expected sales, loss of exclusive titles in the PlayStation 3 software library, its higher price, and stock shortages.|$|E

Babell's transcription of arias from Handel's opera Rinaldo includes 'Vo' far guerra', which Handel intended as a showpiece for his harpsichord playing and is quite remarkable in its virtuosity; Babell's transcription was made from his memory of how Handel improvised in performances. In 1894, Friedrich Chrysander published Babell's piano reduction of Rinaldo in the Händel-Gesellschaft volume 48.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1812 earthquake, the two largest bells cracked and split open. Due to this damage neither produced clear tones.

One of O' Sullivan's companions during his tenure at San Juan Capistrano was José de Gracia Cruz, better known as Acú, who related many stories and legends of the Mission.

25|$|Bowling has {{experienced}} another decline {{since the late}} 1990s and into the 2000s, especially in the United States. From 1998 to 2013, the number of bowling alleys in the U.S. fell from about 5,400 to 3,976, a 26% drop. This is partly attributed to the decline of league bowling participation, which used to account for most of a bowling center's revenue, {{as well as the}} decline in social activity overall (see Bowling Alone), according to Robert Putnam, public policy professor at Harvard University. For example, the Metro Detroit USBC Chapter, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> had the most certified league members of any chapter in the entire USBC organization, now numbers about 45,000, down from about 300,000 in the late 1970s.
