Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote.

RoboMary is an intelligent robot who, instead of the ordinary color camera-eyes, has a software lock such that she is only able to perceive black and white and shades in-between.|$|E
25|$|Shoji {{lives with}} a bar hostess, {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> {{to have a}} child with her and whether the child would grow up as a Napoleon or Hitler. Their apartment is frequented by a large rat, but he finds himself unable to kill it because it is pregnant. This causes the hostess to stay at her friend's place. When Shoji visits her bar, he tells her that none of the rat's six babies came out like Hitler, and leaves her.|$|E
25|$|At a {{very early}} ageas young as fiveJesperson would capture and torture animals. He enjoyed {{watching}} animals kill each other {{as well as the}} feeling he got from taking their lives. This continued as he got older. He would capture birds and stray cats and dogs around the trailer park where he lived with his family, severely beating the animals and then strangling them to death, something he claims his father was proud of him for. In the years following, Jesperson said he often thought about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to do the same to a human.|$|E

She feels a sense of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be a man, and also a sort of jealousy towards Ray, Kitty's husband.

Each of the characters responds to this turn of events differently: Don Santiago scoffs, refusing to consider Americans any threat to his way of life; Alvaro wants to know what military action can be undertaken to stave off the American forces; Luis Gonzaga contemplates whether or not Americans really are the uncultured hoodlums he has heard them to be; María de los Ángeles, under the assumption that Americans are not Catholic, assumes the invasion is punishment from God for Mexico's sins; and Susanita wonders <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to dance with a tall white-skinned man.|$|E

The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is then shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips and steals her first kiss. Lee said [...] "For days, all Sunny's been able to think about is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to kiss Zeke.

When Chris sees Anna {{for the first}} time, he starts singing the song [...] "Crazy for You", which was originally performed by Madonna in the film Vision Quest (1985). When Peter is fighting a British man, the title music from The Sea Hawk (1940), composed by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, is used. The episode imagines <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> if Michael J. Fox, who has [...] Parkinson's disease, would star as Zorro. In a trailer for a film, the tune from Coldplay's [...] "Clocks" [...] is played.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe {{promoting}} their film Stargate. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like Stargate {{if he did not}} believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, [...] "I think I have an idea for our next film." ...|$|E

Pal, that's nice that you're not showing off but this is all wrong and despicable: it's like locking yourself and 10 friends into a loo on a commuter train, to see <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> on the train to Auschwitz.

500|$|The {{character}} Astronaut Mike Dexter {{was first}} referenced in this episode, in which Liz considers {{him to be}} her imaginary perfect husband. In [...] "Sun Tea", [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown) pretends to be Mike Dexter, Liz's [...] "crazy black boyfriend", to help her get Brian out of his apartment. In the following episode, [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show", actor John Anderson played the character, when Liz fantasizes about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> following the success of her talk show, and is then notified by Mike Dexter {{that he has to}} go back to outer space. Astronaut Mike Dexter would be mentioned further in the season.|$|E

To accommodate this, Sesame Street puppeteers Joey Mazzarino, Carmen Osbahr, and Matt Vogel were brought in to do the muppet versions of Jack, Liz, and Tracy Jordan. This angle would later be used again in the show's fourth season episode [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show" [...] in which Kenneth appears as a muppet while walking by a high-definition camera. In addition, the program was parodied by Sesame Street, in the show's 39th season, entitled [...] "30 Rocks".|$|E

Kirk, {{the former}} {{commanding}} officer of the USS Enterprise and an Admiral at Starfleet headquarters, who re-assumes command of the Enterprise, and with it, temporary demotion to his previous rank, captain. When asked during a March 1978 press conference about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to reprise the role, Shatner said, [...] "An actor brings to a role not only {{the concept of a}} character but his own basic personality, things that he is, and both Leonard Nimoy and myself have changed over the years, to a degree at any rate, and we will bring that degree of change inadvertently to the role we recreate." ...|$|E

500|$|Screenwriters Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely {{wanted to}} explore how the Pevensies felt after {{returning}} from Narnia, going from being kings and queens back to an awkward year as school children. They noted, [...] " [...] doesn't much consider <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> for a King of Narnia to return to being a 1940's schoolchild." [...] They also decided to introduce the Pevensies back into Narnia nearer the start, in order to weave the two separate stories of the Pevensies and Caspian, {{in contrast to the}} book's structure. A sense of guilt on the Pevensies' part was added, seeing the destruction of Narnia in their absence, as was hubris for Peter to enhance the theme of belief: his arrogance means he is unable to see Aslan.|$|E
500|$|Director Nate Fox {{stated that}} much of the {{inspiration}} of the superhero story came from two DC Comics series, DMZ and [...] Both center on a city after a large disaster. The series also inspired the crafting of the game's grim take on the superhero genre. Fox further stated that the film Batman Begins was an inspiration for the game. However, any correlation to DC Comics' Static Shock was unintentional. Fox considered his own personal involvement in the Seattle WTO riots of 1999 as influencing the reflection of [...] "spending time in a lawless place" [...] within the game. Grand Theft Auto III was also stated as an influence, in that the team could easily see themselves as superheroes in the open world of Liberty City; similarly, Spider-Man 2 was used as a model to demonstrate <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to move about the city and answer random requests for help alongside regular missions. They had toyed around with a version of the game that they compared to a superhero version of Animal Crossing, and along side superhero work, the hero would have an alter-ego of property developer to meet the citizens' more common needs, but dropped this and focused solely on superhero activities after about six months of work. The character of Cole was created to be a [...] "kind of an everyman" [...] so that players could then [...] "get into the headspace of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be a real human being who has been granted these exceptional abilities". The team also avoided giving Cole an alter-ego or outfitting him with a costume as it would not have reasonably fit in with the character or the game's story.|$|E
500|$|Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole was keen to win {{his first}} trophy in the final: [...] "We don't feel under any great pressure, but we do feel excited about the {{possibility}} of winning our first trophy, we've just been imagining <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to lift the trophy, who's going where in the line if we win it, and how we'll run round Cardiff with it." [...] Teammate Frank Lampard was also keen {{to win his}} first trophy: [...] "If you haven't won anything, a runners-up medal is not what you want at all." [...] He also stated that Chelsea manager José Mourinho's desire to win had been rubbing off on the players: [...] "He actually gets angrier with each one, so every time we lose it's the worst I've seen him, he's a winner, though, that's what you expect, and that's the attitude that's needed at Chelsea these days." ...|$|E
