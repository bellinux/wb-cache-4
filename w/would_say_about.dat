25|$|Ontological hermeneutics {{provides}} {{a way for the}} clients and therapist to work together to create subjective truth and meaning for the client. Where other therapies such as Cognitive-behavioral therapy, Rational-emotive behavioral therapy, Dialectical-behavioral therapy, and other eclectic approaches frequently create a conflict between freedom and commitment for the client. For example, a client seeing a counselor may want to work on becoming more of an individual by exploring his or her self-concept by finding personal meaning, breaking away from social trends and peer pressure, and discovering his or her own interests. Therapists utilizing traditional theories, like cognitive behavioral therapy, rational emotive behavioral therapy, or even eclectic approaches, will guide the client in this process according to how the therapist's chosen therapy <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> how an individual ought to go about this process. In other words, the client will have to commit to exploring his or her self-concept based on how cognitive behavioral therapy, or another therapy, says the client should learn about who they are, therefore limiting the amount of freedom afforded to the client to creatively develop his or her own ways of self-exploration. Proponents of ontological hermeneutics state that hermeneutic psychotherapy strives to provide freedom to the client by affording his or her voice a privileged position in therapy to develop their own options.|$|E
2500|$|During an April 11, 2010, {{appearance}} on CNN, host Candy Crowley {{asked if it}} had been insensitive for Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell to omit mentioning slavery in a proposed recognition of Confederate History Month. Barbour replied, [...] "To me, it's a sort of feeling that it's a nit, that it is not significant, that it's not a—it's trying to make {{a big deal out of}} something doesn't amount to diddly." [...] Barbour continued, [...] "I don't know what you <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> slavery ... but anybody that thinks that you have to explain to people that slavery is a bad thing, I think that goes without saying." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{pivotal moment}} {{in her life}} came during the summer before her sophomore year, when she went with a friend to the Gonzaga University girls' {{basketball}} camp. She <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the trip in 2011, [...] "I just {{fell in love with}} this place. I felt so comfortable here." [...] The Gonzaga women's basketball staff was equally enthusiastic about her, except for head coach Kelly Graves, who had little opportunity to see her during the camp. Graves would finally get to see Vandersloot at length in her junior year, on the day before the 2006 Washington Class 4A state tournament. He offered her a scholarship after seeing her practice, even though he did not stay for the tournament.|$|E

He later said [...] "When the interviewer, Pat Paulsen, got to me, he asked what I thought the critics <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Candy. I said I didn't think it would be reviewed by the regular critics, {{that they would have to}} reconvene the Nuremberg Trials to do it justice. He laughed and asked what I had liked, and I said I liked the lady who showed me the nearest exit so that I would not be forced to vomit indoors." ...|$|E
2500|$|A new president, Mourad Boudjellal, a born-and-bred Toulonnais {{who made}} his fortune in the comic strip business, promised to build a huge team. He said: [...] "I invented the Top 15, with a team that could be {{competitive}} in the Top 14”. He signed {{a high number of}} first-class players, some of them well above 30, like Jean-Jacques Crenca, Yann Delaigue, Gonzalo Quesada and Dan Luger. He created a lot of buzz around the team as he managed to sign former All Blacks captain Tana Umaga, who arrived in Toulon right {{after the end of the}} Air New Zealand Cup on October 26, 2006. The contract was rumoured to be around €300,000 (£200,000), which Boudjellal claimed to pay from his own pocket, for only 8 to 10 matches. In a 2010 interview, Boudjellal <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> his decision to pursue Umaga, [...] "It was incredible, because we were in the second division and I was speaking with the best player in the world. But he said yes and came to play with Toulon." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1908 the Swiss {{mountain}} dog appeared for {{the first}} time in public. At a show in Langenthal, Switzerland, Franz Schertenleib [...] a breeder of the Berner [...] showed an extraordinarily strong, short-haired Berner Sennenhund. He had seen this dog and bought him as an oddity. He was eager to hear what the Langenthal judge, Professor Heim, <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> this short-haired Berner. Bello vom Schlossgut was beautifully marked, [...] high, sturdy, and with attractive colors. Heim's first look saw the possibility of a new breed of Sennenhunde. He remembered having seen similar dogs in the 1860s in various parts of Switzerland. He said to Schertenleib, [...] "The dog belongs in a different category; he is too gorgeous and thoroughbred to push him aside as a poor example of a Berner. He is an example of the old-time, almost extinct, butcher dog." [...] Heim wrote in his judge’s notes: [...] "Bello is a marvelous, old Sennen (Butcher) hund of the large, almost extinct breed. Had he been entered under [...] "other breeds" [...] I would have recognized him as grossen Sennenhund and awarded him first prize with pleasure. Since he was entered among the Durrbachs, I cannot give this interesting dog more than second prize. This dog is out of place here." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{asked why}} Moses had to account to the Israelites, seeing as God trusted Moses so implicitly that God said in [...] "My servant Moses is not so; he is trusted in all My house." [...] The Midrash {{explained}} that Moses overheard certain Israelites scoffing behind his back, for [...] says, [...] "And they (the Israelites) looked after Moses." [...] The Midrash {{asked what the}} people <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Moses. Rabbi Johanan taught that the people blessed his mother, for she never saw him, as he was always speaking with God and always wholly given over to his service. But Rabbi Hama said {{that they used to}} remark how fat and prosperous Moses looked. When Moses heard this, he vowed to give an account of everything. And this is why [...] says, [...] "These are the accounts of the Tabernacle." [...] Reading [...] "as they were rendered according to the commandment of Moses," [...] the Midrash taught that the Israelites did everything that they did by the command of Moses. And reading the continuation of [...] "through the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest," [...] the Midrash taught that everything that Moses made was done through others. Even though everything was done with witnesses, as soon as the construction of the Tabernacle was completed, Moses wasted no time to promise the people the complete details of all the expenditures involved. Moses then began to expound in [...] "These are the accounts of the Tabernacle," [...] saying how much he had expended on the Tabernacle. While engaged in this calculation, Moses completely forgot about 1,775 shekalim of silver that he had used for hooks for the pillars, and he became uneasy thinking to himself that the Israelites would find grounds to say that Moses took them for himself. So God opened the eyes of Moses to realize that the silver had been converted into hooks for the pillars. When the Israelites saw that the account now completely tallied, they were completely satisfied with the integrity of the work on the Tabernacle. And thus [...] says, [...] "These are the accounts of the Tabernacle," [...] to report that the accounts balanced.|$|E
