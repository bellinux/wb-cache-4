40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to deepen}} knowledge whether caring and learning are an intertwined phenomenon in Dedicated Educational Units (DEU). The context is psychiatric and orthopaedic care, {{and the research}} is based on caring science. The research question <b>is</b> this: <b>What</b> characterizes the relationship between caring and learning in a DEU? This will be illuminated from three perspectives; the student, supervisor and patient perspectives. The question for the student <b>is</b> this: <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> to learn the nursing profession by caring for patients on a DEU? The question for the supervisor <b>is</b> this: <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> to supervise nursing students on a DEU? And the final question is directed at the patient: <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> cared for by nursing students in a DEU?

In any given year, I could be working on a play set in South Africa in the 1970s, a musical based on a very small specific Texas town, and a Musical based on a Hans Christian Andersen fairytale.

5000|$|Arquette has {{appeared}} in both television and screen films. In 1982, she earned an Emmy Award nomination for the TV film The Executioners Song. However, she was unhappy with the films nude scene, remarking {{in an interview that}} the idea of the general public seeing her naked made her feel uncomfortable and exploited, and that most of the offers shed received since demanded that she similarly expose herself. Arquettes first starring role was in John Sayless 1983 film, Baby Its You, a highly regarded but little seen film. She starred in Desperately Seeking Susan (1985) alongside pop singer Madonna, for which she won a British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA) for her [...] "supporting" [...] role despite her clearly being the lead. Madonna was breaking out at the time and though many feel that while Arquettes performance was central to the movies success, Madonna made the movie into a mainstream hit. She had negotiated a deal where she would provide a song for the movie. [...] "Into The Groove" [...] became a huge hit for Madonna as did the movie itself. In an interview at the time, Arquette said [...] "The two questions I hate the most are <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> working with Madonna? and Are you the Rosanna in the song Rosanna?" [...] Following the commercial and critical success of Lawrence Kasdans Silverado in 1985, and the failure of both After Hours and 8 Million Ways to Die, she quit Hollywood to work in Europe where she acted in Luc Bessons The Big Blue (1988).|$|E
5000|$|I {{spent four}} years on and off {{in that part of}} Western Kansas there during the {{research}} for that book and then the film. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like?</b> It was very lonely. And difficult. Although I made a lot of friends there. I had to, otherwise I never could have researched the book properly. The reason was I wanted to make an experiment in journalistic writing, and I was looking for a subject that would have sufficient proportions. I'd already done a great deal of narrative journalistic writing in this experimental vein in the 1950s for The New Yorker... But I was looking for something very special that would give me a lot of scope. I had come up with two or three different subjects and each of them for whatever reasons was a dry run after I'd done a lot of work on them. And one day I was gleaning The New York Times, and way on the back page I saw this very small item. And it just said, [...] "Kansas Farmer Slain. Family of Four Is Slain in Kansas". A little item just about like that. And the community was completely nonplussed, and it was this total mystery of how it could have been, and what happened. And I don't know what it was. I think it was that I knew nothing about Kansas or that part of the country or anything. And I thought, [...] "Well, that will be a fresh perspective for me"... And I said, [...] "Well, I'm just {{going to go out there}} and just look around and see what this is." [...] And so maybe this is the subject I've been looking for. Maybe a crime of this kind is ... in a small town. It has no publicity around it and yet had some strange ordinariness about it. So I went out there, and I arrived just two days after the Clutters' funeral. The whole thing was a complete mystery and was for two and a half months. Nothing happened. I stayed there and kept researching it and researching it and got very friendly with the various authorities and the detectives on the case. But I never knew whether it was going to be interesting or not. You know, I mean anything could have happened. They could have never caught the killers. Or if they had caught the killers ... it may have turned out to be something completely uninteresting to me. Or maybe they would never have spoken to me or wanted to cooperate with me. But as it so happened, they did catch them. In January, the case was solved, and then I made very close contact with these two boys and saw them very often over the next four years until they were executed. But I never knew ... when I was even halfway through the book, when I had been working on it for a year and a half, I didn't honestly know whether I would go on with it or not, whether it would finally evolve itself into something that would be worth all that effort. Because it was a tremendous effort.|$|E
