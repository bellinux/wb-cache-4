From the phase diagram results, two reaction paths were found for the formation of kamacite (1) gamma (taenite) yields alpha (kamacite) + gamma (taenite) and (2) gamma yields gamma + Ph /phosphide, (FeNi) 3 P/ yields alpha + gamma + Ph. The reaction path gamma yields alpha + gamma is preferred at low P contents, while at higher P contents and at Ni contents greater than 7. 0 wt. %, the reaction path gamma yields gamma + Ph yields alpha + gamma + Ph controls the formation of kamacite. Above 7 wt. % Ni, the effect of P on the equilibrium nucleation temperature of kamacite is quite small, less than about plus or minus 30 C with respect to the Fe-Ni binary diagram. The addition of P (greater than 0. 1 wt. %) to meteorites promotes nucleation of kamacite at higher temperatures and effectively lowers the amount of undercooling necessary to nucleate kamacite homogeneously. Ni has just the opposite effect, decreasing the temperature of nucleation and increasing the amount of undercooling. It is concluded that significant amounts of undercooling, 50 to 100 C, are necessary for the nucleation of the <b>Widmanstaetten</b> <b>structure</b> in meteorites, and that chemical equilibrium is maintained in the various phases of slowly cooled iron meteorites to 650 C and probably to 600 C...|$|E
