25|$|In the US, a {{small number}} of {{personal}} injury lawsuits have been filed by individuals against cellphone manufacturers (including Motorola, NEC, Siemens, and Nokia) on the basis of allegations of causation of brain cancer and death. In US federal courts, expert testimony relating to science must be first evaluated by a judge, in a Daubert hearing, to be relevant and valid before it is admissible as evidence. In a 2002 case against Motorola, the plaintiffs alleged that the use of <b>wireless</b> <b>handheld</b> telephones could cause brain cancer and that the use of Motorola phones caused one plaintiff's cancer. The judge ruled that no sufficiently reliable and relevant scientific evidence in support of either general or specific causation was proffered by the plaintiffs, accepted a motion to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs' experts, and denied a motion to exclude the testimony of the defendants' experts.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, CBS {{broadcast}} the tournament with high-definition fixed and handheld wired cameras, {{as well as}} standard-definition <b>wireless</b> <b>handheld</b> cameras. In 2006, a webstream called [...] "Amen Corner Live" [...] began providing coverage of all players passing through holes 11, 12, and 13 through all four rounds. This was the first full tournament multi-hole webcast from a major championship. In 2007, CBS added [...] "Masters Extra," [...] an extra hour of full-field bonus coverage daily on the internet, preceding the television broadcasts. In 2008, CBS added full coverage of holes 15 and 16 live on the web. In 2011, [...] "Masters Extra" [...] was dropped after officials gave ESPN an extra hour each day on Thursday and Friday. In 2016, the Amen Corner feed was broadcast in 4K ultra high definition exclusively on DirecTV—as {{one of the first}} live U.S. sports telecasts in the format. A second channel of 4K coverage covering holes 15 and 16 was added in 2017.|$|E
500|$|Video content {{director}} [...] George Elizando {{and video}} engineer Steven Davis controlled the video surfaces using a Pinnacle i9000 switcher and an expanded Vista Systems Spyder system. Graphics on the LED walls were fed from a custom video playback system that incorporated three Green Hippo media servers; {{some of the}} video content was filmed during rehearsals and were meant for Cyrus to interact with onstage. Visual magnification was executed through the usage of Ikegami Tsushinki HL-45 cameras and multiple strategically located point-of-view cameras, in order to cover the show from every angle. Extensive amounts of teamwork was necessitated {{to set up the}} complex video system at each venue, particularly for weekend daytime performances, as they had less time. Mark Woody, Steve [...] "Bone" [...] Gray, Justin McLean, and Dane Mustola set up the video structures, while Evan Huff and crew chief Eric Geiger built the video thrust into the audience and installed the live cameras. [...] "Thanks to these talented designers a show commensurate with Hannah's popularity has been created", said Paul Becher, co-CEO of Nocturne Productions. For audio, Cyrus used Sennheiser's MD 5235 dynamic capsule atop the SKM 5200 <b>wireless</b> <b>handheld</b> transmitter nightly. Sixteen channels of Sennheiser G2 wireless monitors were programmed to ensure that performers could hear what was being played amidst massive, and fervid screams from the audience. Sennheiser 500 series wireless guitar and bass systems were also used.|$|E

We {{are looking into}} the SIP Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions to provide fast-track interactive and telepresence feedback for text messaging on handhelds {{in an attempt to}} rubberized a hitherto plastic, limited gestured instant messaging conversation. This project implements a multiparty texting service with fast-track instant messaging to be deployed on <b>wireless</b> <b>handhelds</b> on an IEEE 802. 11 b wireless LAN.

Because not all Metro Rail stations have turnstiles, it operates on a proof-of-payment system: as such, Metro's fare inspectors randomly {{check to make sure}} TAP users have validated their card by using a <b>wireless</b> <b>handheld</b> unit.

2500|$|Early {{television}} {{remote controls}} (1956-1977) used ultrasonic tones. [...] Present-day remote controls are commonly consumer infrared devices which send digitally-coded pulses of infrared radiation to control {{functions such as}} power, volume, channels, playback, track change, heat, fan speed, or other features varying from device to device. [...] Remote controls for these devices are usually small <b>wireless</b> <b>handheld</b> objects {{with an array of}} buttons for adjusting various settings such as television channel, track number, and volume. For many devices, the remote control contains all the function controls while the controlled device itself has only a handful of essential primary controls. The remote control code, and thus the required remote control device, is usually specific to a product line, but there are universal remotes, which emulate the remote control made for most major brand devices.|$|E

40|$|General-purpose System-on-Chip {{platforms}} {{consisting of}} configurable components are emerging as an attractive alternative to traditional, customized solutions (e. g., ASICs, custom SoCs), owing to their flexibility, time-to-market advantage, and low engineering costs.

This paper addresses the problem of enabling the use of configurable platforms in domains where custom approaches have traditionally been used. We introduce Dynamic Platform Management, a methodology for customizing a configurable general-purpose platform at run-time, to help bridge the performance and energy efficiency gap with custom approaches. The proposed technique uses a software layer that detects time-varying processing requirements imposed {{by a set of}} applications, and dynamically optimizes architectural parameters and platform components. Dynamic platform management enables superior application performance, more efficient utilization of platform resources, and improved energy efficiency, as compared to a statically optimized platform, without requiring any modifications to the underlying hardware...|$|R
