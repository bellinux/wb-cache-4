5|$|Rachel Larris, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> {{conducted}} an academic study of The Daily Show, disputes {{the findings of}} Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, {{and that it would}} be extremely hard to find a causal link between viewing The Daily Show and thinking or acting in a particular way. Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of The Huffington Post argue that so long as Stewart's comedy is grounded in truth, responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to the political and media figures themselves, not the comedian who satirizes them.|$|E

5|$|The {{academic}} {{debate about}} Anne's birth date focuses on two key dates: 1501 and 1507. Eric Ives, a British historian and legal expert, advocates the 1501 date, while Retha Warnicke, an American scholar <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> written {{a biography of}} Anne, prefers 1507. The key piece of surviving written evidence is a letter Anne wrote sometime in 1514. She wrote it in French to her father, who was still living in England while Anne was completing her education at Mechelen, in the Burgundian Netherlands, now Belgium. Ives argues that {{the style of the}} letter and its mature handwriting prove that Anne must have been about thirteen {{at the time of its}} composition, while Warnicke argues that the numerous misspellings and grammar errors show that the letter was written by a child. In Ives' view, this would also be around the minimum age that a girl could be a maid of honour, as Anne was to the regent, Margaret of Austria. This is supported by claims of a chronicler from the late 16th century, who wrote that Anne was twenty when she returned from France.|$|E
