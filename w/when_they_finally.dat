50|$|The Glaucus and Neptune were {{withdrawn}} from service in 1893 and laid up at Brooklyn, New York, where they remained until July 1906, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were <b>finally</b> towed to Boston for breaking up.|$|R
5|$|Despite this, Andronicus tried {{once more}} to strike a decisive blow back at the Turks, this time hiring Catalan mercenaries. Under the {{guidance}} of Michael IX and the leadership of Roger de Flor, the 6,500-strong Catalan Company {{in the spring and}} summer of 1303 managed to drive back the Turks. The mercenaries' onslaught drove the Turks back from Philadelphia to Cyzicus, in the process causing great destruction to the Anatolian landscape. Once again these gains were thwarted by internal matters. Roger de Flor was assassinated and, in revenge, his company began pillaging the Anatolian countryside. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> left in 1307 to attack Byzantine Thrace, the locals welcomed the Ottomans who once again began blockading key fortresses in Asia Minor.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he shared}} {{interests}} in both philanthropy and military affairs with his father, they eventually had a falling out while Johnston {{served as a}} State Assemblyman, and was bitterly opposed by his father in {{a vote on the}} 1889 World's Fair Bill. The feud became so heated that while Johnston was Mayor of Tivoli, his father, who owned the building where the town government met, barred his son from entering the building. The village government was forced to move to another building and remained there until 1894, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> returned to de Peyster's building. Another incident occurred and was reported in the press when Johnston's mother fell ill, and he visited her at the de Peyster family home and was violently assaulted by his father. The father {{went so far as to}} run against his son for Mayor of Tivoli in 1900, but was defeated in the general election.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola and {{his wife}} Alice {{returned}} to their home in Lugano. For {{the duration of the}} war he was unable to drive; the rationing of petrol meant motor racing was unfeasible. The pain in his leg grew worse, and they went back to the clinic in Bologna to consult a specialist. Surgery was recommended, but Caracciola decided against that option, deterred by the minimum three months it would take to recover from the operation. He spent much of {{the last part of the}} war—from 1941 onwards—attempting to gain possession of the two W165s used at the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix, with a view to maintaining them for the duration of the hostilities. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> arrived in Switzerland in early 1945, they were confiscated as German property by the Swiss authorities.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 10 April, leading {{elements}} of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. Bad roads and freezing rain slowed the Austrian advance in the first week, but the opposing Bavarian forces gradually retreated. The Austrian attack occurred about a week before Napoleon's anticipations, and in his absence Berthier's role became all the more critical. Berthier (whose fortè was staff work) {{proved to be an}} insufficient field commander, a characteristic made worse by the fact that several messages from Paris were being delayed and misinterpreted <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> arrived at headquarters. Whereas Napoleon had written to Berthier that an Austrian attack before 15 April should be met by a general French concentration around Donauwörth and Augsburg, Berthier focused on a sentence that called for Davout to station his III Corps around Regensburg and ordered the Iron Marshal to move back to the city despite massive Austrian pressure.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{homicide}} department is requiring all the detectives to take sensitivity training with therapist Carry Westin (Jennifer Mendenhall). While {{most of them}} have positive experiences with her, Bolander (Ned Beatty) flatly refuses to participate and repeatedly avoids their scheduled sessions. When Gee (Yaphet Kotto) tells Bolander he will be suspended without pay if he does not meet with her, Bolander chooses the suspension, but later reconsiders after his partner Munch (Richard Belzer) harasses him at the bar until he changes his mind. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> meet, Bolander explains he does not trust therapists because when going through marriage counseling with his ex-wife, the therapist actively encouraged her to leave Bolander. He feels he was cheated out of $7,000 in therapy bills, but Westin explains his anger is not from the money, but from feelings of betrayal by his ex-wife. Bolander is ultimately impressed by Westin and even decides to ask her on a date, but she strongly hints she is a lesbian.|$|E
5|$|Thea goes on an {{inflatable}} banana boat {{with her friend}} Margaret and her mother, while Carla presents her new art sculpture. The shark goes for Thea but attacks and kills Margaret's mother instead. Ellen boards Jake's boat {{to track down the}} shark, intending to kill it to save the rest of her family. After hearing about what happened, Mike confesses about the shark, infuriating Carla. Mike and Jake are flown by Hoagie to search for Ellen, and they find the shark in pursuit of their boat. During the search, Hoagie explains to Mike about Ellen's belief that the shark that killed Sean is after her family. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> find her, Hoagie lands the plane on the water, ordering Mike and Jake to swim to the boat as the shark drags the plane and Hoagie underwater.|$|E
5000|$|... "Hoy" [...] & [...] "Corazones Puro" [...] {{were the}} first two songs {{to come out of}} the album as singles, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were <b>finally</b> released, <b>they</b> came out with a new mix and a new sound.|$|R

5|$|The common {{ancestor}} of all present gnathostomes (jawed-vertebrates) lived in freshwater, and later migrated {{back to the}} sea. To deal with the much higher salinity in sea water, they evolved the ability to turn the nitrogen waste product ammonia into harmless urea, storing it in the body to give the blood the same osmolarity as the sea water without poisoning the organism. This is the system currently found in cartilaginous fishes. Ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) later returned to freshwater and lost this ability, while the fleshy-finned fishes (Sarcopterygii) retained it. Since the blood of ray-finned fishes contains more salt than freshwater, they could simply get rid of ammonia through their gills. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> returned to the sea again, they did not recover their old trick of turning ammonia to urea, {{and they had to}} evolve salt excreting glands instead. Lungfishes do the same when they are living in water, making ammonia and no urea, but when the water dries up and they are forced to burrow down in the mud, they switch to urea production. Like cartilaginous fishes, the coelacanth can store urea in its blood, as can the only known amphibians that can live {{for long periods of time}} in salt water (the toad Bufo marinus and the frog Rana cancrivora). These are traits they have inherited from their ancestors.|$|E

Some of the rally participants went to the Pudu police station to support those who were detained.|$|E
25|$|The militia regrouped at Fort Blue Mounds {{and picked}} up Black Hawk's trail again on 28 July near Spring Green, Wisconsin. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> {{caught up with the}} British Band, it would lead to the decisive clash of the war at Bad Axe. At the mouth of the Bad Axe River, {{hundreds}} of men, women and children would be killed by pursuing soldiers, their Indian allies, and a U.S. gunboat.|$|E

The new boat carried them to New Orleans based upon the original contract with Offutt.|$|E

25|$|Different venom {{compositions}} {{have evolved}} to serve different roles. Parachartergus fraternus venom is also often sprayed on new nest sites before the nest is built. This venom has an intense smell and can even cause an allergic reaction {{in the eyes and}} nose of humans. This venom is sprayed on the nest to alert other wasps to the new nest site. The potent smell attracts the wasps that may have lost their way along the emigration route. This venom is sprayed by the foragers <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> decide on a new nest site.|$|E
