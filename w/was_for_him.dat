He had often spoken to friends about how {{important}} it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to get travelers to their destinations on time and how proud he was of USAir's on-time record. All the same, he was also portrayed as a by-the-book, cautious pilot.|$|E
5|$|Two new {{characters}} {{were introduced in}} this episode. The first, Nelson Muntz, remains a frequently used recurring character, while the second, Herman, has been used far less. The design of Herman, {{with the exception of}} his missing arm, was inspired by writer John Swartzwelder. His voice, as performed by Harry Shearer, was partly inspired by George H. W. Bush. The original idea for Herman <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to have a differing story for the loss of his arm with every appearance.|$|E

5|$|As a {{character}} introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long's weapon, {{a pair of}} nunchaku with mounted blades, were selected before {{other elements of the}} character. One of several weapons initially considered for the character Hwang early in development, they were designed to be unique amongst the other weapons in the game. Li Long's design and concept were built to revolve around them, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. After his appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, his character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on him, and then animated by a motion designer using motion capture to create his in-game movements. During development, many ideas were considered for Li Long's appearance, including several younger drafts. Another idea considered <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to fight using kung fu, instead of solely with his nunchaku.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1987 Cleveland Browns season, Junkin was {{projected}} to be the starting outside linebacker opposite Clay Matthews, Jr. despite playing inside linebacker in college, which generated criticism around the league as a transition that {{would be difficult for}} him to make. After a 16-day , the Browns and Junkin agreed to a four-year deal worth nearly two million dollars. After missing the first preseason game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he made his debut against the New York Giants. In that game, he played the second half and failed to record a tackle. By the end of training camp, due to struggles learning the outside linebacker position, he made the roster, but lost the starting job to Anthony Griggs. After the Browns moved to a 4-3 defense for the second game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Junkin made his debut, and the plan <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to gradually see more playing time each week. In early November, due to a combination of a players' strike and an injured wrist, Junkin was placed on the injured reserve list and replaced on the active roster by David Grayson.|$|E

The minister-general replied that the only way for Lagun Ein to escape the execution <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to assassinate Minkhaung. Lagun Ein reluctantly accepted the offer.

In 1792, his secret dealings with the king were uncovered, and in 1794 his remains {{were removed from the}} Panthéon and were replaced with those of Jean-Paul Marat. His remains were then buried anonymously in the graveyard of Clamart. In spite of searches performed in 1889, they were not found.|$|E
25|$|Although the Cornish {{language}} had effectively {{died out}} by the early nineteenth century, dialects and accents remained strong throughout the whole of Cornwall.

It was more common for a miner, seeking work to travel {{from his home in}} West Cornwall to South Africa, than it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to travel to the Tamar Valley, or other mining locations within Cornwall. The communications with developing mining towns in the British Empire were better than they were within the county.|$|E

25|$|According to Ağca, {{the plan}} <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and the back-up gunman Oral Çelik to open fire in St. Peter's Square and {{escape to the}} Bulgarian embassy {{under the cover of}} the panic {{generated}} by a small explosion. On 13 May they sat in the square, writing postcards and waiting for the Pope to arrive. When the Pope passed them, Ağca fired several shots and wounded him, but was grabbed by spectators and Vatican security chief Camillo Cibin and prevented from finishing the assassination or escaping. Four bullets hit John Paul II, two of them lodging in his lower intestine, the others hitting his left hand and right arm. Two bystanders were also hit. Çelik panicked and fled without setting off his bomb or opening fire. The Pope survived the assassination attempt.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in August 1980 Ağca, {{under the}} alias of Vilperi, began {{criss-crossing}} the Mediterranean region, changing passports and identities, perhaps {{to hide his}} point of origin in Sofia, Bulgaria. He entered Rome on 10 May 1981, coming by train from Milan. According to Ağca's later testimony, he met with three accomplices in Rome, one a fellow Turk and two Bulgarians, with operation being commanded by Zilo Vassilev, the Bulgarian military attaché in Italy. He {{said that he was}} assigned this mission by Turkish mafioso Bekir Çelenk in Bulgaria. According to Ağca, the plan <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and the back-up gunman Oral Çelik to open fire on the pope in St. Peter's Square and escape to the Bulgarian embassy under the cover of the panic generated by a small explosion.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in mid-1908, Mary had {{an affair}} with Gilbert Cannan (who was twenty years younger than her and an {{associate}} of Barrie's in his anti-censorship activities), including a visit together to Black Lake Cottage, known only to the house staff. When Barrie learned of the affair in July 1909, he demanded that she end it, but she refused. To avoid the scandal of divorce, he offered a legal separation if she would agree not to see Cannan any more, but she still refused. Barrie sued for divorce on the grounds of infidelity– the divorce was granted in October 1909. Knowing how painful the divorce <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> some of Barrie's friends wrote to a number of newspaper editors asking them not to publish the story. In the event, only three newspapers did. Barrie continued to support Mary financially even after she married Cannan, by giving her an annual allowance which was handed over at a private dinner held on her and Barrie's wedding anniversary.|$|E

25|$|It {{concludes that}} Debye's actions in 1933–45 {{were based on}} the nineteenth-century positivist view of science which saw {{research}} in physics as generating blessings for humankind. The report states that, by his contemporaries, Debye was considered an opportunist by some and as a man of highest character by others. The report asserts that Debye was not coerced by the Nazis into writing the infamous DPG Heil Hitler letter and that he also did not follow the lead of other societies in doing so but, rather, other societies followed his lead. The NIOD report also concludes that Debye felt obliged to send the letter and that it <b>was,</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> simply a confirmation of an existing situation. The report argues that Debye, in the Third Reich, developed a survival method of ambiguity which allowed him to pursue his scientific career despite the political turmoil. Crucial to this survival method was the need to keep ready an escape hatch, for example in his secret dealings with the Nazis in 1941, if needed.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, on April 30, 1936, Carothers {{was elected}} to the National Academy of Sciences, a very high honor. Carothers was the first {{industrial}} organic chemist to receive this honor. Yet by June 1936, in spite of this honor which validated his contributions to science, Carothers could not shake the depression that prevented him from working. In early June he was admitted involuntarily to the Philadelphia Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital, a prestigious mental hospital, where his psychiatrist was Dr. Kenneth Appel. One month later he was given permission to leave the institute to go hiking in the Tyrolean Alps with friends. The plan <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to day hike with Dr. Roger Adams and Dr. John Flack for two weeks. After they left, he stayed on, hiking by himself, without sending word to anyone, even his wife. On September 14, he suddenly appeared at her desk at the Experimental Station. From that point on Carothers was not expected to perform any real work at the Experimental Station. He would often go in and visit. He began living in Whiskey Acres again, after his wife had agreed with Dr. Appel that she was not strong enough to watch over Carothers.|$|E

The plan, apparently, <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to be shipped from London to Rotterdam via Batavier II.
