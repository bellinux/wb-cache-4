500|$|Despite the {{criticism}} the LP received {{at the time}} of its release, the remastered CD issued 21 years later was generally well received. In the 2004 Recommended Records catalogue, Cutler wrote that the album had [...] "raised eyebrows at the time (from, as Fred calls them 'progressive music snobs'—of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I was one) for its apparent simplicity and departure from what was then thought of as Fred Style." [...] René van Peer of Leonardo Digital Reviews admitted in 2005 that he was [...] "one of those snobs" [...] and wrote [...] "I am astonished and embarrassed to find how little I grasped back then of what Frith had put into it." [...] Looking at Frith's projects after Cheap at Half the Price made it clear that what he did on the album was not a departure from his musical experiments, as people saw it at the time, but rather a part of it. Van Peer said (in retrospect) that Cheap at Half the Price [...] "bursts with inventiveness, and eradiates [...] the irrepressible joy of playful creativity".|$|E
500|$|Lisa Mahapatra from The New Indian Express was {{impressed}} with the story and Tripathi's writing and praised [...] "the interactions between Shiva and Sati, [...] intriguing. Age-old thoughts and philosophies were delivered in a very modern context, which I thought made for an interesting juxtaposition." [...] Mahapatra added that [...] "the only downside throughout the novel, I was unable to really get into the main characters—they remained mostly on a two-dimensional level." [...] It received a mixed review from Hindustan Times, where the reviewer was critical of Tripathi's usage of common, everyday language. [...] "There are many other subtle depictions of Lord Ram and other characters and overall its very well written. I wrote to Amish to express one small observation, the script writing is not that sharp. You have words like 'Goddamnit', 'bloody hell', 'In the name of God what is this nonsense?' etc, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> would be great for an Indian audience but after you just finish a Steven Erikson novel you find it falling a little flat," [...] the reviewer concluded.|$|E
500|$|The TPF {{formed a}} phalanx and {{attempted}} to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd cheered, started impromptu kick lines, and sang {{to the tune of}} Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay: [...] "We are the Stonewall girls/ We wear our hair in curls/ We don't wear underwear/ We show our pubic hair." [...] Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: [...] "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery {{in the form of a}} chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay powerites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue." [...] One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, [...] "The police rushed us, and that's when I realized this is not a good thing to do, because they got me in the back with a nightstick." [...] Another account stated, [...] "I just can't ever get that one sight out of my mind. The cops with the [...] and the kick line on the other side. It was the most amazing thing... And all the sudden that kick line, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> was a spoof on the machismo... I think that's when I felt rage. Because people were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line." ...|$|E
6000|$|I nearly {{cried out}} in my joy. Here was communication! Here was companionship! I listened eagerly, and the nearer tapping, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> must be Ed Morrell's, replied: ...|$|R
6000|$|Then another next to it, {{which might}} have been [...] "L," [...] or might have been [...] "J." [...] Then a last letter, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> to be [...] "P." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, Mr. Case,” said I, “you’ve {{frightened me}} once, but I defy you to frighten me again,” I says, and slipped down the tree, {{and set out}} again to find my enemy’s head office, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> would not be far away.|$|R
2500|$|Even {{though the}} group's name {{includes}} Finland's capital Helsinki, they first played {{there at the}} Flow Festival in August 2007: [...] "When we were in Norway {{at the end of}} last year there were a few Finnish interviewers who came to interview us mainly about the name. I think they were quite perplexed. To us, the name means having to answer many questions and inquiries about the name, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> is entirely understandable." [...] Sam Perry said.|$|E
2500|$|Adele {{revealed}} {{that she was}} struggling emotionally when she composed it: [...] "When I was writing it I was feeling pretty miserable and pretty lonely, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> kind of contradicts 'Rolling in the Deep'. Whereas that was about me saying, 'I'm {{going to be fine}} without you', this is me on my knees really." [...] She discussed further the inspiration of the song: [...] "I can imagine being about 40 and looking for him again, only to turn up and find that he's settled with a beautiful wife and beautiful kids and he's completely happy... and I'm still on my own. The song's about that and I'm scared at the thought of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} categorisation, Isis have been {{described}} as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing – what Turner describes as [...] "guitar theatrics." [...] However, post-rock has what is essentially a [...] sound: one devoid of aggressive vocals and distorted guitars. Isis, however, have hardcore/sludge origins (especially in their pre-Celestial era) and hardcore-like vocals. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, sludge, ambient music, and post-rock; yet none of these labels defines their sound fully. Critic Dan Epstein notes that [...] "though [...] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that [...] "if I wanna listen to emotional music <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that – something that is [...] emotional, powerful music." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have brought}} their bread with them," [...] the colonel said, [...] "and our friends here have {{provided}} a deer almost as fine as that which carried off the twelve bullets. It was roasting over {{a fire in the}} forest when we went past, and I saw some black bottles <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> were vodka." ...|$|R

2500|$|Bickers and Chadwick seemed {{confident}} that age, perspective and situation {{meant that they}} could avoid the problems which had divided the band in 1990. Interviewed {{at the time of}} the release of Days Run Away, Chadwick admitted acceptance of the fact that [...] "we're really different people. It's a very complex kind of friendship, and I think it'll always be slightly fractious. We don't have this huge buddy thing going on though at the same time it's very intimate... We've always had a very instinctive way of communicating with each other, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> is why we make good music together." [...] Bickers in turn reflected [...] "I think we're both old enough and ugly enough to address any issues head-on and keep our tempers in check. We're also doing things at our own pace rather than letting a record company dictate what we do, which helps... It's still early days but communication is good and so is the music. This is about letting bygones be bygones and just getting on with it. Personally, I've never been happier." ...|$|E

5000|$|Clarkson had a {{wide variety}} of curve balls and was {{considered}} to be a calculating, scientific pitcher who carefully analyzed every hitter's weaknesses. Hall of Fame hitter Sam Thompson said of Clarkson: [...] "I faced him in scores of games and I can truthfully say that never in all that time did I get a pitch that came where I expected it or in the way in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> it was coming." ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{men were}} posted well enough, behind a small enclosure, {{with a narrow}} lane in their front. And my lord had caused his dragoons {{to be placed in}} the front to line the hedges; and in this posture he stood viewing the enemy at a distance. The Scots, who had some {{intelligence}} of our coming, drew out three small parties, and sent them by different ways to observe our number; and, forming a fourth party, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> to be about 600 horse, advanced {{to the top of the}} plain, and drew up to face us, but never offered to attack us.|$|R
60|$|Moreover, in what I {{will call}} the arena, stood a temple that in its main outlines, {{although}} small, exactly resembled those still {{to be seen in}} Egypt. There was the gateway or pylon; there the open outer court with columns round it supporting roofed cloisters, which, as we ascertained afterwards, were used as dwelling-places by the priests. There beyond and connected with the first by a short passage was a second rather smaller court, also open to the sky, and beyond this again, built like {{all the rest of the}} temple of lava blocks, a roofed erection measuring about twelve feet square, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> at once must be the sanctuary.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] said Martin. [...] "If I help, I'll make a proposition, to <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you'll {{be able to}} agree. In the meantime, we can let it go. Looks as if you'd {{make good}} anyhow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{they were}} undoing the gate, the light fell on a {{coil of rope}} they had set down there, and a bag <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> had copper of some kind in it. They have done us cleverly, the young villains! There was not noise enough to wake a cat. They must have had every bolt and hinge well oiled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it's {{possible}} {{that she could}} find one or two for you. But {{we have to face}} the situation. It seems that you love my daughter, and there is reason for believing that she is fond of you. Now, Ida has been accustomed to every luxury, and the only thing you count on is a share in the Grenfell mine, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you will admit may go under at any time. What do you propose to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} morning I awoke, as a good hunter always should do, just at that time when, on looking out of the wagon, nothing can be seen but a little grey glint of light which he knows is reflected from the horns of the cattle tied to the trek-tow. Presently, however, I saw another glint of light <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> came from the spear of Saduko, who was seated by {{the ashes of the}} cooking fire wrapped in his kaross of wildcat skins. Slipping from the voorkisse, or driving-box, I came behind him softly and touched him on the shoulder. He leapt up with a start which revealed his nervous nature, then recognising me through the soft grey gloom, said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘And {{perhaps it}} is just then that I could step in,’ {{returned}} the lawyer. ‘Suppose by some contingency, at <b>which</b> <b>I</b> make no <b>guess,</b> and on <b>which</b> <b>I</b> offer no opinion—’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In a word, then," [...] said Morton, [...] "you have exercised, {{by means}} at <b>which</b> <b>I</b> can <b>guess,</b> a secret, but most prejudicial, {{influence}} over the fortunes of Lady Margaret Bellenden and her granddaughter, and in favour of that base, oppressive apostate, Basil Olifant, whom the law, deceived by thy operations, has placed in possession of their lawful property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now this {{finishes}} the lessons about the land animals or mammals. There are other mammals {{who live in}} the ocean, which is the salt water which surrounds the land, and <b>which,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> none of you have ever seen. Some of these come on shore and some never do. To-morrow I will tell you just a little about them, so that you will know something about all the animals of this great country which is called North America. That is, I will if you want me to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{returned}} Nares, {{with the}} same unamiable reserve, [...] "for a reason, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you know, the cruise may suit me: but there's a point or two to settle. We shall have to talk, Mr. Pinkerton. But whether I go or not, somebody will. There's no sense in losing time; and you might give Mr. Johnson a note, let him take the hands right down, and set to to overhaul the rigging. The beasts look sober," [...] he added, {{with an air of}} great disgust, [...] "and need putting to work to keep them so." ...|$|E
6000|$|That was {{the first}} time I ever waited upon those two, but it wasn't to be the last by many a long chalk, as you'll see. He often used to bring her in after that. Who she was and what she was he didn't know, and she didn't know, so there was a pair of them. She'd run away from an old woman down Limehouse way, who used to beat her. That was all she could tell him. He got her a lodging with an old woman, who had an attic in the same house where he slept--when it would run to that--taught her to yell [...] "Speshul!" [...] and found a corner for her. There ain't room for boys and girls in the Mile-End Road. They're either kids down there or they're grown-ups. [...] "Kipper" [...] and [...] "Carrots"--as we named her--looked upon {{themselves}} as sweethearts, though he couldn't have been more than fifteen, and she barely twelve; and that he was regular gone on her anyone could see with half an eye. Not that he was soft about it--that wasn't his style. He kept her in order, and she had just to mind, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> was a good thing for her, and when she wanted it he'd use his hand on her, and make no bones about it. That's the way among that class. They up and give the old woman a friendly clump, just as you or me would swear at the missus, or fling a boot-jack at her. They don't mean anything more.|$|E
6000|$|To the north, however, it {{did come}} to an end, for there, as I judged fifty or sixty miles away, rose the grim outline {{of what looked like}} a huge fortress, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> knew must be one of those {{extraordinary}} mountain formations, probably owing their origin to volcanic action, that are to be met with here and there in the vast expanses of Central and Eastern Africa. Being so distant it was impossible to estimate its size, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> must be enormous, but in looking at it I bethought me of that great mountain in which Zikali said the marvellous white Queen lived, and wondered whether it could be the same, as from my memory of his map upon the ashes, it well might be, that is, if such a place existed at all. If so the map had shown it as surrounded by swamps and--well, surely that mist hid the face of a mighty swamp? ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{sank down}} upon the couch as though {{exhausted}} by emotion, of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> could only <b>guess</b> the reasons, hiding {{her face in her}} hands. Presently she let them fall again and continued, ...|$|R
5000|$|Luani {{began his}} American {{football}} {{career as a}} defensive back for the Faga'itua Vikings, representing Faga'itua High School and wearing the number 21 jersey for the team. Competent in both association and American football, Luani has stated [...] "I am keen to keep playing both at the moment because I am not sure which one will be my best option for the future. I {{would like to make}} a career in one but <b>I</b> don’t know <b>which</b> yet, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> will find out later on." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "This is {{probably}} my favourite {{song on the}} album at the moment {{but it was a}} total headfuck to record. Sometimes when I cant get a song right I just leave it for ages and go back to it eventually. Thats what I did with this song for like six months. Eventually we got it to a place where I was cool with it and its coming out as the next single. I actually directed the video clip for it as well, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> means Ive ascended to a new level of control freak wanker-ness." ...|$|E

5000|$|... (voiced by Jess Harnell) - Grim is a warlock and Hildy's husband. In [...] "The Jollywood Jam", it is {{revealed}} that Grim's great-great-great-grandfather was a warlock who {{was defeated by}} the Founders of Jollywood. Harnell describes him as [...] "a bad-at-being-bad guy". Regarding {{his role as a}} Disney villain, he said that [...] "there's a fine line — especially in 7D, which is a broad comedy — because you don't want to scare little kids". He said [...] "Grim is so awesome because he's totally stupid but he's got a really good heart. He's actually not a bad guy, he's just {{trying to keep up with}} his wife, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> a lot of us can relate to".|$|E
60|$|On we trekked, our road still sloping {{slightly}} down hill, till {{at length}} we saw far away a vast sea of bush-veld <b>which,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> correctly, must fringe the great Zambesi River. Moreover we, or rather Hans, whose eyes {{were those of}} a hawk, saw something else, namely buildings of {{a more or less}} civilised kind, which stood among trees by the side of a stream several miles {{on this side of the}} great belt of bush.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} a thick-headed idiot!" [...] Wolfenden exclaimed. [...] "There have been heaps of things from <b>which</b> <b>I</b> might have <b>guessed</b> {{something}} near the truth, at any rate. What a fool she must have thought me!" ...|$|R
60|$|The fog lay thick {{upon the}} Channel, but all inland {{was very clear}} and bright. Along the coast the country was dreary and marshy, but {{at the other side}} a goodly extent of fertile plain lay before me, well tilled and cared for. A range of lofty hills, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> to be the Mendips, bordered the whole skyline, and further north there lay a second chain in the blue distance. The {{glittering}} Avon wound its way over the country-side like a silver snake in a flower-bed. Close to its mouth, and not more than two leagues from where I stood, rose the spires and towers of stately Bristol, the Queen of the West, which was and still may be the second city in the kingdom. The forests of masts which shot up like a pinegrove above the roofs of the houses bore witness to the great trade both with Ireland and with the Plantations which had built up so flourishing a city.|$|R
