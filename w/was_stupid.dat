This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said {{he wished he had}} made the call on the evening of the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E

He <b>was</b> <b>stupid.</b> He was told to keep away. He grabbed Pete (i.e.Peter Walker) and hit him with an iron bar. He caused his own death. I didn't want to shoot him. I could have shot a lot more.|$|E

Callum's guard, Jack, delivers a letter, written by Callum before he died, {{saying that he}} never loved her and {{could not believe that}} she <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> enough to fall for him. Meggie tries to make Sephy believe that Callum was forced to write the letter {{by the rest of the}} gang, but the letter is so hurtful that Sephy believes it and becomes full of postnatal depression. She meets Jaxon, a hot-tempered man with a band, the Midges. He offers Sephy a singing part, but the noughts are prejudiced against her because she is a cross. She begins to neglect Callie Rose.|$|E
25|$|Just over a {{year after}} signing with the WWF, the Legion of Doom won the WWF World Tag Team Titles from The Nasty Boys at SummerSlam 1991 and held them for about six months. When they lost the titles in February 1992 they were briefly taken off television, only to return with long-time manager Paul Ellering by their side, {{as well as a}} wooden dummy called “Rocco”. Both members of the L.O.D. thought the gimmick <b>was</b> <b>stupid,</b> as did most of the fans and it led to Hawk quitting the WWF, leaving Animal on his own {{for the first time in}} 9 years. When Animal {{suffered}} a severe back injury a short while later, everyone thought it was the end of the legendary team.|$|E

What a Lovely War' to 'Blackadder Goes Forth,' the criminal idiocy of the British High Command has become an article of faith." ...|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{censorship}} {{issues with}} Cannibal Holocaust concern the on-screen killings of animals. Deodato himself has condemned his past actions, saying [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> to introduce animals." [...] Although six animal deaths appear onscreen, seven animals were killed for the production, as the scene depicting the monkey's death was shot twice, {{resulting in the}} death of two monkeys. Both of the animals were eaten by indigenous cast members, who consider monkey brains a delicacy. The animals that were killed onscreen were: ...|$|E

It was a good thing that the Nip air commander <b>was</b> <b>stupid.</b> Those hundred airplanes would have made our job awfully hard if they had taken part in the big fight over the convoy on March 3rd." ...|$|E
500|$|Following an eleven-year hiatus {{producers}} asked Dennis {{to return}} to Neighbours for the 20th anniversary episodes. But their talks resulted in Dennis agreeing to return full-time. Alan Dale who played his on-screen father, Jim Robinson helped Dennis {{to make the decision}} to return. Dennis has since admitted that he made a mistake quitting Neighbours in 1992. He explained [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>stupid.</b> I thought I {{was going to go to}} Hollywood and conquer the world, and I didn't." [...] Dennis' return made Paul the only original character still appearing on Neighbours. The actor continued to publicise his commitment to staying on the show long-term.|$|E

500|$|... 15 illustrators {{responded to}} the letter; three {{declined}} to participate, one {{did not know how}} to contribute to what he called a vague project, one thought the project <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> and badly paid, and one said he was afraid. 12 drawings had been submittedthree from newspaper employees and two which did not directly show Muhammad. The editors thought that some of the illustrators who had not responded were employed by other newspapers and were thus contractually prohibited from working for Jyllands-Posten. In the end, editor-in-chief Carsten Juste decided that given its inconclusive results, the story was better suited as an opinion piece rather than a news story, and it was decided to publish it in the culture section, entirely under the direction of editor Flemming Rose.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a slight}} {{difference}} in lyrics between the version used in [...] version and the one released on Shades of Purple. The Shades of Purple version includes the line [...] "then you start kissing me, what's that about?" [...] In the Pokémon version, the lyric is [...] "then you said you love me, what's that about?" [...] When asked about the lyric change in an interview, M2M replied [...] "the Pokémon people didn't find it appropriate to have kissing in the lyrics, because it was for younger kids. We think [...] <b>was</b> <b>stupid.</b> The original version is on , and that's the one {{we wanted to go}} with."

500|$|After {{consulting}} with his lawyers in October 2005, Stollery {{responded to the}} Church with a far more aggressive stance. Now believing the accusation to be completely frivolous, Stollery publicly refused, challenging the Church with: [...] "I'm keeping my domain, see you in court." [...] Again {{in an interview with}} ONE News, Stollery reiterated {{that he was going to}} retain rights to [...] "ScienTOMogy", and not transfer the URL to the Church of Scientology, as they had requested. After the media attention, Stollery said he began to receive [...] "annoying calls" [...] from local Scientologists. [...] "The first few I <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> enough to answer, but now they just call and call and call. When I did speak to 'a church member here in Auckland' he kept insisting over and over that we meet to talk about my 'vendetta' with the church." ...|$|E

However, he praised the work of the marshals who had assisted to recover the cars involved. He also believed that Zonta had [...] "over-estimated his ability" [...] and said he would have a [...] "quiet word" [...] with the latter. Zonta believed that the incident was not his fault and that Michael Schumacher braked harder than him, but apologised for his retirement from the race. Fisichella also agreed that the race should have been stopped, saying, [...] "Three of the protagonists are out and it <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> not to red flag." [...] Benetton Technical Director Pat Symonds was highly critical of the driver's actions as he believed Benetton lost valuable points towards the Constructors' Championship. [...] "The driving antics of some of our competitors at the first corner were appalling and ruined the race not only for many of the drivers but also for many of the spectators" [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Returning to the West End, Gielgud {{starred in}} JBPriestley's The Good Companions, adapted {{for the stage}} by the author and Edward Knoblock. The {{production}} ran from May 1931 for 331 performances, and Gielgud described it as his first real taste of commercial success. He played Inigo Jollifant, a young schoolmaster who abandons teaching to join a travelling theatre troupe. This crowd-pleaser drew disapproval from the more austere reviewers, who felt Gielgud should be doing something more demanding, but he found playing a conventional juvenile lead had challenges of its own and helped him improve his technique. During {{the run of the}} play he made another film, Insult (1932), a melodrama about the French Foreign Legion, and he starred in a cinema version of The Good Companions in 1933, with Jessie Matthews. A letter to a friend reveals Gielgud's view of film acting: [...] "There is talk of my doing Inigo in the film of The Good Companions, which appals my soul but appeals to my pocket." [...] In his first volume of memoirs, published in 1939, Gielgud devoted two pages to describing the things about filming that he detested. Unlike his contemporaries Richardson and Laurence Olivier, he made few films until after the Second World War, and did not establish himself as a prominent film actor until many years after that. As he put it in 1994, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> enough to toss my head and stick to the stage while watching Larry and Ralph sign lucrative Korda contracts." ...|$|E
500|$|During his childhood, and {{owing to}} his {{considerable}} strength and bulk, Steiger {{became known as}} [...] "The Rock". Despite being mocked over his mother's alcoholism, he was a popular figure at school and an able softball player. He displayed an interest in writing poetry and acting during his adolescent years, and appeared in several school plays while at West Side High School in Newark. Tired of fighting with his mother, he {{ran away from home}} at age sixteen to join the United States Navy during World War II. [...] He enlisted on May 11, 1942, and received his training at the U.S. Naval Training Station in Newport, Rhode Island. He joined the newly commissioned USS Taussig (DD-746) on May 20, 1944. While serving as a torpedoman on destroyers, he saw action in the South Pacific, including the Battle of Iwo Jima. Steiger later commented: [...] "I loved the Navy. I <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> enough to think I was being heroic". His experiences during the war haunted him {{for the rest of his}} life, particularly the loss of Americans during the Battle of Iwo Jima, as well as the sinking of vessels by the Taussig which were known to have women and children aboard. On December 17, 1944, off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines, Steiger and the Taussig encountered a severe typhoon, which became known as Halsey's Typhoon, with winds reaching one hundred knots (115mph) and [...] waves. As a result, three U.S. destroyers were lost, but the Taussig survived, with Steiger tying a rope to himself on deck and flattening himself as waves engulfed the ship.|$|E

Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine noted that [...] "there's {{a core of}} unimpeachably classic work on Homework, hidden among the merely good, and when you've got such a classic debut hidden in {{the outlines of the}} epic slouch of their debut, it's hard not to get frustrated." [...] Rolling Stone awarded the album three stars out of five, commenting that [...] "the duo's essential, career-defining insight is that the problem with disco the first time around was not that it <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> but that it was not stupid enough." [...] Rolling Stone ranked Homework at the top on their list of [...] "The 30 Greatest EDM Albums of All Time" [...] while affirming that Daft Punk's debut [...] "is pure synapse-tweaking brilliance." [...] According to Scott Woods of The Village Voice, [...] "Daft Punk [...] the lid off the [...] sewer" [...] with the release of Homework. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork awarded it 7.6 out of 10. He stated that [...] "Homework provides sixteen whole tracks of modern-day boom box bass n' drum and unlike your science project, it doesn't require a lot of intricate calculations to figure out how it works." [...] In his view, [...] "It sounds like an Atari 2600 on a killing spree." [...] By contrast, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited [...] "Da Funk" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money". Darren Gawle from Drop-D Magazine also gave a negative review, stating that [...] "Homework is the work of a couple of DJs who sound amateurish at best." ...|$|E
