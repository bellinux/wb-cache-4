5|$|Einstein was a figurehead {{leader in}} helping {{establish}} the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, {{which opened in}} 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he {{was asked by the}} biochemist and president of the <b>World</b> <b>Zionist</b> <b>Organization,</b> Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university.

5|$|Following {{the change}} in government, Sykes was {{promoted}} into the War Cabinet Secretariat with responsibility for Middle Eastern affairs. In January 1917, despite having previously built a relationship with Moses Gaster, he began looking to meet other Zionist leaders; {{by the end of}} the month he had been introduced to Weizmann and his associate Nahum Sokolow, a journalist and executive of the <b>World</b> <b>Zionist</b> <b>Organization</b> who had moved to Britain at the beginning of the war.|$|E
5|$|Avi Shlaim, Emeritus Professor of International Relations in the University of Oxford, {{asserts that}} two main {{schools of thought}} have been {{developed}} {{on the question of}} the primary driving force behind the declaration, one presented in 1961 by Leonard Stein, a lawyer and former political secretary to the <b>World</b> <b>Zionist</b> <b>Organization,</b> and the other in 1970 by Mayir Vereté, then Professor of Israeli History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Shlaim states that Stein does not reach any clear cut conclusions, but that implicit in his narrative is that the declaration resulted primarily from the activity and skill of the Zionists, whereas according to Vereté, it was the work of hard-headed pragmatists motivated by British imperial interests in the Middle East. Much of modern scholarship on the decision to issue the declaration focuses on the Zionist movement and rivalries within it, with a key debate being whether the role of Weizmann was decisive or whether the British were likely to have issued a similar declaration in any event. Danny Gutwein, Professor of Jewish History at the University of Haifa, proposes a twist on an old idea, asserting that Sykes's February 1917 approach to the Zionists was the defining moment, and that it was consistent with the pursuit of the government’s wider agenda to partition the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5000|$|Louis later moved {{south to}} Cape Town {{where he would}} meet his wife, Jane Miller. Like Johns fathers family, his mothers family also {{migrated}} to South Africa from Lithuania in the early 1900s. Jane was born just outside Cape Town where her father worked as a small trader. Jane and Louis met during WWII in Cape Town. John recalls with admiration, [...] "My mother is an extraordinary brilliant woman who ought to have gone to college but never did" [...] (John Comaroff, personal communication, April 2013). Instead, as the war continued, Jane worked in an arms factory while Louis worked as a trader in the furniture business. Throughout Janes lifetime she exhibited a commitment to voluntary work in their community. She was a major leader in the South African Jewish community and just before her death in 1972 she was named {{the head of the}} <b>World</b> Womans <b>Zionist</b> <b>Organization.</b> Johns parents were both Jewish, however as John remarks, [...] "They were not especially religious" [...] (John Comaroff, personal communication, 17 April 2013).

The letter referred to research stating that the Settlement Division has ties to right-wing NGOs, which, in turn, are connected to The Jewish Home Party (Bayit Yehudi), Slomiansky’s party. Shaffir also argued against funding for the Jewish Identity Administration which she considered a ploy to promote a right wing political agenda.|$|E

25|$|At the Peace Conference in 1919, Emir Faisal, {{speaking}} {{on behalf of}} King Hussein, asked for Arab independence, or at minimum the right to pick the mandatory.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{withdrawal}} of Great Britain from Palestine and the reactions of the Zionist movement on her mandatory policy. In 1937, the British planed to divide the mandate between the Arabs and the Jews, terminate the administration and establish an alliance with the successor states. Disapproval of the Arab world, worsened security in Palestine {{and the threat of}} a war in Europe led the mandatory power to prolong the administration and restrict the jewish immigration. These meassures caused a deterioration of Anglo-Zionist relations. During the Second <b>World</b> War, the <b>Zionist</b> <b>Organization</b> put forward a request {{for the establishment of a}} Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine. No long after, the British restored their preparations for the termination of the mandate. As before the war, they sought for the pernament teritorial solution for postmandatory Palestine and new allies.

50|$|After a {{short period}} of fundraising, Lindheim became the second {{president}} of Hadassah, in 1926. At the time, the <b>Zionist</b> <b>Organization</b> of America, then-president Louis Lipsky was pressuring Hadassah to give up their autonomy and fold into the ZOA. Lindheim fought against that pressure and eventually succeeded, was re-elected president in 1927, and served as Hadassah's delegate to the <b>World</b> <b>Zionist</b> Congress in Basel. When she returned, she joined the Labor Zionist Poale Zion, prompting the Hadassah board to demand her resignation on the grounds of conflict of interest.

50|$|When {{the secular}} “people’s lawyer” Louis Brandeis became {{involved}} in the movement in 1912, just before World War I, Zionism started gaining significant support. By 1917, Brandeis' leadership had increased American Zionist membership ten times to 200,000 members, and “American Jewry thenceforth became the financial center for the <b>world</b> <b>Zionist</b> movement,” greatly surpassing its previous European base of support. In addition, {{during the early years of}} World War I, he and others established the American Provisional Executive Committee for General Zionist Affairs to run Zionist affairs on behalf of the worldwide <b>Zionist</b> <b>Organization,</b> which had been rendered largely impotent because its members were divided by allegiance to the different sides in the conflict.|$|R

During this meeting, Balfour asked what Weizmann's objections {{had been to}} the 1903 Uganda Scheme to give a portion of British East Africa to the Jewish people as a homeland. The scheme, which had been proposed to Herzl by Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain following his trip to East Africa earlier in the year, had been subsequently voted down following Herzl's death by the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905, after two years of heated debate in the <b>Zionist</b> <b>Organization.</b>|$|R

25|$|In urban townships, {{access to}} water is also an issue: an article from the <b>World</b> <b>Zionist</b> <b>Organization</b> Hagshama Department {{explains}} that water allocation to Bedouin towns is 25-50% of that to Jewish towns.
