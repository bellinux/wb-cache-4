5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise {{by trial and error}} against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember the new approach. They can also make detours to find the best attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of visual contact with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to abseiling down a silk thread and biting the prey from behind. Such detours may take up to an hour, and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> an incorrect route. If a Portia makes a mistake while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E

The duo poses on the South Bank of the River Thames in a pastiche of a postcard image, with the Houses of Parliament as a background.|$|E

5|$|Levels {{become more}} complex as the player progresses, {{introducing}} different mechanics and {{new types of}} enemies. Each enemy type {{is dressed in a}} unique colour, allowing the player to recognise their movement patterns. Some enemies remain static or rotate on a single node, while others will patrol the board along a specific route. Later stages may require the player to collect keys located on the board and unlock doors that block access to the level objective. Trapdoors connect one location on the board to another and allow the player to move between them during a turn. Some nodes contain potted plants, the player will not be detected while occupying these nodes. Coloured disguises can be found and equipped to let the player <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> an enemy type of that colour without being detected. There are throwable objects that are used to disrupt and change enemy behaviour patterns. Firearms can also be found on certain levels, they are used to shoot targets or obstacles from a distance.|$|E

25|$|In Cologne, Ernst, Baargeld, and Arp {{launched}} a controversial Dada exhibition in 1920 {{which focused on}} nonsense and anti-bourgeois sentiments.

The police closed the exhibition on grounds of obscenity, but it was re-opened when the charges were dropped.|$|E

50|$|Commodities, when {{produced}} or imported, {{are stored}} in warehouses. From there they are distributed to retailers, which employ walkers. When a retailer walker <b>walks</b> <b>past</b> a house which requires a certain commodity, the house draws a small amount from the retailer's stockpile. This amount declines over time, and so is topped up every time the walker <b>walks</b> <b>past,</b> subject to availability.|$|R

To the Hogwarts house-elves, it is also known as the Come and Go Room.|$|E

Chaz goes to the restroom with Joey to console him, then waits for Joey outside. Chaz takes ecstasy and leaves when he sees a good-looking man <b>walk</b> <b>past.</b> Joey's crush comes into the bathroom and apologizes, leaving Joey ecstatically happy. Just then, the killer emerges from a bathroom stall and decapitates Joey, taking his head as a trophy.|$|E

25|$|At Jekyll's {{first meeting}} with Lutyens in 1889 she invited him to Munstead Wood, and their {{collaboration}} began. They explored the local vernacular architecture, gathering ideas {{for the construction of}} Jekyll's house. His first building for her was The Hut, a cottage built in the grounds of Munstead Wood in 1895. Jekyll used this as a workshop, and lived in it until Lutyens completed the main house in 1897. While the house was still being built, Lutyens obtained another, larger commission in Surrey, Orchards, {{as a result of his}} future clients being impressed with Munstead Wood when they happened to <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> the construction site. Jekyll lived at Munstead Wood until her death in 1932.|$|E
25|$|Banded tunnelweb spiders {{are known}} to eat most types of small insects, waiting in the tunnel that they have {{constructed}} for prey to <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> the opening. At the entrance to their tunnel, they construct a swathe of silk, which serves as an indicator to when prey is moving past. Once an insect is captured it is dragged into the tunnel. From inspecting the remains found in their dwellings {{it has been observed}} that their diet consists mainly of beetles, millipedes and slaters, although they will attack and eat most arthropods. They have also been known to eat snails. Despite the armored defenses of a snail the banded tunnelweb spider are able to bite and drag them into their tunnels.|$|E
25|$|Robert Whyte, pseudonymous {{author of}} the 1847 Famine Ship Diary: The Journey of a Coffin Ship, {{described}} how on arrival at Grosse Isle the Irish emigrant passengers on the Ajax dressed in their best clothes and helped the crew to clean the ship, expecting to be sent either to hospital or on to Quebec after their long voyage. In fact, the doctor inspected them only briefly and did not return for several days. By mid-summer doctors were examining their charges very perfunctorily, allowing them to <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> and examining the tongues of any who looked feverish. In this way, many people with latent fever were allowed to pass as healthy, only to succumb to their sickness once they had left Grosse Isle.|$|E

500|$|After the game's release, a {{reviewer}} for Game Revolution praised its sound, {{saying that}} [...] "When you're {{in a crowded}} city, {{it sounds like a}} crowded city. <b>Walk</b> <b>past</b> a bar, and you'll hear the noise of the drunken patrons inside. Wander near a slave auction, and you'll hear the auctioneer calling. Go to a party in the festival hall, and it sounds just like a party". The same reviewer also stated [...] "Planescape has just about the best sound I've ever heard in a game." [...] IGN gave the sound 8.5 out of 10 and noted that [...] "The game has fantastic speech and sound effects, but what's more impressive is the way they fade in and out depending on how close you're standing to them." ...|$|E

They realize that the songs are bringing out hidden secrets, and later insist to Giles that something evil is to blame. As they argue, they <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> a woman (series writer and producer Marti Noxon) protesting a parking ticket ("The Parking Ticket"). That evening, Buffy visits Spike, who angrily tells Buffy to leave him alone if she will not love him ("Rest in Peace").|$|E
500|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have been called [...] "eight-legged cats", as their hunting tactics are as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's.

500|$|The episode's cold open {{was filmed}} {{in a water}} tank, using a replica P-51 Mustang plane which had been {{designed}} by the art director. Bowman also needed to direct {{a scene in which}} Gillian Anderson would react to a memory of playing with her sister as a child; the scene involved digitally compositing the children playing into Anderson's footage. Bowman asked Anderson to act towards a tree as though it were her sister, later telling her [...] "I'm going to tell everybody I can that you just did that great reaction to a tree". Bowman also reshot the episode's ending, as originally Duchovny and Lea were to <b>walk</b> <b>past</b> the camera and continue off-screen. Feeling this was not effective, he replaced this with a walking shot which continued straight towards and into the camera, noting that [...] "Nick will jump in front of a truck if he think it will make a scene better".|$|E
