5|$|In 2011, astronomers found <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> to be {{pristine}} {{clouds of}} primordial gas by analyzing absorption {{lines in the}} spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed {{in the first few}} minutes after the Big Bang, during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|The higher-level {{phylogeny}} of the arthropods {{continues to}} be a matter of debate and research. In 2008, researchers at Tufts University uncovered <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> is the world's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect, a 300-million-year-old specimen from the Carboniferous period. The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert. It may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect. This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles (two articulations in the mandible), a feature associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time. Thus, the first insects probably appeared earlier, in the Silurian period.|$|E

5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, {{along with}} their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where they see a movie about two archeologists who {{discover}} an undead mummy. Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} mummy and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and {{his friend}} Captain Haddock plan an {{expedition}} to the West Indies aboard a fishing trawler, the Sirius, {{to search for the}} treasure of the pirate Red Rackham. Having previously read three parchments authored by Haddock's ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock, the duo had discovered the coordinates to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> is the treasure aboard the sunken 17th century vessel, the Unicorn, near an unknown island. An eccentric, hard-of-hearing inventor named Professor Cuthbert Calculus offers to aid them with the use of his shark-shaped one-man submarine, but they decline his assistance. Setting sail, they are joined by the police detectives Thomson and Thompson and soon discover that Calculus has stowed away on board, bringing his submarine with him.|$|E
5|$|To further {{understand}} {{the mysteries of}} the Foretellers and the future, the player, Chirithy, and Skuld re-enter the Foretellers' tower where they are caught by a Foreteller. They are also told that Ephemer is a traitor to his union and that he has disappeared. The player then challenges the Foreteller to a duel, assuming Ephemer has been captured, but is easily defeated. The Foreteller reveals that she is in fact Master Ava, and that the player's quest was a test of their character to see if they are worthy of leaving this world before the Great War between light and darkness. Keyblade wielders that can resist the darkness and fight for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> in, like their friends, are worthy of becoming elite Keyblade warriors known as Dandelions and going on to the Realm of Light and avoiding the coming universal war. All who stay will become a part of that war and must face an uncertain future. Skuld accepts the offer, but the player's character is uncertain if they should join Ephemer, who has gone on to the Realm of Light, or stay and fight to save the future. Later, they encounter two Keyblade warriors accusing each other of stealing Lux from their unions, and the player is forced to fight Master Aced, who defeats them. Ira arrives to stop the fighting. Aced claims that he is collecting more Keyblade warriors to prepare for the upcoming war before leaving. Ira informs the player, Skuld, and Chirithy that the war cannot be avoided and {{that there will be no}} victor. The only Foreteller who may have a solution is Gula so the trio go to look for him.|$|E
