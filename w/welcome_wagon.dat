50|$|One of {{the old-time}} Wyoming {{residents}} from Ten Sleep who moved away {{as a young}} adult seeking a career was Audrey Vonona Davis Bailey, born at the nearby Rice Ranch bunkhouse on December 27, 1916, amid impassable snow and temperatures of fifty degrees below zero. She and her three brothers were reared on the Triangle E. Davis Ranch by their parents, Lester James and Audrey Odessa Davis. As a ranch girl, she developed an interest in livestock, field work, gardening, and wildlife. She graduated from the Ten Sleep school system, worked at the sanitarium in Basin, Wyoming, and later graduated from the University of Wyoming in Laramie, where she met her husband, Joseph Spencer Bailey, who was studying civil engineering. They married in 1941, but World War II delayed a normal home life for the couple and their soon three children. Audrey joined a caravan of other military wives which followed their husbands from coast to coast. The Baileys established their permanent residence in Cheyenne in 1947, when Joseph took a position with the Portland Cement Association. Audrey Bailey owned an arts and crafts business and was a seamstress. In her spare time, she was a bridge player, rock hunter, golfer, snow skier, skater, fly fisherman, and a hunter of moose and bighorn sheep. She worked for <b>Welcome</b> <b>Wagon</b> through her local Chamber of Commerce and was secretary of the Wyoming State Mineral and Gem Society, with her husband as past president.
