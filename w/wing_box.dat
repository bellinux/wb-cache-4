40|$|The Ko {{displacement}} theory previously formulated for deformed shape {{predictions of}} nonuniform beam structures is further developed mathematically. The further-developed displacement equations are expressed explicitly {{in terms of}} geometrical parameters of the beam and bending strains at equally spaced strain-sensing stations along the multiplexed fiber-optic sensor line installed on the bottom surface of the beam. The bending strain data can then be input into the displacement equations for calculations of local slopes, deflections, and cross-sectional twist angles for generating the overall deformed shapes of the nonuniform beam. The further-developed displacement theory can also {{be applied to the}} deformed shape predictions of nonuniform two-point supported beams, nonuniform panels, nonuniform aircraft wings and fuselages, and so forth. The high degree of accuracy of the further-developed displacement theory for nonuniform beams is validated by finite-element analysis of various nonuniform beam structures. Such structures include tapered tubular beams, depth-tapered unswept and swept <b>wing</b> <b>boxes,</b> width-tapered <b>wing</b> <b>boxes,</b> and double-tapered <b>wing</b> <b>boxes,</b> all under combined bending and torsional loads. The Ko displacement theory, combined with the fiber-optic strain-sensing system, provide a powerful tool for in-flight deformed shape monitoring of unmanned aerospace vehicles by ground-based pilots to maintain safe flights...|$|R
40|$|A {{conceptual}} design optimization methodology {{was developed for}} a medium range <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft. A baseline conventional cantilever wing aircraft designed for the same mis- sion and payload was also optimized alongside a baseline <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft. An empirical formula for the mass estimation of the fore and aft <b>wings</b> of the <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft was derived by relating conventional cantilever <b>wings</b> to <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft wings. The {{results indicate that the}} fore and aft wings would use the same correction coe cient and that the aft wing would be lighter than the fore wing on the medium range <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft because of reduced sweep. As part of the methodology, a computational study was performed to analyze di erent wing/tip n xities using a statically loaded idealized <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> con guration. The analy- ses determined the best joint xity by comparing the stress distributions in nite element torsion box models in addition to aerodynamic requirements. The analyses indicates that the rigid joint is the most suitable. Studies were also performed to investigate the structural implications of changing only the tip n inclinations on the <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft. Tip n inclination refers to the angle the tip n makes to the vertical body axis of the aircraft. No signi cant variations in wing structural design drivers as a function of tip n inclination were observed. Stochastic and deterministic optimization routines were performed on the baseline <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft using the methodology developed where the variables were wing area, av- erage thickness to chord ratio and sweep angle. The conventional aircraft design showed similar performance and characteristics to the equivalent in-service aircraft thereby pro- viding some validation to the methodology and the results for the <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft. Longitudinal stability investigations showed that the extra fuel capacity of the <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> in the ns could be used to reduce trim drag. The short period oscillation of the conventional cantilever wing aircraft was found to be satisfactory but the <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft was found to be unacceptable hence requiring stability augmentation systems. The eld and ight performance of the <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> showed to be better than the conventional cantilever wing aircraft. Overall, the economic advantages of the <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft over the conventional cantilever wing aircraft improve with increase in fuel price making the <b>box</b> <b>wing</b> a worthy replacement for the conventional cantilever wing aircraft...|$|R

[...] Design studies were performed by Grumman Aerospace Corporation in collaboration with Gulfstream American Corporation. [...] Design of the Gulfstream III started with an effort to synthesize a completely new wing employing NASA supercritical airfoil sections and winglets.

As a result, the new wing concept was canceled and work began on design modifications that would retain the Gulfstream II <b>wing</b> <b>box</b> structure and trailing edge surfaces.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wing</b> <b>box,</b> a 54-plane {{formation}} (basically three 18-plane boxes {{stacked in}} a similar fashion to the group box), evolved from a need to provide defensive fire against head-on attacks. The formations were stacked so that while squadrons were stacked away from the sun on missions, groups were stacked in the opposite direction, making for a more compact <b>wing</b> <b>box.</b> Because the Eighth AF had only four B-17 units until May 1943, composite groups were formed by combining squadrons from different groups, or a fourth group was added to the <b>wing</b> <b>box</b> to form a diamond-shaped box. The latter was flown in a trailing position behind the wing and proved susceptible to Luftwaffe tactics of attacking the extremities of formations. The <b>wing</b> <b>box</b> was often spread 3000 ft vertically, 7000 ft deep, and 2000 ft across and was difficult to maintain.|$|E
