40|$|We study {{analytically}} and numerically {{the winding}} of directed polymers of length t {{around each other}} or around a rod. Unconfined polymers in pure media have exponentially decaying <b>winding</b> <b>angle</b> distributions, the decay constant {{depending on whether the}} interaction is repulsive or neutral, but not on microscopic details. In the presence of a chiral asymmetry, the exponential tails become non universal. In all these cases the mean <b>winding</b> <b>angle</b> is proportional to t. When the polymer is confined to a finite region around the winding center, e. g. due to an attractive interaction, the <b>winding</b> <b>angle</b> distribution is Gaussian, with a variance proportional to t.

The savonius wind turbine under {{the study was}} designed to convert wind flows with opposite directions, such as wind flows due to the movement of vehicles that could be seen at the isles, into electricity. The prototype wind turbine had both diameter and height of 32 cm and had its shaft connected to an electric DC generator. Two tunnels with input and output wind areas of 1, 980 and 782 cm 2 each were used to increase wind speeds by 2. 5 times for the turbine. The experimental results showed that the <b>wind</b> <b>angles</b> between 23. 2 – 35. 5 degrees provided high levels of generated voltages when the <b>wind</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 degrees provided the highest voltage among the <b>wind</b> <b>angles</b> of 0 - 90 degrees.
