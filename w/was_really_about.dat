25|$|During {{the first}} and second season, the search for Laura Palmer's killer served as the engine for the plot, and {{captured}} the public's imagination, although the creators admitted this was largely a MacGuffin; each episode <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> the interactions between the townsfolk. The unique (and often bizarre) personalities of each citizen formed a web of minutiae that ran contrary to the town's quaint appearance. Adding to the surreal atmosphere was the recurrence of Dale Cooper's dreams, in which the FBI agent is given clues to Laura's murder in a supernatural realm {{that may or may not}} be of his imagination. The first season contained only eight episodes (including the two-hour pilot episode), and was considered technically and artistically revolutionary for television at the time, and geared toward reaching the standards of film.|$|E
25|$|After Lazarus {{had checked}} her gun {{and come to}} the {{interrogation}} room, they explained that this <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> some loose ends they were trying to tie up in the Rasmussen case, since her name had come up in the investigation. They claimed they wanted a private setting because while Ruetten was an old boyfriend, she was long married to someone else and did not want her private life to become the subject of office gossip. Stearns and Jaramillo knew they would have to tread carefully since Lazarus herself was well aware of police interview techniques and her rights to silence and legal counsel, which she could invoke at any time. They rambled and digressed from the subject at times, sometimes discussing unrelated police business, but eventually came back to Rasmussen. Lazarus claimed to recall little due to the intervening years, but gradually revealed more and more knowledge—including oblique acknowledgements of her visits to the Ruetten condo—until she accused her colleagues of considering her a suspect, whereupon they allowed that there was DNA evidence connecting her to the crime scene and she was free to go. She left the room and was immediately arrested and charged with the murder.|$|E
500|$|Mylod, {{spoke about}} the {{decision}} to show Blackfish's death off screen, saying [...] "there {{was a lot of}} tonal discussion about this, and I think I can safely speak for the writers that the choice was a conscious one in the writing not to see his actual death, because the emotional focus <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> the final moments between him and Brienne -- two warriors, two samurais, facing each other -- and Brienne's acknowledgment that this fellow samurai has chosen his moment, and this is his moment of dignity and choice of his death. So it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> that moment of choice and the dignity and acceptance between these two great warriors, rather than the actual detail of his actual death. That was actually a tonal choice as to how we saw that character." ...|$|E

500|$|Miller later {{noted that}} unlike other episode scenes {{such as in}} [...] "Grey Matters", Walter's {{breakdown}} at the supermarket [...] "came largely out of nowhere. It was a thought experiment that took {{on a life of}} its own." [...] Miller continued that at the time, he and Stentz thought they were writing Olivia-focused episodes, but [...] "In retrospect, we really wrote a four-part story about Walter, his relationship to children, and the struggle between Walter-who-was and Walter-who-is. If you look at it that way, his decision at the end of 'Northwest Passage' becomes the moment where he reconciles those things. He doesn't resolve them, but he comes to grips with them. Once again in retrospect, I think that's what the supermarket breakdown <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about.</b> This happens — you think a scene is about one thing when you're in the middle of it, and realize it's something else entirely when you look back. Characters can be sneaky motherfuckers that way." ...|$|E
500|$|Neither Carter nor Duchovny were {{contracted}} {{to work on}} the series beyond the seventh season; however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of season in order to bring the two on board for an eighth season.

[...] Rumors began spreading—and were eventually confirmed—that, since Duchovny had not expressed an interest to appear as a main character in the eighth season, that another character would take Mulder's place.

500|$|Gerard O'Donovan of The Daily Telegraph {{lamented the}} eleven months that {{passed since the}} series seven cliffhanger, and stated that [...] "for all its square-jawed silliness and bonkers conspiracies, Spooks still {{delivers}} high-class escapism at its slickest, most glamorous and entertaining." [...] Adam Sweeting of The Arts Desk felt that the episode's plot was [...] "mere background noise," [...] and that the series [...] "is about hilariously artificial encounters between the characters, clumsily manufactured dramatic tension, and a denouement involving someone being prevented {{in the nick of}} time from detonating something/killing somebody/triggering a global economic collapse." [...] Andrea Mullaney of The Scotsman said that the plot was [...] "all gibberish," [...] but cited the episode <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> the return of Ruth, a development Mullaney praised, stating Ruth [...] "has been much missed since she was framed and sent into faked-death exile." [...] Mullaney also praised the performance of the cast, including [...] "Walker's gulping hysteria when Ruth's husband was executed," [...] which was [...] "perfectly done," [...] and Malcolm's [...] "doughty attempts to comfort a small boy in danger were touching." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{there was}} still a chance that the seventh season may have been the show's last, the {{character}} of Billy Miles, played by Zachary Ansley and who originally appeared in the pilot episode, was brought back in and featured in [...] "Requiem" [...] to bring the series full-circle. Ansley would also appear in several eighth season episodes as well. After the conclusion of the episode, David Duchovny expressed his desire to leave the series. He explained, [...] "I was kind of a free agent after season seven, and to me, there was not much else to do in terms of the character.

500|$|Charlie Cox {{explained}} that with Wilson Fisk imprisoned following the first season, season two picks up with [...] "the crime rate [...] plummeted. Things {{have returned to}} normal, if not better than normal", which is when Punisher is introduced, who makes Matt Murdock [...] "question everything. Matt has to reevaluate [...] and what he does". Jeph Loeb, head of Marvel Television, said that [...] "if season one <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> Matt’s decision to become a hero, then season two really became about what is {{it to be a}} hero." [...] By introducing the Punisher and Elektra, the writers were able to [...] "push and pull" [...] on Murdock, contrasting their three ideologies—the Punisher seeing [...] "justice in a very black-and-white kind of way", and Elektra living [...] "more in the gray". On Elektra in particular, Loeb said that she has a very clear, self-motivated agenda, and she challenges Murdock's own agenda and [...] "quest for justice. Who are you doing this for?

500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{critic for}} The Star-Ledger, said the episode was satisfying, although {{he felt it}} was short on laughs, except for Jim's antics with the tuxedo and the episode's documentary-style interviews. Sepinwall particularly praised the twist of Michael quitting and said he looked forward to seeing where the subplot went. Jeff Labrecque said [...] "watching Jim flail for approval [...] one of the episode's most awkward delights", but he said the episode <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> [...] "the type of man Michael Scott really is". Labrecque also said he looked forward to seeing how Michael regained his job, and raised the suggestion that the reason Michael clashed so much with Charles was because he was intimidated by the man's race. Brian Howard of The Journal News said, [...] "For 22 minutes of not much fun and only some funny, 'New Boss' was a pretty good episode." [...] He particularly liked the ending, which {{he said he did not}} see coming and served as a kind of redemption for Michael; Howard also liked Pam's documentary interviews and Jim's failed efforts to make a good impression to Charles. Several reviewers particularly praised the line about the [...] "two-way petting zoo", a zoo in which people pet the animals and the animals pet back.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Ruffalo said he {{believed}} the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, [...] "I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did The Avengers it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version {{of what it would}} be." [...] In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in Phase Two of the MCU, by saying, [...] "After the first Avengers, Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in [...] So it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about,</b> frankly, saving somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between Avengers movies is the next Avengers movie, so [...] could continue to play with that in [...] Where we go after that, we'll see." [...] In October 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said [...] "we'll see. We'd love to do it, we'd love to find the place to put it, but right now, Hulk will be appearing, with his friends, in their [...] films." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, Flynn was {{conceived}} as a British farmer named Bastian until his voice actor was finally cast. The directors cited actors Errol Flynn and Gene Kelly, and Star Wars character Han Solo, among several individuals by whom Flynn was inspired. Greno explained that [...] "Having Flynn as a thief seemed like a fresh spin, especially in contrast to Rapunzel, who is a really smart girl but is just locked away in this tower. So {{she has a very}} limited world view and Flynn could complement that as this worldly guy." [...] The film's change in title from Rapunzel to the more gender-neutral Tangled {{is due in part to}} Flynn's role and involvement. First observing that the Disney tradition is [...] "to name the movie after the Princess", the directors had initially thought that the film [...] "would be structured like Cinderella where there's Cinderella and then a Prince that pops into the movie once in a while". This changed, however, as Flynn was gradually developed into a much more prominent character. Howard explained that [...] "When Nathan and I figured out that this film <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> two characters, Flynn and Rapunzel, we knew that changing the title would be a good idea." [...] Meanwhile, the title Tangled summarizes the relationship between protagonists Flynn and Rapunzel, and antagonist Mother Gothel. Additionally, Flynn also narrates the film, providing it with [...] "an ironic counterpoint", according to Children's Literature and Learner Empowerment: Children and Teenagers in English Language Education author Janice Bland. As [...] "an example of first-person voice-over narration", Flynn's narration [...] "compels the viewer to identify empathetically with" [...] Flynn and Rapunzel.|$|E

50|$|Thirdly, {{there is}} the {{distinctive}} Syriac Christian {{context in which the}} typical hermeneutic method was typological analysis - not allegorical and not literal interpretation. According to this methodology, persons and events in the Old Testament prefigure those in the New. Typology is a theory of history, that one event in the past really signifies another event, in the future. Thus the Exodus is not about the people of Israel leaving Egypt some three thousand years ago. It <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> Jesus (Moses) leading humanity (the people of Israel) out of sin (Egypt) through the waters of Baptism (the Red Sea) into the Kingdom of Heaven (the Promised Land).

500|$|Gough and Millar {{had five}} months for casting, but their primary {{focus was on}} finding an actor to play Clark Kent. They {{received}} Kristin Kreuk's audition tape {{for the role of}} Lana Lang and liked it so much that they immediately showed her to the network. Tom Welling, after twice turning down the producers' attempts to get him to audition for the role of Clark Kent, eventually accepted the opportunity {{to be part of the}} show. It was David Nutter who finally convinced Welling to read the script for the pilot, after finding Welling's picture in a photo album at the casting director's office. Welling's manager did not want him to take the role because it could hurt his feature film career, but Welling liked the script and agreed to come in for an audition. Welling's reason for turning down the role was because the producers were keeping quiet on what the show <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about,</b> which left him with the impression the show was going to be [...] "Superman in high school", something he did not want to do. Nutter promised to let Welling read the script if he came in and auditioned. After auditioning, Welling was given the script to read, which he thought was [...] "amazing". For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene, from the pilot, with Kristin Kreuk; the network thought they had [...] "great chemistry". No one could agree on which actors had the best audition for Lex Luthor. Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice, and, believing he did not take his first audition seriously, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene from the pilot. He indicated all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing, and performed so well that everyone agreed he was [...] "the guy".|$|E
500|$|As {{the series}} progressed, reviews became more positive, and Friends {{became one of}} the most popular sitcoms of its time. It is now often ranked among the all-time best TV shows. Critics commended the series as having {{consistently}} sharp writing and chemistry between the main actors. Noel Holston of Newsday, who had dismissed the pilot as a [...] "so-so Seinfeld wannabe" [...] in 1994, repudiated his earlier review after rewatching the episode, and felt like writing an apology to the writers. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com thought that the series [...] "hit its stride" [...] in the second season. Havrilesky found the character-specific jokes and situations [...] "could reliably make you laugh out loud a few times each episode", and the quality of writing allowed the stories to be [...] "original and innovative." [...] Bill Carter of The New York Times called the eighth season a [...] "truly stunning comeback." [...] Carter found that by [...] "generating new hot storylines and high-decibel laughs", the series made its way [...] "back into the hearts of its fans." [...] However, Liane Bonin of Entertainment Weekly felt that the direction of the ninth season was a [...] "disappointing buzzkill", criticizing it for the non-stop celebrity guest spots and going into jump the shark territory. Although disappointed with the season, Bonin noted that [...] "the writing [...] still sharp." [...] Havrilesky thought that the tenth season was [...] "alarmingly awful, far worse than you would ever imagine a show that was once so good could be." [...] Friends was featured on Times list of [...] "The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time", saying, [...] "the well-hidden secret of this show was that it called itself Friends, and <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> family." ...|$|E

People are just reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>about.</b> But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." [...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried to take me down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E
