5|$|However, {{because of}} {{political}} infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> Grant, who won in a landslide. Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes, and received 55.8 {{percent of the popular}} vote nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both house of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election. Out of respect for Greeley, Grant attended his funeral.|$|E
5|$|Even then, Eberstein {{refused to}} ask Schack for {{assistance}} in the battle. Colonel Ditlev Ahlefeldt of the allied forces would not to let pride and vanity be {{the downfall of the}} attack and pleaded with Schack to attack. Shack brandished his rapier and mounted a forceful attack into the Swedish left flank. A bloody engagement ensued, but the Swedish cavalry <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the rested Danish forces—they fled towards Nyborg leaving the infantry defenseless. The Polish riders showed no pardon, cutting down the Swedish infantry almost to a man. The Dutch also intervened with an expeditionary fleet led by Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} the Pindaris was carried out as planned. The Pindaris were attacked, and their homes were {{surrounded}} and destroyed. General Hislop from the Madras Residency attacked the Pindaris {{from the south and}} drove them beyond the Narmada river, where governor general Francis Rawdon-Hastings was waiting with his army. Karim Khan surrendered to the British and was given lands in Gorakhpur. The principal routes from Central India were occupied by British detachments. The Pindari forces were completely broken up, scattered {{in the course of a}} single campaign. They made no stand against the regular troops, and even in small bands they were unable to escape the ring of forces drawn around them. The Pindaris rapidly dispersed over the country. The Pindari chiefs were reduced to the condition of hunted outlaws. The desperate Pindaris expected the Marathas to help them, but none dared to give them even a place of shelter for their families. Karim and Setu had still 23,000 men between them but such a force <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the armies that surrounded them. In whatever direction they turned they were met by British forces. Defeat followed defeat. One gang made their escape to the south, leaving all their baggage behind them. Many fled to the jungles and perished. Others sought refuge in the villages, but were killed without mercy by the villagers who had not forgotten the sufferings they had been inflicted upon by the Pindaris. The Pindari chiefs Karim Khan and Wasil Mohammed had been present with their Durras at the battle of Mahidpur. Since by this time the Maratha powers had been reduced significantly, the pursuit of Setu and the other leaders was resumed with vigor. All the leaders had surrendered before the end of February and the Pindari system and power was brought to a close. They were removed to Gorakhptir where they obtained grants of land for their subsistence. Karim Khan became a farmer on the small estate he received beyond the Ganges in Gorakpur. Wasil Mohammed attempted to escape. He was found and committed suicide by taking poison. Setu, a Jat by caste, was hunted by John Malcolm from place to place until he had no followers left. He vanished into the jungles of Central India in 1819 and was killed by a tiger.|$|E

This peasant army was untrained and without organization and <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the battle-hardened Birkebeiners. In a battle on 6 March 1200 the peasants were defeated piecemeal. However, the Birkebeiners' grip on the region was still weak, and Sverre decided to sail back to Bergen.|$|E

Macedon <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> this army, and Perseus was unable to rally the other Greek states to his aid. Poor generalship by the Romans enabled him to hold out for three years, but in 168 BC the Romans sent Lucius Aemilius Paullus to Greece, and at Pydna the Macedonians were crushingly defeated. Perseus was captured and taken to Rome, the Macedonian kingdom was broken up into four smaller states, and all the Greek cities who aided her, even rhetorically, were punished. Even Rome's allies Rhodes and Pergamum effectively lost their independence.|$|E
25|$|From the start, it {{was clear}} that Metellus Pius <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> Sertorius, {{suffering}} repeated defeats through Sertorius’ use of guerrilla tactics. His legate Thorius, dispatched to come to the assistance of the governor of Hispania Citerior, Marcus Domitus Calvinus, was defeated by Sertorius (79 BC). After his unsuccessful push towards the Tagus in 79 BC, and suffering a defeat by Sertorius at Lacobriga in 78 BC, Pius was forced to ask for help from the governor of Gallia Transalpina, but he was defeated by Sertorius’ legate and unable to help. The end result was that an exhausted Pius was pushed out of his province of Hispania Ulterior.|$|E

Squadrons were distributed among the field Armies. The remaining 30 Czaplas were initially in reserve. Several were used to supplement the combat units during the campaign (the mentioned squadrons and several others). In total, 49 Czaplas were used in units. Like the R-XIII, the Czapla <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> any Luftwaffe fighter, bomber, or even reconnaissance aircraft, being much slower, and armed with only two machine guns.

Hannibal dispatched two of his lieutenants, who were of Syracusian origin to negotiate with Hieronymus.

The Syracusans' ambitions were great, but the army they fielded <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>match</b> <b>for</b> the arriving Roman force, leading to the Siege of Syracuse from 214 BC onwards.
