40|$|Abstract: Input-output models, {{when applied}} correctly, can be {{powerful}} tools for estimating the economy-wide {{effects of an}} initial change in economic activity. To effectively use these models, analysts must collect detailed information about the project or program under <b>study.</b> <b>Analysts</b> {{also need to be}} aware of the assumptions and limitations of these models. In this paper, we will focus on these assumptions and on the information that is required to use regional input-output multipliers correctly. We focus specifically on multipliers generated by the Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II) developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. 1...|$|R

This paper presents a method to estimate how much a utility {{can afford to pay}} for these alternatives when the change in system capacity due to the distributed resource is constant from year to year and when there is no uncertainty. The method is concise, has intuitive appeal, has minimal data requirements, and is accurate when benchmarked against two existing case <b>studies.</b> <b>Analysts</b> who want to screen distributed resource investment opportunities with a minimal amount of effort will find the method particularly useful. ...|$|R

The most relevant measures are investor and analyst feedback and perception <b>studies,</b> <b>analyst</b> following and analyst forecast accuracy and management feedback...|$|R

[...] The reasons {{for such a}} shift of emphasis can be ticked off in the following order: While relations with India [...] "may not progress as quickly as desired" [...] and those with Pakistan and Afghanistan are [...] "in tatters," [...] the United States needs to forge deeper strategic relationship with the [...] "marginal states." [...] Such states," [...] according to Doug Lieb in the Harvard International Review, [...] "are often overlooked in a structural realist world view that privileges the study of larger countries."Bangladesh and Sri Lanka being maritime countries exude significant potential for securing Indian Ocean sea lanes {{in the eyes of}} China and United States, of course with implications independent of India.|$|R
