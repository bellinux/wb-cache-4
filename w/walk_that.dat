40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} planar lattice <b>walks</b> <b>that</b> {{start from}} a prescribed position, take their steps {{in a given}} finite subset of Z 2, and always stay in the quadrant x⩾ 0,y⩾ 0. We first give a criterion which guarantees that the length generating function of these <b>walks</b> is D-finite, <b>that</b> is, satisfies a linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients. This criterion applies, among others, to the ordinary square lattice walks. Then, we prove <b>that</b> <b>walks</b> <b>that</b> start from (1, 1), take their steps in {(2,− 1),(− 1, 2) } {{and stay in the}} first quadrant have a non-D-finite generating function. Our proof relies on a functional equation satisfied by this generating function, and on elementary complex analysis...|$|R

25|$|Physiological effects, {{similar to}} those in other anxiety disorders, are present in social phobics. In adults, it may be tears as well as {{excessive}} sweating, nausea, difficulty breathing, shaking, and palpitations {{as a result of the}} fight-or-flight response. The walk disturbance (where a person is so worried about how they <b>walk</b> <b>that</b> they may lose balance) may appear, especially when passing a group of people. Blushing is commonly exhibited by individuals suffering from social phobia. These visible symptoms further reinforce the anxiety in the presence of others. A 2006 study found that the area of the brain called the amygdala, part of the limbic system, is hyperactive when patients are shown threatening faces or confronted with frightening situations.|$|E

500|$|On 19 September 1819, Keats walked near Winchester {{along the}} River Itchen. In {{a letter to}} his friend John Hamilton Reynolds written on 21 September, Keats {{described}} the impression the scene had made upon him and its influence on the composition of [...] "To Autumn": [...] "How beautiful the season is now [...] How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it [...] I never lik'd stubble fields so much as now [...] Somehow a stubble plain looks warm [...] {{in the same way that}} some pictures look warm [...] this struck me so much in my sunday's <b>walk</b> <b>that</b> I composed upon it." [...] Not everything on Keats's mind at the time was bright; the poet knew in September that he would have to finally abandon Hyperion. Thus, in the letter that he wrote to Reynolds, Keats also included a note saying that he abandoned his long poem. Keats did not send [...] "To Autumn" [...] to Reynolds, but did include the poem within a letter to Richard Woodhouse, Keats's publisher and friend, and dated it on the same day.|$|E
500|$|Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork noted [...] "songs like Nirvana's [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit", Dr. Dre's [...] "Nothing But a G Thang", and Britney Spears's [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] {{altered the}} {{landscape}} of pop culture so quickly {{in large part because}} they were delivered to all corners of the U.S. simultaneously by MTV. [...] MTV's ability to place a song and musician into the pop music conversation was unparalleled at the time, {{and by the end of}} the decade that meant absurd levels of both financial and creative commitment to music videos." [...] PopMatters writer Evan Sawdey commented that Spears's concept for the music video of the song was the one responsible for her immediate success, saying that, as a result, the singer [...] "scored a massive No. 1 single, inadvertently started the late '90s teen pop boom, and created a public persona for herself that was simultaneously kid-friendly and pure male fantasy. Her videos got played on both MTV and the Disney Channel at the same time, showing just how well Spears (and her armies of PR handlers) managed to <b>walk</b> <b>that</b> fine line between family-friendly pop idol and unabashed sex object." ...|$|E
