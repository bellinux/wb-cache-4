40|$|Estimou-se a área foliar do nastúrcio (Tropaeolum majus L.) por métodos não destrutivos e determinou-se a variação {{temporal}} da área foliar e do número {{de flores}} sob duas densidades de plantas em dois experimentos, em estufa plástica, na UFSM. No primeiro experimento calculou-se a área foliar a partir da análise de 50 folhas, provenientes de dez plantas, através de imagens digitais, relacionando-a à estimativa da área foliar feita a partir de discos foliares. Correlacionou-se também a área foliar à medida de quatro diagonais das folhas: medida sobre a nervura principal, perpendicular à nervura principal e duas medidas transversais à nervura principal. Obteve-se coeficiente de determinação (r²) de 0, 94 (p Two experiments {{were conducted in}} a plastic greenhouses in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, to estimate the nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus L.) leaf area through non destructive methods, {{as well as to}} study the leaf area and flower number variation in time, in two planting densities. In the first experiment, leaf area was assessed using 50 leaves harvested out of ten plants through digital image. This calculated value was then compared to leaf area estimation obtained using leaf disks. In addition, leaf area was correlated to the following leaf diagonals: <b>main</b> <b>rib,</b> perpendicular to the <b>main</b> <b>rib,</b> and two transversal measures to the <b>main</b> <b>rib.</b> A determination coefficient (r²) of 0, 94 (p< 0, 05) was obtained for leaf area calculated through digital images and leaf disks. The leaf area formula 0, 8906 x², where x corresponds to the measure on the <b>main</b> <b>rib,</b> presented the largest determination coefficient (r² = 0, 99; p< 0, 05) among the four tested diagonals. In the second experiment, two plant densities were tested: 0. 60 x 0. 50 m and 0. 30 x 0. 25 respectively between plants and rows. For each plant density, leaf area was estimated using the equation adjusted for the length of the <b>main</b> <b>rib.</b> <b>Main</b> <b>rib</b> was measured in all leaves larger than 5 cm of four plants. Logistics models were adjusted for leaf area and flower number variation in time. Flowers were harvested in 1 m². The smallest plant density provided a leaf area for plant (6932 cm²), with maximum at 47 days after transplanting (DAT) and 695 degree-day (GD), larger than the largest density (3129 cm 2), with maximum at 42 DAT and 622 GD. Blooming took place before plants reached the maximum leaf area and the largest flower production was obtained in the largest plant density...|$|R
