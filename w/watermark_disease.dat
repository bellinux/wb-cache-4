50|$|The white willow, S. alba, is very {{sensitive}} to <b>watermark</b> <b>disease,</b> while the crack willow, S. fragilis, is considerably less so. Hybrids of these two species have shown intermediate sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|White willows are fast-growing, but {{relatively}} short-lived, being susceptible to several diseases, including <b>watermark</b> <b>disease</b> {{caused by the}} bacterium Brenneria salicis (named because of the characteristic 'watermark' staining in the wood; syn. Erwinia salicis) and willow anthracnose, caused by the fungus Marssonina salicicola. These diseases can be a serious problem on trees grown for timber or ornament.|$|E
50|$|The {{bacterium}} {{is known}} to cause 'watermark disease' in willow (Salix ssp.) trees. <b>Watermark</b> <b>disease</b> affects infected trees by occluding the xylem vessels, impeding circulation. Early signs of the disease are wilting or dried-out, dead leaves on intermittent branches throughout the tree's crown. Cross sections from affected branches show a watery, transparent discoloration to an orange-brown staining in the wood. Cross sections of a killed tree's main stem are blanched completely white.|$|E
40|$|Willows in the Flemish {{region are}} {{threatened}} by the <b>watermark</b> <b>disease,</b> a wood disease caused by the bacterium Brenneria salicis (Hauben et al. Syst Appl Microbiol 21 : 384 - 397, 1998). Affected trees are observed to grow at specific sites which seem more sensitive to periodical watermark symptom development than other sites. In this study we aim at revealing abiotic site factors that could {{play a role in}} triggering the <b>watermark</b> <b>disease.</b> During three consecutive years we analyzed stands of young isogenic willows (Salix alba L. cv. Lichtenvoorde), which were planted on four different sites in an agricultural environment. These test sites were chosen, based on the occurrence/absence of <b>watermark</b> <b>disease</b> in the old willows that grow on these sites. Two sites had old willow pollards with clear watermark symptoms, and on the two other sites the old willows were unaffected. Differences in abiotic characteristics between the sites were analysed and their effects on the nutrient status in willow were measured in the isogenic willows that were newly planted. Brenneria salicis-specific multiplex PCR revealed the presence of this pathogenic bacterium in both the old and the freshly planted young willows. At each site, the physical and chemical characteristics of soil and groundwater were investigated; the young tree growth was monitored and nutritional status of the willow plantings was assessed by foliar analysis. Physical soil properties including soil type and profile water availability, and chemical soil analysis were unable to explain differences between healthy and affected sites. Diseased sites, however, had significantly higher N concentrations and traces of herbicides in the groundwater. In young trees, foliar levels of N and S were always greater at the affected sites, while P contents were lower. Dry mass based N concentration in the leaves of the newly planted trees increased systematically over the years, but more at affected than at healthy sites. Also, chlorophyll content was significantly greater at the affected sites. Growth rate of the young isogenic trees was twice as fast at the diseased sites. The presented data suggest that application of fertilisers in agriculture causes an imbalance in the nutritional status of Salix alba L. Excess nitrogen makes this species fast-growing, reflected by an average foliar N:P ratio > 10, and more susceptible for <b>watermark</b> <b>disease,</b> indicated by an average foliar N:Ca ratio exceeding 1. 5...|$|E
40|$|Eighty-six {{isolates}} of Erwinia salicis, {{the causal}} agent of <b>watermark</b> <b>disease</b> of willow, {{were obtained from}} culture collections and collected from various willow plantations in south-east England. These isolates were characterized by their reaction in a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, by enzyme electrophoresis, and for lysis {{by a panel of}} five bacteriophage. Eighty-one isolates had similar characteristics and clustered at a level of similarity of at least 60 %. Five isolates were found to have less than 20 % similarity to the other E. salicis. Antiserum raised against E. salicis (NCPPB 2535) was found to be specific to E. salicis and did not cross-react with other bacteria tested. No geographical clustering of electrotypes was found: however, Dutch and English isolates could be distinguished by bacteriophage typing. The local distribution of electrotypes collected from diseased trees suggests that the bacterium is spread via the propagating material and that tree to tree spread is rare...|$|E
40|$|Brenneria salicis {{has been}} studied in willow wood only in {{relation}} to <b>watermark</b> <b>disease.</b> In this pathogenic condition, the bacterium occurs at high concentrations. Pathogenicity of B. salicis is still uncontrollable and the disease unpredictable because the plant-bacteria interaction is not understood. Thanks to molecular techniques B. salicis can be detected at low concentrations, which are found in most non-pathogenic interactions. Brenneria salicis was identified and traced with a new specific three-primer polymerase chain reaction and its identity and relative concentration in biological samples confirmed through {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} profiling. Brenneria salicis was found in symptomless willows sampled randomly in Flanders agricultural areas, in young nursery willows, and also in poplar (Populus) and alder (Alnus). It harboured the nitrogenase reductase gene NifH and promoted growth and chlorophyll in willow. Inoculated luminescence-marked B. salicis circulated through the whole plant without inducing disease and exuded at the leaf margins. Other willow endophytes identified were Rahnella, Sphingomonas and Methylobacterium. In conclusion, because endophytic B. salicis is generally observed in willow, disease must not be dependent on infection. Leaf-to-leaf spread is proposed as an important mechanism for spread of B. salicis...|$|E
40|$|The <b>watermark</b> <b>disease,</b> {{caused by}} Brenneria salicis (formerly Erwinia salicis), is of {{significant}} concern wherever tree-forming willows are grown or occur naturally. The movement of infected, asymptomatic cuttings {{is a major}} cause of pathogen dispersal. A reliable and sensitive diagnostic procedure is necessary for the safe movement of willow planting material. We derived primers from the nucleotide sequence of the 16 S rRNA gene of B. salicis {{for the development of a}} PCR to detect this pathogen. One set of primers, Es 1 a-Es 4 b, directed the amplification of a 553 -bp fragment from B. salicis genomic DNA as well as B. salicis cells. PCR products were not observed when genomic DNA was tested for 27 strains of other, related plant-associated bacteria. Genomic fingerprinting by amplification fragment length polymorphism of B. salicis strains, originating from four different countries, and related Brenneria, Pectobacterium, and Erwinia strains revealed a very high similarity among the B. salicis genomes, indicating that the spread of the pathogen is mainly due to the transportation of infected cuttings. The PCR had to be preceded by a DNA extraction in order to detect the pathogen in the vascular fluid of willows. The minimum number of cells that could be detected from vascular fluid was 20 CFU/ml. The PCR assays proved to be very sensitive and reliable in detecting B. salicis in willow plant material...|$|E
