500|$|There {{was this}} huge scandal that {{originally}} [...] "Halo" [...] {{was meant to}} go to Leona. That was never the case... That song was written for Beyoncé. What happened was that Beyoncé waited long enough to record that song... I thought {{this would be a}} brilliant first single for Leona, which it would have... <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> foolishly say to Leona's camp, [...] "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I just {{want to know if you}} like it enough to consider it". I sent it to them and they flipped on it. They loved it and instantly said they wanted to do it. I was like, [...] "Wait, wait, wait, no, it's not free yet!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Snowden {{was asked}} in a January 2014 {{interview}} about returning to the U.S. to face the charges in court, as Obama had suggested a few days prior. Snowden explained why he rejected the request: [...] "What he doesn't say are that the crimes that he's charged me with are crimes that don't allow me to make my case. They don't allow me to defend myself in an open court {{to the public and}} convince a jury that <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to their benefit. ... So it's, I would say, illustrative that the President would choose to say someone should face the music when he knows the music is a show trial." [...] Snowden's legal representative, Jesselyn Radack, wrote that [...] "the Espionage Act effectively hinders a person from defending himself before a jury in an open court." [...] She said that the [...] "arcane World War I law" [...] was never meant to prosecute whistleblowers, but rather spies who sold secrets to enemies for profit.|$|E
2500|$|On January 22, 2016, Anselmo {{ended the}} [...] "Dimebash" [...] Dimebag Darrell tribute show by giving a Nazi salute and {{screaming}} the words [...] "white power" [...] to the crowd. The incident {{was captured by}} an audience member's cell phone camera and the video was posted on YouTube. Anselmo later claimed he was joking about drinking [...] "white wine". Anselmo commented on the YouTube video, writing: In an interview with Eddie Trunk on Sirius XM on December 15, 2016, Anselmo claimed he was being taunted throughout the show by [...] "two or three little hecklers" [...] who were standing near the stage. He stated that the hecklers called him all sorts of names throughout the show, {{and by the end}} he said he'd lost his patience. On the show Anselmo said, [...] "When people start screaming 'racist' {{over and over and over}} and over again at me, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> show them exactly what [...] the ugliest possible thing I could think of at the time was." ...|$|E

2500|$|Boam {{abandoned}} King's parallel story {{structure for}} The Dead Zones screenplay, turning the plot into separate episodes. Boam told writer Tim Lucas in 1983, [...] "King's book {{is longer than}} it needed to be. The novel sprawls and it's episodic. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> use that episodic quality, because I saw The Dead Zone as a triptych." [...] His script was revised and condensed four times by Cronenberg, who eliminated large portions of the novel's story, including plot points about Johnny Smith having a brain tumor. Cronenberg, Boam, and Hill had script meetings to revise the screenplay page by page. Boam's [...] "triptych" [...] in the screenplay surrounds three acts: the introduction of Johnny Smith before his car accident and after he awakes from a coma, a story about Smith assisting a sheriff track down the Castle Rock Killer, and finally Johnny deciding to confront the politician Stillson. Boam said that he enjoyed writing the character development for Smith, having him struggle with the responsibility of his psychic abilities, and ultimately give up his life for the greater good. [...] "It was this theme that made me like the book, and I particularly enjoyed discovering it in what was essentially a genre piece, a work of exploitation," [...] he said. In Boam's first draft of the screenplay, Johnny doesn't die at the end, but rather has a vision about the Castle Rock Killer, who is still alive and escaped from prison. Cronenberg insisted that this [...] "trick ending" [...] be revised. Boam submitted the final draft of the screenplay on November 8, 1982.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{is not an}} insult," [...] said Keswick quietly. [...] "It was {{a service}} of--of affection. I saw that you were annoyed and troubled by Mr Croft's failure to keep his engagement, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> simply--" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{leapt to}} my feet at that. His derision cut me like a whip. If <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> the act of a braggart, yet it almost seems I could do no less to bolster up my former boasting--or what into boasting they had translated.|$|E

5000|$|Regarding the portrait-like {{format of}} the works, he noted, [...] "Posing for a photograph, people already display a certain formality. It is already {{something}} artificial. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> increase this artificiality and this sense of formalism." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] he answered. [...] "In Mr. Dowling's place I {{should have}} done the same thing. Every one with his way in life to make must look out for himself.

6000|$|Austin {{smiled at}} him. [...] "We'll both {{be guilty of}} some sentimental {{nonsense}} we may be sorry for afterwards if we continue in that strain, my friend.

60|$|I took to {{my heels}} to interfere, and perhaps I had done {{better to have}} waited where I was, for I was the means of cutting off the madman's last escape.

60|$|In the meanwhile, since I {{was here}} and since M. le Marquis was unconscious, I {{proceeded}} {{then and there}} to take the precaution which prudence had dictated, and without which, seeing this man's treachery and Theodore's villainy, I should undoubtedly have ended my days as a convict. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to search M. le Marquis's pockets for anything that might subsequently prove useful to me.|$|E
6000|$|... '"I {{am sorry}} for you," [...] said be.

6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment, and leaned {{somewhat}} heavily upon the balustrade {{with his eyes}} fixed on the dusky form of the negro.
