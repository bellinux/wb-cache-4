5|$|Merrick {{concluded}} that his only {{escape from the}} workhouse might be through the world of human novelty exhibitions. He knew of a Leicester music hall comedian and proprietor named Sam Torr. Merrick wrote to Torr, who came and visited him at the workhouse. Torr decided {{that he could make}} money exhibiting Merrick; although, to retain Merrick's novelty, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> travelling exhibit. To this end, he organised a group of managers for Merrick: music hall proprietor J. Ellis, travelling showman George Hitchcock, and fair owner Sam Roper. On 3 August 1884, Merrick departed the workhouse to start his new career.|$|E
5|$|Still {{in pursuit}} of the debris of the enemy force, late on 13 February, Napoleon {{received}} reports that Marmont's Corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at Étoges. The Emperor deduced that the enemy force before him <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> much reduced one and promptly decided to go to Marmont's aid. The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 o'clock in the morning, leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue the pursuit of the enemy. Taking with him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy's Cavalry Reserve, Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps.|$|E

In 2001, the Festival's 21-member board of directors had voted for his daughter, Eva Wagner-Pasquier, to succeed him. Wolfgang Wagner, however, proposed to hand control over to his second wife, Gudrun, and their daughter Katharina. Gudrun died in 2007. No successor was named at that time, but it was speculated that Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina would eventually be named as joint directors of the festival. Directors have stated that preference will be given to descendants of Richard Wagner, and that a non-descendant <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> clearly better candidate.|$|E

His purpose was to build a Catholic university, in a world where the major Catholic universities on the European continent had recently been secularised, and most universities in the English-speaking world were Protestant. For a university to claim legitimacy in the larger world, it would have to support research and publication free from church censorship; however, for a university to be a safe place for the education of Catholic youth, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> place in which the teachings of the Catholic church were respected and promoted.|$|E

25|$|Sheldon {{wrote that}} the daily report of the 4th Army claimed that the Allied attack had been a costly failure, which was hyperbole. The attackers had {{advanced}} , two defensive positions had been overrun and heavy artillery had severely bombarded German Eingreifdivisionen moving behind the front line. On the Gheluvelt Plateau, the German defence was most successful and despite {{the loss of the}} observation posts on Bellewaarde Ridge, the Eingreifdivisionen of Gruppe Wytschaete had not been needed. The Germans had proved capable of powerful and determined counter-attacks and the success of the defence of the plateau compromised a further British advance in the north, by leaving it vulnerable to enfilade fire by small arms and observed artillery-fire. A British advance across the Gheluvelt Plateau <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> slow process of preparatory bombardments and limited advances. British and French commanders considered the attack to be {{the first of a series}} of blows which would lead to an inevitable German collapse and German commanders were concerned at the demands that the battle made on their troops.|$|E

According to Randazza, the website was used for satirical purposes and its owner was not attempting to profit from it. Randazza wrote that an individual <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pathetic idiot to come under the impression that his client's website was directly affiliated with Beck, contending that the website's domain name could not be confused with the [...] "Glenn Beck" [...] trademark except to [...] "a moron in a hurry".|$|E

[...] Miller also became less effective as the season progressed late, with his strikeout rate decreasing and walk rate increasing.

[...] He's been exactly what we’ve needed up to this point. [...] Fortunately we haven’t needed that long outing." [...] Mozeliak added that [...] "second-guessing the roster doesn’t have traction. [...] His role was always that insurance. [...] There were a lot of question marks as we were going into this on exactly how our rotation was going to unfold. [...] The fact that everybody has stepped up changed the dynamic." ...|$|E

500|$|Simon Callow, who portrayed Dickens, was {{considered}} apt since he possessed extensive {{knowledge of the}} author and had experience playing the character and recreating his public readings. Callow contended that for him to agree to play Dickens, the script <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sufficiently high quality. When he heard that the author was to feature in Doctor Who his heart [...] "sank" [...] as he felt fiction {{has a tendency to}} posit the author as [...] "a kind of all-purpose Victorian literary character and really understand little, if anything, about him, his life or his books". Director Euros Lyn noted that the material being of interest to Callow was key to getting him involved. Promoting his role in Doctor Who, Callow stated that writer Mark Gatiss knew [...] "exactly what Dickens is all about" [...] and [...] "very cleverly connects his idealism... with the Doctor's desire to save the world". Callow was also pleased that the episode portrayed Dickens as he was towards the end of his life: ill and sad rather than energetic. In the 2011 episode [...] "The Wedding of River Song", Callow returned to reprise his role as Dickens briefly.|$|E
500|$|On 29 September 1939, {{soon after}} the start of the war, Godfrey {{circulated}} a memorandum that, [...] "bore all the hallmarks of... Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming", according to historian Ben Macintyre. It was called the Trout Memo and compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to fly fishing. The memo contained a number of schemes to be considered for use against the Axis powers to lure U-boats and German surface ships towards minefields. Number 28 on the list was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy; the suggestion is similar to Operation Mincemeat, the successful 1943 plan to conceal the intended invasion of Italy from North Africa, although that idea was developed by Charles Cholmondoley in October 1942. The recommendation in the Trout Memo was titled: [...] "A Suggestion (not a very nice one)", and continued: [...] "The following suggestion is used in a book by Basil Thomson: a corpse dressed as an airman, with despatches in his pockets, could be dropped on the coast, supposedly from a parachute that has failed. I understand there is no difficulty in obtaining corpses at the Naval Hospital, but, of course, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fresh one." ...|$|E
500|$|Niffenegger is {{an artist}} {{who teaches at the}} Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She {{produced}} some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that The Time Traveler's Wife <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> novel: [...] "I got the idea for the title, and when I draw I have this big drawing table covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. So I wrote down this title and after a while I started to think about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, so I decided to write a novel." [...] She was intrigued by the title because [...] "it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel Man and Time: [...] "Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife." [...] Drawing her central theme from this image, she says, [...] "Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time." [...] Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.|$|E

500|$|On {{the basis}} of such assessments, {{researchers}} such as Cheryl Glenn, Professor at the Pennsylvania State University, argue that Aspasia {{seems to have been}} the only woman in classical Greece to have distinguished herself in the public sphere and must have influenced Pericles in the composition of his speeches. Some scholars believe that Aspasia opened an academy for young women of good families or even invented the Socratic method. However, Robert W. Wallace, Professor of classics at Northwestern University, underscores that [...] "we cannot accept as historical the joke that Aspasia taught Pericles how to speak and hence was a master rhetorician or philosopher". According to Wallace, the intellectual role Aspasia was given by Plato may have derived from comedy. Kagan describes Aspasia as [...] "a beautiful, independent, brilliantly witty young woman capable of holding her own in conversation with the best minds in Greece and of discussing and illuminating any kind of question with her husband". Roger Just, a classicist and Professor of social anthropology at the University of Kent, believes that Aspasia was an exceptional figure, but her example alone is enough to underline the fact that any woman who was to become the intellectual and social equal of a man <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hetaera. According to Sr. Prudence Allen, a philosopher and seminary professor, Aspasia moved the potential of women to become philosophers one step forward from the poetic inspirations of Sappho.|$|E
500|$|Under Bruce the Australian {{government}} also moved {{to its new}} permanent home in the planned federal city of Canberra. Plans for a new federal capital had been circulated {{since the time of}} Federation, and a site on the Molonglo River was selected in 1913. Design and construction had proceeded slowly due to World War I as well as funding and management problems. Bruce was a committed advocate of the new capital, however, stating: [...] "For the purposes of Federation it was essential that there should be some central point of nationhood, suitable to Australia as a nation... and sooner or later there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> national capital, overriding State boundaries and State prejudices." [...] This came to pass on 9 May 1927 when the Federal Parliament moved to its new premises in Canberra; Bruce had moved himself and his wife to The Lodge a few days earlier. At the Federal Parliament's opening ceremony, Bruce decided that voices of the clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate were too heavily accented, and determined that he would personally welcome the Duke of York and co-open the new building a move that was criticised by several parliamentarians. The business of transferring government and cabinet operations to the new capital proceeded slowly over 1927 and 1928. This was an administrative task that occupied a significant proportion of the government's time in those years, with many departments only very gradually transferring from Melbourne, much to Bruce's consternation.|$|E
