40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} test was carried out on an aspect ratio 6 wing {{equipped}} with Gurney flaps and trailing edge T-strips. The test was conducted at the University of Washington Aeronautical Laboratory’s 8 x 12 foot low-speed wind tunnel at Reynolds numbers of 1. 95 x 106, 1. 02 x 106 and 0. 51 x 106. The NACA 23012 test wing was unswept and untwisted with a 90 inch span and a constant chord of 15 inches. Gurney flap heights of 0. 21 %, 0. 52 %, 1. 04 %, 1. 46 %, 2. 08 %, 3. 33 %, 4. 00 % & 5. 00 % chord were tested on the model. T-strip heights of 0. 42 %, 1. 04 %, 1. 67 %, 2. 08 %, 2. 92 %, 4. 17 % & 5. 00 % chord were also tested. Results showed that Gurney flaps produced a positive increment in lift coefficient, a negative shift in the zero-lift angle of attack, {{and an increase in}} the wing maximum lift coefficient. T-strips produced an increase in the slope of the lift curve and an increase in maximum lift coefficient, but produced no shift in the wing zero-lift angle of attack. Gurney flaps produced a negative (nose-down) shift in the pitching moment curve and a rearward shift in the <b>wing</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>center.</b> T-strips also produced a rearward shift in the <b>wing</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>center,</b> but produced no increment in the pitching moment coefficient near zero lift.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the 9 -by 12 -inch blowdown tunnel of the Langley 19 -foot pressure tunnel to determine the aerody-namic characteristics of a sting-mounted Douglas Aircraft Company (DAC) store in the presence of, but not attached to, an unswept semispan canti-levered wing of aspect ratio 4. 0. The influence of the store on the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing was also obtained. The store was located at two lateral and three vertical positions (with and without pylon) beneath the wing, and tests were conducted at angles of attack from- 3 ' to 12 O and at Mach numbers between 0. 75 and 1. 96. Test Reynolds numbers were between 1. 1 x 10 and 1. 5 x 10. 6 6 The presence of the store {{in the vicinity of}} the wing generally caused small changes in the slopes of the wing normal-force and bending-moment coefficient through the Mach number range.

The results of a computational fluid dynamics study for 236 wings show that {{the position of the}} semispan <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>center</b> of a <b>wing</b> depends primarily on aspect ratio, taper ratio, and quarter-chord sweep angle.

40|$|A closed-form {{solution}} for the downwash in the plane of symmetry of an elliptically loaded line is given. This theoretical result is derived from Prandtl's lifting-line theory and assumes that: (1) a three-dimensional wing can {{be replaced by a}} straight lifting line, (2) this line is elliptically loaded, and (3) the trailing wake is a flat-sheet which does not roll up. The first assumption is reasonable for distances greater than about 1 chord from the <b>wing</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>center.</b> The second assumption is satisfied by any combination of wing twist, spanwise camber variation, or planform that approximates elliptic loading. The third assumption is justified only for high-aspect-ratio wings at low lift coefficients and downstream distances less than about 1 span from the aerodynamic center. It is shown, however, that assuming the wake to be fully rolled up gives downwash values reasonably close to those of the flat-sheet solution derived in this paper. The wing can therefore be modeled as a single horseshoe vortex with the same lift and total circulation as the equivalent ellipticity loaded line, and the predicted downwash will be a close approximation independent of aspect ratio and lift coefficient. The flat-sheet equation and the fully rolled up wake equation are both one-line formulas that predict the upwash field in front of the wing, as well as the downwash field behind it. These formulas are useful for preliminary estimates of the complex aerodynamic interaction between two wings (i. e., canard, tandem wing, and conventional aircraft) including the effects of gap and stagger...|$|E
