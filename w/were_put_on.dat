5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} {{to bolster}} the aims of Fortitude North, and overall this aspect of the plan was successful. German documents, {{captured}} after the war, showed that, although they did not believe Norway to be the main invasion target, the Fortitude North units were considered capable of a diversionary attack. As a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> higher alert and were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|E

Then the plastering, being soft when it <b>is</b> <b>put</b> <b>on,</b> works into the cracks, and thus clings to the wood when it is dry and hard. If plastering <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> to smooth boards, or a smooth wall, it would all fall off again very easily." ...|$|R

In Athens, however, the ambassadors <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> trial and then executed; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well.

5|$|About half {{of those}} {{who lost their lives}} on the Wall were killed in the first five years after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E
