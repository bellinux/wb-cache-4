25|$|After {{losing the}} trios title Black Warrior {{had a hard}} time finding any direction, at one point he {{publicly}} pleaded with CMLL to turn him rudo via an interview for Box y Lucha magazine. In early 2006 Warrior began working with Místico and the two quickly earned a shot at the CMLL World Tag Team Championship, held by Averno and Mephisto. During the third fall of the match Místico accidentally collided with Black Warrior causing their team to lose. Weeks later, during a rematch, Black Warrior turned on Místico, attacking him during the match and then <b>walking</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> storyline with Místico was further intensified when Black Warrior defeated Místico for the NWA World Middleweight Championship on May 12, 2006. After months of scripted hostility between Warrior and Místico the two faced off in a Luchas de Apuestas (bet fight), mask versus mask match at CMLL's 73rd Anniversary show. The match saw Místico defeat Black Warrior, two falls to one, to win Black Warrior's mask. For {{the first time in his}} career Warrior was forced to unmask and show his face in public. Following the loss of his mask Black Warrior made several successful title defenses against Místico until finally losing the NWA World Middleweight Title back to him on April 29, 2007. After the feud with Místico ended Black Warrior worked as an upper-card rudo although not with any major storylines. In late 2007 Black Warrior became involved in a storyline that saw Warrior and Rey Bucanero team up to take on Shocker and Lizmark Jr. in a tag team Luchas de Apuestas with the hair of the losing team on the line. On December 7, 2007 Warrior and Bucanero lost and had their heads shaved completely bald as a result of the stipulation, in the main event of CMLL's pay-per-view Sin Piedad (Without Mercy).|$|E
