5|$|The {{remainder}} of the war <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> Stuart, achieving no further successes against submarines. Upon the armistice the full details of his Victoria Cross action were revealed and, in 1919, he was mentioned in despatches {{in recognition of the}} service he had performed during the Q-ship operations. As further recognition of his overall efforts against the German submarine campaign, the French government presented him with the Croix de Guerre.|$|E
25|$|The band <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> {{the first}} four months of 1991, during which time two more members departed. William D. Drake played his final concert with the band on 2 May at The Venue in New Cross (going on to join the band Nervous and, in 2001, embarking on a long-delayed solo career). Christian Hayes (had joined up-and-coming indie-psychedelic band Levitation) played his own final gig as a Cardiac in Oxford on 16 May: {{although}} Cardiacs and Levitation were friendly with each other and had even toured together, Hayes had finally found it impossible to balance the demands of both bands. Both Hayes and Drake would continue to be associated with Cardiacs, and would occasionally guest with the band at selected live concerts many years later.|$|E
25|$|The NEFA (North-East Frontier Agency) {{was created}} in 1954. The issue <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> nearly a decade, with a period of cordial Sino-Indian relations, but its {{resurgence}} in 1960 was a factor leading to the Sino-Indian border conflict of 1962. During the war in 1962, China captured most of the area of Arunachal Pradesh. However, China soon declared victory, withdrew back to the McMahon Line and returned Indian prisoners of war in 1963. It is believed by some commentators that Mao wanted to intimidate India for its continued support of the Dalai Lama, and for its stance on Tibet being an independent state and not a Chinese territory. There was a significant influx of Tibetan refugees into India, primarily to Dharamshala in North India.|$|E

25|$|It <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> {{another two}} years, until June 2009, when two Creature Creature concerts in Tokyo and Osaka were held {{starting}} the Simone and the Wrath tour series, but with different a line-up, featuring guitarist Hiro (from La'cryma Christi), guitarist Shinobu (from Guy's Family), bassist Hitoki (from Kuroyume), and drummer Sakura (from L'Arc~en~Ciel). In August, Morrie {{and the other}} Dead End members reunite, and held a their first concert in almost twenty years. In November they released their new album and did not stop with activity in upcoming years. In December, with Creature Creature, Morrie held two concerts in Shanghai, China, and performed at the Jack in the Box and Beat Shuffle events at Nippon Budokan and Omiya Sonic City respectively.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{finishing}} his stint with Second City in 1988, Mochrie's career <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> a while as he {{spent some time}} with his new wife and child. In 1989, he auditioned for the new British Channel 4 improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, but did not make the cut. Mochrie has stated that the audition was a good learning experience because while improv is about setting other people up to be funny, auditions should be about giving yourself the chance to stand out. He moved to Los Angeles the following year, and again auditioned for Whose Line, this time making the cut and was asked to fly to London. He appeared on one episode and was again let go. The third time he auditioned, he earned a regular spot on the show. He spent seven years as a regular on Whose Line Is It Anyway? and remained a cast member until the show's end in 1998.|$|E
500|$|Paraguay <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> 5 {{years under}} interim {{governor}} Martín de Barúa, seen as {{friendly to the}} settlers and hostile to the Jesuits. [...] When he was replaced by Ignacio de Soroeta, however, Paraguay refused its new governor. [...] Fernando de Mómpo y Zayas had spread ideas among the populace {{that the power of}} the people - the común - was superior to that of the governor and even the King. [...] The comuneros held new elections to the town council of Asunción, won the seats, and resumed self-rule. [...] A replacement governor sent in 1732, Agustín de Ruyloba, was killed by the comuneros. [...] However, the comunero movement split several times. [...] The notables of Asunción, who had been happy to defy the colonial authorities when the town council was run by them, now feared the total breakdown of order, as the poorer Paraguayans started to loot the estates and property of any notable not thought to be sufficiently pro-comunero. [...] The inability of Asunción to trade {{with the rest of the}} Spanish Empire led to an economic crisis, as well. [...] When colonial forces finally moved on Asunción, the divided comuneros scattered and fled, with most of the Asunción faction joining the government forces in a bid for clemency.|$|E

500|$|During the insurgency's Ramadan Offensive, a {{military}} Chinook transport helicopter carrying 32 soldiers {{was shot down}} with an SA-7 missile near Fallujah on 2 November. Thirteen were killed and the rest wounded. Following the shootdown, Fallujah <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> a few months. On 5 November, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that the Marines would return to Iraq early {{the next year and}} would take over Anbar Province. As the Marines prepared to move in, there was a growing consensus that the 82nd had lost control of the area, although the only real problem was Fallujah. Some Marine commanders, like Major General James Mattis and Lieutenant Colonel Carl Mundy, criticized the Army's tactics as [...] "hard-nosed" [...] and [...] "humiliating the Sunni population", promising that the Marines would act differently. Late that November, Operators from A Squadron SAS launched a heliborne assault on a remote farm in Al Anbar province, after they came under fire from insurgents inside, air support was called in and hit the farm, after it was cleared; seven dead insurgents were found whom American intelligence believed were foreign fighters. [...] Riots in Fallujah and Ramadi followed the December capture of Saddam Hussein. The capture of Saddam created significant problems in Anbar: instead of weakening the insurgency, many Anbaris were outraged over what they saw as the degrading treatment of Saddam. Saddam's removal allowed the insurgency to recruit fighters who had previously opposed the Americans but had remained passive out of hatred for Saddam. As Saddam loyalists were killed or captured, leadership positions went to AQI-affiliated hardliners such as Abdullah Abu Azzam al-Iraqi, who was directly responsible for murdering government officials in 2004. While the Ba'ath Party continued {{to play a major role}} in the insurgency, the balance of power had shifted to various religious leaders who were advocating a jihad against American forces.|$|E
2500|$|The {{start of}} 1985 <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> the band as members spent time apart in Stockholm, Sydney and Jamaica.

2500|$|Due to {{threat from}} Poland, the front with the Soviets <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> {{more than a}} month. There were minor {{incidents}} involving scouts or outpost guards. The Red Army used the time to reorganize and strengthen their forces, using natural barriers, like plentiful lakes, rivers, and hills, enhanced with trenches and barbed wires, to secure their position. They also had fortifications built during World War I about [...] south of Daugavpils. The Soviets had larger forces: Lithuanians had two infantry regiments and five separate battalions; the Soviets had six regiments and one separate battalion. The Lithuanians together with Poles planned to push for Daugavpils starting August 9, but the plans were delayed until August 23.|$|E

2500|$|The Middle Eastern theatre <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> {{the first}} few months of the war until Italy's {{declaration}} of war in June 1940. The Italian forces in North and East Africa greatly outnumbered the British and Wavell's policy was therefore one of [...] "flexible containment" [...] to buy time to build up adequate forces to take the offensive. Having fallen back in front of Italian advances from Libya, Eritrea and Ethiopia, Wavell mounted successful offensives into Libya (Operation Compass) in December 1940 and Eritrea and Ethiopia in January 1941. By February 1941, his Western Desert Force under Lieutenant General Richard O'Connor had defeated the Italian Tenth Army at Beda Fomm taking 130,000 prisoners and appeared to be on the verge of overrunning the last Italian forces in Libya, which would have ended all direct Axis control in North Africa. His troops in East Africa also had the Italians under pressure and at the end of March his forces in Eritrea under William Platt won the decisive battle of the campaign at Keren which led to the occupation of the Italian colonies in Ethiopia and Somaliland.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main event}} match between the Mexican {{team and the}} Japanese La Fiebre Amarilla started out with the tecnico side showing a bit of unity as Stuka Jr. wore a mask that was a {{combination}} of his own and the mask style Rey Cometa had worn until September, 2012. Namajague also wore a mask created specifically for the occasion, featuring long, bright red hair attached to his mask. Okumura and Namajague sought to get an easy advantage by jumping their opponents before the bell, but based on the two teams previous history Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa were prepared for it and took control of the match for the early parts of the match. After several minutes of being on the defensive La Fievre Amarilla double teamed their way into control of the match and won the first fall of the match. The rudo duo continued to dominate throughout most of the second fall, but this time the Mexican team was able to overcome this and even the match with one fall to each team. Initially the crowd <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> the match, {{but by the end of}} the second fall the Mexico City fans were solidly cheering [...] "Mexico" [...] to support the home team. At one point a mistake between Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa saw the team almost fight each other, each thinking the other one intentionally knocked them down. After a few moments cooler heads prevailed and Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa turned their attention back towards their Japanese rivals for the third and final fall. In the third fall Stuka Jr. pinned Okumura to eliminate him from the match, while he himself being pinned by Namajague only moments later. This left Namajague and Rey Cometa in the ring, with the next elimination deciding which side lost the match. After several moments of high flying, fast paced wrestling Rey Cometa was able to execute a 450 degree splash off the top rope to Namajague for the final elimination. The crowd showed their appreciation for the performance of both Mexicans, cheering them on as brightly colored confetti dropped from the ceiling covering the defeated Okumura and Namajague. While Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa celebrated Okumura had all his hair shaved off while sitting in the middle of the ring, paying off on the [...] "bet" [...] he placed on the match. Subsequently, Namajague removed his wrestling mask to show the audience his face and announced that his name was Kyosuke Mikami, 29 years old and five years as a professional wrestler to close the show.|$|E
