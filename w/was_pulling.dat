5|$|On 30 May 2012, EVA Air Cargo Flight BR661 (Boeing 747-400F) clipped {{the tail}} of American Eagle Flight 4265 at Chicago O'Hare. The {{regional}} jet had arrived from Springfield, Mo., and was taxiing toward a gate at Terminal 3. The accident occurred around 1 p.m. CT. The incident occurred as the American Eagle jet <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> into Gate G20. Damage to the two aircraft appeared to be minor and both returned to service after repair.|$|E
5|$|Russia {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Ukraine in 1992 allowing it to continue using the Dnepr radars at Sevastopol and Mukachevo. The stations were run by Ukrainian personnel and data was sent to the headquarters of the Russian early warning system in Solnechnogorsk. In 2008 Russia announced that it <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> out of the agreement with Ukraine and that the last data given to Russia from the stations would be in 2009. The Ukrainian government announced that the stations were to be used part-time for space surveillance.|$|E
5|$|When it {{was clear}} at 03:00 that the German Army {{in front of the}} {{division}} <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> back, the first divisional unit to follow up was the 3rd Parachute Brigade. By 07:00 Bures was occupied by the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions and by 08:00 the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was in the Bois de Bavent. The rest of the division started advancing around the same time. The 4th Special Service Brigade headed for Troan and Saint Pair, while the 1st Special Service Brigade made for Bavent and Robehomme. In the north, the 6th Airlanding Brigade started moving along the road from Bréville to Merville.|$|E

5|$|After {{stalling}} offshore {{for almost}} a day, a mid- to upper-tropospheric trough over the central U.S. slowly pulled Tropical Storm Gordon northward then north-northeastward towards Florida's west coast. The storm made landfall between Ft. Myers and Naples with 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. The eastward component of the storm's movement increased, and Gordon moved northeastward onto the Florida Peninsula at 10 mph (17 km/h). The storm barely weakened as it crossed the landmass keeping its 50 mph (85 km/h) winds. Crossing the peninsula in a mere six hours, the storm continued to pick up speed. Early on November 17, back over the open ocean, the storm's central pressure began to fall. Improved organization was not apparent and wind shear <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> {{at the core of}} the deep convection when, on November 17, Gordon suddenly spawned 75 mph (120 km/h) winds and was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated {{in early}} 1993, when the teams in Arusha signed a full power sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF {{and other major}} opposition parties, but excluding the CDR. This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until {{free and fair elections}} could be held. The agreement was reasonably equitable given the balance of power at the time and Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition and the RPF all accepted it; however, the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed. MRND national secretary Mathieu Ngirumpatse announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting both the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha. The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger scale killing spree than those that had previously occurred. The violence engulfed the whole northwest of Rwanda and lasted for six days, with numerous houses burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed. Paul Kagame, reacting to stories brought to him first hand by survivors seeking refuge in rebel territory, announced that he <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six month cease-fire.|$|E
5|$|While the two Ferraris were delayed behind Hamilton, Alonso <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> {{away at the}} front, setting fastest laps on laps {{seven and}} fifteen. On lap 12, Robert Kubica was {{the first man to}} pit for fuel and fresh tyres, however he {{reported}} traction control problems four laps later and lost places. Alonso had extended his lead over Hamilton to 15 seconds by the first round of pitstops. He had experienced radio problems before refuelling, but these were fixed during the stop. The Renaults were circulating in eighth and tenth by the pit stops, with Fisichella ahead of Kovalainen. Button {{was one of the few}} drivers who started on the slower harder tyre and was dropping down the field, as Takuma Sato passed the Briton. All of the front runners were on the same tyre strategy, with Räikkönen being the first front runner to pit. He found himself behind Fisichella as he exited. A short pit stop by Hamilton enabled him to come out of the pits ahead of the Renault, leaving a car between himself and Räikkönen during the pit window. Heidfeld's late stop on lap 22 helped him stay ahead of Massa. The top five positions remained unchanged, however Hamilton's different strategy enabled him to escape Räikkönen and close in on leader Alonso at a second per lap. Despite pitting on lap 20, he set the fastest lap of the race on lap 22 in 1:36.701.|$|E

A lap later, Alesi, in his first race for Ferrari, swept past Patrese, but by then Senna <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> away. After ten laps, he had a lead of ten seconds over Prost.|$|E
25|$|Your phrase 'my copy is not mine' {{is not a}} bull. It is {{perfectly}} good English {{to use the same}} word in two different senses in one sentence, particularly when there is usage.

But incongruity of ideas (as {{in the case of the}} Irishman who <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> up the rope, and finding it did not finish, cried out that somebody had cut off the other end of it) is the genuine bull.|$|E
25|$|In May 2008, Shell {{announced}} that it <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> out of the project. It was announced in July 2008 that E.ON UK and DONG Energy would buy Shell's stake. Subsequently, on 16 October 2008, London Array announced the Abu Dhabi based Masdar would join E.ON as a joint venture party in the scheme. Under the agreement, Masdar purchased 40% of E.ON's half share of the scheme, giving Masdar a 20% stake in the project overall. The resultant ownership was 50% DONG Energy, 30% E.ON UK Renewables and 20% Masdar.|$|E

25|$|The tariff issue <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> the GOP apart. Roosevelt {{tried to}} {{postpone}} the issue, but Taft had to meet it head on in 1909 with the Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act. Eastern conservatives led by Nelson W. Aldrich wanted high tariffs on manufactured goods (especially woolens), while Midwesterners called for low tariffs. Aldrich tricked them by lowering the tariff on farm products, which outraged the farmers. Insurgent Midwesterners led by George Norris revolted against the conservatives led by Speaker Cannon. The Democrats won control of the House in 1910 as the rift between insurgents and conservatives widened.|$|E
25|$|As Virgil's train <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> out of Tucson {{on its way}} to California, gunfire was heard. Witnesses gave {{contradictory}} accounts {{about the}} number of men seen near the tracks and numbers of shots fired. Some said the Earps were armed after leaving Porter's Hotel and others said they were not. Witnesses saw men running with weapons but could not identify anyone in the dark. Wyatt said later that he and his deputies spotted Frank Stilwell and another man he believed to be Ike Clanton armed with shotguns lying on a flatcar.|$|E
25|$|Such fears proved unfounded, as Noda {{qualified}} {{within a}} second of Comas' time, {{and was the}} 25th fastest. But when David Brabham's best time in the Simtek was disallowed, Noda was bumped up to 24th on the grid, alongside Comas in 23rd. But in another department, he had comprehensively thrashed his more experienced teammate. Under braking, he <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> 4.1g, a Larrousse record, whereas Comas often pulled less than 3g. It showed how quickly he had got the hang of powerful Formula One brakes.|$|E

25|$|The {{dismissal}} of Kotomitsuki in July 2010 for involvement in illegal gambling on baseball left Kaiō {{as the only}} Japanese wrestler in the top two ranks.

On Day 10 of the Nagoya Sumo Tournament, Kaiō lost to fellow ōzeki Kotoōshū, and the next morning announced he <b>was</b> <b>pulling</b> out of the tournament with a 6–4 record, citing an injured left shoulder. However, he returned to hold his rank yet again in the September tournament.|$|E

The boys were hit while trying to remove their all-terrain vehicle which had gotten stuck on the tracks.
