5|$|The {{altering}} of the qibla <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> {{the reason}} the Rashidun caliph Umar, despite identifying the mosque which Muhammad used to ascend to Heaven upon his arrival at the Noble Sanctuary in 638, neither prayed facing it nor built any structure upon it. This was because {{the significance of that}} particular spot on the Noble Sanctuary was superseded in Islamic jurisprudence by the Kaaba in Mecca after the change of the qibla towards that site.|$|E
5|$|The transit circle {{was capable}} of {{determining}} both right ascension and declination of a star, unlike the more simple and common transit instrument that can only determine the right ascension. Such an instrument {{could also be used}} to set the Observatory’s clocks by observing standard stars whose position <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> known.|$|E

5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. He kept a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> the sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E
5|$|Other {{legislation}} {{of importance}} includes the Treason Act of 1351. It <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> the harmony of the reign that allowed {{a consensus on}} the definition of this controversial crime. Yet the most significant legal reform was probably that concerning the Justices of the Peace. This institution began before the reign of Edward III but, by 1350, the justices {{had been given the}} power not only to investigate crimes and make arrests, but also to try cases, including those of felony. With this, an enduring fixture in the administration of local English justice had been created.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} most of these fossils were the coastal cliffs around Lyme Regis, part of a {{geological}} formation known as the Blue Lias. This consists of alternating layers of limestone and shale, laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period (about 210–195million years ago). It {{is one of the}} richest fossil locations in Britain. The cliffs could be dangerously unstable, however, especially in winter when rain caused landslides. It <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> during the winter months that collectors were drawn to the cliffs because the landslides often exposed new fossils.|$|E

5|$|Amésqueta was {{extremely}} {{suspicious of the}} small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. He suspected that AjK'ixaw had betrayed them and that this <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> {{what had happened to}} Díaz and his men. As nightfall approached, low on rations, in a vulnerable location and with no sign of Díaz and his men, Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of the}} morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches. They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro Mártir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies. The battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4miles or 37.7km) north of Mopan.|$|E

25|$|The courses {{reported}} by both submarines were incorrect, because they reflected one {{leg of a}} zigzag being used by British ships to avoid submarines. Taken with a wireless intercept of more ships leaving Scapa Flow earlier in the night, they created the impression in the German High Command that the British fleet, whatever it was doing, was split into separate sections moving apart, which <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> as the Germans wished to meet it.|$|E
25|$|In colonialism, {{all social}} {{components}} are expressed through {{the articulation of}} the 'form of difference', and the colonial urban planning <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> implemented by the order of relationship between various ethnically, racially and economically urban dwellers. Karsten rejected this idea and began to include more indigenous elements intertwined with those typical European elements. In 1917, he presented the 'New Candi' plan, an extension plan of the Semarang's master plan to accommodate all ethnic groups {{according to their own}} habits. He produced a master plan for new suburbs in Batavia including the central city square.|$|E
25|$|The Alamein sector did {{not present}} such a broad front {{as had been}} the case in other desert battles, which <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> why Auchinleck had chosen to stand and fight there. Any {{armoured}} thrust would have to pass between the sea, in the north, and the Qattara Depression, in the south, which was impassable for tanks. The British defences were quite strong, but Rommel believed they had a weak point. The southern sector—between Munassib and Qaret El Himeimat—was lightly held and Rommel believed that it was lightly mined.|$|E

25|$|However, Mayer {{has written}} that it <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> unions' {{opposition}} to NAFTA overall that jeopardized organized labor's ability to influence the debate on labor standards in a significant way. During Clinton's presidential campaign, labor unions wanted NAFTA to include a side deal to provide {{for a kind of}} international social charter, a set of standards that would be enforceable both in domestic courts and through international institutions. Mickey Kantor, then U.S. trade representative, had strong ties to organized labor and believed that he could get unions to come along with the agreement, particularly if they were given a strong voice in the negotiation process.|$|E
25|$|Deeply {{affected}} by his dismissal from the Academy, Eakins' later career focused on portraiture, {{such as his}} 1905 Portrait of Professor William S. Forbes. His steadfast insistence on his own vision of realism, {{in addition to his}} notoriety from his school scandals, combined to hurt his income in later years. Even as he approached these portraits with the skill of a highly trained anatomist, what is most noteworthy is the intense psychological presence of his sitters. However, it <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> for this reason that his portraits were often rejected by the sitters or their families. As a result, Eakins came to rely on his friends and family members to model for portraits. His portrait of Walt Whitman (1887–1888) was the poet's favorite.|$|E
25|$|The {{convertible}} {{featured a}} removable rigid section over the passengers and a folding textile rear section with heatable rear glass window. Power operated, lowering the top required unlatching two header catches, power lowering the top, exiting the car (or reaching {{over to the}} right side latch), and folding down the rigid section manually. Mazda introduced with the convertible the first integral windblocker, a rigid panel that folded up from behind the passenger seats to block unwanted drafts from reaching the passengers — thereby extending the driving season for the car in open mode. The convertible also featured optional headrest mounted audio speakers and a folding leather snap-fastened tonneau cover. The convertible assembly <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> engineered and manufactured, and dropped into the ready body assembly as a complete unit — a first in convertible production.|$|E

25|$|Oral tales, not {{recorded}} until much later, include the widely reported and possibly mythical one that Livingstone used to beat corpses at funerals with his walking stick {{to make sure}} they were dead and not simply shamming. His wife defended him passionately, claiming he was charitable to the hungry and sick. Her defence is quite plausible: Livingstone was quick-tempered and may have been violent and kind at different times. However, his distribution of food may have been limited to the headmen appointed by him to control the estate workforce rather than general. Her defence was that Livingstone was good master, not a bad one as the commission claimed. The concept of the master-servant relationship was at the heart of colonial society, but this concept <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> what Chilembwe was fighting with his schools and self-help schemes, and ultimately why Livingstone was killed.|$|E
25|$|The philosopher C. T. K. Chari of Madras Christian College in Chennai, a {{specialist}} in parapsychology, argued that Stevenson was naive and that the case studies were undermined by his lack of local knowledge. Chari wrote {{that many of the}} cases had come from societies, such as that of India, where people believed in reincarnation, and that the stories were simply cultural artifacts; he argued that, for children in many Asian countries, the recall of a past life is the equivalent of an imaginary playmate. The philosopher Keith Augustine made a similar argument. Stevenson responded that it <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> those societies that listened to children's claims about past lives, which in Europe or North America would normally be dismissed without investigation. To address the cultural concern, he wrote European Cases of the Reincarnation Type (2003), which presented forty cases he had examined in Europe.|$|E
25|$|In May 1535, {{the newly}} elected Pope Paul III created Fisher Cardinal Priest of San Vitale, {{apparently}} {{in the hope of}} inducing Henry to ease Fisher's treatment. The effect <b>was</b> <b>precisely</b> the reverse: Henry forbade the cardinal's hat to be brought into England, declaring that he would send the head to Rome instead. In June a special commission for Fisher's trial was issued, and on Thursday, 17 June, he was arraigned in Westminster Hall before a court of seventeen, including Thomas Cromwell, Anne Boleyn's father, and ten justices. The charge was treason, in that he denied that the King was the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Since he had been deprived of his position of Bishop of Rochester by the Act of Attainder, he was treated as a commoner, and tried by jury. The only testimony was that of Richard Rich. John Fisher was found guilty and condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn.|$|E
