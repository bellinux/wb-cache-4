60|$|I had {{exchanged}} a glance with Mark {{in which it}} is possible that he read that my pity for him was untinged with contempt, though I know not why he should have cared; and as, presently, his sister got up and took her bedroom candlestick, he proposed that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to his study.

60|$|As I spoke Bastin {{pointed to}} the edge of the bush some {{hundreds}} of yards away, where we perceived brown figures slipping about among the trees. I suggested that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the mouth of our path, so as to have a line of retreat open in case of necessity, and await events. So we did and there stood still. By degrees the brown figures emerged on to the plain to the number of some hundreds, and we saw that they were both male and female. The women were clothed in nothing except flowers and a little girdle; the men were all armed with wooden weapons and also wore a girdle but no flowers. The children, of whom there were many, were quite naked.|$|E

I would rather that, by a great deal, than farming. All these books you have lent me, Walter, have shown me what great and noble deeds there are {{to be done in the}} world--I don't mean in fighting, you know, but in other ways.

60|$|We {{had hardly}} got here when father {{received}} a telegram {{saying he would}} have to come right back to New York. It was for something about his business--I don't know exactly what; you know I never understand those things, never want to. We had just got settled at the hotel, in some charming rooms, and mother and I, as you may imagine, were greatly annoyed. Father is extremely fussy, as you know, and his first idea, as soon as he found he should have to go back, was that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> with him. He declared he would never leave us in Paris alone, and that we must return and come out again. I don't know what he thought would happen to us; I suppose he thought we should be too extravagant. It's father's theory that we are always running up bills, whereas a little observation would show him that we wear the same old rags FOR MONTHS. But father has no observation; he has nothing but theories. Mother and I, however, have, fortunately, a great deal of practice, and we succeeded in making him understand that we wouldn't budge from Paris, and that we would rather be chopped into small pieces than cross that dreadful ocean again. So, at last, he decided to go back alone, and to leave us here for three months. But, to show you how fussy he is, he refused to let us stay at the hotel, and insisted that we should go into a family. I don't know what put such an idea into his head, unless it was some advertisement that he saw in one of the American papers that are published here.|$|E

40|$|Rees Davies’s {{questioning}} of the current fashion for talking about medieval states (Davies, 2003) is characteristically stimulating and persuasive. Not surprisingly, in view of his references to my essay on the historiography of the medieval state (Reynolds, 1997), I nev-ertheless find it not persuasive enough. 1 I agree {{with a lot of}} what he says but the main thrust of his argument seems to me to per-petuate the tendency of medieval historians to isolate themselves from discussions from which they could profit and to which they could have much to contribute. I quite agree in deploring the fashion for using the word state in discussions of medieval polities without any explanation of the cat-egory to which the supposed state belongs and why it belongs there.

60|$|It is not {{necessary}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to any feelings which might have operated upon him during his wife's lifetime, or {{during the period of}} his parliamentary career. His wife was now dead, and he no longer held a seat in Parliament. He had, indeed, all but abandoned his practice at the Bar, never putting himself forward for the ordinary business of a Chancery barrister. But, nevertheless, he spent the largest half of his life in his chambers, breakfasting there, reading there, writing there, and sleeping there. He did not altogether desert the lodge at Fulham, and the two girls who lived there. He would not even admit to them, or allow them to assert that he had not his home with them. Sometimes for two nights together, and sometimes for three, he would be at the villa,--never remaining there, however, during the day. But on Sundays it may almost be said that he was never at home. And hence arose the feeling that of all, this went the nearest to create discord between the father and the daughters. Sir Thomas was always in Southampton Buildings on Sundays. Did Sir Thomas go to church? The Miss Underwoods did go to church very regularly, and thought much of the propriety and necessity of such Sunday exercises. They could remember that in their younger days their father always had been there with them. They could remember, indeed, that he, with something of sternness, would require from them punctuality and exactness in this duty. Now and again,--perhaps four times in the year,--he would go to the Rolls Chapel. So much they could learn, But they believed that beyond that his Sundays were kept holy by no attendance at divine service. And it may be said at once that they believed aright.|$|E
6000|$|It will be {{necessary}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> in our story for {{a very short period}} in order that the reader may be told that Phineas Finn was duly re-elected at Loughton after his appointment at the Treasury Board. There was some little trouble at Loughton, and something more of expense than he had before encountered. Mr. Quintus Slide absolutely came down, and was proposed by Mr. Vellum for the borough. Mr. Vellum being a gentleman learned in the law, and hostile to the interests of the noble owner of Saulsby, was able to raise a little trouble against our hero. Mr. Slide was proposed by Mr. Vellum, and seconded by Mr. Vellum's clerk,--though, as it afterwards appeared, Mr. Vellum's clerk was not in truth an elector,--and went to the poll like a man. He received three votes, and at twelve o'clock withdrew. This in itself could hardly have afforded compensation for the expense which Mr. Slide or his backers must have encountered;--but he had an opportunity of making a speech, every word of which was reported in the People's Banner; and if the speech was made in the language given in the report, Mr. Slide was really possessed of some oratorical power. Most of those who read the speech in the columns of the People's Banner were probably not aware how favourable an opportunity of retouching his sentences in type had been given to Mr. Slide by the fact of his connection with the newspaper. The speech had been very severe upon our hero; and though the speaker had been so hooted and pelted at Loughton as to have been altogether inaudible,--so maltreated that in point of fact he {{had not been able to}} speak above a tenth part of his speech at all,--nevertheless the speech did give Phineas a certain amount of pain. Why Phineas should have read it who can tell? But who is there that abstains from reading that which is printed in abuse of himself? ...|$|E

This latter part we found to concern us directly, though we knew it to be false; yet, as my partner said, very justly, if we had fallen into their hands, and they had had such a prepossession against us beforehand, it had been in vain for us to have defended ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter at their hands; especially considering that our accusers had been our judges, and that we could have expected nothing from them but what rage would have dictated, and an ungoverned passion have executed.

However, are they as carbon neutral as marketing lets us believe, and if not, then how can be achieve carbon neutral transportation. With current electricity production being quite centralised, the current fossil fuel based solution allows us to e. g. install carbon capture technologies, but are these not a small bandage on heavily bleeding wound, and <b>should</b> <b>we</b> not <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the drawing board to look at better solutions.

5000|$|Ironically, Lee {{himself would}} later be {{considered}} an [...] "ultra" [...] by the Alliance government {{for some of the}} statements he made; on May 24, 1965, Lee publicly stated: [...] "Let us be quite frank. Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to old Singapore and once again reduce the non-Malays in Malaya to a minority?" [...] His Malaysian Malaysia campaign was not received well either by UMNO or most of the Malays, who tended to view a Malaysian Malaysia as a [...] "Chinese Malaysia". It has been speculated that this was due to the limited vocabulary of Malay at the time; the only Malay word for [...] "nation" [...] then was [...] "bangsa", which was also synonymous with race. Since there was (and is) no [...] "Malaysian race", {{it has been argued that}} most Malays considered anything other than a [...] "Malay nation" [...] as threatening to their rights.

In June 2005, he called on {{indigenous}} Fijians to prepare themselves to accept a non-indigenous Prime Minister, saying that the country was ready for it.

The radio edit is eight seconds shorter than the album version. The reworked chorus that appears in the radio edit was one of two ways Cuomo originally wrote the song. When touring in summer 2005, when the band prompted the crowd to sing along, they oddly enough sung it in the other way Cuomo had written it (different from the record version). Cuomo stated in an interview during the band's 2005 performance at the AOL Sessions as saying [...] "Well, if these ten thousand people think it should go this way, maybe <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and re-record it." ...|$|E

[...] At times, however, Lee worsened things by making racial comments of his own. Many of his speeches harped on the ethnic composition of Malaysia, reminding listeners that the non-Malays were now in the majority, with 61% of the population to the Malays' 39% asking at one point, [...] "Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to old Singapore and once again reduce the non-Malays in Malaya to a minority?"

40|$|Is there {{something}} new in recent research on Europeanisation? Or <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to what we already know about political integration in Europe and avoid the term? This article reviews recent work in four steps: {{the identification of the}} specific domain of Europeanisation; the relationship between Europeanisation, on the one hand, and governance, institutions, and discourse, on the other; the methodological problems and the models emerging in this new field of research; and an assessment of the results arising out of theoretical and empirical research. One theme throughout the article is that, in order to develop a progressive agenda, Europeanisation should be seen as a problem, not as a solution. It is neither a new theory, nor an ad-hoc approach. Rather, {{it is a way of}} orchestrating existing concepts and to contribute to cumulative research in political science. Europeanisation does not provide any simple fix to theoretical or empirical problems. Quite the opposite, it can deliver if approached as a set of puzzles. A problem in search of explanation – not the explanation itself (Gualini 2003). The conclusion is that Europeanisation has contributed to the emergence of new insights, original explanations, and interesting questions on three important issues: the understanding and analysis of 'impact', how to endogeneise international governance in models of domestic politics, and the relationship between agency and change. These three issues are prominent in the research agendas of international relations, theoretical policy analysis, and comparative politics. To contribute to major issues at the core of political science is a valuable result for a relatively new field of inquiry. Kurzfassun...|$|R

In an interview with Michael Petrou, she stated:I'm in favour of having {{a system in which}} any major decision for this country is taken by a Jewish majority. If that means giving less rights to the Israel Arabs, then yes.

When somebody hurts you, you want revenge, you want to hurt him. How do you hurt him? When you show them that - with a smile, that you are not going to take us away from our homelands and we are going to - forever every Jew you attack, we're going to build another community.
