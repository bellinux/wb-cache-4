40|$|Abstract—Postlaunch {{calibration}} of the WindSat polarimetric {{microwave radiometer}} indicates {{the presence of}} thermal gradients across the calibration <b>warm</b> <b>load</b> during some portions of the year. These gradients are caused by reflected solar illumination or eclipse and increase total calibration errors. This paper describes the WindSat <b>warm</b> <b>load</b> and presents the measured on-orbit data which clearly illustrate the anomalous responses seen in the <b>warm</b> <b>load</b> calibration data. Detailed thermal modeling predictions of the WindSat on-orbit performance are presented along with the satellite orbital geometry model with solar inputs in order to explain the physical causes of the thermal gradients. To reduce the resultant calibration errors during periods of anomalous <b>warm</b> <b>load</b> behavior, a correction algorithm was developed which uses the physical temperatures of the gain stages in the receiver elec-tronics to calculate an effective gain. This calibration algorithm is described, and its performance and expected accuracy are examined. Index Terms—Microwave radiometer, radiometer calibration, remote sensing, WindSat...|$|E
40|$|The NASA Earth Science System Pathfinder (ESSP) mission Aquarius, will measure global {{ocean surface}} {{salinity}} with approx. 120 km spatial resolution every 7 -days {{with an average}} monthly salinity accuracy of 0. 2 psu (parts per thousand).

The instrument utilizes a push-broom configuration which makes it impractical to use a traditional <b>warm</b> <b>load</b> and cold plate in front of the feedhorns. Therefore, to achieve the necessary performance Aquarius utilizes a Dicke radiometer with noise injection to perform a warm - hot calibration. The radiometer sequence between antenna, Dicke load, and noise diode has been optimized to maximize antenna observations and therefore minimize NEDT. This is possible due the ability to thermally control the radiometer electronics and front-end components to 0. 1 Crms over 7 days...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the project TESIN funded by the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy, a high temperature latent heat thermal energy storage unit is being developed and will be designed, built, commissioned and tested in an operating cogeneration plant in Saarland, Germany. This plant provides superheated steam to industrial process customers from a gas turbine with a heat recovery steam generator. Currently, a secondary boiler is operated at minimal load, from which it can be heated to full load in 2 minutes. With the integration of the thermal energy storage into the plant, the secondary boiler will be reduced from minimal to <b>warm</b> <b>load</b> operation. In case of a failure of the gas turbine, the storage will produce steam for 15 min. while the secondary boiler is heated from a warm to a hot operating load. This standby load reduction in the secondary boiler will reduce the use of fossil fuels. The steam demand from the thermal storage is for 8 t/h at around 25 bar and a minimum temperature of 300 °C. This results in a high power level of about 6 MWth and a necessary storage capacity of 1. 5 MWh. At this pressure level, the steam is superheated about at least 75 K. The combination of the superheating and the required power level has led to a smaller tube distance than in previous storage units as well as a new axial fin design. The basic storage as well as the fin design combined with nitrate salts as the storage material have been analyzed with simulation tools. Detailed design planning, permitting and build of the system are the coming steps {{in this part of the}} project. The design of these fins, storage unit design and planned integration in the cogeneration plant are presented here...|$|E

The application of the spaceflight version of this instrument will address several pressing {{issues related to the}} Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM). The X-Band Lightweight Rainfall Radiometer using STAR technology (LRR-X) is an aircraft sensor that is jointly developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Michigan. This paper will describe the theory of calibration as well as the hardware design specifications used by the method. The on-board hardware uses individual uncorrelated <b>warm</b> <b>loads</b> on each receiver as well as to a single noise diode providing a correlated noise source to each receiver. A procedure for maintaining onboard calibration with an optimum running average using correlated bursts of thermal noise interleaved with scene data will be exercised during the maiden flight of the LRR-X instrument during the spring of 2003. The final component of calibration of a synthetic aperture radiometer is the image reconstruction algorithm that uses the measured correlations to produce the temperature brightness (TB) images. An overview of system-level testing, both on the ground and in-flight, will be presented to validate the absolute accuracy of the image reconstruction algorithm...|$|R

The first satellite of the GCOM-W (Water) series will be GCOM-W 1 with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer- 2 (AMSR 2) onboard. AMSR 2 is a successor of AMSR on the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-II (ADEOS-II) and AMSR for EOS (AMSR-E) on NASA’s Aqua satellite. Basic performance of AMSR 2 will be {{similar to that of}} AMSR-E based on the minimum requirement of data continuity of AMSR-E, with several enhancements including larger main reflector (2. 0 m), additional channels in C-band receiver, and improved calibration system. AMSR-E was launched in 2002 and is still gathering global brightness temperatures for more than eight years beyond its scheduled operational period of three years. Despite the warm-load calibration issue, the instrument indicates good performance in long-term stability. Based on the AMSR and AMSR-E experience, several design changes were made for the AMSR 2 <b>warm</b> <b>load,</b> including changes in thermal stabilization and solar light shielding. Pre-launch testing is being performed, such as antenna pattern and detector nonlinearity measurements. The testing results will be reflected in sensor calibration model. After the launch, a deep-space calibration maneuver will be performed just one time during the initial checkout period to check consistency between main reflector and cold sky mirror, as well as to see scan biases for cold brightness temperatures. Further post-launch calibration activities will be performed, including cross calibration among similar microwave radiometers. Since GCOM-W 1 will join the A-Train constellation, cross calibration between AMSR-E and AMSR 2 will be very simple and thus accurate. Continuation from AMSR-E to AMSR 2 with th...|$|E

The GMI design for on-orbit calibration includes <b>warm</b> <b>load</b> and cold sky design features that mitigate many of the radiometric calibration issues observed on historical microwave radiometers. The GPM spacecraft was launched on February 27, 2014. During the first year of on-orbit operations, calibration and validation activities demonstrated the accuracy and stability of the GMI calibration. The GMI radiometer was designed, built, and tested by Ball Aerospace 2 ̆ 6 Technologies Corp. After launch, on-orbit data were processed and analyzed to determine the performance of key radiometric parameters. Extensive calibration and validation of the lower frequency channels (36 GHz and below) showed that the instrument meets radiometric performance requirements, offering stable, accurate brightness temperatures for use in the retrieval of geophysical products. This paper evaluates the calibration performance of the high frequency channels at 89 GHz and above. We compare the GMI brightness temperatures with similar channels from the concurrent Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) and Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) instruments.

A time stage equal to 15 minutes is considered to simulate the different control strategies. Existing technical constraints and set points are met. The operating costs of the cooling plant are evaluated by taking into account both the energy and the demand cost rate. In off-design conditions, savings of operating costs are made only if the storage tanks are fully discharged after being fully charged. In this case, ice storage systems reduce the operating costs of the cooling plant by shifting a significant fraction of on-peak energy consumption to off-peak periods and by reducing the on-peak demand. But at the same time, the introduction of an ice storage system in a cooling plant causes the electrical energy consumption to rise because the thermal efficiency of the chillers is reduced when working in ice formation mode.

The over weighted supplemental devices include swinging multiple bats, Schutt Dirx (96 oz), Pitcher's Nightmare, Power Fin (14 oz), Standard 23 oz softball bat, heavier 26 oz softball bat, lighter 18 oz softball bat and Doughnut ring (16 oz). [...] Weighted warm-up devices are commonly used because players feel that warming-up with heavier bats will help them increase bat velocity because after the warm-up with a heavier bat, the normal bat feels lighter and they feel they could swing it faster. [...] The effect of these devices is not only mental, {{but it may also}} be physical. Heavy <b>warm</b> up <b>loads</b> stimulate the neural system, allowing for increased muscle activation during lighter bat swings. The use of weighted bats is based on the theory of complex training where sets of heavier and lighter resistances are alternated to increase muscle performance. This theory revolves around the idea that muscle contractions are stronger after reaching near maximal contractions. The postactivation potentiation improves motor neuron pool excitability and increases the number of recruited motor units, both leading to greater power output. The additional weight may also help strengthen the muscles of the forearms and wrist thus increasing bat velocity, though some evidence suggests that the effect is psychological rather than biomechanical.|$|R

Both species have been extirpated from the summer months in which they once flourished, seemingly because of mid-summer declines in their food resources, which have been depressed by Daphnia since its establishment. However, climate warming has increased the length of the plankton growing season in Lake Washington, such that spring and fall offer greater abundance of food resources for Conochilus, offsetting modern exclusion of Conochilus from midsummer months.

These changes in the climate, however, do not act alone and are often accompanied by additional stressors such as eutrophication. Both global warming and eutrophication {{have been shown to}} affect the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms. Little is known about the combined effects of rising temperatures and eutrophication on the stoichiometry of entire phytoplankton communities. We exposed a natural phytoplankton spring community to different <b>warming</b> and phosphorus <b>loading</b> scenarios using a full-factorial design. Our results demonstrate that rising temperatures promote the growth rate of an entire phytoplankton community. Furthermore, both rising temperatures and phosphorus loading stimulated the maximum biomass built up by the phytoplankton community. Rising temperatures led to higher carbon:nutrient stoichiometry of the phytoplankton community under phosphorus limited conditions. Such a shift towards higher carbon:nutrient ratios, in combination with a higher biomass build-up, suggests a temperature-driven increase in nutrient use efficiency of the phytoplankton community. Importantly, higher carbon:nutrient stoichiometry of phytoplankton is generally of poorer nutritional value for zooplankton. Thus, although warming may result in higher phytoplankton biomass, this may be accompanied by a stoichiometric mismatch between phytoplankton and their grazers, with possible consequences for the entire aquatic food web.

Its goal is to transmit the torque create by HTS motor (coldest part) to the <b>load</b> (<b>warmest</b> part) without mechanical contact. Therefore, we don't need the torque tubes which are classically used in conventional HTS motor to link the inductor to the shaft. The absence of heat conduction generated by the torque tubes reduces the power of the cryogenic system and thereby increases the efficiency of the motor. Secondly, the contactless transmission is a natural harmonic filter which removes the torque pulsation and mechanical vibration on the shaft. During our study, we have developed an analytical modeling of the motor based on the resolution of Maxwell's equations which include the behavior of the superconducting coils in function of the applied magnetic field and temperature. Then a small prototype of the propulsion system has been developed to study the interaction between motor and magnetic coupling and the behavior of the HTS tapes...|$|R
5000|$|Traylor Howard, who {{replaced}} Schram as Monk's assistant {{in the middle}} of the third season, elected it as her favorite episode along with [...] "Mr. Monk vs. the Cobra". In The Futon Critic's Brian Ford Sullivan ranking of the fifty best episodes of 2002, it was placed 17th. David Bianculli, a writer for New York Daily News, said the pilot [...] "not only establishes the character of Monk, it establishes the perfect tone for the show, a delicate but deft blend of wry humor and tender drama." [...] United Feature Syndicate's critic Kevin McDonough praised the [...] "whimsical" [...] direction, and added [...] "Monk is not easy to love, but shines as a funny and fresh alternative to summer reruns." [...] It was also called [...] "fresh and funny" [...] by Entertainment Weeklys Bruce Fretts, and a [...] "invigorating" [...] "fresh spring breeze {{in the middle of}} summer" [...] by The Washington Posts Tom Shales. Varietys Phil Gallo praised the [...] "breezy gait of the storytelling, the nicely explained quirks of a brilliant mind and Tony Shalhoub's sterling characterization" [...] in his review. Tom Gliatto, a Peoples critic, declared [...] "This is probably not a clinically accurate portrayal of an OCD sufferer, but Shalhoub's gentle earnestness keeps it from being gimmicky."

40|$|In shallow lakes, {{environmental}} <b>warming</b> {{and nutrient}} <b>loading</b> are important {{influences on the}} likelihood of a shift between clear and turbid ecosystem states. With temperatures and nutrient runoff predicted to increase within the next decades, climate change poses a threat to lake communities. However, current predictions on the effect of these environmental factors on the abundance and timing of peak zooplankton numbers are based on correlations rather than on experimental isolation of thermal from other confounding effects. We present results of warming (4 °C above ambient) and increased nutrient loading on plankton communities in 48 outdoor mesocosms, simulating fishless and hypertrophic ponds. The timing of the chlorophyll a peak and crustacean zooplankton peak abundance, dominated by Daphnia pulex, responded strongly to temperature and nutrient addition. Daphnia numbers reached peaks 22 – 24 days earlier in heated than in unheated mesocosms. The chlorophyll a peak abundance advanced by 15 – 19 days with heating. Phytoplankton, total zooplankton and D. pulex reached peak abundance 12 – 19 days later when doses of nitrogen and phosphorus were added; this finding contradicts predicted earlier phytoplankton and zooplankton spring peak abundances with nutrient enrichment. Peak zooplankton and D. pulex abundances did not differ with temperature treatment, contrary to our expectations, but peak abundances occurred at similar actual temperatures. Nutrient additions had no effect on the peak zooplankton and D. pulex abundances in our mesocosms. Overall, climate warming is likely to advance plankton phenology in fishless ponds; however, this advance could be dampened in systems with high nutrient concentration. We found very high zooplankton abundances with warming and high nutrient loadings inducing a clear water state in all our tanks owing to heavy zooplankton grazing despite high nutrient concentration...|$|R
