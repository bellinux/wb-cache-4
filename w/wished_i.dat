He grew up in Boca Raton, Florida. [...] He was raised Jewish, and has said: [...] "People are shocked at first that I’m Jewish. I get teased in the clubhouse about being Jewish, but we all get teased about something. Going to Hebrew school and being a bar mitzvah … made my mom really happy. I <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> had been out playing baseball, but looking back at it now, I’m happy I did it.” [...] Valencia has a sister, Laura.|$|E

500|$|In another {{review of}} the first book, Publishers Weekly noted that Smith [...] "create a fantasy world fit for the most discriminating medieval partisan. It cleverly walks just this side of parody, getting away with lines like, 'I <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> could {{personally}} flout him and his busy searchers, and make him look the fool he was.'" [...] In a similar vein, Kirkus Reviews praised the first novel as [...] "Smith's lush descriptions evoke a fantastic yet credible world, where magic spells and enchanted stones are everyday facts of life." [...] M. Jean Greenlaw, contributing to The ALAN Review, lauded Smith for her [...] "language and imagery" [...] as well as [...] "her deft plotting [...] keep the reader glued to the pages." [...] Writing for the School Library Journal, Patricia Lothrop-Green, however, gave a largely negative review to the first part, highlighting [...] "huge logical leaps," [...] an [...] "utterly predictable plot," [...] and a heroine whom [...] "many readers will be thoroughly tired of" [...] {{by the end of}} the story.|$|E

2500|$|In 1993 {{the then}} 17 Sanger Institute staff moved into {{temporary}} laboratory space at Hinxton Hall in Cambridgeshire. This [...] site {{was to become}} the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, which has a growing population of around 1300 staff, approximately 900 of whom work at the Sanger Institute. The Genome Campus also includes the Wellcome Trust Conference Centre [...] and the European Bioinformatics Institute. A major extension of the campus was officially opened in 2005; the buildings accommodate new laboratories, a data centre and staff amenities. In discussing {{the name of the}} centre, Sanger (still alive when the centre was opened) told John Sulston, the founding director, that the centre [...] "had better be good." [...] Sulston commented, [...] "I rather <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> hadn’t asked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike many umpires, Evans {{never made}} claims to infallibility. [...] "I missed {{a lot of}} {{decision}}s", he once said. [...] "At the time of making such a decision {{there was no doubt}} in my mind as to its correctness. However, a second or two later I felt that I erred and <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> could change my original ruling". Evans' humility and impartiality did not always protect him from abusive fans. As sports writers Daniel Okrent and Steve Wulf observed, [...] "roughness on the field seemed to elicit the same in the stands". On September 15, 1907, in the midst of a doubleheader between the St. Louis Browns and Detroit Tigers, Evans suffered a skull fracture when a bottle hurled by an angry spectator knocked him unconscious. The New York Times described the incident as [...] "one of the most disgraceful scenes ever witnessed on a ball field".|$|E

2500|$|A second {{record was}} in the works when a clashing of egos took place and Clapton walked, thus {{disbanding}} the group. Allman {{was killed in a}} motorcycle accident on [...] 1971. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the [...] "musical brother I'd never had but <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> did". Although Radle would remain Clapton's bass player until the summer of 1979 (Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics), it would be 2003 before Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again (Clapton guested on Whitlock's appearance on the Later with Jools Holland show). Another tragic footnote to the Dominos story was the fate of drummer Jim Gordon, who was an undiagnosed schizophrenic and years later murdered his mother during a psychotic episode. Gordon was confined to 16-years-to-life imprisonment, later being moved to a mental institution, where he remains today.|$|E
2500|$|... “At first I had {{no desire}} to write screenplays. I kind of <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> had because I was {{reaching}} the end of my time producing music videos. I was struggling so hard {{to figure out what it}} was that I was supposed to be doing. I kept thinking I’m supposed to be doing something creative. I can’t believe I have such a knack for the vernacular and I don’t have anywhere to apply it." [...] “I felt I had not found my true path. And then a series of events occurred that led me to the point where I didn’t have anything to lose if I wrote a screenplay." [...] She began writing sitcoms with a comedian friend but was plagued by second thoughts about her work. Khouri was frustrated and kept [...] "contemplating and meditating" [...] until she got this idea of [...] "two women going on a crime spree." [...] She felt as if a light bulb had gone on over her head, making her more interested in the idea.|$|E
2500|$|Beresford {{wrote to}} Fitzwilliam on 22 June that his {{character}} had been unjustly attacked: [...] "Direct and specific charges I could fairly have met and refuted, but crooked and undefined insinuations against private character, through {{the pretext of}} official discussion, your Lordship must allow, are the weapons of a libeller". Fitzwilliam replied the next day that domestic matters took charge of his attention but on 28 June that he let Beresford know he was now in town and [...] "As I could not misunderstand the object of your letter, I have only to signify that I am ready to attend your call". Rumours of the impending duel leaked and Fitzwilliam was [...] "obliged to quit the house...hastily in the morning, for fear of arrest by the police". His second, Lord George Cavendish, met Beresford's second (Sir George Montgomery) on 28 June and debated an apology by Fitzwilliam. His proposed apology was not acceptable to Beresford. Their first arena, Marylebone fields, was crowded with prospective spectators so they moved to a field near Paddington. As Beresford and Fitzwilliam were taking their marks a magistrate ran onto the field and arrested Fitzwilliam. Fitzwilliam said to Beresford [...] "that we have been prevented from finishing this business in the manner I <b>wished,</b> <b>I</b> have no scruple to make an apology". Beresford accepted and they shook hands, with Fitzwilliam saying [...] "Now, thank God, there is a complete end to my Irish administration" [...] and hoped that [...] "whenever they met it {{might be on the}} footing of friends". Burke wrote to Lord John Cavendish on 1 July that [...] "it is happy, that a Virtuous man has escaped with Life and honour—and that his reputation for spirit and humanity, and true dignity must stand higher than ever, if higher it could stand".|$|E
