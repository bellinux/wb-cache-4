40|$|For me, {{the word}} “evil ” is {{somewhat}} of an abstraction. Hav-ing led a protected life, {{one of only a}} few occasions on which I have seen something resembling evil was when the Twin Towers fell on September 11 th. Evil is the intent of harm and deliberate violation of basic moral and ethical codes. Evil is nowwoven into our culture, something that, in recent times, probably became more apparent (and popular) when Presi-dent Reagan called the Soviets “evil ” and, later, <b>with</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> extending this concept to the “axis of evil. ” Invasion and dom-ination by conquering forces are explicitly evil, as we have learned by how the Spanish (and we Americans) treated our native populations in the Americas.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to design a {{semi-active}} magnetorheological (<b>MR)</b> hydraulic <b>bushing.</b> The semi-active bushing {{is intended to be}} used to isolate a cylinder deactivating engine. Cylinder deactivation causes high transient torsional loading in addition to changing the magnitude and mode of engine vibrations requiring an adaptive or controllable isolator. Practical and simple semi-active control strategies are inspired by investigating the optimization of linear and slightly cubic nonlinear single degree of freedom isolators. Experimental verification of the optimization technique, which minimizes the root mean square (RMS) of engine acceleration frequency response and RMS of the force transmitted frequency response, shows that this method can be implemented on real linear systems to isolate the engine from harmonic inputs. This optimization technique is also applied to tune selected model parameters of existing two degree of freedom hydraulic bushings. This thesis also details the development of a <b>MR</b> hydraulic <b>bushing.</b> The <b>MR</b> <b>bushing</b> design retrofits an existing bushing with a pressure driven flow mode valve on the inertia track. A new efficient valve design is selected and developed for the application. The <b>MR</b> hydraulic <b>bushing</b> is designed, mathematically modeled, and numerically simulated. The simulation results show that the <b>MR</b> <b>bushing</b> tends to increase the low frequency dynamic stiffness magnitude while simultaneously decreasing the phase. The next stage of the project is fabrication and testing of the semi-active bushing. The performance of the manufactured <b>MR</b> <b>bushing</b> is tested on a base excitation apparatus. Varying the current input to the MR valve was found to have a small effect on the response of the suspended mass. The results are in agreement with the effects demonstrated by the dynamic stiffness numerical simulation...|$|R

40|$|Edward Baigent {{arrived in}} New Zealand almost 140 years ago, {{and except for}} a few months in Nelson, spent his entire life in Wakefield. Unfortunately neither Edward Baigent nor any of his {{children}} seem to have kept diaries, or been prolific letter writers. The information this thesis is based upon, does thus come almost entirely from early newspaper articles, diaries of Baigent's contemporary settlers, and old ledgers and journals, dating back to 1870, which were found by chance last year in the demolition of an old building on Baigents' Rutherford Street property. The completion of this thesis {{would not have been possible}} if not for the willing assistance I have had from a number of people. Special thanks must go to <b>Mr</b> John <b>Bush,</b> who began collecting information relating to the Baigent family several years ago, with the intention of eventually writing a family/company history. <b>With</b> characteristic unselfishness, <b>Mr</b> <b>Bush</b> passed on to me all the material he had accumulated, and I am extremely grateful for the initial help he provided. To Mrs M. Palmer, a great grand-daughter of Edward Baigent, I also extend my special thanks. Mrs Palmer has always taken a great deal of interest in the Baigent family, and wherever possible, has been of great assistance to me. Nelson is fortunate that early events were faithfully recorded by newspaper reporters almost immediately settlement was commenced. The Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle which began in 1842 and continued until 1874, provided much valuable information on the early years of settlement in the Nelson Province. An almost complete file of this paper is available at the Nelson Public Library, and to the staff of the Library I wish to record my thanks...|$|R
