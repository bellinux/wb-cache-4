5|$|Development of {{the fourth}} Silent Hill game by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo's {{development}} group Team Silent began shortly {{after the release of}} Silent Hill 2 and alongside Silent Hill 3, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> creating a new style of game that would take the series in a different direction than the previous games. Despite what has been popularized around the Internet, Silent Hill 4 was always meant to be connected to Silent Hill and not an unrelated separate horror game that later became a Silent Hill title, although different gameplay mechanics and change were intended. News of the game's development was made public by October 2003, and official announcements by Konami followed at Gamers' Day 2004. The game was produced by the series' recurring sound designer and composer Akira Yamaoka. Its working title, prior to its incorporation into the rest of the series, was simply Room 302.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the act, the canal company {{inherited}} the debts of the Conservators, and paid them an additional £2,000. They were required to rebuild part of the North Town Bridge in Taunton, and to return the Tone Navigation to good order.

The £2,000 was held by the Conservators until 1838, when they applied for an order to dispose of it, {{but it was not until}} 1843 that the order was granted. £1,000 was used to build a new wing for the Taunton and Somerset Hospital, and £1,000 was invested in the Taunton Market Trust, in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> the 1699 act.|$|E
5|$|Further details {{concerning}} Sejanus' fall {{are provided}} by Cassius Dio, writing nearly 200 years later in his Roman History. It appears that, when Tiberius heard to what extent Sejanus had already usurped his authority in Rome, he immediately took steps to remove him from power. However, he realised that an outright condemnation could provoke Sejanus to attempt a coup. Instead, Tiberius addressed a number of contradictory letters to the Senate, some of which praised Sejanus and his friends and some of which denounced them. Tiberius variously {{announced that he would}} arrive in Rome the next day or that he was at the point of death. He stepped down as consul, forcing Sejanus to do the same and conferred an honorary priesthood upon Caligula, rekindling popular support for the house of Germanicus. The ensuing confusion was successful in alienating Sejanus from many of his followers. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> the emperor no longer clear, it was now deemed a safer course of action at Rome to withdraw from overt support to Sejanus until the matter was clearly settled.|$|E

25|$|The code {{of ethics}} that is {{affiliated}} with traditional marketing can also be applied to social media. However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers {{like to hear from}} advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are. The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is to be honest <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign. Most social network marketers use websites like Facebook and MySpace to try to drive traffic to another website. While it is ethical to use social networking websites to spread a message to people who are genuinely interested, many people game the system with auto-friend adding programs and spam messages and bulletins. Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.|$|E

500|$|Kosygin {{initiated}} another {{economic reform}} in 1973 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> weakening the central Ministries and giving more powers {{to the regional}} authorities in republican and local-levels. The reform's failure to meet Kosygin's goal led to its cancellation. However, the reform succeeded in creating associations, an organisation representing various enterprises.

The [...] "Improving planning and reinforcing {{the effects of the}} economic mechanism on raising the effectiveness in production and improving the quality of work", more commonly known as the 1979 reform. The reform, in contrast to the 1965 reform, was intended to increase the central government's economic involvement by enhancing the duties and responsibilities of the ministries. Due to Kosygin's resignation in 1980, and because of Nikolai Tikhonov's conservative approach to economics, very little of the reform was actually implemented.|$|E

Access FM was initiated {{as a function of}} Bridgwater's YMCA and as such held the same values as the charity. Access FM was founded by Martin Hodgson (CEO of Bridgwater YMCA), Grant Francis (owner of [...] ) and Tom Copestake, a youth worker who had worked with a Christian radio station in Coventry before moving to work at Bridgwater YMCA. Soon after the station launched on 9 June 2013, Jason Pimm joined the management team to help with development.

Many of the voluntary presenters were aged 16 – 20 and the station acted as the first step into the industry. Under the management and direction of Tom Copestake and technical skills of Grant Francis, Access FM had mild success within the community, attending multiple events and marking new ground for local radio in the area. The station was the first in history to provide live broadcast coverage from Bridgwater Guy Fawkes Carnival in 2014.|$|E
