500|$|The {{fountain}} uses [...] per hour, 97% {{of which}} is recycled back into the system. [...] Getting the water to the spout took ingenuity. Although consideration was given to omitting a LED tile, {{it was determined that}} the images would then look as though they were each missing a tooth. Instead, one tile in each tower is recessed about [...] to allow the installation of [...] clear tubing for the <b>water</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The water regularly spills over the fountain and down the sides of the towers and intermittently spouts from the nozzle. Two essential custom fittings contribute to the artistic vision of the fountain: a custom glass block at the upper edge for guiding the water's descent while remaining unobtrusive, and a plastic nozzle fitted to the stainless steel frame to control the rate of water flow and reduce liability to the city for any injuries sustained by the fountain's interactive participants. The interactive participants are usually children playing in the stream from the water spout or under the cascade. The risk that the spouting water would knock people down made the design both a legal and a physical challenge.|$|E

40|$|The Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} a cooling process of full cone <b>water</b> <b>nozzles.</b> It {{explains}} {{the principle of the}} continuous steel casting which these nozzles are used for. The basics of heat transfer and spray cooling are also described. The thesis then summarizes the way of the experiment with these nozzles. The purpose of the thesis is to choose an appropriate 3 D mathematical function which would well characterize the distribution of the heat transfer coefficient under the nozzle and then create an algorithm for finding its parameters. The algorithm is programmed in MATLAB and implemented on the data gained by the experimental way for two types of full cone <b>water</b> <b>nozzles...</b>|$|R

50|$|After {{the drum}} {{is full of}} the {{solidified}} coke, the hot mixture from the furnace is switched to the second drum. While the second drum is filling, the full drum is steamed out to reduce the hydrocarbon content of the petroleum coke, and then quenched with water to cool it. The top and bottom heads of the full coke drum are removed, and the solid petroleum coke is then cut from the coke drum with a high pressure <b>water</b> <b>nozzle,</b> where it falls into a pit, pad, or sluiceway for reclamation to storage.|$|E
50|$|The {{water jet}} {{is powered by}} two 560 {{kilowatt}} electric motors driving four stage centrifugal pumps capable of pumping up to 250 litres per second against a head of 183 metres. The water velocity at the <b>water</b> <b>nozzle</b> is 260 km/h. While running both pumps simultaneously the main jet throws approximately six tons of water into the air at any instant, reaching a maximum height of 147 metres. Alternatively the jet can be run on a single pump reaching a lower height of 110 metres. During special occasions it can be illuminated, often with coloured lights.|$|E

Sometimes, players may find an invisible hexagon shaped door that allows them to enter a secret map area provided they have the correct Child Spectrobe type (Corona, Aurora, or Flash) accompanying them. In certain areas, special tools may have to be used to get past the terrain; for example, a flame thrower for ice, a <b>water</b> <b>nozzle</b> for lava, etc. Each of these drills must be used meticulously and with precision to master excavation.|$|E

50|$|APW {{extinguishers}} {{are commonly}} converted into makeshift CAFS extinguishers by drilling two 1/8-1/16 inch {{holes in the}} pickup tube.

Typically, the tip of the smooth-bore application nozzle is then cut off to allow the foam to properly expand. Keeping the nozzle will result in wetter foam and longer range. Cutting the nozzle will result in an expanded, dry foam but will lack the range of the standard <b>water</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Water extinguishers can also be fitted with air aspirators when used with foam (commonly used on AFFF and FFFP foam extinguishers) which will result in a more expanded foam but will lack the durability or heat resistance of compressed air foam.|$|E

5000|$|Snow Lances {{are up to}} 12 meter long {{vertically}} inclined aluminum tubes at {{the head}} of which are placed water and-or air nucleators. Air is blown into the atomized water at the outlet from the <b>water</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The previously compressed air expands and cools, creating ice nuclei on which crystallization of the atomized water takes place. Due to the height and the slow rate of descent there will be enough time for this process. This process uses less energy than a fan gun, but has a smaller range and lower snow quality; it also has greater sensitivity to wind. Advantages over fan gun are: lower investment (only cable system with air and water, central compressor station), much quieter, half the energy consumption for the same amount of snow, simpler maintenance due to lower wear and fewer moving parts, and regulation of snow making is possible in principle. The working pressure of snow lances is 20-60 bar. There are also small mobile systems for the home user that are operated by the garden connection (Home Snow).|$|E
