25|$|In the semifinals, {{they faced}} the two-seeded Denver Nuggets, who were fresh off a 4–1 series win against the New Orleans Hornets, {{including}} a 58-point win in New Orleans. The Mavericks stayed close with the Nuggets {{in the first}} three quarters of Games 1 and 2, but it was the fourth quarter when Carmelo Anthony and the Nuggets woke up, as they took the first two games by double-digit figures. Game 3 in Dallas was close the <b>whole</b> <b>way,</b> and Dallas led by five points with less than a minute to go. But Carmelo Anthony hit a three-pointer to give the Nuggets a 106–105 victory. The play generated quite a bit of controversy because Maverick guard Antoine Wright clearly fouled Anthony, but since there was no replay used in the NBA in 2009 the Mavericks suffered a game 3 loss. It was later announced by the league that the referees made the wrong call, but despite that, the Mavericks still faced a 3–0 deficit in the series.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, New York in the AFL {{championship}} game faced a red hot Oakland Raiders team {{who had just}} defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 41-6 one week earlier, with quarterback Daryle Lamonica throwing 5 touchdown passes. The {{championship game}} was close and hard fought the <b>whole</b> <b>way</b> through, with both teams trading scores at a relatively even pace. The momentum seemed to swing in the Raiders' favor when George Atkinson picked off a pass from Namath and returned it 32 yards to the Jets 5-yard line, setting up a touchdown that gave Oakland their first lead of the game at 23-20 with 8:18 left in regulation. But Namath quickly led the team back, completing a 10-yard pass to Sauer and a 52-yard pass to Maynard on the Raiders 6-yard line. On the next play, his 6-yard touchdown pass to Maynard gave them a 27-23 lead they would never relinquish. Oakland's final three possessions of the game {{would result in a}} turnover on downs, a lost fumble, and time expiring in the game.|$|E

25|$|The most {{frequent}} away colours used by Portsmouth have been white shirts with royal or navy blue shorts and either blue or white socks. The club has had white as either {{the second or}} third choice shirt for every season since 1998–99 to date. Other colours that have appeared several times on Portsmouth change kits have been yellow (usually with blue shorts) and red (often combined with black). From the 2006–07 season to the 2008–09 season the club have used black with a gold trim as their third choice colours. In the 2009–10 season the third kit was black with blue trim and thin blue hoops. The away kit was white with two navy blue vertical lines running the <b>whole</b> <b>way</b> {{down the side of the}} shirt, with the badge superimposed on top of them. The home kit has been the classic red white and blue kit, with plain blue shirt, plain white shorts and plain red socks. For the 2010 FA Cup Final, Portsmouth wore a change kit of white shirts, burgundy shorts and burgundy socks. For 2010–11, the away kit was a white shirt, with maroon shorts and socks. In 2011–12, the away kit was a black shirt, with black shorts and socks; the club also announced a third one, with a divided shirt half-black and half-red; shorts and socks were black. For 2012–13, the club returned with a white shirt as an away kit, and turned into an orange-type third kit, with black shorts and orange socks.|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger {{called it a}} [...] "balls to the wall, gut-busting, amazing Office episode", and called the fire opening scene [...] "not only the best Office pre-credits sequence ever, but an all-time sitcom classic". Sepinwall said [...] "Stress Relief" [...] was accessible to newcomers and regular viewers, and displayed both the comedic and human sides of the characters. He said the only drawback of the episode was the Mrs. Albert Hannaday subplot, which he felt was an unnecessary gimmick added solely to accommodate the guest stars. TV Guide writer Shahzad Abbas wrote, [...] "This {{was one of my}} favorite episodes ever. It had me laughing the <b>whole</b> <b>way</b> through." [...] Abbas particularly praised the fire opening scene and the final scene in which Michael insults everybody, which he called [...] "a very satisfying ending to the roast saga".

500|$|Wenger regards a {{well-balanced}} diet as {{an essential}} part of a player's preparation. He was influenced by his time in Japan, where [...] "the <b>whole</b> <b>way</b> of life there is linked to health. Their diet is basically boiled vegetables, fish and rice. No fat, no sugar. You notice when you live there that there are no fat people". At Arsenal, Wenger brought in dieticians to explain the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, and acquired the help of Philippe Boixel, an osteopath for the France national team, to realign the players' bodies each month. Plyometrics, exercises designed to strengthen the muscles, were introduced and Wenger routinely made players stretch before and after matches. Until 2004, he encouraged his players to take Creatine for increased stamina, later stopping when he noticed side-effects. The innovations had a desirable effect on the team as it prolonged the careers of his defence, and made Arsenal stronger {{in the second half of}} seasons. Though Wenger's methods were common in Italian football, they had been unsuccessfully trialled in England until his arrival.|$|E
