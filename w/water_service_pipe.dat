The valve used to connect a small-diameter service line to a water main is called a corporation stop (also called a tap, or corp stop). One gooseneck joins the corporation stop to the <b>water</b> <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> work. A second gooseneck links the supply pipeline to a water meter located outside the building.|$|E

40|$|Infectious {{intestinal}} diseases (IID) represent a widespread {{public health problem}} in Mexico. The country also faces major challenges {{with respect to the}} provision of residential <b>water</b> <b>services</b> (<b>piped</b> <b>water</b> and sewer) —an essential input for hygiene and cleanliness in homes. This paper analyzes morbidity rates from several IID associated with unsanitary living conditions along with a series of residential <b>water</b> <b>services</b> indicators for Mexico’s 2, 456 municipalities. With data obtained through a special request to the federal epidemiological authority as well as official census data for 2010, we find stark regional contrasts and identify interesting spatial structures for both IID morbidity and residential <b>water</b> <b>services</b> indicators. In particular, municipalities tend to present values similar to neighboring municipalities, forming clusters of relatively high-value (or low-value) municipalities. Moreover we find that municipalities with a relatively high level of access to residential <b>water</b> <b>services</b> tend to present relatively low IID morbidity rates. These results have multiple public policy implications. In order to reduce the incidence of IID effectively and efficiently, interventions should explicitly consider the spatial structure of morbidity and target problem spots—which typically spill over state, municipal and other administrative boundaries. Moreover, improvements in the quality of access to piped water (for example, increasing the frequency of supply) may be as important for reducing morbidity as the expansion of basic access to this service...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} in South Africa the state is {{understood}} and narrated in multiple ways, notably differentiated by interactions with service provision infrastructure and the ongoing housing formalisation process. We trace various contested narratives {{of the state and}} of citizenship that emerge from interactions with urban <b>water</b> <b>service</b> infrastructures. In effect, the housing formalisation process rolls out through specific physical infrastructures, including, but not limited to, <b>water</b> <b>services</b> (<b>pipes,</b> taps, <b>water</b> meters). These infrastructures bring with them particular logics and expectations that contribute to a sense of enfranchisement and associated benefits to some residents, while others continue to experience inadequate services, and linked exclusions. More specifically, we learn that residents who have received newly built homes replacing shack dwellings in the process of formalisation more often narrate the state as legitimate, stemming from the government role as service provider. Somewhat surprisingly, these residents at times also suggest compliance with obligations and expectations for payment for water and responsible water consumption. In contrast, shack dwellers more often characterise the state as uncooperative and neglectful, accenting state failure to incorporate alternative views of what constitutes appropriate services. With an interest in political ecologies of the state and <b>water</b> <b>services</b> infrastructures, this paper traces the dynamic processes through which states and citizenship are mutually and relationally understood, and dynamically evolving. As such, the analysis offers insights for ongoing state-society negotiations in relation to changing infrastructure access in a transitioning democracy...|$|R

Chilled mine <b>service</b> <b>water</b> is <b>piped</b> from the surface to deep level stope; where the hydrostatic pressure provides power for stoping machinery. This water varies widely in composition and acidity. High concentrations of sulphate, chloride and nitrate are present. These ions are derived from the leaching of oxidised sulphides from the broken rock, the fissure water and the dissolution of blasting fumes. In order to minimise the deterioration of stoping machinery by corrosion and synergistic corrosive abrasive effects, a compromise between selecting a suitable corrosion resistant material and treating the mine <b>service</b> <b>water</b> to an acceptable level of corrosiveness is being sought...|$|R
40|$|Background: Access to safe {{drinking}} water is essential for health. Monitoring access to drinking water focuses on water supply type at the source, but there is limited evidence on whether quality differences at the source persist in water stored in the household. Objectives: To assess the extent of fecal contamination at the source and in household stored water (HSW) and explore the relationship between contamination at each of these sampling points and water supply type. Methods: A bivariate random-effects meta-analysis of 45 studies, identified through a systematic review, that reported either the proportion of samples free of fecal indicator bacteria and/or individual sample bacteria counts for source and HSW, disaggregated by supply type. Results: Water quality deteriorated substantially between source and stored water. Mean percentage of contaminated samples (noncompliance) at the source was 46 % (95 % CI: 33, 60 %) while mean noncompliance in HSW was 75 % (95 % CI: 64, 84 %). Water supply type {{was significantly associated with}} noncompliance at the source (p <. 001) and in HSW (p = 0. 03). Source water (OR = 0. 2; 95 % CI: 0. 1, 0. 5) and HSW (OR = 0. 3; 95 % CI: 0. 2, 0. 8) from piped supplies had significantly lower odds of contamination when compared to non-piped water, potentially due to residual chlorine. Conclusions: Piped water is less likely to be contaminated compared to other water supply types at both the source and in HSW. A focus on upgrading <b>water</b> <b>services</b> to <b>piped</b> supplies may help improve safety, including for those drinking stored water...|$|R

40|$|Although {{advances}} in water treatment technology {{have contributed to}} improved water quality at water treatment plants, treated water is not reaching consumer taps with the same quality. <b>Water</b> quality in <b>service</b> <b>pipes</b> is lower than at the water treatment plants, most likely because rust corrosion particles are generated inside the pipes, accumulated sediments become resuspended or other reasons. In this study, particles suspended in treated water flowing through water mains of various service areas were collected, and their quantity and elemental compositions were analyzed to investigate changes in suspended solid (SS) characteristics over distance and time. In addition to longitudinal changes along water mains, cross-sectional SS changes were investigated by developing a method of directly collecting SS particles flowing through a water main at different vertical locations. SS concentrations and the percentages of inorganics and iron in SS increased as water traveled toward the dead end of a main. Vertical differences of SS in the main cross section were also observed: SS concentrations in the upper part were higher {{than those in the}} middle and lower parts. The higher percentages of inorganics and iron in the upper part suggested that scaling in {{the upper part of the}} main, which had a stagnant area, caused iron particles to be released into the stream. Temporal variations in SS concentrations were observed for water flowing through the middle and lower parts of the main cross section. SS concentrations increased with increased flow rates, indicating resuspension of sediment at the bottoms of the mains. Overall, SS concentrations, their temporal variations, their cross-sectional changes and the elemental compositions of SS in water were different in various <b>water</b> <b>service</b> areas, and these characteristics could be useful in determining the origin of SS particles in drinking water...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} sparse district heating conditions and explore how to improve them. Few sparse areas are heated by district heat, which reflects the economic competitiveness. A method {{that could be used}} by the district heating companies to identify the boundaries of profitable district heat is presented. Important key figures are identified when investigating the boundaries of competitive district heat. This method was identified using data gained from research on sparse areas in Göteborg, Sweden and demonstrates what to focus on in order to improve competitiveness. It is concluded that distribution heat losses must decrease in future connected sparse areas to be an efficient and competitive heating alternative. The insulation properties of flexible district heating pipes, widely used when connecting sparse areas, are an important issue when improving the energy efficiency. The long term insulation properties of flexible district heating pipes are experimentally investigated by studying the cell gas transport in semi-flexible polyurethane foams. The results show that the insulation properties are impaired more rapidly than for traditional straight pipes. The flexibility of the material is partly achieved at the cost of faster gas transport. An effective diffusion barrier hindering this gas transport is thus important. A new method to determine the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of flexible district heating pipes is presented. The method is {{based on the fact that}} the temperature decline of hot water in a district heating pipe placed in cool water depends on the thermal conductivity of the polyurethane foam. The temperature decline of the <b>water</b> inside the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> is measured and modelled numerically. The difference between measured and calculated temperatures is used to determine the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and the specific heat by fitting. The method is based on simple measurements of the temperature decline of the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>water,</b> and it is applied on single and twin pipes. A single experiment gives the thermal conductivity for a large temperature span...|$|R

The question was raised as to whether the SCC was active or dormant. This paper describes the resultant investigation to determine if a particular service crack was actively growing. The strategy adopted was to assess the appearance of the fracture surface of the service crack and to compare with expectations from laboratory specimens with active SCC. The conclusions from this study are as follows. To judge whether a crack in the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> is active or dormant, it is reasonable to compare the very crack tip of the service crack and a fresh crack in a laboratory sample. If the crack tip of the active laboratory sample {{is similar to that of}} the <b>service</b> <b>pipe,</b> it means the crack in the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> is likely to be active. From the comparison of the crack tip between the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> and the laboratory samples, it appears likely that the cracks in the samples extracted from service were most likely to have been active intergranular stress corrosion cracks.
