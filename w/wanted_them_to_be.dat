5|$|A 1000-year-old {{skeleton}} of a woman was discovered in the caves by Balch in 1912, and has also traditionally {{been linked to the}} legendary witch. The remains {{have been part of the}} collection of the Wells and Mendip Museum, which was founded by Balch, since they were excavated, though in 2004 the owner of the Caves said that he <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> returned to Wookey Hole.|$|E
5|$|When the live-action of the manga was made, Watsuki {{had several}} ideas about Kenshin's mind about his early {{appearances}} in the series. This resulted in the manga reboot Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration where Kenshin's characterization was expanded by the author who thought in retrospective about what he could add to him. Although there were some changes to the cast, Watsuki <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subtle such as Kenshin wearing a scarf. He also wrote a prequel chapter to the original series which helped the readers to understand why Kenshin would stay in Kaoru's dojo.|$|E
5|$|Kirkland cites his {{assistant}} director Matthew Nastuk {{as a big}} influence on the episode. He became heavily involved with the animation because {{he had grown up}} in New Jersey, where the Thomas Edison National Historical Park that Homer and Bart visit is located. To help make the museum look as authentic as possible, Kirkland and Nastuk visited it and took a large number of photographs that they brought back to the animation studio. At one point in the episode, Homer writes complex math formulas on a chalkboard. The producers <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> actual formulas, so writer David X. Cohen got in contact with a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who were able to provide them.|$|E
500|$|Marshall {{also cited}} [...] (1983), Zulu (1964), and works of {{director}} Terry Gilliam like The Fisher King (1991) as influences in producing Doomsday. Marshall acknowledged that his creation is [...] "so outrageous you've got to laugh". He reflected, [...] "I do think it's going to divide audiences... I just <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thrilled and enthralled. I <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{overwhelmed by the}} imagery they've seen.

5000|$|The Left Party {{called the}} gymnasia [...] "an {{outdated}} institution" [...] and <b>wants</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> abolished. According <b>to</b> [...] "The Left Party", working-class children are as talented as middle-class children, yet not admitted for gymnasium. The party furthermore holds {{the opinion that}} the majority of Germans <b>is</b> opposed <b>to</b> gymnasia and <b>wants</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> abolished. If gymnasia will not be abolished [...] "The Left Party" [...] is in favour of affirmative action.|$|R

5|$|When {{creating}} Link's sword movements, {{the team}} initially <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as realistic as possible, but {{as this was}} being detrimental to the character's portrayal, they had to include unrealistic movements to preserve the atmosphere. The Skyward Strike was initially born from Aonuma thinking up a possible mechanic of holding the sword still above Link: these also {{gave rise to the}} game's title. Having sword fighting relying on Wii MotionPlus freed up other buttons on the controller, allowing the addition of the Dash sprinting option. So as not to interrupt the flow of gameplay, they incorporated other elements into the Dash function, such as scaling walls rather than just slamming into them. The Dowsing mechanic was created early on, based on the gameplay themes of discovery and exploration. Due to the introduction of Dowsing, the team did not have to create environmental landmarks for places and objects of importance as they had done in previous titles. So players would not get lost in the terrain, they also introduced the marker beacons. Items were designed so they could be visible in any area, such as the bright blue Bombs. They were also designed based on their original location: those from Skyloft used a bird motif, while those from other Surface regions used more intricate designs. The Beetle acted as a replacement for the Boomarang, as the team wanted an item that players could control. The Beetle and other pseudo-technical items gave rise to the ancient mechanical theme that appeared in the Lanayru Desert region. At Miyamoto's insistence, the more desirable items that were normally placed towards the end of a campaign were made available to players from an early stage. When designing items, the developers were faced with the usual problems of the interdependence of items and dungeons creating a chicken-and-egg scenario for the developers. The menu for Item access was also redesigned around the use of Wii MotionPlus.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} {{irritation}} was the regional assemblies, {{which had been}} organized on an interim basis pending further constitutional discussions. The opposition, which was strong in Ashanti and the north, proposed significant powers for the assemblies; the CPP <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more or less advisory. In 1959, Nkrumah used his majority in the parliament to push through the Constitutional Amendment Act, which abolished the assemblies and allowed the parliament to amend the constitution with a simple majority.|$|E
25|$|The crusaders {{organized}} into five divisions: the Burgundians, Raymond and the Byzantines, the Germans, the French, and the Lombards. The Turks nearly destroyed the crusaders’ army near {{the mountains of}} Paphlagonia at Mersivan. The land was well-suited to the Turks—dry and inhospitable for their enemy, it was open, with plenty of space for their cavalry units. The Turks had been troublesome to the Latins for some days, at last making certain that they went where Kilij Arslan I <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{and making sure that}} they only found a small amount of supplies.|$|E

25|$|Following the war, {{with most}} of the British Band killed and the rest {{captured}} or disbanded, the defeated Black Hawk was held in captivity at Jefferson Barracks near Saint Louis, Missouri together with Neapope, White Cloud, and eight other leaders. After eight months, in April 1833 they were taken east, as ordered by U.S. President Andrew Jackson. The men were taken by steamboat, carriage, and railroad, and met with large crowds wherever they went. Jackson <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> impressed with the power of the United States. Once in Washington, D.C., they met with Jackson and Secretary of War Lewis Cass. Afterward, they were delivered to their final destination, prison at Fortress Monroe in Norfolk, Virginia. They were held only a few weeks at the prison, during which they posed for portraits by different artists.|$|E
25|$|Both {{ships were}} {{designed}} to be short because the design board responsible for the ships <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to fit into dry docks otherwise closed to previous battleship classes. The design requirements this imposed made them shorter than the earlier King Edward VII-class battleships and rather cramped in service, but the requirements also made the ships both flat-sided and fairly flat-bottomed; this and the mounting of the heavy 9.2 inch guns and their turrets had the useful side-effect of making the Lord Nelsons resistant to rolling and therefore both good seaboats and good gun platforms. However, the design also forced a compromises in the 9.2-inch battery. The ships' beam limitations forced abandonment of a design in which each of them would mount twelve 9.2inch guns in six twin turrets, and instead they mounted ten of the guns in four twin and two single turrets, and limitations {{on the size of}} the 9.2-inch turrets themselves meant that they were cramped enough in service to impair the rate of fire of their guns.|$|E
25|$|Of 76 escapees, 73 were captured. Adolf Hitler {{initially}} <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shot as {{an example}} to other prisoners, along with Commandant von Lindeiner, the architect who designed the camp, the camp's security officer and all the guards on duty at the time. Hermann Göring, Field Marshal Keitel, Major-General Westhoff and Major-General von Graevenitz (head of the department in charge of war prisoners) all argued against the executions {{as a violation of}} the Geneva Conventions. Hitler eventually ordered SS head Himmler to execute {{more than half of the}} escapees. Himmler passed the selection on to General Arthur Nebe, and fifty were executed singly or in pairs. Roger Bushell, the leader of the escape, was shot by Gestapo official Emil Schulz just outside Saarbrucken, Germany. Bob Nelson is said to have been spared by the Gestapo because they may have believed he was related to his namesake Admiral Nelson. His friend Dick Churchill was probably spared because of his surname, shared with then British Prime Minister. 17 were returned to Stalag Luft III, and four were sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where they managed to tunnel out and escape three months later, although they were recaptured and returned there. Two were sent to Oflag IV-C Colditz.|$|E

25|$|The {{separation}} axioms {{are about}} the use of topological means to distinguish disjoint sets and distinct points. It's not enough for elements of a topological space <b>to</b> <b>be</b> distinct (that is, unequal); we may <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> topologically distinguishable. Similarly, it's not enough for subsets of a topological space <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disjoint; we may <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> separated (in any of various ways). The separation axioms all say, in one way or another, that points or sets that are distinguishable or separated in some weak sense must also be distinguishable or separated in some stronger sense.|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Hook arrives to the mansion to warn Emma, but Gold thwarts his efforts, erases his {{phone calls to}} Emma, and ties him to the fence. Inside the mansion, Elsa finds Emma and tells her that she sees her {{doing the same thing}} that she once did, blaming herself {{for not being able to}} control her powers because her family was harmed, and that she should be blessed to have this gift. Elsa then asks Emma for her hand and she takes it, {{resulting}} in Emma's powers returning to normal. Outside, Gold, upset over what he just saw, becomes furious over his failed attempt to take Emma's power, which pleased Hook. However, Gold says that despite the setback, he will find a way to acquire the power to free him of the Dagger of Kris. But Gold also needs another item: the heart of someone who knew Gold before he became the Dark One. Since Killian is the only one left alive, Gold takes his heart. By doing so, Gold makes Killian his puppet and vows to use him to find another way to get Emma's powers, before he will kill him. As Hook reunites with Emma and kisses her, Emma wondered what got into him, and after she and Elsa walk away, he grabs the Sorcerer's box and hides it inside the jacket. Regina arrives at the library, where Robin shows her a page that featured the two together at the pub back in the Enchanted Forest, leading to indications that whoever wrote the story <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> together. Back at the Snow Queen's lair, Ingrid, now free of the force field, follows through with her plan to bring her three sisters together by sending out her ribbons to Emma and Elsa. As Emma and Elsa are reunited with David, Mary Margaret, and Henry, she unleashed her magic into the sky, which creates colorful auroras and then fireworks. Unfortunately, Emma and Elsa notice the yellow ribbons on their left wrists too late, and that they can't remove their ribbons, even while the ribbons are siphoning away their power.|$|E

500|$|The Narrator finds {{redemption}} {{at the end}} of {{the film}} by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution. Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in The Graduate, indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self.

He had intended hiring {{the armed forces of}} an entire country to make the film, as he considered Napoleonic battles to be [...] "so beautiful, like vast lethal ballets", with an [...] "aesthetic brilliance that doesn't require a military mind to appreciate". He <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replicated as authentically as possible on screen. Kubrick had sent research teams to scout for locations across Europe, and commissioned screenwriter and director Andrew Birkin, one of his young assistants on 2001, to the Isle of Elba, Austerlitz, and Waterloo, taking thousands of pictures for his later perusal. Kubrick approached numerous stars to play leading roles, including Audrey Hepburn for Empress Josephine, a part which she could not accept due to semiretirement.|$|E
500|$|Constructing the Munitions and Main Navy Buildings was an idea {{conceived}} by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, who put forth {{the idea to}} President Woodrow Wilson. [...] Roosevelt originally suggested a temporary building {{be placed on the}} Ellipse, but President Wilson disliked the idea of a building on the White House's front lawn. [...] Thus, Roosevelt suggested placing the buildings on the National Mall (Potomac Park) along B Street (renamed Constitution Avenue in 1931), near the Lincoln Memorial.

500|$|Despite {{not using}} the sets, the episode did re-use the Borg costumes from First Contact, which McNeill {{described}} as [...] "the scarier Borg" [...] compared to those seen previously in The Next Generation. This caused some problems with filming as an animatronic Borg arm used for the film was malfunctioning, leading to the production being stalled for several hours. For First Contact, the Borg had been re-designed by Michael Westmore and Deborah Everton. The former and his makeup team had worked on {{the look of the}} heads, which included a variety of different Borg appliances which could be mixed and matched to create an ongoing variety of looks. For example, Westmore's colleague Jake Garber had created ten different eye pieces. Everton, meanwhile, created the costumes for the Borg, and <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more elaborate than in previous appearances.
