2500|$|The {{winner of}} the {{competition}} to design the DD-21 was due to be announced in March 2001, but the decision was put back twice as the new Bush administration reviewed defense spending. On March 1 {{it was announced that}} the decision would be made in May, and on May 31 it was announced that the Navy would wait for the results of the Quadrennial Defense Review, and a future shipbuilding review. After the House Appropriations Committee proposed a reduction in the DD-21 allocation in the FY2002 budget in late October 2001, on 1 November the Navy announced a less ambitious Future Surface Combatant program (FSC). Polmar claims that DD-21 was terminated primarily for political reasons as the program was closely identified <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration,</b> whereas Work views it as the culmination of a debate within the Navy about whether they should use in the littoral zone large capable ships like the DD-21 or more numerous smaller ships like the [...] "Streetfighter" [...] concept.

It is also increasingly democratic, and this month inaugurates its first popularly elected, civilian president in three decades, Kim Young Sam. But democracy has brought with it social disruption, demands for higher wages and overspending. President Kim inherits a stalled economy (the real growth rate, though more than 6 percent, is half {{of what it was}} in 1987), increasing pressures to control Korea's giant corporations, bitter regional tensions and suspended talks with North Korea. While South Korea's diplomatic and trade ties in the region now include Russia and China, Kim will need to improve relations with Japan, toward which many Koreans are still bitter. Finally, he must work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> to redefine Korea's relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United States. Korea has accepted new responsibility for its shared defense.

50|$|In 1997 Representative Leach again {{sponsored}} {{a bill to}} repeal Glass-Steagall Sections 20 and 32.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{different}} perspectives that <b>the</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Bush, and Obama administrations have had towards illegal immigration and border enforcement on the U. S. -Mexico border. Subsequently, it also explores what policies and laws {{that have been}} enacted. Historically, the U. S. has been quite open to immigration from Mexico. Especially {{since the end of}} the Bracero program, illegal immigration from Mexico has been a recurrent problem that at times has resulted in strict policies imposed by the U. S. government. During the last twenty years, this problem has become more profound and a visible escalation of border enforcement has occurred. The three administrations have in many ways employed three different strategies to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> issue. <b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> was faced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> challenge of strengthening the border at the same time that it wanted to keep it open to trade. However, <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> started <b>the</b> build-up that escalated out of proportions after the attacks on September 11. As a response to this, the Bush administration resorted to a legislative approach that subsequently has resulted in a more militarized border in the name of national security. During the Obama administration, the U. S. has experienced a standstill in illegal immigration from Mexico. However, the administration has concentrated their efforts on interior enforcement and is now pushing for immigration reform. Despite these differences, one can also see a continuation of policies that can be traced from the onset of Operation Gatekeeper until today...|$|R
50|$|According to <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> diplomat Martin Indyk, Muammar Gaddafi sought more respectability {{as early}} as the start of Bill Clinton's Presidency, in the early 1990s. According to an article written by Indyk in 2004, by the 1990s, Gaddafi gave up on {{supporting}} various Pan-Arab and African movements and instead began focusing on getting sanctions on Libya removed. Indyk stated that Gaddafi offered to give up his weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and open his facilities to inspection in 1999 in (then-)secret talks <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration.</b> According to Gaddafi's former Foreign Minister, Abdel Rahman Shalgham, the event which ultimately caused Gaddafi to give up his WMDs and nuclear weapons program was a reported 2001 message from U.S. President George W. Bush which told Gaddafi that “either you get rid of your weapons of mass destruction or United States will personally destroy them and destroy everything with no discussion.” Libyan officials began to meet covertly with British, Russian, and U.S. officials to officially dismantle the program. In March 2003, days before the invasion of Iraq, Gaddafi's personal envoys contacted U.S. President George W. Bush, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair about Libya's willingness to dismantle its nuclear program. Subsequently, at Gaddafi's direction, Libyan officials provided British, Russian, and U.S. diplomats with documentation and additional details on Libya's chemical, biological, nuclear, and ballistic missile activities. Libya reportedly allowed Russian, U.S., and British officials to visit 10 previously secret sites and dozens of Libyan laboratories and military factories to search for evidence of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities, and for chemical and missile programs.|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} first Industrial Revolution, during which many textile {{artisans}} lost their jobs to weaving machines, the relationship between technological progress and unemployment has been explored and examined by researchers and policy makers. Existing empirical research, mostly at the microeconomic level, has presented ambiguous results. Procuring data on 51 U. S. states {{for a period of}} 19 years and a large number of controls, this paper studies the employment effect of technological innovations with a novel state-level macroeconomic analysis. Using commercially-supplied Research and Development expenditure as a proxy, this paper finds that although technological innovations have a non-significant effect on employment at the general state level, there are a few factors that determine how well each state’s labor market responds to technological changes. More specifically, non-urbanized, non-tech-savvy, or states with a large number of workers employed in Manufacturing or Accommodation and Food Services industry experience a more severe unemployment effect than the other states. The results also suggest that unemployment rate is more negatively affected by technological innovations during the Obama <b>Administration,</b> compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> and Bush <b>Administration.</b> This paper adds to the limited, macroeconomic literature on technological unemployment, and provides policy makers with important implications on how to prepare citizens for the imminent waves of technological changes...|$|R
