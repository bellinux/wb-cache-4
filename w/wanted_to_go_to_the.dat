5|$|The next season, Leeds drew Turkish side Beşiktaş in the UEFA Champions League. Security {{surrounding}} both matches {{was increased}} and planned {{several months in}} advance. Because of the tensions caused by the stabbings in Istanbul, only 70 Beşiktaş fans travelled to Leeds. They had originally been booked onto an official Beşiktaş chartered flight, however, it was cancelled as was pre-match hospitality prepared by Leeds' directors. The flight, sponsored by Beşiktaş fans, was cancelled because only 70 out of a hoped-for 500 fans <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> match. In the return leg, Beşiktaş placed Leeds fans, who had been escorted through the airport, on an alcohol-free cruise around the Bosphorus Strait before being transported by bus to the BJK İnönü Stadium in Istanbul before the match.|$|E
5|$|After electing to bat, Australia {{made history}} {{on the first}} day by {{breaking}} the record for the most runs scored in a first-class match in a day. Ironically, {{it was the only time}} they were dismissed in a single day on the entire tour. With centuries from Brown (153), Bradman (187), Loxton (120) and Saggers (104*), Australia's first innings totalled 721; they were dismissed on the close of the first day's play. Bradman's 187 came in 155 minutes and Brown's 153 lasted three hours; the pair put on 219 in 90 minutes after Barnes fell for 79 at 145/1. Bradman came in and seized the initiative, reaching 42 in the 20 minutes before lunch, including five fours from one over by Frank Vigar which subsequently entered Essex club folklore. Bradman and Brown were parted when the latter fell at 364/2 only halfway through the day's play. Miller then famously deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball as a protest against Australia's merciless crushing of their hosts, something that angered his captain and batting partner Bradman. Miller later told Dickie Bird that he had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local horse races, but this was refused by Bradman. The all rounder therefore made his duck in protest, but still did not get to go to the races. Later, Loxton and Saggers made 166 in 65 minutes for the sixth wicket, before a late-order collapse saw Australia lose 5/57, leaving Saggers unbeaten, but not before he reached the only first-class century of his career. After being demoralised by the Australian batsmen {{on the first day}}, Essex made only 83 in their first innings, capitulating within 37 overs. Toshack took 5/31 and Miller 3/14, and Australia enforced the follow-on. Essex's second innings appeared to be heading the same way when four early wickets to Johnson had them at 46/6. However, a partnership of 133 between Tom Pearce and Peter Smith for the seventh wicket salvaged some respectability before they were out for 187. Johnson ended with 6/37 as the Australians dismissed their hosts twice in a single day. The ground attendance of 32,000 was a record.|$|E

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 18, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with advertising theaters known in Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arizona, Missouri, Texas, and Pennsylvania. The only known trade publication review is by The Moving Picture World {{and it is a}} positive one. The reviewer states, [...] "A clear presentation of the visions of a child who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city. The vision is, perhaps, a bit more beatific than the actual city, but it unquestionably represents the imagined city of those who have never seen it. The awakening was rude, but happily the vision becomes real when the father appears with sufficient money to take the dreamer to the city for which she has longed. The acting and mechanical work on this picture are both of excellent quality." [...] Another minor review of theater productions in the Arkansas City Daily Traveler said it was a good production.|$|E

They are a group of female volunteers who guard the entrance to the women’s section preventing entry to visitors who are not dressed to their idea of Orthodox modesty standards for women. The director of Jerusalem’s Open House, a community center for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, noted that Long’s experience was not unique.

[...] Although there was a combat art program at that time for the French Army and {{newspaper}} and magazine illustrators were drawing and painting infantry combat, because of his age, which was then sixty-three, Le Blant {{was not allowed to}} go to the front. [...] Instead, he decided to draw and paint the soldiers as they arrived and departed from the Gare de l'Est (East Station) in Paris. The neighborhood around the station was full of soldiers and Le Blant drew and painted the French and French Colonial army from life, throughout the war. [...] He also painted the soldiers at their barracks in Reuilly, Vincenne, where they awaited departure for the front. [...] This large body of work shows the French [...] "Polius at rest {{in a wide range of}} moods and postures. After the war, in 1919, these works were assembled into a large exhibition at Galerie Georges Petit.

2500|$|On October 23, 1924, a coup {{led by the}} warlord Feng Yuxiang {{took control}} of Beijing. Feng, the latest of the warlords to take Beijing was seeking {{legitimacy}} and decided that abolishing the unpopular Articles of Favorable Settlement was {{an easy way to}} win the approval of the crowd. The [...] "Articles of Favourable Treatment" [...] were unilaterally revised by Feng on November 5, 1924, abolishing Puyi's imperial title and privileges, and reducing him to a private citizen of the Republic of China. Puyi was expelled from the Forbidden City that same day. Puyi was given three hours to leave the Forbidden City. Puyi spent a few days at the house of his father Prince Chun, and then temporarily resided in the Japanese embassy in Beijing. Puyi left his father's house together with Johnston and his chief servant Big Li without informing Prince Chun's servants, who followed them in another car while two policemen joined on the sides of Puyi's car, leading to a wild car chase through Beijing as Puyi's chauffeur tried to lose the servants' car before Puyi was able to slip into a jewelry store and into a carriage that took him to the Japanese legation. Puyi had originally <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British Legation, but the Japanophile Johnston had insisted that he would be safer with the Japanese. For Johnston, the Japanese system where the Japanese people worshiped their emperor as a living god was much closer to his ideal political system than the British system of a constitutional monarchy, and he constantly steered Puyi in a pro-Japanese direction. One of Puyi's advisers Lu Zongyu-who was secretly working for the Japanese-suggested that Puyi move to Tianjin, which he argued was safer than Beijing, through the real reason was that the Japanese felt that Puyi would be easier to control in Tianjin without the embarrassment of having him live in the Japanese Legation, which was straining relations with China. On 23 February 1925, Puyi left Beijing for Tianjin while wearing a simple Chinese gown and skullcap as he was afraid of being robbed on the train.|$|E
