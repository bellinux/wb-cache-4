25|$|Fisher wrote {{a letter}} of {{recommendation}} to Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., resulting in Thomas' being hired for the Ziegfeld Follies. However, Thomas later disputed this, claiming she <b>walked</b> <b>right</b> up and asked for the job. She made her stage debut in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1915 on June 21, 1915. Thomas' popularity in the Follies led to her being cast in Ziegfeld's more risqué Midnight Frolic show. The Frolic was staged after hours in the roof garden of the New Amsterdam Theatre. It was primarily a show for famous male patrons who had plenty of money to bestow on the young and beautiful female performers. Thomas received expensive gifts from her admirers; it was rumored that German Ambassador Albrecht von Bernstorff {{had given her a}} $10,000 string of pearls.|$|E
25|$|Concurrently {{with the}} siege in 749, the Abbasids crossed the Euphrates and took Kufa. The son of Khalid al-Qasri – a disgraced Umayyad {{official}} {{who had been}} tortured to death a few years prior – began a pro-Abbasid riot starting at the city's citadel. On September 2, 749, al-Hasan bin Qahtaba essentially just <b>walked</b> <b>right</b> in {{to the city and}} set up shop. Some confusion followed when Abu Salama, an Abbasid officer, pushed for an Alid leader. Abu Muslim's confidante Abu Jahm reported what was happening, and the Abbasids acted preemptively. On Friday, November 28, 749, before the siege of Wasit had even finished, As-Saffah, the great-grandson of Muhammad's uncle, al-Abbas, was recognized as the new caliph in the mosque at Kufa. Abu Salama, who witnessed twelve military commanders from the revolution pledging allegiance, was embarrassed into following suit.|$|E

So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately <b>walked</b> <b>right</b> up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said she}} found the episode both [...] "dishearting" [...] and [...] "engaging", as well as later adding that it was [...] "sad" [...] and [...] "frightening" [...] when Jake O'Connor was accused of murdering his father. Writing about the final scene which shows Megan enter the Russell’s house, {{she said that she}} wanted to [...] "smack" [...] Megan for doing so, saying [...] "What was she thinking? She knew Scanlon had committed the murder and that Jen was acting strangely when she wouldn't let her in. Yet, she went back to find the door open and <b>walked</b> <b>right</b> in. Megan's intelligent enough to know that something wasn't right but she's unarmed and untrained to handle the situation. For some reason she seemed incapable of making the smart decision to wait for the real police". Orlando said of the flashback scenes that she hopes in future episodes they [...] "delve deeper" [...] into Megan's father's death, saying that it was [...] "certainly a turning point for the character and I'd love to know more". She said it was [...] "nice" [...] to see scenes between Peter and Megan and said of the carpooling storyline, [...] "Snacks for carpool didn't seem like a bad idea but they could have used a couple of healthier options to go with the chocolate". Of Curtis and Kate's examining Manny Santos, she said that their expressions were [...] "hysterical" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] when they decided whether Manny was a juvenile, adding that it gave [...] "a much needed moment of comic relief in an otherwise heavy episode". She finished in saying that the episode [...] "grabbed her attention", finishing, [...] "These engaging characters and this episode was a winner for Body of Proof". In the carpooling storyline it featured Tastykake's products, a line of snack foods based in Philadelphia. Such products which were mentioned were Krimpets and KandyKakes, with the ABC saying they were the [...] "best".|$|E
2500|$|Many stories {{exist to}} explain {{the origins of the}} footprints. The theatre's {{official}} account in its books and souvenir programs credit Norma Talmadge as having inspired the tradition when she accidentally stepped into the wet concrete. However, in a short interview during the September 13, 1937, Lux Radio Theatre broadcast of a radio adaptation of A Star Is Born, Grauman related another version of how he got the idea to put hand and foot prints in the concrete. He said it was [...] "pure accident. I <b>walked</b> <b>right</b> into it. While we were building the theatre, I accidentally happened to step in some soft concrete. And there it was. So, I went to Mary Pickford immediately. Mary put her foot into it." [...] Still another account by the construction foreman, Jean Klossner, recounts that Klossner autographed his work next to the right-hand poster kiosk and that Grauman and he developed the idea then and there. His autograph and handprint, dated 1927, remain today. The theatre's third founding partner, Douglas Fairbanks, was the second celebrity, after Talmadge, to be immortalized in the concrete.|$|E
2500|$|Scherzer {{held the}} Dodgers hitless until the fifth inning, when Los Angeles right fielder Josh Reddick finally singled. The Dodgers loaded the bases {{with two more}} singles, but Scherzer struck out pinch hitter Andre Ethier and got second baseman Chase Utley to ground out to end the inning without the Dodgers scoring. The Nats, meanwhile, staked Scherzer to a 1-0 lead off Dodgers starter Rich Hill {{in the bottom of}} the second inning when second baseman Daniel Murphy singled, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman walked, and shortstop Danny Espinosa singled to drive in Murphy. [...] But they missed scoring {{opportunities}} that followed. In the third inning, center fielder Trea Turner singled, stole second, and advanced to third on a fly out and Murphy was intentionally walked and stole second, but Dodgers reliever Joe Blanton entered the game and got third baseman Anthony Rendon to line out to end the inning without driving either of them in. In the fifth inning, Dodgers pitcher Julio Urías <b>walked</b> <b>right</b> fielder Bryce Harper but then picked him off first. And in the sixth inning, after left fielder Jayson Werth walked, Zimmerman doubled with two outs and third base coach Bob Hendley ill-advisedly sent Werth home as he rounded third; the Dodgers cut Werth down at the plate easily to end the inning.|$|E

2500|$|In {{subsequent}} legal hearings, residents testified how: [...] "If you <b>walked</b> <b>right</b> {{behind the}} factory {{it was like}} cotton. It was in {{the cracks in the}} pavement behind the factory;" [...] and: [...] "It used to be blue-white. We used to sweep this blue dust up. It was blue fluffy stuff... I used {{to get up in the}} morning and the other side of the street always had a layer of fine dust with footmarks on it from the early morning workers." [...] Of the conditions in the nearby school one said: [...] "The dust was always there while I was at school, lying on walls or window ledges if it had been damp. It was like snow fall." [...] Describing the loading bay, to which local children had easy access, one witness recalled: [...] "Sometimes sacks were left out overnight. They were hessian sacks and they were full of a sort of fluffy dust. We could jump on the sacks when they were left out... I remember seeing grey-blue coloured dust come out of them. If we jumped hard enough the sacks burst open. After sitting or bouncing on the sacks I remember being covered in dust." [...] During the summer doors and windows of both the factory and the houses were left open for cooling, and during the winter children often congregated around the factory's street-level ventilation outlets for warmth.|$|E
2500|$|When she {{was interviewed}} for Blues & Soul in 2010, Rowland {{explained}} that the album would blend her urban roots with a strong dance music influence. [...] "I'd say {{the main difference between}} this new album and my previous albums, is that this time I wasn't afraid to take a risk. I didn't care whether it was urban, dance, hip hop, WHATEVER... I just wanted a great track that I could sing and that people would enjoy." [...] Part of the inspiration for the new sound on the album was wanting to do something different. In her interview with The Independent, she said [...] "For me, it was being kind of at a flat line with urban music and wanting something different ... when I did 'When Love Takes Over', it was easy to do it – it was almost like it happened before me in spirit and I <b>walked</b> <b>right</b> into it. ...so I knew I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction." [...] Then in response to criticisms that her long-standing fans would not have their expectations met, she said [...] "I did not forget about my urban roots, nor will I ever ... That {{is one of the reasons}} I am here period ... I thank everyone for being so wonderful and so open to me trying something new. I won't let you down this record, I promise you." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Chicago, starter Jake Arrieta, {{returning}} to action {{after suffering a}} hamstring injury, [...] walked five Nats in four innings of work but allowed only two hits. He gave up only one run – unearned – when, {{in the top of}} the third inning, Washington shortstop Trea Turner, batting leadoff but 0-for-13 in the series, doubled with one out, reaching base for the first time in the NLDS, then advanced to third base on a wild pitch. Arrieta struck out left fielder Jayson Werth, then [...] <b>walked</b> <b>right</b> fielder Bryce Harper , who stole second. After that, Cubs shortstop Addison Russell committed an error on Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman′s slow roller, allowing Turner to score and giving Washington a 1-0 lead before Arrieta struck out second basemen Daniel Murphy to end the inning. He faced another major scoring threat {{in the top of the}} fourth, when Washington third baseman Anthony Rendon led off with a double, [...] center fielder Michael A. Taylor [...] walked, Strasburg executed a textbook sacrifice bunt [...] to advance both runners, and Trea Turner walked to load the bases with two outs, but he struck out Werth again to end both the inning and his playoff outing, having struck out four Nats and allowed no earned runs. Jon Lester relieved Arrieta in the fifth and retired the first ten Nationals batters he faced, the last of them Bryce Harper, who led off the eighth inning and struck out. Ryan Zimmerman walked and attempted to rattle Lester – known for disliking throwing the ball to the bases – by taking long leads, but Lester uncharacteristically managed to pick him off first for the second out.|$|E
