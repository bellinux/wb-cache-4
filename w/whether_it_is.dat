5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Graham Cormode {{proved that}} {{deciding}} <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible {{to complete a}} level of Lemmings is NP-hard. Later, Giovanni Viglietta showed that the task is PSPACE-complete, even for levels where {{there is only one}} lemming to save.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the listed species, a distinctive Charadrius plover known as the white-faced plover has been seen in Thailand in recent years. It is at present unclear <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a new species or a subspecies of Kentish plover.|$|E

5|$|The {{song of the}} {{distinctive}} S.e.arctica {{is said to be}} noticeably different from that of its relatives, which would help to establish <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a full species, but there has been insufficient research into its vocalizations.|$|E
5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E
5|$|According to the plan, {{the type}} of {{consumption}} (i.e. whether agricultural, industrial and civil) will also be considered when setting energy prices. The subsidy plan will be implemented in proportion with geographical regions because warm regions consume more electricity during summer while cold regions consume more gas during winter. Finally, the time of consumption (i.e. during peak and off-peak hours) and the consumption demand (i.e. <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> low or high) will be taken into consideration.|$|E
60|$|But {{he tried}} in vain. Whereupon there arose a great {{argument}} about the trumpet, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in order or not, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible for any one to sound it.

50|$|Historical {{evidence}} {{can sometimes}} {{be brought to bear}} on two questions concerning pitching: first, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> considered desirable for singers to select their own key, and second <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> advisable to use a tuning fork or pitch pipe as an aid.|$|R
50|$|Generally, the {{question}} of the ensoulment of the fetus revolved around {{the question}} of when the rational soul entered the body, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{an integral part of the}} bodily form and substance, or <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> pre-existent and subject to reincarnation or pre-existence.|$|R
5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|As of December 2007, the TTB lists both Zinfandel and Primitivo as {{approved}} grape varieties for American wines, {{but they are}} not listed as synonyms. U.S. producers, therefore, must label a wine according to <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Zinfandel or Primitivo. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) proposed in 2002 that they be recognised as synonyms, but no decision on this proposal (RIN 1513–AA32, formerly RIN 1512-AC65) has been made.|$|E
5|$|Divine command theory (also {{known as}} {{theological}} voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good {{is equivalent to}} <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> commanded by God. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that {{for a person to}} be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.|$|E
50|$|The Supreme Courts of {{the states}} and territories are {{superior}} courts of record with general and unlimited jurisdiction within their own state or territory.

5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} {{a solution to}} the problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a rise in cases of {{undisclosed}} synthetic diamond melee being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade. Due to the relatively inexpensive cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal knowledge for identifying large quantities of melee efficiently, not all dealers have made an effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the finless sleeper ray can {{generate}} a defensive electric shock from paired electric organs in its disc. It gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk. A litter size of four has been recorded from one individual. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the finless sleeper ray as Vulnerable. This slow-reproducing species is caught by intensive bottom trawl and possibly other fisheries throughout its range, which likely cause high mortality regardless of <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> discarded or utilised.|$|E
50|$|A special {{chapter of}} the order, the capitular knights, open only to Oldenburgers, had a badge which {{consisted}} of the medallion, surrounded by a green enameled wreath of oak leaves. It came in several classes whose badge differed in <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> gold or silver and <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> crowned.|$|R

5|$|Observations of Io by {{spacecraft}} and Earth-based {{astronomers have}} led to the identification of differences in the types of eruptions seen on the satellite. The three main types identified include intra-patera, flow-dominated, and explosion-dominated eruptions. They differ in terms of duration, energy released, brightness temperature (determined from infrared imaging), type of lava flow, and <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> confined within volcanic pits.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June 2016, the Australian Transport Minister, Darren Chester, {{said that}} a piece of {{aircraft}} debris had been found on Pemba Island, {{off the coast of}} Tanzania. It was handed over to the authorities so that experts from Malaysia could determine <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> part of the aircraft. The Australian government released photos of the piece, believed to be an outboard flap from one of the aircraft's wings, on 20 July. On 15 September, Malaysia's transport ministry confirmed that the debris came from the missing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|President Reagan {{announced}} on September 16, 1983, that the Global Positioning System (GPS) {{would be made}} available for civilian use, free of charge, once completed in order to avert similar navigational errors in the future.

But to take this in pieces--1. In a word, are they converted? God finds them first, for, saith He, [...] "I am found of them that sought Me not" [...] (Isa 65:1). 2. Have they pardon of sin? They have that also freely,--"I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely" [...] (Hosea 14:4). 3. Have they faith? <b>It</b> <b>is</b> the gift of God in Christ Jesus, and He {{is not only the}} Author, that is, the beginner thereof, but He doth also perfect the same (Heb 12:2). 4. Have they hope? <b>It</b> <b>is</b> God that is the first cause thereof--"Remember the word unto Thy servant, upon which Thou hast caused me to hope" [...] (Psa 119:49). 5. Have they righteousness? <b>It</b> <b>is</b> the free gift of God (Rom 5:17). Have they strength to do the work of God in their generations, or any other thing that God would have them do? That also is a free gift from the Lord, for without Him we neither do nor can do anything (John 15:5). 7. Have we comfort, or consolation? We have it not for what we have done, but from God through Christ; for He is the God of all comforts and consolation (2 Cor 1:3-7). 8. Have we the Spirit, or the fruits thereof? <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the gift of the Father--"how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him (Luke 11:13)? [...] "Thou has wrought all our works in us" [...] (Isa 26:12).|$|R
5000|$|In the past, {{the courts}} took {{the view that}} the {{function}} of the court is not to second-guess the employer’s decision. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not up to the court to ask <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the [...] "best" [...] decision under those circumstances; it needed only to consider <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a rational, commercial or operational decision.|$|R
