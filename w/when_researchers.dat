5|$|In July 2013, {{scientists}} from the University of Maryland and the US Department of Agriculture found {{that a combination of}} pesticides has been contaminating the pollen bees use to feed their hives. <b>When</b> <b>researchers</b> collected pollen from hives on the east coast, they discovered that it was contaminated (on average) with 9 different fungicides and pesticides, although scientists found a blend of 21 different agricultural chemicals in one sample of pollen. Eight ag chemicals were identified to be associated with increased risk of infection by Nosema ceranae.|$|E
5|$|The first, indirect, {{detection}} of gravitational waves {{came in the}} 1970s through observation {{of a pair of}} closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16. The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves. Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, <b>when</b> <b>researchers</b> at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves, on Earth, exactly one hundred years after the prediction.|$|E

5|$|While slight {{variations}} on the standard genetic code had been predicted earlier, none was discovered until 1979, <b>when</b> <b>researchers</b> studying human mitochondrial genes determined that they used an alternative code. However, the mitochondria of many other eukaryotes, including most plants, use the standard code. Many slight variants have been discovered since, including various alternative mitochondrial codes. Further, the AUA, AUC, and AUU codons are all allowable start codons.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. <b>When</b> <b>researchers</b> fed hamsters grass that grew on ground where a deer that died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Polyakov {{underwent}} medical assessments before, during, {{and after}} the flight. He also underwent two follow-up examinations six months after returning to Earth. <b>When</b> <b>researchers</b> compared {{the results of these}} medical exams, it was revealed that although there were no impairments of cognitive functions, Polyakov experienced a clear decline in mood as well as a feeling of increased workload during the first few weeks of spaceflight and return to Earth. However, Polyakov's mood stabilized to pre-flight levels between the second and fourteenth month of his mission. It was also revealed that Polyakov did not suffer from any prolonged performance impairments after returning to Earth. In light of these findings, researchers concluded that a stable mood and overall function could be maintained during extended duration spaceflights, such as manned missions to Mars.|$|E

50|$|The {{first two}} {{features}} of a theoretical sample deals with issues {{right at the beginning}} of the research project. The third feature however deals with concerns or application during the process of the research. One of the advantages the qualitative research as a whole has over quantitative research is its flexibility.In theoretical sampling the researcher manipulates or changes the theory, sampling activities as well as the analysis during the course of the research. Flexibility occurs in this style of sampling <b>when</b> the <b>researchers</b> want to increase the sample size due to new factors that arise during the research. Flexibility also occurs <b>when</b> the <b>researcher’s</b> wishes to use a small sample during the initial stages of the research but increase the sample size to test developing generalizations. Finally flexibility is also allowed <b>when</b> the <b>researcher</b> finds unexpected generalization and wants to look into deviant cases.|$|R
5|$|The {{scholarly}} {{study of}} music in the United States includes work relating music to social class, racial, ethnic and religious identity, gender and sexuality, as well as studies of music history, musicology, and other topics. The academic study of American music {{can be traced back}} to the late 19th century, <b>when</b> <b>researchers</b> like Alice Fletcher and Francis La Flesche studied the music of the Omaha peoples, working for the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. In the 1890s and into the early 20th century, musicological recordings were made among indigenous, Hispanic, African-American and Anglo-American peoples of the United States. Many worked for the Library of Congress, first under the leadership of Oscar Sonneck, chief of the Library's Music Divisions. These researchers included Robert W. Gordon, founder of the Archive of American Folk Song, and John and Alan Lomax; Alan Lomax was the most prominent of several folk song collectors who helped to inspire the 20th century roots revival of American folk culture.|$|E

50|$|Linked {{with more}} than two dozen deaths since its discovery, B virus is the only {{identified}} nonhuman primate herpesvirus that displays severe pathogenicity in humans.

Proper personal protective equipment is essential when working with macaques, especially those animals that have tested positive for the virus.

25|$|Unlike {{fetal alcohol}} syndrome, no set of {{characteristics}} {{has been discovered}} that results uniquely from cocaine exposure in utero.

40|$|As more {{is known}} about {{contemporary}} cultural shifts and the effect this has on the young, research must consider how children operate as global citizens. Children are innocent and vulnerable, but also actively participate in the world; research into early childhood must therefore refine ideas and conceptions and develop research methodologies that see children as superdiverse young citizens. Intergenerational collaborative drawing, which involves adult researchers and children drawing together, is a method that supports superdimensions.
