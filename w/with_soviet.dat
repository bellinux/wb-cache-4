5|$|In 1960, Fischer {{tied for}} first place <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> star Boris Spassky at the strong Mar del Plata Tournament in Argentina, winning by a {{two-point}} margin, scoring 13½/15 (+13−1=1), ahead of David Bronstein. Fischer lost only to Spassky; this {{was the start of}} their lifelong friendship.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{capture of}} Vilnius {{set the stage}} for further {{escalation}} of Polish conflicts <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> Russia and Lithuania. In coming months, Polish forces would push steadily eastward, launching Operation Minsk in August.|$|E
5|$|The Prague Spring deepened the disillusionment of many Western leftists <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> views. It {{contributed to}} the growth of Euro{{communist}} ideas in Western communist parties, which sought greater distance from the Soviet Union, and eventually led to the dissolution of many of these groups.|$|E

50|$|In foreign relations, the SRVN became {{increasingly}} aligned <b>with</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Union by joining the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), and signing a Friendship Pact, {{which was in}} fact a military alliance, <b>with</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Union. Tension between Vietnam and China mounted along with China's rivalry <b>with</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Union and conflict erupted with Cambodia, China's ally. Vietnam was also subject to trade embargoes by the U.S. and its allies.|$|R
5|$|The Soviets {{ultimately}} sentenced Powers to {{a decade}} in prison. Working with lawyer James B. Donovan, Miskovsky negotiated <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> representatives. Eventually, they agreed upon a trade: Gary Powers would be released in exchange for Soviet spy Rudolf Abel held by the United States. Both sides agreed and Powers was released in 1962.|$|E
5|$|The diversionary attacks went well, <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> forces acting {{under the}} {{impression}} that the Poles had targets other than Vilnius. Despite their diversionary intent, these attacks succeeded in their own right, with Generał Józef Adam Lasocki taking Lida in two days despite unexpectedly strong resistance, and Generał Stefan Mokrzecki taking Nowogrodek in three days and Baranowicze in four.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} twenty, {{he formed}} a workers' soviet in Echmiadzin. In 1915 Mikoyan {{formally}} joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (later known as the Bolshevik Party) and became {{a leader of the}} revolutionary movement in the Caucasus. His interactions <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> revolutionaries led him to Baku, where he became the co-editor for the Armenian-language newspaper Sotsyal-Demokrat and later for the Russian-language paper Izvestia Bakinskogo Soveta. During this time, he is said to have robbed a bank in Tiflis with TNT and had his nose broken in street fighting.|$|E
50|$|Four years later, {{he won a}} {{gold medal}} <b>with</b> the <b>Soviet</b> team in the 1980 Olympic tournament. He played five matches. <b>With</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Union, Zaytsev won two other Olympic silver medals, two World Championships and seven European titles.|$|R
50|$|However, in late August, Germany {{arranged}} its own {{occupation of}} Romania, targeting oil fields. The move raised tensions <b>with</b> the <b>Soviets,</b> who responded that Germany {{was supposed to}} have consulted <b>with</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Union under Article III of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.|$|R
5000|$|Germany {{developed}} {{positive relationship}} with the Baltic states, especially with Latvia. Latvia represented itself as a bridge to an improved relationship <b>with</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Union. Latvia managed to sign a trade agreement with Germany in 1926 and <b>with</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1927. Similarly, Lithuania signed a trade agreement with Germany in May 1926. Lithuania {{was the key to}} improved relationship <b>with</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Union. In exchange for Soviet recognition of Lithuania's claim to Vilnius, the countries signed a non-aggression pact in September 1926.|$|R
5|$|Born in Hamburg, Ostermann {{joined the}} {{military}} service of the Luftwaffe in 1937 and was trained as a pilot. After a brief period with Zerstörergeschwader 1 (ZG1), a heavy fighter unit, he was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG54). He participated in the Battle of France and Britain before transferring east. He became the sixth fighter pilot in aviation history to achieve 100 aerial victories on the Eastern Front {{for which he was}} awarded Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. He was killed in aerial combat <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> fighters southeast of Lake Ilmen on 9August 1942.|$|E
5|$|By late 1989, the Communist Parties of {{the republics}} of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had largely been {{weakened}} in power. In Nagorno-Karabakh, the intercommunal relations between Armenians and Azerbaijanis had worsened due to violence and pogroms. Gorbachev's policies hastened {{the collapse of the}} Soviet system and many Armenians and Azerbaijanis sought protection by arming themselves <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> military weaponry. His preoccupation in dealing with the numerous demands by the other republics saw the disappearance of vast amounts of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and other small arms munitions stored in caches throughout Armenia and Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|Cho was {{dispatched}} by the Soviet {{authorities to}} liberated Korea when the Red Army entered in 1945. By that time, he had substantial experience <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> literature and literature administration. The Soviets hoped that Cho would shape the cultural {{institutions of the}} new state based on the Soviet model. For the Soviets, the move was successful and Cho did not only that but also significantly developed socialist realism as it would become {{the driving force of}} North Korean literature and arts.|$|E
50|$|At the 1988 Winter Olympics, Mogilny {{made his}} senior debut <b>with</b> the <b>Soviet</b> {{national}} team as an 18-year-old in Canada. He played <b>with</b> the full-roster <b>Soviet</b> Union {{team that won}} the gold medal.|$|R
50|$|Although not a Communist, Beneš {{was also}} on {{friendly}} terms with Stalin. Believing that Czechoslovakia had more to gain from an alliance <b>with</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Union than one with Poland, he torpedoed plans for a Polish-Czechoslovak confederation and in 1943, he signed an entente <b>with</b> the <b>Soviets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vytautas Vasiliauskas (born October 21, 1930) is a Lithuanian {{citizen who}} was a {{collaborator}} <b>with</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Russian occupation regime and who worked <b>with</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Ministry of State Security. He was convicted of genocide {{for his role in}} the Soviet murder of Lithuanian resistance fighters.|$|R
5|$|Following {{his visit}} to China, Nixon met <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> leaders, {{including}} Brezhnev in Moscow. These Strategic Arms Limitation Talks resulted in two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, after Smith's death, {{a script}} {{was written for}} a {{television}} movie titled The Samantha Smith Story with Robert Wagner as producer. Columbia Pictures Television and R.J. Wagner Productions {{were reported to have}} agreed to produce the film for NBC, <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> company Sovin Film interested in co-producing it. Ultimately, Columbia Pictures Television decided not to film it due to lack of interest from any network.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{intervention}} in Russia in 1918–19. He was indignant <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> accounts {{of a vast}} capitalist conspiracy against the world's first worker's state, some of which do not even mention the First World War; he was equally indignant with the decision to intervene as costly and harmful. He argues that the interventions, by arousing Russian nationalism, may have ensured {{the survival of the}} Bolshevik state.|$|E

5|$|The Treblinka I gravel mine functioned at full {{capacity}} {{under the command}} of Theodor van Eupen until July 1944, with new forced labourers sent to him by Kreishauptmann Ernst Gramss from Sokołów. The mass shootings continued into 1944. <b>With</b> <b>Soviet</b> troops closing in, the last 300 to 700 Sonderkommandos disposing of the incriminating evidence were executed by Trawnikis in late July 1944, long after the camp's official closure. Strebel, the ethnic German who had been installed in the farmhouse built in place of the camp's original bakery using bricks from the gas chambers, set fire to the building and fled to avoid capture.|$|E
5|$|The Tupolev Tu-142 (142; NATO {{reporting}} name: Bear F/J) is a maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft {{derived from}} the Tu-95 turboprop strategic bomber. A specialised communications variant designated Tu-142MR was tasked with long-range communications duties <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> ballistic missile submarines. The Tu-142 was designed by the Tupolev design bureau, and manufactured by the Kuibyshev Aviation and Taganrog Machinery Plants from 1968 to 1994. Formerly operated by the Soviet Navy and Ukrainian Air Force, the Tu-142 currently serves with the Russian Navy.|$|E
5|$|The first {{scenes of}} {{dialogue}} are Floyd's encounters {{on the space}} station: chit-chat with the colleague who greets him, his telephone call to his daughter, and the friendly but strained encounter <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> scientists. Later, {{en route to the}} monolith, Floyd engages in trite exchanges with his staff while a spectacular journey by Earth-light across the Lunar surface is shown. Hal is the only character who expresses anxiety, as well as feelings of pride and bewilderment.|$|E

Sikorski's position was that Germany was the principal enemy and that cooperation <b>with</b> the <b>Soviet</b> Union was conditionally possible. There were rival factions in the government and probably no official proclamations on that issue.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of the new}} {{immigrants}} found that their former education was not recognized by many Israeli employers, though it was recognized by institutions of higher education. Many had to work in jobs which did not match their expertise, in contrast <b>with</b> <b>Soviets</b> who immigrated to the United States in the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|V. I. Lenin's policy, {{the right}} of nations to {{self-determination}} aimed at preventing the disintegration of Russia {{during the period of}} military weakness. He assumed that in war-torn, splintering Europe, the proletariat of free nations would carry out socialist revolutions and unite <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> Russia later. The majority of the Finnish labor movement supported Finland's independence. The Finnish Bolsheviks, influential though few in number, favoured annexation of Finland by Russia. The question of annexation, in the aftermath of World War I, was resolved by the defeat of Red Finland and weakness of Russia.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>Soviet</b> support, 2,000 ANC troops {{launched}} a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful, {{but during the}} course of the offensive, the ANC became involved in infighting between the Baluba and Bena Lulua ethnic groups. As a result, the ANC perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians. Around 3,000 were killed. The violence of the advance caused an exodus of thousands of Baluba civilians who fled their homes to escape the fighting.|$|E
5|$|A {{communications}} variant designated Tu-142MR ("Bear J") was {{the last}} production version of the Tu-142. It was tasked with long-range communications duties <b>with</b> <b>Soviet</b> ballistic missile submarines, a role {{similar to that of}} the Boeing E-6 Mercury. The Tu-142MR differed from the ASW Tu-142s in having less-sophisticated avionics, but had a long trailing wire radio aerial to relay messages to submerged Soviet submarines in times of nuclear war. This was amongst the many distinctive features of the Tu-142MR that allows it to communicate with satellites, airborne and ground-based command posts, and submarines. The aircraft replaced the Ilyushin Il-80 in the airborne command and control role. Tu-142s are currently operated by the 76th Naval Aviation Regiment from Kipelovo. Other developments of the Tu-142 include the one-off Tu-142MRT maritime reconnaissance variant, and the unbuilt Tu-142MS missile-carrying variant.|$|E
