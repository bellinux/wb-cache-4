Groups of 25 people or less may be taken through the Archives and shown what it has to offer, and school visits can be arranged in both the Archives' Rabat and Mdina locations. School students are shown through the Archives to increase awareness of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> offer and also shown how archived documents are handled. Students are also given the chance to experience the difficulty involved in cataloging and reorganising the Archives' items.|$|E

[...] On April 19, 2007, Thompson and Take-Two settled the suit, with Thompson agreeing not to seek any legal restriction on sales of Take-Two's games, threaten to sue the company, or accuse Take-Two of any wrongdoing based {{on the sale of}} any of its games.|$|E
500|$|Pompeo {{suffers from}} several allergies and asthma. She owns two toy poodles {{with her husband}} because they don't shed: [...] "I have asthma, {{so those are the}} only kinds of dogs I can have." [...] Pompeo follows a healthy lifestyle, meditates twice a day for 20 minutes each, and does so inside her trailer in between takes as well. Pompeo heavily criticised media reports {{suggesting}} that she suffered from an eating disorder, calling the media irresponsible for promoting such rumours. In a 2007 issue of Los Angeles Confidential Magazine, she said that she was worried about the young girls who look up to her: [...] "I don’t want them to think I starve myself or don’t eat, and that to be like me that’s <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E

500|$|The BBC Deputy Director General, Mark Byford, also {{defended the}} {{decision}} {{on the day of}} the programme, saying: [...] " [...] should have the right to be heard, be challenged, and for the public who take part in Question Time and the viewers to make up their own minds about the views of the BNP. It's not for the BBC to censor and say they can't be on". The BBC's chief political adviser, Ric Bailey, stated after the failed appeal that the BBC [...] "would have been breaking its charter if it had not treated the BNP with impartiality ... We absolutely stand by that judgement, even though there's obviously been a lot of controversy about it". A senior BBC presenter, John Humphrys, said the decision was [...] "absolutely right". He said: [...] "Why should we be afraid of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say? Free speech is the issue here, and the BBC's obligations." [...] However, broadcasting unions said some of its members would protest at the invitation.|$|E
500|$|Section 5 {{is based}} on Article 9 of the United Kingdom's Bill of Rights 1689: [...] "he [...] of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in [...] {{ought not to be}} impeached or {{questioned}} in any Court or Place out of [...]" [...] On the basis of this provision, and for other reasons, a long line of authorities in the Commonwealth have held that courts are precluded from impeaching or questioning the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament. This is so even if the legal action is brought by, and not against, a member of the legislature. Immunity also extends to independent persons appointed by Parliament exercising their duties in relation to Parliament's activities. In Prebble v. Television New Zealand Ltd. (1994), the Privy Council held that if any exceptions were made unless in the most extreme circumstances, members of the legislature would not know if there would subsequently be challenges to what they are saying in Parliament. Therefore, members would not have the confidence to state fully and freely <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say.|$|E
500|$|Whether an {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization would send humanity a decipherable message {{is a matter}} of debate in itself. Sagan argued that a highly advanced extraterrestrial civilization would bear in mind that they were communicating with a relatively primitive one and therefore would try to ensure that the receiving civilization would be able to understand the message. Arguing against this view, astronomer Guillermo Lemarchand stated that {{an advanced}} civilization would probably encrypt a message with high information content, such as an Encyclopædia Galactica, {{in order to ensure that}} only other ethically advanced civilizations would be able to understand it. Douglas Vakoch assumes it may take some time to decode any message, telling ABC News that [...] "I don't think we're going to understand immediately <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say." [...] “There’s going to be a lot of guesswork in trying to interpret another civilization," [...] he told Science Friday, adding that [...] "in some ways, any message we get from an extraterrestrial will be like a cosmic Rorschach ink blot test.” ...|$|E

500|$|The Highbury {{clock was}} {{unveiled}} in an elevated position {{before the game}} against Tottenham Hotspur {{as part of the}} ground's refurbishment work. Merson and Thomas scored a goal apiece against their bitter rivals, handing the team a fourth straight league win and send them two points clear of Norwich City. Match reporter Clive White conceded Tottenham had a legitimate claim for a penalty in the first half, but felt they never merited anything from the game, contrasting the visitor's disappointing play to Arsenal – [...] "the epitome of pure, free-flowing football." [...] The team continued their good away form by taking apart Everton at Goodison Park. Graham labelled his team as [...] "nice and solid" [...] after a goalless first half and the visitors sprung to life in the second, scoring three goals. Richardson, scorer of Arsenal's third, assessed the squad was more experienced than last year, adding [...] "Everybody knows <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Arsenal failed to record a sixth straight win as Sheffield Wednesday held on for a 1–1 draw at Highbury the following weekend.|$|E

Manson also appeared in Michael Moore's 2002 documentary, Bowling for Columbine; his appearance was filmed {{on the same day}} as their Denver Ozzfest performance.

2500|$|On 16 August 1819 a {{crowd had}} {{assembled}} near Manchester {{to listen to}} a speech by Henry Hunt and was run down by the yeomanry cavalry, with fifteen dead as a result. Fitzwilliam's first reaction to [...] "Peterloo" [...] was cautious. He wrote on 24 August: [...] "I see they are making much of what has happened in Manchester, in London. No doubt much may be said against interfering with a legal meeting...but circumstances may arise to call for the intervention of the magistrates even on such occasions, and to be impartial, one must hear <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say for themselves". On 5 October Fitzwilliam wrote to Lady Ponsonby: [...] "If we do not set this matter to rights, the military are henceforward the governing power in the British Empire". At the county meeting of Yorkshire held on 14 October, Fitzwilliam was represented by his son Lord Milton, and it adopted the resolutions drafted by Fitzwilliam: the right to public assembly and condemnation of unlawful interference with it, and a demand for an inquiry into Peterloo. Fitzwilliam's objection, as he wrote on 17 October, was to: ...|$|E
