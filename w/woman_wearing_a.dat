5|$|In 1949, Grant starred {{alongside}} Ann Sheridan in {{the comedy}} I Was a Male War Bride {{in which he}} appeared in scenes dressed as a <b>woman,</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> skirt and a wig. During the filming he was taken ill with infectious hepatitis and lost weight, affecting {{the way he looked}} in the picture. The film proved to be successful, becoming the highest-grossing film for 20th Century Fox that year with over $4.5 million in takings and being likened to Hawks's screwball comedies of the late 1930s. By this point {{he was one of the}} highest paid Hollywood stars, commanding $300,000 per picture.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{copied the}} files from her laptop to an SD card for her camera, {{so that she}} could take it with her to the United States while on R leave. Army {{investigators}} later found the SD card in Manning's basement room in her aunt's home, in Potomac, Maryland. On January 23, Manning flew to the United States via Germany, for two weeks of leave. It was during this visit that she first went out dressed as a <b>woman,</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> wig and makeup. After her arrest, her former partner, Tyler Watkins, told Wired that Manning had said during the visit that she had found some sensitive information and was considering leaking it.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-seven of the carvings depict animals: rabbits, dogs, a puppy biting a cat, a ewe {{feeding a}} lamb, monkeys, lions, bats, and the Early Christian motif of two doves {{drinking}} from a ewer. Eighteen of the misericords have mythological subjects, including mermaids, dragons and wyverns. Five of the carvings are clearly narrative, {{such as the}} Fox and the Geese, {{and the story of}} Alexander the Great being raised to Heaven by griffins. There are three heads: a bishop in a mitre, an angel and a <b>woman</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> veil over her hair arranged in coils over each ear. Eleven carvings are of human figures, among which are several of remarkable design, having been conceived by the artist specifically for their purpose of supporting a shelf. One figure lies beneath the seat, supporting the shelf with his cheek, one hand and one foot. Another sits in a contorted manner supporting the weight on his elbow, while another figure squats with his knees wide apart and a strained look on his face.|$|E

25|$|The patron {{goddess of}} Carchemish was Kubaba, a deity of {{apparently}} Hurrian origins. She was {{represented as a}} dignified <b>woman</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> long robe, standing or seated, and holding a mirror. The main male deity of the town was Karhuha, akin to the Hittite stag-god Kurunta.|$|E

25|$|In art, {{originally}} Isis was pictured as a <b>woman</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> long sheath {{dress and}} crowned with the hieroglyphic sign for a throne. Sometimes she {{is depicted as}} holding a lotus, or, as a sycamore tree. One pharaoh, Thutmose III, is depicted in his tomb as nursing from a sycamore tree that has a breast.|$|E
25|$|Boyer {{published}} I Married Wyatt Earp with {{a picture}} {{on the cover of}} a <b>woman</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> sheer gauze peignoir, re-touched to conceal her breasts and nipples.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some feminists {{did not take}} {{to the fact that}} the spots were painted pink, much less that a <b>woman</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> pink mini skirt was also painted on the spot.

25|$|In 2002, under Ashcroft, {{curtains}} {{were installed}} blocking the Spirit of Justice statue in the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building, {{which is of}} a <b>woman</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> toga-like dress with one breast revealed, from view during speeches. The curtains were first used on a rental basis during the administration of Dick Thornburgh. Justice officials long insisted that the curtains were put up to improve the room's use as a television backdrop and that Ashcroft {{had nothing to do}} with it. Ashcroft's successor, Alberto Gonzales, removed the curtains in June 2005.|$|E
25|$|Wyler {{encouraged}} Davis to see Bankhead in {{the original}} play, which she did despite major misgivings. She later regretted doing so because after watching Bankhead's performance and reading Hellman's screenplay she felt compelled to create a totally different interpretation of the role, one she didn't feel suited the character. Bankhead had portrayed Regina as a victim forced to fight for her survival due to the contempt with which her brothers treated her, but Davis played her as a cold, conniving, calculating <b>woman</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> death mask of white powder she insisted makeup artist Perc Westmore create for her.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} Victorian decades, voluminous skirts held up with crinolines, and then hoop skirts, were {{the focal point}} of the silhouette. To enhance the style without distracting from it, hats were modest in size and design, straw and fabric bonnets being the popular choice. Poke bonnets, which had been worn during the late Regency period, had high, small crowns and brims that grew larger until the 1830s, when the face of a <b>woman</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> poke bonnet could only be seen {{directly}} from the front. They had rounded brims, echoing the rounded form of the bell-shaped hoop skirts.|$|E

25|$|The gulf-style or full niqab {{completely}} {{covers the}} face. It {{consists of an}} upper band that is tied around the forehead, together with a long wide piece of fabric which covers the face, leaving an opening for the eyes. Many full niqab have two or more sheer layers attached to the upper band, which can be worn flipped down to cover the eyes or left {{over the top of}} the head. While a person looking at a <b>woman</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> niqab with an eyeveil would not be able to see her eyes, the woman wearing the niqab would be able to see out through the thin fabric.|$|E
25|$|The Star of David is {{also used}} less {{prominently}} by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in the temples and in architecture. It symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. It may also symbolize the Tribes of Israel and friendship and their affinity towards the Jewish people. Additionally, it is sometimes used to symbolize the quorum of the twelve apostles, as in Revelation 12, wherein the Church of God is symbolized by a <b>woman</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> crown of twelve stars. It is also sometimes used to symbolize the Big Dipper, which points to the North Star, a symbol of Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the {{organization}} Aides Haute-Garonne organized La nuit de la Sainte-Capote (the {{night of the}} Holy Condom), an informative evening about the prevention of the human immunodeficiency virus. To announce the event, {{the organization}} handed out a prospectus. The prospectus contained a head-and-shoulders image of a <b>woman</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> nun's bonnet. Near that image was the image of two pink condoms. The prospectus's text asked {{for the protection of}} Sainte Capote. A Catholic organization initiated proceedings on the ground that the prospectus insulted a group because of its religion. The court of first instance convicted Aides Haute-Garonne. The first court of appeal, the Court of Toulouse, upheld the conviction. In February 2006, the Supreme Court of Appeal annulled the conviction.|$|E

25|$|On the {{edition of}} January 10 of TNA Impact! Anderson made her Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) debut as an unknown <b>woman</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> niqāb, later named Raisha Saeed and billed from Syria. She was in Awesome Kong's corner when Kong {{defeated}} Gail Kim {{to win the}} TNA Women's Knockout Championship. Her first pay-per-view appearance with the company was again in Kong's corner at Against All Odds, distracting Kong's opponent ODB to help her retain the Knockout Championship. The situation with Kim and ODB intensified, leading to Anderson's first match as a competitor with the promotion. At TNA's all-steel cage event Lockdown, she and Kong took on Kim and ODB in a tag team match, where Saeed was pinned by ODB. On the edition of July 3, 2008 of Impact!, Saeed lost a match against newcomer Taylor Wilde which saw Wilde become number one contender for the Knockout Championship despite outside interference from Kong.|$|E
25|$|During February and March 2017, {{several new}} Passion Pit songs were {{uploaded}} on YouTube on the account The Wishart Group (from {{the name of}} a project started by Michael Angelakos and dedicated to supporting musicians by providing them with legal, educational and healthcare services, with a focus on mental health, a topic on which Angelakos has been especially forthcoming), foreshadowing a fourth album for 2017. Because all the videos for those new songs have the same background photo (a <b>woman</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> white dress, located {{in the middle of the}} sea, turning around as though she had sensed she was being secretly observed from behind), it is suggested that said picture will be the front cover of the fourth album, tentatively titled Tremendous Sea of Love. The songs have since been taken down, but Angelakos announced that he will give a downloadable copy of the album for free to anyone who retweets neuroscientist Michael F. Wells' tweet on the importance of science and research. The profits from the album will be donated to a psychiatric research institution in Cambridge, Massachusetts.|$|E
