40|$|Comprehensively {{understanding}} {{water consumption}} behavior {{is necessary to}} design efficient and effective water use strategies. Despite global efforts to identify the factors that affect domestic water consumption, those related to domestic water use in rural regions have not been sufficiently studied, particularly in villages that have gained access to improved water supply. To address this gap, we investigated 247 households in eight villages in the Wei River Basin where three types of improved water supply systems are implemented. Results show that domestic water consumption in liters per capita per day was significantly correlated with water supply pattern and vegetable garden area, and significantly negatively correlated with family size and age of household head. Traditional hygiene habits, use of <b>water</b> <b>appliances,</b> and preference for vegetable gardening remain dominant behaviors in the villages with access to improved water supply.

40|$|<b>Water</b> {{efficient}} <b>appliances</b> {{are proven}} measures of reducing householders’ peak water demand on cities’ mains water supply network and consequently provide {{benefits to the}} water provider, in terms of augmentation deferrals and reduced sized infrastructure. However, while acknowledged in the literature, the actual benefits have not been thoroughly investigated and quantified. The paper aims to demonstrate how the installation of <b>water</b> efficient <b>appliances</b> would affect {{the design of the}} water supply network. Using an updated methodology incorporating end-use data from smart water meter, peak day water demand profiles were developed for the baseline scenario (Scenario A), representing the typical building code mandated for new dwellings constructed in the region of Queensland, Australia, and for households fitted with higher efficiency <b>water</b> <b>appliances</b> (Scenario B). Hydraulic model runs were conducted for both scenarios over various planning horizons to determine the scheduling of augmentations in a water supply study area in South East Queensland. The results of the model runs showed deferred and eliminated augmentations as well as a reduction in infrastructure sizing for Scenario B in comparison to Scenario A. The resulting monetary savings from installing higher efficiency <b>water</b> <b>appliances</b> in the study area represented 11. 4 % of total original augmentation costs, with the majority of savings due to deferred network augmentations. The paper concludes with the implications of reduced peak demands on the water infrastructure network and the potential for additional financial benefits to be realised by the water utility.

40|$|A {{model was}} {{developed}} to predict synthetic socioeconomic based domestic wastewater hydrographs for the small arid communities. The model predicts the flow hydrograph for random weekdays and weekends based on the specific socioeconomic characteristics of the community. The main socioeconomic characteristics are {{the composition of the}} community, the different user behaviours in using <b>water</b> <b>appliances,</b> and the unit discharges of such appliances. Use patterns of <b>water</b> <b>appliances</b> are assumed to vary for the various members of the community and the type of day. Each community is composed of several social categories such as the employee, working woman, stay home woman, stay home child, students etc. The use patterns account for the stochastic nature of use in terms of number of uses, duration of the use and times of use in the day. Randomly generated hydrographs are generated for weekdays and weekends along with synthetic hydrographs of non-exceedance. The model was verified for a small residential compound in Sharm El Shiekh - Egypt using 11 days of flow measurements performed in summer. The synthetic hydrographs based on assumed water use patterns of the various members of the community compared reasonably with the measured hydrographs. Synthetic hydrographs can be derived for a community under consideration to reflect its socioeconomic conditions and thus can be used to generate probability based peaking factors {{to be used in the}} design of sewerage systems pumping facilities, and treatment plants. © 201 WIT Press...|$|R

40|$|Bottom-up {{urban water}} demand {{forecasting}} based on empirical data for individual water end uses or micro-components (e. g., toilet, shower, etc.) for different households of varying characteristics is undoubtedly superior to top-down estimates originating from bulk water metres {{that are currently}} performed. Residential water end-use studies partially enabled by modern smart metering technologies such as those used in the South East Queensland Residential End Use Study (SEQREUS) provide the opportunity to align disaggregated water end-use demand for households with an extensive database covering household demographic, socio-economic and <b>water</b> <b>appliance</b> stock efficiency information. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) provide the ideal technique for aligning these databases to extract the key determinants for each water end-use category, with the view to building a residential water end-use demand forecasting model. Three conventional ANNs were used: two feed-forward back propagation networks and one radial basis function network. A sigmoid activation hidden layer and linear activation output layer produced the most accurate forecasting models. The end-use forecasting models had R 2 values of 0. 33, 0. 37, 0. 60, 0. 57, 0. 57, 0. 21 and 0. 41 for toilet, tap, shower, clothes washer, dishwasher, bath and total internal demand, respectively. All of the forecasting models except the bath demand were able to reproduce the means and medians of the frequency distributions of the training and validation sets. This study concludes with an application of the developed forecasting model for predicting the water savings derived from a citywide implementation of a residential <b>water</b> <b>appliance</b> retrofit program (i. e., retrofitting with efficient toilets, clothes washers and shower heads).

40|$|Urbanisation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} sources responsible for additional pressures (both qualitative and quantitative) on the environment. Typical quantitative pressures are the temporal changes of the hydrosystem's water flow pattern (due to alterations of the terrain) and the water abstractions (due to the water demand increase). Sustainable, water-aware technologies, like Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) and rainwater harvesting schemes, can be implemented to reduce these pressures. These technologies introduce interactions between the components of the urban water cycle. Rainwater harvesting for example, apart from the potable water demand reduction, has significant influence on the generated runoff. Consequently, integrated modelling of the urban water cycle is necessary for the simulation of the modern water technologies and the identification of their combined benefits. In this study, two hypothetical developments, referred hereafter as development H and development L, that implement rainwater harvesting scheme and SUDS are simulated using the Urban Water Optioneering Tool (UWOT). The characteristics of the developments H and L correspond to high and low urbanisation density. The study is organised into three stages. The first stage includes the calibration of UWOT's rainfall-runoff module. The second stage includes the identification of the optimum configurations of the developments that minimise the environmental pressures. The final stage includes a sensitivity analysis aiming to investigate the influence of the characteristics of the <b>water</b> <b>appliances</b> and technologies on the generated runoff. This study indicated that: (a) the localised measures are more efficient than the centralised technologies for mitigating the runoff peak; (b) the cost to minimise the pressures of new developments on the environment increases significantly with the urbanisation density both because of the increased population and the increased sensitivity of the runoff's maximum on the development characteristics; (c) if localised rainwater harvesting is implemented then the efficiency of the <b>water</b> <b>appliances</b> influences considerably the generated runoff...|$|R

40|$|Integrating {{alternative}} {{water supplies}} and <b>water</b> efficient <b>appliances</b> are proven strategies for reducing customers' average and peak demand on the cities mains water distribution infrastructure network. However, water utilities {{are yet to}} harness the potential of smart meters to build tailored daily diurnal demand patterns that reflect the consumption characteristics of individual developments that are increasingly applying alternative water sources and ultra-efficient appliances. This paper demonstrates how smart metering and water end-use data facilitates enhanced infrastructure planning of contemporary water supply schemes located in Queensland, Australia. To achieve research aims, extensive data received from high resolution smart meters fitted {{to a sample of}} 130 households was disaggregated into end use events (e. g. shower, dishwasher, etc.) and categorised into 48 thirty-minute time steps (i. e. daily diurnal demand) over the average day (AD) and peak day (PD). Moreover, these demand curves were also clustered according to <b>water</b> <b>appliance</b> stock efficiency ratings. Novel bottom-up end-use level models of demand were formulated representing scenarios of both single and multi-residential dwellings installed with combinations of <b>water</b> efficient <b>appliances</b> and rainwater tanks or greywater reuse. AD and PD diurnal demand patterns for these contemporary water scenarios were compared against the baseline scenario which represents the typical building code mandated dwelling constructed in the region of Queensland, Australia. Modelled demand curves for scenarios applying more efficient appliances in both dwelling types had lower peak demand than the baseline scenario by 13 % and 6 % for the AD and PD respectively, while scenarios also including rainwater tanks and greywater reuse (i. e. source substitution) resulted in peak reductions of 28 % on the AD and 51 % on the PD. The paper concludes with some implications for better handling the demand complexities of contemporary water supply schemes being developed by using smart meter data for the optimal planning of water infrastructure networks.

40|$|The rapid {{dissemination}} of residential water end-use (e. g. shower, clothes washer, etc.) consumption {{data to the}} customer via a web-enabled portal interface is becoming feasible through the advent of high resolution smart metering technologies. However, {{in order to achieve}} this paradigm shift in residential customer water use feedback, an automated approach for disaggregating complex water flow trace signatures into a registry of end-use event categories needs to be developed. This outcome is achieved by applying a hybrid combination of gradient vector filtering, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm (DTW) techniques on an existing residential water end-use database of 252 households located in South-east Queensland, Australia having high resolution water meters (0. 0139 L/pulse), remote data transfer loggers (5 s logging) and completed household <b>water</b> <b>appliance</b> audits. The approach enables both single independent events (e. g. shower event) and combined events (i. e. several overlapping single events) to be disaggregated from flow data into a comprehensive end-use event registry.

This paper presents the results of an investigation into the effect of these factors on the performance of a more realistic 'two tank' system with treatment using an object based household water cycle model. A Monte-Carlo simulation technique was adopted to generate domestic <b>water</b> <b>appliance</b> usage data which allows long-term prediction of the system's performance to be made. Model results reveal the constraints of treatment capacity, storage tank sizes and operating mode on percentage of potable water saved. A treatment capacity threshold has been discovered at which water saving efficiency is maximised for a given pair of grey and treated grey water tank. Results from the analysis suggest that the previous one-tank model significantly underestimates the tank volumes required for a given target water saving efficiency. © 2010 Desalination Publications.
