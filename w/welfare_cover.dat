40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{technological}} advancements {{in the field of}} proteomics have advanced our understanding of the complex biological systems of living organisms. Techniques based on mass spectrometry (MS) have emerged as powerful tools to contextualise existing genomic information and to create quantitative protein profiles from plasma, tissues or cell lines of various species. Proteomic approaches have been used increasingly in veterinary science to investigate biological processes responsible for growth, reproduction and pathological events. However, the adoption of proteomic approaches by veterinary investigators lags behind that of researchers in the human medical field. Furthermore, in contrast to human proteomics studies, interpretation of veterinary proteomic data is difficult due to the limited protein databases available for many animal species. This review article examines the current use of advanced proteomics techniques for evaluation of animal health and <b>welfare</b> and <b>covers</b> the current status of clinical veterinary proteomics research, including successful protein identification and data interpretation studies. It includes a description of an emerging tool, sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra (SWATH-MS), available on selected mass spectrometry instruments. This newly developed data acquisition technique combines advantages of discovery and targeted proteomics approaches, and thus has the potential to advance the veterinary proteomics field by enhancing identification and reproducibility of proteomics data...|$|R
40|$|In Spain, as a {{consequence}} of the persistence of the economic crisis, the deficit and debt of the public administrations have become a main issue on the current economic and political debates In the case of a highly decentralized scenario, such it is the Spanish one, even if we recognize the principal role of Central Government´s debt, a large part of the increased Autonomous Communities’ deficit and indebtedness is explained by the difficulties they have to face in financing services they have to cover. The paper describes the main characteristics of public accounts’ disequilibria in Spain and the regulatory limits established to make use of public debt. Also, the article offers different explanations of those disequilibria, putting the emphasis on those linked to the crisis: i. e. the increasing weight of basic <b>welfare</b> services <b>covered</b> by the Autonomous Communities (such as public health and as education); as the expansive policies implemented to fight the initial effects of the crisis; as the existence of previous and large “extraordinary” resources coming from the housing sector and its consequent collapse; as growth of the debt of the autonomous-community quangos and as the lack of effective accountability mechanisms addressed to control the expenditures of the autonomous communities...|$|R
30|$|When {{taking a}} look at China’s fiscal and social landscape, there is {{pressure}} to increase public expenditure to <b>cover</b> <b>welfare</b> benefits of an aging population. The population also demands higher investments in education, the health system, and labor protection. These expenditures cannot be financed merely through tax receipts. Thus, the supply of public bonds would need to rise to meet these demands (Aglietta 2007). In an attempt to boost demand for its bonds, China has also been allowing more foreign institutional investors to trade on its interbank market. The decision to eliminate quotas on interbank trading leads to opening up the bond market and the capital account, but much more will need to be done to truly develop China’s financial markets. Essential reforms require better ratings of bonds and better information management.|$|R

Other states like Mexico have taken specific provisions to include immigrants and non-migrant family members in existing social security schemes. With its universal health coverage scheme called Seguro Popular not only can immigrants prepare for their own access to Mexican public health upon return, they can start registering non-migrant relatives from abroad (Vargas-Bustamante et al., 2012).|$|R

In the presence of reference-dependent preferences, Learnfare provides uniquely powerful financial incentives for student performance. However, a 10 -county random-assignment evaluation suggested that Learnfare had no sustained effects on school enrollment and attendance. This study evaluates the data from this randomized field experiment. In Milwaukee County, the Learnfare procedures were poorly implemented and the random-assignment process failed to produce balanced baseline traits. However, in the nine remaining counties, Learnfare increased school enrollment by 3. 5 percent (effect sizeÂ =Â  0. 08) and attendance by 4. 5 percent (effect sizeÂ =Â  0. 10).

2500|$|Annabella did {{not have}} a close {{relationship}} with the young Ada and often left her in the care of her own mother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke who doted on her grandchild. However, because of societal attitudes of the time—which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation—Annabella had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about Ada's <b>welfare,</b> with a <b>cover</b> note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern. In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to Ada as [...] "it": [...] "I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own." [...] In her teenage years, several of her mother's close friends watched Ada for any sign of moral deviation.

40|$|Why do {{some people}} hold anti-immigration sentiments while others do not? Due to the {{political}} development of the last decade, this issue has gained a lot of interest. Previous {{research has shown that}} welfare state characteristics effects people’s perceived threat of immigration. The competition for scarce resources is, however, not the same for all population groups, as it is conditioned individual resources. By bridging two theoretical perspectives, this thesis explores how the effect of skill level and income on attitudes towards immigration vary depending on <b>welfare</b> state traits. <b>Covering</b> mainly 16 European countries, a quantitative approach is used to test these relationships between 2002 and 2010. The results suggest that unskilled native workers in generous welfare states are less inclined to welcome immigrants than unskilled workers in less generous welfare states. Income {{does not seem to have}} any significant interaction effects with welfare state variations. Several robustness checks were employed and another conclusion that can be drawn from the data is that all welfare programmes do not have an equal effect. ...|$|R
