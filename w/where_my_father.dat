500|$|In 1870, 88-year-old John Farley gave {{a second}} {{explanation}} of the name. His family had settled {{on the banks of}} White Deer Hole Creek in 1787, and John's father John built a mill on the creek by 1789. The creek was named because [...] "a white deer {{is said to have been}} killed at an early day in a low hole or pond of water that once existed <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> built his mill". The hole was [...] "a large circular basin of low ground of some tenacres [...] in extent....after my father's mill and dam were built the water of the dam overflowed and covered the most of the hollow basin of ground." [...] The mill was just west of the mouth at the unincorporated village of Allenwood (then called Uniontown), now in Gregg Township in Union County.|$|E

2500|$|... “It {{is located}} in a {{community}} <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was born and lived his life. [...] It is on the campus of a university. [...] As part of that university, it is dedicated to culture, and understanding response to beauty, and religious worship.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... [2] Long Island {{was settled}} {{first on the}} west end by the Dutch from Holland, then on the east end by the English--the {{dividing}} line of the two nationalities being a little west of Huntington <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> folks lived, and where I was born.|$|R
6000|$|... {4} [...] "I {{remember}} I {{went into}} the room <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> body lay, and my mother sat weeping alone by it. I had my battledore in my hand, and fell a-beating the coffin and calling 'Papa,' for I know not how, I had some slight {{idea that he was}} locked up there."--STEELE, The Tatler, June 6, 1710.|$|R
2500|$|... "My {{father was}} an ethnic Slovak, and I am Slovak, and my mother is Russian, {{she was born in}} small town of Kulotino under the former Leningrad. The mother, unfortunately, died quite young. I spent my {{childhood}} in Prague and Africa, <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> worked as a diplomat... my father and mother graduated from MGIMO. By the way, their marriage {{was one of the first}} mixed marriages in the Soviet Union (in 1956, immediately after the XX Congress of the CPSU)." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was easy}} to be brave <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was concerned, and George, but you're the man I love, and it's so different. I don't know any more how to stand alone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{was easy}} to be brave <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was concerned, or George, but now it's so different. Love has changed me. I haven't the courage any more to {{withstand}} the opinion of all my fellows.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, I hope, Colonel, a plain man may go {{to heaven}} without {{thinking}} about them at all; besides, inter nos, I am {{a member of the}} suffering and Episcopal Church of Scotland--the shadow of a shade now, and fortunately so; but I love to pray <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>fathers</b> prayed before me, without thinking worse of the Presbyterian forms because they do not affect me with the same associations.' And with this remark they parted until dinner-time.|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} Kea {{returned}} again. She had an envelope with a name and address on it in her hand. She {{gave it to me}} simply. Her eyes were still red with crying. [...] "That's <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> people live," [...] she said quietly. [...] "I wish I was with them. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> wanted me to return to them when he died. But I was afraid to go, because--because, though they asked me after his death, they never wrote to me while he was alive--they never wrote to him either--They were angry with him for marrying my mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indifferent, sir," [...] said Richie Moniplies, {{looking down}} on his garments--"very indifferent; {{but it is the}} wonted livery of poor burghers' sons in our country--one of Luckie Want's bestowing upon us --rest us patient! The king's leaving Scotland has taken all custom frae Edinburgh; and there is hay made at the Cross, and a dainty crop of fouats in the Grass-market. There is as much grass grows <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> stall stood, as might have been a good bite for the beasts he was used to kill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, I do not,' {{answered}} the old man. 'But {{if you go}} straight along this road for a year, you will reach a hut <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> lives, and possibly he {{may be able to}} tell you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no right}} to express an opinion as to <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> should or should not go; but if you ask me, I think that, under all the circumstances, you would do best to keep away." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lucille bade them follow her, and I {{heard her}} giving orders {{to one of}} the hired men. Then she {{returned}} alone in haste to me. [...] "You saw <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> put the book Miss Redmond gave him?" [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{swear to}} you, then," [...] said MacIan, after a pause. [...] "I {{swear to you}} that nothing shall come between us. I swear to you that nothing shall be in my heart or in my head till our swords clash together. I swear it by the God you have denied, by the Blessed Lady you have blasphemed; I swear it by the seven swords in her heart. I swear it by the Holy Island <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>fathers</b> are, by the honour of my mother, by the secret of my people, and by the chalice of the Blood of God." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{somebody}} {{please tell}} me <b>where</b> to find <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> Gaston Isbel?" [...] inquired Jean, with as civil a tongue as he could command.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Quatermain," [...] she said, [...] "I {{suppose that}} I {{must have been}} ill, for the last thing I {{remember}} is going {{to sleep on the}} night after you started for the hippopotamus hunt. <b>Where</b> is <b>my</b> <b>father?</b> Did any harm come to him while he was hunting?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I am {{sure you}} would not. You have too much pity for me. Mary, look {{across the room to}} where we were just now--to <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> is--my father, so {{compassionate}} and loving to me--and tell me what you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{stopped a}} moment, {{and then looked}} at him reflectively. [...] "Why don't you go North and try your fortune at prospecting, too? They have been finding {{a good deal of}} gold lately in the Green River country <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] {{said the}} man, quite unmoved by this last explosion; [...] "my name is Salvation Yeo, born in Clovelly Street, {{in the year}} 1526, <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{exercised}} the mystery of a barber surgeon, and a preacher of the people since called Anabaptists, for which I return humble thanks to God." ...|$|E
60|$|So it was settled, and the {{grasshopper}} went forth {{into the}} fields and toiled as hard as any slave. I plowed, threshed, and husked corn, and when at last December came, I had acquired money enough to carry me on my way. I decided to visit Onalaska and the old coulee <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> sister {{and two of the}} McClintocks were still living. With swift return of confidence, I said good-bye to my friends in Zumbrota and took the train. It seemed very wonderful that after a space of thirteen years I should be returning to the scenes of my childhood, a full-grown man and paying my own way. I expanded with joy of the prospect.|$|R
60|$|Then {{and there}} I set off running over the moor, until I {{burst into the}} kitchen <b>where</b> <b>my</b> mother and <b>father</b> were sitting {{on either side of}} the ingle.|$|R
5000|$|In the dungeon, Zainab {{tried to}} console Sayyedah Sakinah {{and said that}} she would soon meet her father. One night, when Sakinah was asleep, she woke up crying and started to look for her father everywhere. All the women tried to console her so that she would stop crying, but she continued: [...] "O <b>my</b> dear aunt, <b>Where</b> is <b>my</b> <b>father?</b> A few minutes ago I was with <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> and he kissed me and said that [...] "My dear Sakinah you will soon be with me." [...] But <b>where</b> is <b>my</b> <b>father</b> now?" [...] At this, all the women started to cry, and the crying was heard by Yazid at his court. Yazid sent the severed head of Al-Husain to the prison, and when Sakinah {{received}} the head of her father, she started to cry even more and held it very tight and asked her father: [...] "Who cut off <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> head, who martyred <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> why are we held as captives?" [...] With these words of sorrow, Sakina was quiet. Everyone thought that Sakinah had finally gone to sleep again, but she had died, at the age of four or five.|$|R
6000|$|... "Riddough's Hotel?" [...] said he, [...] "upon my word, I think I {{have heard}} of such a place; let me see--yes, yes--that was the hotel <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> broke his arm, helping to pull down the walls. My lad, you surely can't be inquiring for Riddough's Hotel! What do you want to find there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} good old Fernan {{established}} a missionary station here, building a church, {{and getting the}} ground consecrated <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> lies. I can just see {{the top of the}} cross, and there he promises that I shall lie. You will be able to put my name in the cloister under my father's, as no impostor.|$|E
6000|$|I did {{not wait}} to hear what she said. I brushed past her, down the stairs. My heart was bursting--my flesh felt cold. I ran breathlessly and {{recklessly}} into the room <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and mother had received me. They were both sitting there still. I ran up to them, wringing my hands, and crying out in a passion of tears: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly, madame! He {{had ever}} loved Lord Edmund. He strove to stay Lord Clifford's hand, and threw himself between, but Clifford dashed him aside, and he bears still the scar where he fell against the parapet of the bridge. Harry Featherstone told me, when he fled from the piteous field, <b>where</b> died <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and brother Robin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All,--every mite," [...] {{said the}} old grave-digger. [...] "But <b>my</b> <b>father</b> knew, {{and would have been}} glad to tell you the whole story. There {{was a great deal of}} wisdom and knowledge, about graves especially, buried out yonder <b>where</b> <b>my</b> old <b>father</b> was put away, before the Stamp Act was thought of. But it is no great matter, I suppose. People don't care about old graves in these times. They just live, and put the dead out of sight and out of mind." ...|$|R
5000|$|We, Negro Americans, {{sing with}} all loyal Americans: [...] "My country 'tis of thee,/Sweet land of liberty,/Of thee I sing./Land <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>fathers</b> died,/ Land of the Pilgrims' pride,/From every {{mountain}}side,/Let freedom ring!" [...] That's {{exactly what we}} mean—from every mountain side, let freedom ring. Not only from the Green Mountains and White Mountains of Vermont and New Hampshire; {{not only from the}} Catskills of New York; but from the Ozarks in Arkansas, from the Stone Mountain in Georgia, from the great Smoky of Tennessee, and from the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia—not only let it ring for the minorities of the United States, but for the persecuted of Europe, for the rejected of Asia, for the disfranchised of South Africa and for the disinherited of all the earth—may the Republican Party, under God, from every mountainside, [...] "LET FREEDOM RING." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{ever since}} I have been trading--first, on the Kennebec with the Abenaquis, {{in the great}} forests of Maine, and with the Micmac fish-eaters over the Penobscot. Then later with the Iroquois, as far west as the country of the Senecas. At Albany and Schenectady we stored our pelts, and so on to New York, <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> shipped them over the sea." ...|$|E
60|$|If Hiram Griffin {{had been}} {{standing}} near the door listening to our conversation {{he could not have}} entered the room at a better moment, for the doctor had but just spoken those words which were the same as token of my dismissal, when he came in, and I asked if he could tell me <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> might be found.|$|E
6000|$|... "The traitor host met his deserts, and {{was broken}} {{on the wheel}} for murdering a pedlar a year ago," [...] said Ebbo. [...] "I would I knew <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was buried, for then would I bring his corpse honourably back; but as to his being a living man, I will not have it spoken of to trouble my mother." ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 1241 he had granted it to {{the abbey}} of Monk Sherborne on {{condition}} that they celebrated daily mass [...] "in our church of Sherborne <b>where</b> <b>my</b> mother and <b>father</b> will lie after their deaths and I along with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “He was. He {{had left}} me, {{after several years}} of fruit less {{application}} and comparative poverty, in Nova Scotia, to obtain the compensation for his losses which the British commissioners had at length awarded. After spending a year in England, he was returning to Halifax, {{on his way to a}} government to which he had been appointed, in the West Indies, intending to go to the place <b>where</b> <b>my</b> grand <b>father</b> had sojourned during and since the war, and take him with us.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is no need}} to," [...] replied Elsa in {{the same}} quiet voice, [...] "because {{there is no other}} man. I have never yet thought of marriage, I have no wish that way, and if I had, I should forget it now when from hour to hour I do not know <b>where</b> <b>my</b> dear <b>father</b> may be, or what fate awaits him. He is my only lover, Heer Adrian," [...] and as Elsa spoke her soft brown eyes filled with tears.|$|R
