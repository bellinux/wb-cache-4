5|$|We {{always start}} out with a musical idea. Great effort goes into {{creating}} a solid melodic core. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> play the keyboards and program, but in general Mikkel plays the instruments and controls Pro Tools, while Tor has the executive overlook as well as lyrical input. However, <b>we</b> <b>both</b> are hands on and have no rules or limitations. When we have some killer beats and musical starting points, we hook up with one of our favorite topline writers, who gets cracking on the lyrics and melody. We make sure there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit before we feel we've got a killer hook.|$|E

We {{have a deep}} {{interest}} {{and a sense of}} responsibility for {{what goes on in the}} wider world. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> share a commitment to global trade and have both traditionally promoted strong trans-Atlantic links. Furthermore, as former colonial powers, <b>we</b> <b>both</b> have important international interests.|$|E

We share {{the same type of}} {{religion}} and boyhood background; we got our start as schoolteachers and figured prominently in public education; <b>we</b> <b>both</b> served in public life at or near the top. And I like to feel that we share a common appreciation and respect for people, all people. One of the greatest rewards in politics is meeting people. And one of the greatest and most unusual men I've ever met is Bill Dodd.|$|E
25|$|Our apprehensions {{are raised}} by very {{different}} objects. You seem to dread {{the prevalence of}} Paine's opinions (which in most parts I detest {{as much as you}} do) while I am much more afraid of the total annihilation of all principles of liberty and resistance, an event which I am sure you would be as sorry to see as I. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> hate the two extremes equally, but we differ in opinions with respect to the quarter from which the danger is most pressing.|$|E

And you know, just the way I would sing it versus in the way Toni Braxton would sing it. And I love the way it came out, and I think probably the rest of the band really does not like it, and that’s probably why it didn’t make our fifth record, in 2005 when we were recording it." ...|$|E

Following Williams's departure, the group disbanded until 2005 when Take That announced their reunion. After 13 years, in 2008, during the band's work on their fifth studio album, The Circus, Barlow and Williams {{met for the first time}} since the latter left the band. In 2010, in an interview on BBC Radio 1, Williams elaborated, [...] "'It is one of those situations in life that could be very explosive and could go completely wrong. We had that big chat and the most amazing thing happened at the end of it. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> said sorry to each other and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> meant it and that was all we needed."

500|$|O'Hara always denied {{having any}} extramarital affairs, {{but in his}} autobiography, {{frequent}} collaborator Anthony Quinn claimed to have {{fallen in love with}} her on the set of Sinbad the Sailor.

Quinn implied that they had been involved in an affair, adding that [...] "after a while <b>we</b> <b>both</b> tired of the deceit".|$|E
500|$|She and I {{sat down}} and wrote this song about some serious insecurities that we had {{when we first started}} down this road with each other, and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> had trust issues.

According to Lindsay: [...] "When the song ended <b>we</b> <b>both</b> just looked at each other. I said, Now what the fuck are we gonna do?' With that single, the Beatles raised the ante as to what a pop record should be."

Then we saw {{a great deal of}} each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other.

[...] Along with Westfeldt, Hamm has appeared in Gap-related campaign advertisements. During April 2009, Hamm and Westfeldt formed their own production company, Points West Pictures. Hamm and Westfeldt are advocates of animal rescue and have adopted a mixed breed dog named Cora from the Much Love Animal Shelter in California.|$|E

It was the only copy. It was such a shame as Phil was vibed up about the new Lizzy." ...|$|E

Coincidentally, Bacsik's father had faced Aaron (as a pitcher for the Texas Rangers) after Aaron had hit his 755th home run. On August 23, 1976, Michael J. Bacsik held Aaron {{to a single}} and a fly out to right field. The younger Bacsik commented later, [...] "If my dad had been gracious enough to let Hank Aaron hit a home run, <b>we</b> <b>both</b> would have given up 756."
