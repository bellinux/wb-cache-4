The wool from one Merino sheep will produce about 250-300ml of recoverable <b>wool</b> <b>grease.</b> Lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special wool scouring detergent to remove dirt, <b>wool</b> <b>grease</b> (crude lanolin), suint (sweat salts), and anything else stuck to the <b>wool.</b> The <b>wool</b> <b>grease</b> is continuously removed during this washing process by centrifuge separators, which concentrate it into a wax-like substance melting at approximately 38°C (100°F).|$|R

Methane production and {{volatile fatty acids}} consumption were negligible. Most of the grease {{was thought to be}} removed by flocculation as a result of anaerobic activity. Since the supernatant of the treated effluent still contained residual grease of over 1 500 mg/L, further purification is necessary.

40|$|Wool yolk {{is highly}} fluorescent. The amount of wool yolk and {{intensity}} of wool yolk fluorescence varies along a Merino wool fibre. The fluorescence intensity of the yolk increases on travelling from tip to the root. Two components-'grease' and chlorophyll-contribute to the fluorescence of <b>wool</b> <b>grease.</b> The 'grease' fluorescence reveals {{the presence of a}} number of chromophores/components. An attempt to separate the chemical constituents and identify them was only partly successful as each of nine fractions obtained by preparatory thin-layer chromatography exhibited similar fluorescence properties. There are two types of chlorophyll present-chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. Chlorophyll could be detected in all the <b>wool</b> <b>greases</b> examined. Artificial UV irradiation gave rise to a number of complex photochemical reactions including the destruction of chlorophyll. After an initial decrease in fluorescence intensity (for unknown reasons), there is a change of non-fluorescing visible-absorbing species to fluorescing UV-absorbing species before a final change in the latter to the former. The relative size of the changes was different for two different <b>wool</b> <b>greases</b> examined. In-situ studies using blue light as the irradiation source suggest that it also causes a (slower) decrease in fluorescence intensity, but proportionally faster for the 'grease' component than for the chlorophyll component...|$|R

The short-term treatment (1 - 7 days) of this effluent with anaerobic bacteria resulted in partial grease nocculation. However the efficiency of this process varied largely (30 % to 80 %) with the source of wool Scouring effluent used. The concentration of free surfactant, rather than total surfactant, {{was found to be}} the likely reason for the variation in efficiency. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of anaerobic biological flocculation a detailed surfactant analysis was performed.

As the pressure to devise a more environmentally acceptable treatment method increases {{there is a need}} to study alternative, efficient biological treatment systems for WSE. In this study, laboratory and pilot-scale anaerobic biological and chemical flocculation treatment processes were investigated for removing the pollutants (mainly <b>wool</b> <b>grease)</b> from WSE. Anaerobic biological treatment utilises the natural microbial flora to destabilise and bioflocculate the WSE resulting in the settling of <b>wool</b> <b>grease</b> from the bulk liquid. Batch trials showed a grease reduction by anaerobic bioflocculation of between 30 % (pilot scale) and 50 % (laboratory scale) over 8 days. However, the destabilisation of the <b>wool</b> <b>grease</b> emulsion after only 2 - 3 days resulted in a total grease reduction of > 80 % after addition of a polymeric flocculant. A laboratory anaerobic bioflocculation-chemical flocculation process gave promising results by removing > 90 % grease at hydraulic retention times of 1 - 2 days. In the pilot-scale the same process resulted in up to 80 % grease removal efficiency. The results of this study indicate that anaerobic biological and chemical treatment of WSE is a promising alternative treatment system compared to other chemical or natural (lagooning) treatment systems. Our approach suggests adding a flocculant to aid the separation of biologically coagulated grease from the bulk liquid. A final low-level aerobic polishing step will be necessary to meet effluent disposal guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Existing ways of {{extraction}} of <b>wool</b> <b>grease</b> have {{the high cost}} price and are not harmless. For increase of efficiency of {{extraction of}} <b>wool</b> <b>grease</b> in work application high-discrete processing (HDP) wool-washing water is offered. Materials and methods. Determination of conductivity, RedOx-potential, temperature, pH and {{the total number of}} lipid-water ions was carried out using a combined tester Combo HI 98129 («HANNA Instruments»). Concentration of free radicals was determined by titration method. Viscosity change of washwater under the influence of HDP was investigated by the method of measurement by an Ostwald. Influence of duration of the HDP to change the surface tension of the wash water was measured by counting drops. Resultsand discussion. As a result of HDP, there is a change of physical and chemical properties of the wash water, namely: reduction of conductivity wool-washing water (from 2969 µS/cm to 2837 µS/cm) and the total ion content (1487 mg/l to 1298 mg/l), increased pH environment (8. 35 to 9. 40), temperature (from 18 °C to 43 °C) and RedOx-capacity (from 60 mV to 93 mV). This is because HDP helps create areas of high concentration of mechanical energy, which leads to a high impact strength and high pressure. Temperature rise in turn affects the hydrogen bonds, with the collapse cluster complexes of water and hydration shells around ions with the formation of free radicals, which means, that the presence of chemical reactions in the water. Reduced viscosity (with 1, 034 · 10 - 3 Ns/m 2 to 0, 903 · 10 - 3 Ns/m 2) and surfacetension (from 39. 86 cN/m to 37. 56 cN/m) of wash water {{under the influence of the}} HDP is due to breaking of hydrogen bonds of water associates and the weakening of the forces of attraction between the molecules within the clusters and in the surface layer – structural changes of water. The most important chemical and structural changes occur in the washings at 180 with the processing time. Conclusions.

50|$|Lanolin (from Latin lāna, ‘wool’, and oleum, ‘oil’), {{also called}} wool wax or <b>wool</b> <b>grease,</b> is a wax {{secreted}} by the sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Lanolin used by humans comes from domestic sheep breeds that are raised specifically for their wool. Historically, many pharmacopoeias {{have referred to}} lanolin as wool fat (adeps lanae); however, as lanolin lacks glycerides (glycerol esters), {{it is not a}} true fat. Lanolin primarily consists of sterol esters instead. Lanolin's waterproofing property aids sheep in shedding water from their coats. Certain breeds of sheep produce large amounts of lanolin. There is an inverse correlation between fiber diameter and wool wax content.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the final {{products from the}} current effluent treatment system for woolscouring (wool washing) plants, namely, (i) sludge produced from the chemical flocculation of solids in the wastewater from the wash bowls, and (ii) concentrated suint (sheep sweat) produced from evaporation of the liquid phase separated from the sludge. In addition, fibrous wastes from the woolscouring process were studied. The aims {{of the study were}} to (i) investigate whether suint could be applied in a sustainable way to arable land as a potassium fertiliser, and (ii) assess the conditions under which the sludge could be composted for use as a soil conditioner to return organic matter to soil. Experiments involving suint were performed at both laboratory and glasshouse scales, while experiments involving the solid woolscour wastes were based both in the laboratory and using a small-scale (4. 5 m 3 total capacity) in-vessel composting unit established at a New Zealand woolscour. Decomposition was measured using net-nitrogen mineralisation and weight loss methods. Suint, the water-soluble contaminants on the fleece, contained high levels of potassium (20 % on a dry weight basis) and also appreciable quantities of sulphur, sodium, and chlorine. Biological treatment before evaporation stabilised the resulting suint and improved the consistency of its composition. Suint did not affect the soil processes examined, in that it partly decomposed in soil, did not inhibit the turnover of model organic compounds, did not affect soil properties such as pH and electrical conductivity, and did not lead to increased leaching of mineral nitrogen. Suint was either neutral or positive towards plant performance when applied to soil at a rate of 100 kg potassium per hectare. Suint was therefore judged to be suitable for application to land and could be targeted to soils known to be deficient in potassium or to areas where crops with a high potassium demand are grown. Sludge, composed of dirt (soil particles, faecal matter, and skin and fibre debris) and <b>wool</b> <b>grease,</b> was highly variable in terms of its rate of decomposition, ranging from 0. 8 to 27. 8 % of the initial total nitrogen mineralised over 30 days at 37 ℃. Fibrous wastes, such as opener (fibre and contaminants removed from the wool by agitation prior to scouring) and scoured wool cleaner (wool fibre and dust removed from scoured and dried wool) wastes, also showed variability in decomposition rates. Sludge decomposition was improved by as much as threefold when co-incubated with fibrous wastes. Although it was shown that the polyacrylamide and pesticide content of sludge did not inhibit its decomposition, the effect of the grease content was not fully understood. Chemical properties of woolscour sludge, such as the carbon to nitrogen ratio, suggested that sludge was a substrate of good resource quality. From a biological perspective, however, the data suggested that woolscour sludge was limited in available nutrients; sludge nitrogen was derived principally from keratin, which decomposed at a low rate resulting in the slow release of mineral nitrogen and low levels of microbial activity. Thus, sludge appeared a poor substrate for composting. However, the results from composting trials indicated that the sludge could be successfully processed after blending with a bulking agent such as sawdust. The blended material showed a 90 % reduction in <b>wool</b> <b>grease</b> over 21 days of composting when the moisture content of the composting mass was kept optimal. Compost temperature exceeded 55 ℃ when wool fibre was added to the blend. Initial results from a case study involving the commercial composting of the entire sludge production (16 tonnes per day) from a New Zealand woolscour indicated that a saleable compost could be produced from a material that would otherwise go to landfill, and served to illustrate the commercial significance of these research results...|$|R
