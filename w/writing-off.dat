6000|$|... "It was his {{greatest}} effort, and his last. Without even {{waiting to be}} paid, the illustrious craftsman departed this life, and was buried under an ornate tombstone, whose winged cherubs would have afforded singularly little scope for the exercise of his favourite art. There remained, however, the widow Pincini, to whom the six hundred francs were due. And thereupon arose the great crisis {{in the life of}} Henri Deplis, traveller of commerce. The legacy, under the stress of numerous little calls on its substance, had dwindled to very insignificant proportions, and when a pressing wine bill and sundry other current accounts had been paid, there remained little more than 430 francs to offer to the widow. The lady was properly indignant, not wholly, as she volubly explained, on account of the suggested <b>writing-off</b> of 170 francs, but also at the attempt to depreciate the value of her late husband's acknowledged masterpiece. In a week's time Deplis was obliged to reduce his offer to 405 francs, which circumstance fanned the widow's indignation into a fury. She cancelled the sale of the work of art, and a few days later Deplis learned with a sense of consternation that she had presented it to the municipality of Bergamo, which had gratefully accepted it. He left the neighbourhood as unobtrusively as possible, and was genuinely relieved when his business commands took him to Rome, where he hoped his identity and that of the famous picture might be lost sight of.|$|E

His refusal to comply with the court order to pay the fine could result in a jail sentence and probably disbarment. Michalis Paraskevas civil disobedience was also connected to the refusal of the Minister of Finance to comply with the Social Insurance Fund 2010 Law, which obliged the Minister to repay some of the debt back to the Social Insurance account so as to create real assets, and to appoint an independent committee for auditing purposes. The initiative concerning the Social Insurance Fund resulted {{in the creation of a}} team of activists. Called ‘Initiative for Social Control of Social Insurance Fund’, which demanded the return of money from the state to the Social Insurance Fund, and reformation of the way the Fund is controlled so as to allow for some direct control by the citizens.|$|E

Just over two weeks later, Tottenham came to an agreement for the transfer of Wilson Palacios for a fee of £12 million from Wigan Athletic; the deal for Palacios was officially concluded on 30 January {{with the approval of}} a work permit. Tottenham also signed experienced goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini from Chelsea on a free transfer and also concluded a deal to re-sign Pascal Chimbonda from Sunderland for a fee thought to be around £3 million.

Performance of the industry  has been analyzed {{on the basis}} of an availability factor of own circulating facilities that characterizes availability of own circulating facilities at an organization which are necessary for its financial stability. So the above-mentioned factor as of 01. 01. 2007 and 01. 01. 2008 has been equal to 0. 04 and 0. 05, respectively, however it is significantly lower in comparison with a normative value (0. 3). It means that we have unsatisfactory value of the availability factor of own circulating facilities.  The paper reveals main problems and difficulties concerning extinguishing consumers’ debt for gas which is formed as of 01. 12. 1996. In order to improve financial situation of power-supplying organizations it is expedient to consider writing-off  of the gas debt  with simultaneous <b>writing-off</b> of Republic consumers’ debt for electric power which is unreal for claiming.  </p...|$|E

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 129 mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&As) in the US between publicly traded acquirers and targets {{in research and development}} (R&D) intensive industries over the period of 1994 - 2004 and a size- and industry-matched sample, we examine the relation among targets' R&D activities, the probability of acquirers' <b>writing-off</b> in-process R&D (IPRD), and acquirers' returns around the time of M&A announcements. We find that firms acquiring targets with higher R&D investments tend to write off some of the acquired R&D assets upon the completion of the M&As. We also find that the median cumulative abnormal return during the three days around M&A announcements for acquirers with subsequent IPRD write-offs is - 2. 73 % while the return for acquirers without IPRD write-offs is - 0. 60 %. This suggests that acquirers' stock returns around M&A announcements are much lower when investors expect acquirers to expense IPRD. The results are consistent with our conjecture that acquirers tend to write-off IPRD when they acquire overvalued targets. We also find that IPRD write-offs do not increase earnings or stock returns of acquirers after M&As, which is inconsistent with an earnings management hypothesis.

40|$|The authors conduct {{studies of}} {{economic}} prerequisites and factors, {{which resulted in}} <b>writing-off</b> significant amounts of goodwill value in Ukrainian banking institutions, which are structural parts of international financial institutions. In the result of analysis of main prerequisites the article identifies external and internal reasons of acknowledgement of devaluation of goodwill in the domestic banking sector. In accordance {{with the results of}} the study, the article identifies that acknowledgement of devaluation of goodwill testifies to a negative mood of foreign investors with respect to prospects of business development in the domestic banking market. The article justifies expediency of, separate from goodwill, identification of intangible assets, subject to acknowledgement in the result of unification of banks, in particular the client base of a bank, as an intangible asset with a final date of useful use. It proves that acknowledgement of this asset in the result of unification would allow avoiding significant amounts of write-off of goodwill value under unfavourable economic conditions. The prospect of further studies in this direction is justification of an optimal method of identification of the amount of goodwill devaluation, which would allow avoiding manipulations with financial reporting and would improve quality of presented information about the real financial state of banking institutions...|$|E
