25|$|The {{historians who}} relay such stories, principally Tacitus and Suetonius, wrote some 70 {{years after the}} events in an {{environment}} hostile to the imperial line to which Messalina had belonged. Suetonius' history is largely scandal-mongering. Tacitus claims to be transmitting 'what was heard and written by my elders' without naming sources other than the memoirs of Agrippina the Younger, who had arranged to displace Messalina's children in the imperial succession and was therefore particularly interested in blackening her predecessor's name. It {{has been argued that}} <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> <b>for</b> history is largely a result of the political sanctions that followed her death.|$|E
25|$|Also {{writing in}} 1971, Hugh M. Richmond offered {{an entirely new}} view of the play's love story lines. He argued that <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> <b>for</b> love in this play is {{actually}} a self-destructive expression of passion. He argued that the play's significant characters are all affected by passion and by a sadomasochistic type of sexuality. This passion prevents the lovers from genuinely communicating with each other. At {{the same time it}} protects them from the disenchantment with the love interest that communication inevitably brings. The exception to the rule is Bottom, who is chiefly devoted to himself. His own egotism protects him from feeling passion for anyone else. Richmond also noted that there are parallels between the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe, featured in this play, and that of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
500|$|Music critic Chet Flippo {{wrote in}} a Texas Monthly article {{entitled}} [...] "Mathew, Mark, Luke and Willie: Willie Nelson's latest album {{is more than a}} good country music; it's almost Gospel": [...] "The difference between Nelson's Red Headed Stranger and any current C album, and especially <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> <b>for</b> a soundtrack for Nashville, is astounding. What Nelson has done is simply unclassifiable; it is the only record I have heard that strikes me as otherworldly. Red Headed Stranger conjures up such strange emotions and works on so many levels that listening to it becomes totally obsessing".|$|E

500|$|Larkin's {{public persona}} {{was that of}} the no-nonsense, solitary Englishman who disliked fame and had no {{patience}} for the trappings of the public literary life. The posthumous publication by Anthony Thwaite in 1992 of his letters triggered controversy about his personal life and political views, described by John Banville as hair-raising, but also in places hilarious. Lisa Jardine called him a [...] "casual, habitual racist, and an easy misogynist", but the academic John Osborne argued in 2008 that [...] "the worst that anyone has discovered about Larkin are some crass letters and a taste for porn softer than <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> <b>for</b> mainstream entertainment". Despite the controversy Larkin was chosen in a 2003 Poetry Book Society survey, almost two decades after his death, as Britain's best-loved poet of the previous 50 years, and in 2008 The Times named him Britain's greatest post-war writer.|$|E
500|$|Modi {{said that}} the media had exaggerated while {{covering}} the extent of violence and criticised the media for [...] "provoking the violence by naming the religion of victims". Newspapers, particularly Sandesh, were reported by various organisations to have published [...] "inflammatory headlines, stories and pictures". A headline in Sandesh on 28 February 2002 read, [...] "Avenge Blood With Blood". After the massacre, when Muslims had returned from Hajj, Sandesh had published the headline, [...] "Hindus Beware: Hajj pilgrims return with deadly conspiracy", which caused terror among the returning Muslim community, and they were escorted by Army officials to their homes and were given protection to avoid attacks. A report by the People's Union for Civil Liberties stated, [...] "Major effect of media under long period has been to feed on the prevalent anti-Muslim prejudices of its Hindu readership and provoke it further by sensationalizing, twisting, mangling and distorting news or <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> <b>for</b> it." ...|$|E

Marsland Gander of The Daily Telegraph, who commented, [...] "It {{is a show}} {{that has to be}} seen to be disbelieved." [...] Writing for the same newspaper in 2011, Simon Heffer remembered his enthusiastic impressions of watching [...] "Trapped in the Sky" [...] as a boy in 1965, and how it endeared him {{to the rest of the}} series: [...] "... I had just watched the first episode of Thunderbirds. I felt as though the whole landscape of <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> <b>for</b> my imagination had been changed... It caused an excitement of the sort that is possible only for the very young, and it lasted for days. Indeed, every Saturday night was a renewal of the miracle." [...] Co-creator Sylvia Anderson observes that, by necessity, the pilot episode comprises many examples of exposition for the purposes of introducing the primary characters and vehicles. However, she considers the roles of Lady Penelope and Parker to be [...] "brief but effective".|$|E

60|$|It is {{probable}} that much of <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> <b>for</b> hallucination proper belongs in reality to the hybrid case, being an illusive interpretation of some induced visual cloud or blur.

6000|$|The {{second point}} of view, and {{by far the}} largest--as the world in working-day dress vastly exceeds the world in parlor toilette--is the one of common life, from the oldest times down, and {{especially}} in England, (see the earlier chapters of [...] "Taine's English Literature," [...] and see Shakspere almost anywhere,) and which our age to-day inherits from riant stock, in the wit, or <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> <b>for</b> wit, of masculine circles, and in erotic stories and talk, to excite, express, and dwell on, that merely sensual voluptuousness which, according to Victor Hugo, is the most universal trait of all ages, all lands.

60|$|That gloomy month, however, had {{not been}} thrown away. All the men were {{disposed}} to be serious; and {{the reading of the}} bible, openly and aloud, soon became a favourite occupation with every one of them. Although Roswell's reading was directed by the marks of Mary, all of which had reference to those passages that touched on the Divinity of the Saviour, he made no comments that betrayed his incredulity. There is a simple earnestness in the narrative portions of the Gospel that commends its truth to every mind, and it had its effect on that of Roswell Gardiner; though it failed to remove doubts that had so long been cherished, and which had their existence in pride of reason, or <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> <b>for</b> such, with those who merely skim the surface of things, as they seem to exist around them.|$|E
6000|$|The {{results of}} the {{inquiries}} I have made into certain alleged forms of our relations with the unseen world do not, so far as they go, confirm the common doctrines. One, for example, on the objective efficacy of prayer[20] was decidedly negative. It showed that while contradicting the commonly expressed doctrine, it concurred with the almost universal practical opinion of the present day. Another inquiry into visions showed that, however ill explained they may still be, they belong for the most part, if not altogether, to an order of phenomena which no one dreams in other cases of calling supernatural. Many investigations concur in showing the vast multiplicity of mental operations that are in simultaneous action, of which only a minute part falls within the ken of consciousness, and suggest that much of <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> <b>for</b> supernatural is due to one portion of our mind being contemplated by another portion of it, {{as if it had}} been that of another person.
