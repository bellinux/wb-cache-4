500|$|In {{a conference}} call on April 17, 2001, then-Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Skilling {{verbally}} attacked Wall Street analyst Richard Grubman, who questioned Enron's unusual accounting practice during a recorded conference call. When Grubman complained that Enron was the only company that could not release a balance sheet along with its earnings statements, Skilling replied [...] "Well, thank you very much, <b>we</b> <b>appreciate</b> that...asshole." [...] This became an inside joke among many Enron employees, mocking Grubman for his perceived meddling rather than Skilling's offensiveness, with slogans such as [...] "Ask Why, Asshole", a variation on Enron's official slogan [...] "Ask why". However, Skilling's comment was met with dismay and astonishment by press and public, as he had previously disdained criticism of Enron coolly or humorously.|$|E
500|$|Reagan died of pneumonia, {{complicated}} by Alzheimer's disease, {{at his home}} in the Bel Air district of Los Angeles, California, on the afternoon of June 5, 2004. A short time after his death, Nancy Reagan released a statement saying, [...] "My family and I would like the world to know that President Ronald Reagan has died after 10 years of Alzheimer's disease at 93 years of age. <b>We</b> <b>appreciate</b> everyone's prayers." [...] President George W. Bush declared June 11 a National Day of Mourning, and [...] came in from around the world. Reagan's body was taken to the Kingsley and Gates Funeral Home in Santa Monica, California later in the day, where well-wishers paid tribute by laying flowers and American flags in the grass. On June 7, his body was removed and taken to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, where a brief family funeral was held conducted by Pastor Michael Wenning. His body lay in repose in the Library lobby until June 9; over 100,000 people viewed the coffin.|$|E
2500|$|On April 17, 2001, Skilling {{made what}} became an infamous comment during {{a conference call}} with {{financial}} analysts. [...] In response to Richard Grubman saying [...] "You know, you are the only financial institution that can't produce a balance sheet or cash flow statement with their earnings," [...] Skilling replied: [...] "Thank you very much, <b>we</b> <b>appreciate</b> that... asshole." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of these policies, many bumiputera with good {{connections}} quickly became millionaires. According to Tan Sri Rafidah Aziz, former Minister of Trade and Industry, the policy was to create [...] "Towering Malays". In 2005 she gave a speech that stated: [...] "If there are young Malay entrepreneurs whose companies are successful, then <b>we</b> <b>appreciate</b> their success, we want Towering Malays of glokal (global and local) standard". She also said that the policy of Approved Permits (APs) had produced many bumiputera entrepreneurs in the automotive industry.|$|E
2500|$|A {{review of}} the short film version in the Daily News of Los Angeles was positive, and Dennis McCarthy wrote: [...] "You'll see some smiles and some tears. Some anger {{and a lot of}} frustration. You'll see the world of autism through the eyes of some {{beautiful}} kids living there." [...] Lenore Skenazy of New York Daily News wrote [...] "It's an extremely moving film, mostly because it's impossible not {{to fall in love with}} the matter-of-fact kids on screen." [...] The Tri-Valley Herald referred to the documentary as a [...] "highly acclaimed film". When Keri Bowers and Taylor Cross appeared on Sunday Today in April 2006, host Campbell Brown said to them: [...] "We are so excited about this and really glad to have you on. <b>We</b> <b>appreciate</b> it." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Bellini reports, he had {{problems}} with Tosi wanting changes {{to be made to}} a cavatina and a stretta in one scene, but he stuck to his own opinion, proving to be correct when he reported the audience's reaction to Florimo: [...] "the public was very happy with the entire opera, particularly with the second act". Overall, the first performance was even greater {{than it had been in}} Naples, and the opera was given a total of 21 times. However, critical reaction was not as positive as that of the audience: [...] "The second act is a long bore" [...] stated L'Eco di Milano, although the Gazzetta di Genova was more helpful, noting [...] "the more we listen to the style of the music, the more <b>we</b> <b>appreciate</b> its merit".|$|E
2500|$|After the 2012 Summer Olympics Campaign, Liz {{was due to}} {{head back}} to the United States to {{complete}} her season with Tulsa Shock in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), but announced on the morning her flight was due to leave, 27 August 2012, that she would not be returning to the States to finish the 2012 season with Tulsa Shock. Her agent released a statement saying [...] "Over the past 6 months Liz has been involved with the Australian National Team as they prepared for the 2012 London Olympics. She has returned from the Olympic campaign physically exhausted and is in need of some recovery time. Unfortunately this will make her unavailable for the remaining few weeks of the WNBA season. We are aware that this is an unfortunate situation and <b>we</b> <b>appreciate</b> and thank Tulsa Shock for their understanding." ...|$|E
2500|$|In modern times, {{there are}} fewer proponents of these views. One reason is that, as Stephen Maitzen argues, {{anthropology}} has long established that while religious belief in general is essentially universal, belief in what Calvin would recognize as God is very unevenly distributed among cultures (consider for example God in Buddhism, Jain cosmology, or non-theistic animism). If God exists, then why, Maitzen asks, does the prevalence of belief in God vary so dramatically with cultural and national boundaries? Jason Marsh has extended this kind of demographic challenge by focusing on human evolution and cognitive science of religion. Why is theistic belief apparently non-existent among early humans but common at later times, {{at least in some}} regions? [...] According to Marsh, the hiddenness problem is harder to answer once <b>we</b> <b>appreciate</b> that much nonbelief is 'natural', owing to the kinds of minds people naturally possess and to their place in evolutionary and cultural history.|$|E

And then the Coliseum.|$|R

2500|$|Hopkins was {{influenced}} by the Welsh language that he acquired while studying theology at St Beuno's near St Asaph. The poetic forms of Welsh literature and particularly cynghanedd with its emphasis on repeating sounds accorded with his own style and became a prominent feature of his work. This reliance on similar-sounding words with close or differing senses means that his poems are best understood if read aloud. An important element in his work is Hopkins's own concept of [...] "inscape" [...] which was derived, in part, from the medieval theologian Duns Scotus. Anthony Domestico explains,Inscape, for Hopkins, is the charged essence, the absolute singularity that gives each created thing its being; instress is both the energy that holds the inscape together and the process by which this inscape is perceived by an observer. We instress the inscape of a tulip, Hopkins would say, when <b>we</b> <b>appreciate</b> the particular delicacy of its petals, when we are enraptured by its specific, inimitable shade of pink." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{transgender}} {{people have}} criticized the HRC for its stance on the 2007 version of ENDA, {{which at the time}} included sexual orientation as a protected category but not gender identity and expression. Once the legislation was submitted by Rep. Barney Frank, HRC officially neither opposed nor supported it. This followed a speech by former HRC President Joe Solmonese at the transgender Southern Comfort Conference the previous month, where he said that HRC [...] "oppose any legislation that is not absolutely inclusive". HRC later explained that it could not actively support a non-inclusive bill, but did not oppose it because the legislation would strategically advance long-term efforts to pass a trans-inclusive ENDA. However, in a letter to U.S. Representatives, HRC did express support for the bill, stating that while HRC is [...] "greatly disappointed that the current version of ENDA is not inclusive... <b>we</b> <b>appreciate</b> the steadfast efforts of our... allies... even when they are forced... to make progress that is measured by inches rather than yards." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frontiere {{finally gave}} up and decided to move the Rams {{franchise}} to St. Louis. However, on March 15, 1995, the other league owners rejected Frontiere's bid to move the franchise by a 21–3–6 vote. Then-Commissioner Paul Tagliabue stated after rejecting the move, [...] "This {{was one of the}} most complex issues we have had to approach in years. We had to balance the interest of fans in Los Angeles and in St. Louis that <b>we</b> <b>appreciate</b> very much. In my judgment, they did not meet the guidelines we have in place for such a move." [...] The commissioner also added: [...] "Once the bridges have been burned and people get turned off on a sports franchise, years of loyalty is not respected and it is difficult to get it back. By the same token, there are millions of fans in that area who have supported the Rams in an extraordinary way. The Rams have 50 years of history and the last 5 or so years of difficult times can be corrected." ...|$|E

2500|$|The opening {{sequence}} for the 2011 {{season was}} set in a closed-studio setting, with Hank Williams Jr. (in his 23rd year) performing with a band {{in front of a}} live audience with large video screens in the background. The end of the opening sequence featured the team logos of that night's participants transitioning into the new ESPN Monday Night Football logo before going to a live shot. On October 3, 2011, ESPN pulled the theme song after Williams appeared on the Fox News Channel program, Fox & Friends, where he compared a golf outing involving Barack Obama, John Boehner, Joe Biden and John Kasich to [...] "Hitler playing golf with Netanyahu." [...] On October 6, 2011, it was announced that Williams would no longer be singing the theme song, and that [...] "All My Rowdy Friends" [...] would no longer be used as its theme, as Williams still owns the song. A statement from ESPN said that the network has [...] "decided to part ways with Hank Williams Jr. <b>We</b> <b>appreciate</b> his contributions over the past years. The success of Monday Night Football has always been about the games and that will continue." [...] Williams commented on the matter: [...] "After reading hundreds of e-mails, I have made my decision... By pulling my opening October 3, [...] stepped on the toes of the First Amendment Freedom of Speech, so therefore me, my song, and All My Rowdy Friends are out of here. It's been a great run." [...] MNF did not have an opening sequence at all from Week 4 through the end of that season.|$|E
