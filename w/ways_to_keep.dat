25|$|Road {{and bridge}} repair methods. There were several <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> traffic moving amid the {{destruction}} {{wrought by the}} bombers. Simple pontoon bridges were made of lashed together bundles of bamboo, topped by heavy wooden planking. Sturdier pontoon structures were made by tying wooden canal boats together – with camouflage measures to hide them during the day from aerial observation. Bridges were also built underwater to escape detection. As noted above, supplies, equipment and material was pre-stocked along roads, and near various choke points like ferry crossings so that repairs could be made quickly. Delayed action bombs caused special problems. Designated personnel were tasked with dismantling them, or watchmen kept them under observation- signaling all within blast distance to disperse when the bombs showed signs of detonating. Repairs were often done at night when the enemy aircraft would be less active.|$|E

25|$|As {{compared}} to other types of CP, and especially as {{compared to}} hypotonic or paralytic mobility disabilities, spastic CP is typically more easily manageable by the person affected, and medical treatment can be pursued on a multitude of orthopedic and neurological fronts throughout life. In any form of spastic CP, clonus of the affected limb(s) may sometimes result, as well as muscle spasms resulting from the pain or stress of the tightness experienced. The spasticity can and usually does lead to a very early onset of muscle stress symptoms like arthritis and tendinitis, especially in ambulatory individuals in their mid-20s and early-30s. Occupational therapy and physical therapy regimens of assisted stretching, strengthening, functional tasks, or targeted physical activity and exercise are usually the chief <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> spastic CP well-managed. If the spasticity {{is too much for}} the person to handle, other remedies may be considered, such as antispasmodic medications, botulinum toxin, baclofen, or even a neurosurgery known as a selective dorsal rhizotomy (which eliminates the spasticity by reducing the excitatory neural response in the nerves causing it).|$|E
25|$|In service, the Airtrans {{system had}} a number of {{unexpected}} problems. The system was originally designed for typical Dallas weather, which rarely sees snow, and it was expected that the normal operations would keep the guideway clear when snow did fall. In operation, snow and ice proved to be a serious problem, but a detailed study on <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the system clear demonstrated it would be less expensive to provide truck services during those rare periods. Additionally, maintaining the vehicles proved more difficult than expected, but DFW's transportation department kept updating the system, one piece at a time. Wiring and electronic components were moved inside the Airtrans cars; they had been exposed to weather under the cars. Circuit boards were replaced with microchips. After fifteen years of continual improvement, the system emerged as a paragon of reliability. At its peak in 1987, the system carried 23,000 passengers a day. In 1988, now operating 24 hours, the system achieved a 99.8% in-service record. In 1989 the vehicles were refurbished to improve maintenance and cleaning operations. When Airtrans made its debut, it used eight-track cartridges for its announcements; the audio system was later upgraded to a cassette system, and still later to a digital voice synthesizer.|$|E

500|$|Stereogum and Gigaom {{estimated}} that Yorke {{may have made}} $20 million from the release, more than he would likely have made through a traditional album release. Stereogum wrote that [...] "this sort of album-release strategy only works for artists who are already astronomically famous, but salute Thom Yorke for figuring out <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> stacking cash while keeping his artistic autonomy." [...] However, Billboard argued that, assuming the ratio of people who paid for the full album was comparable to subscription numbers of Spotify and Pandora Radio, earnings between $1 and 6 million were more likely: [...] "not bad showing for a self-released, direct-to-fan album that allowed Yorke to circumvent major download stores and gather customer information — but it's no Hollywood starring role, either." ...|$|E

[...] He then addressed the group, [...] "We have made many laws and endeavored in several <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you from among us, but neither whipping nor imprisonment, nor cutting off ears, nor banishment upon pain of death will keep you from among us. [...] We desire not your death." [...] Having met his obligation to present {{the position of the}} colony's authorities, he then pronounced, [...] "Hearken now to your sentence of death." [...] William Robinson then wanted to read a prepared statement about being called by the Lord to Boston, but the governor would not allow it to be read, and Robinson was sent back to prison. [...] Marmaduke Stephenson, being less vociferous than Robinson, was allowed to speak, and though initially declining, he ultimately spoke his mind, and then was also sent back to jail.|$|E
500|$|When Ettelson {{joined the}} congregation, it had 650 member families. To {{accommodate}} growth, in 1926 the synagogue built an annex for the children's religious school. That year the congregation also established the [...] "Temple Men's Club", which had over 200 members, {{and joined the}} National Federation of Temple Brotherhoods. In 1928, the congregation purchased an adjoining house south of the synagogue, for Junior Congregation meetings, and began broadcasting its Friday evening services on the radio. The costs for both endeavors were donated anonymously by synagogue member Abe Plough, founder and chairman of Schering-Plough. The synagogue was hard-hit by the Great Depression. Income from dues dropped from $47,000 in 1928 (today $) to $23,000 in 1932, and membership fell from 750 families in 1929 to as low as 629 families. The Talmud Torah was closed {{due to lack of}} funds, and board meetings focused on finding <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the congregation going financially. Ettelson requested a pay reduction of $1,000 (today $) in 1931, and a further 10 percent cut in 1933, and the salaries of other synagogue employees were also cut. The Junior Congregation did well, though; it had 189 paid members by 1933, held Saturday morning and High Holy Days services, and conducted a number of other programs. The congregation eventually recovered as a whole, assisted by members who were leaders in the civic and business worlds. By 1936, membership had increased to 650, and the synagogue paid off the remaining mortgage on the Poplar and Montgomery synagogue building.|$|E

[...] Kahn placed one of these shells at the front of each of the three wings as a porch or portico to illustrate how the building was constructed.

2500|$|Suicide {{rates are}} growing {{worldwide}} {{and over the}} last thirty years there has been international research trying to curb this phenomenon and gather knowledge about who is [...] "at-risk". When a parent loses their child through suicide it is traumatic, sudden and affects all loved ones impacted by this child. Suicide leaves many unanswered questions and leaves most parents feeling hurt, angry and deeply saddened by such a loss. Parents may feel they can't openly discuss their grief and feel their emotions because of how their child died and how the people around them may perceive the situation. Parents, family members and service providers have all confirmed the unique nature of suicide-related bereavement following the loss of a child. They report a wall of silence that goes up around them and how people interact towards them. One {{of the best ways to}} grieve and move on from this type of loss is to find <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> that child as an active part of their lives. It might be privately at first but as parents move away from the silence they can move into a more proactive healing time.|$|E
