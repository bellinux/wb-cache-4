5|$|The age of {{the modern}} <b>Whippet</b> dawned in 1891 when The Kennel Club granted the breed {{official}} recognition, thus making the <b>Whippet</b> eligible for competition in dog shows, and commencing the recording of their pedigrees. In the United States, the <b>Whippet</b> was recognised in 1888 by the American Kennel Club. Whippets arrived in the United States with mill operators from England, and the first populations were established in Massachusetts. The <b>Whippet</b> is the 55th most popular breed according to the American Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, the British <b>Whippet</b> Racing Association was {{established}} to bring around reform and consistency in race rules and procedures for races involving non-purebred Whippets. A year later, viewing the non-purebred dogs as a threat, the <b>Whippet</b> Club Racing Association {{was established}} exclusively for purebred animals.|$|E

5|$|Jim the <b>whippet</b> {{played a}} central role in a trilogy of canal travel books by Terry Darlington. Described as a 'narrow dog' he lent his name to the book's titles - Narrow Dog to Carcassonne, Narrow Dog to Indian River and Narrow Dog to Wigan Pier.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} a <b>Whippet</b> is large and slow beating, often being arrhythmic or even {{intermittent}} when the animal is at rest. This sometimes causes concern to the owner, or to the vet not experienced with the breed. Whippets will, however, demonstrate a regular heartbeat during exercise. In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems were shown to be the second leading cause of mortality in Whippets.|$|E
5|$|It {{was planned}} that the 2nd Infantry Brigade would move past 1st Infantry Brigade once Grévillers was {{captured}} {{but it was}} forced into action early, when its commander, Brigadier General Robert Young, seeing that the 37th Division was struggling to take its objective of Biefvillers, decided to use his brigade to assist. Accordingly, two battalions cleared the village by 10:00 am although casualties were incurred when they were fired upon by some <b>Whippet</b> tanks. The commander {{of one of the}} attacking battalions, along with its padre, intervened and directed the tanks onto Biefvillers. With the village captured, this secured the flank of 1st Infantry Brigade.|$|E

5|$|<b>Whippet</b> rags were {{a popular}} Sunday {{event in the}} north and Midlands at the time. There were also {{international}} events; in Australia, at a track known as Gurney's Paddock, there were races of more than 300 whippets every Saturday, and three nights a week at the White City track. Eventually, the sport evolved and dogs were divided into four groups: those who hunted rabbits, which was not governed by rules; those who coursed hare, for which a set of rules was established; those trained to the rag; and those trained to chase a mechanical lure in a fashion similar to greyhound races. Few of the Whippets of any of the four types were purebred, as maintaining a purebred bloodline was not considered as important as breeding dogs that could win races. Many racing dogs were part terrier, part Greyhound, or part Lurcher.|$|E

5|$|<b>Whippets</b> course, work, and race; {{they have}} been bred for these jobs for years. This has kept them a {{structurally}} sound breed which is predominantly free from the physical exaggerations {{that can lead to}} certain health problems. <b>Whippets</b> are, like other sighthounds, intolerant of barbiturate anaesthetics. This is in part due to their low concentration of body fat and their liver's inability to metabolise the anaesthetics.|$|R

25|$|The Austin <b>Whippet</b> was a British single-seat light {{aircraft}} {{designed and built}} by the Austin Motor Company just after the First World War. It was a small single-seat biplane, intended to be an inexpensive aircraft for the amateur private pilot, and a small number were built before Austin abandoned aircraft production.|$|E
25|$|The early 19th century saw {{times of}} poor {{sanitation}} in England. Rats {{soon became a}} health menace and rat killing became a popular sport. John Hulme, enthusiastic devotee of the sport of rat-baiting and rabbit coursing, crossed a <b>whippet</b> to a cross-bred terrier to produce a tenacious, streamlined animal better suited to the sport. This cross proved so successful that it was repeated, resulting {{in the establishment of}} a definite type.|$|E

5|$|Despite being bred for racing, <b>Whippets</b> can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency to get up on furniture. <b>Whippets</b> are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|R
500|$|<b>Whippets</b> {{are quiet}} and not prone to barking, but require regular exercise. They are {{generally}} gentle dogs {{and may be}} content to spend {{much of the day}} resting.

The <b>whippet</b> angel appears and tells him that because he sacrificed his life for Anne-Marie, Charlie has earned his place in Heaven. Anne-Marie awakens, and they reconcile. Charlie asks her to take care for Itchy. When Anne-Marie goes to sleep again, Charlie leaves and returns to Heaven.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, John Kenworthy, chief {{designer}} of the motor manufacturer Austin Motor Company, (who had built large numbers of aircraft under license during the First World War) designed a small single-seater light aircraft in order {{to cash in on}} an expected boom in private flying. The resulting aircraft, named the Austin <b>Whippet,</b> was a small single-seat biplane of mixed construction, with a fabric covered steel tube fuselage, and single-bay, folding wooden wings. The wings avoided the need for rigging wires by use of streamlined steel lift struts.|$|E

The southern section of the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway connects directly to the station, allowing buses to run from Trumpington via the station to St. Ives and Huntingdon. Buses also travel from the station out of the city to Sawston and Saffron Walden. A taxi rank is located just outside the main entrance.|$|E

500|$|<b>Whippets</b> were {{originally}} greyhounds that were deemed unsuitable for hunting {{because of their}} size. They were returned to their peasant breeders after being maimed {{so that they could}} not be used to hunt and break the forest law. These maimed dogs were bred together and used to catch rats, and hunt rabbits. When the forest law was repealed, these [...] "miniature greyhounds" [...] became popular in the sport of dog racing. This has led to <b>Whippets</b> being described as [...] "the poor man's racehorse." [...] They are still frequently used as racing dogs today, as they have the highest running speed of breeds their weight: [...] and even challenge greyhounds for top speed. <b>Whippets</b> are, however, the fastest accelerating land animal in the world.|$|R

25|$|The QUADRUPED was an NFL draft day {{competition}} held in April 1996 for the Jacksonville Jaguars. This competition {{format is}} older than all other disc dog competition formats other than the Ashley <b>Whippet</b> and the FDDO formats.

It turned into an open competition where many more than four teams were able to compete. Today we have The QUADRUPED Series, a group of competitions that are a points championship in the United States. The popularity has been so great within the frisbee dog world that it has spread to Europe where it has occurred in several countries.|$|E
25|$|The Alien {{is portrayed}} by both Woodruff, Jr. {{in a suit}} and a rod puppet filmed against bluescreen and {{optically}} composited into the live-action footage, with the rods removed by rotoscoping. A mechanical alien head was also used for close-ups. The suit adapted the design used in Aliens so Woodruff could walk on all fours. Woodruff's head was contained in the neck of the suit, because the head was filled with animatronics to move the mouth of the Alien. Fincher suggested that a <b>Whippet</b> be dressed in an alien costume for on-set coverage of the quadrupedal alien, but the visual effects team was dissatisfied with the comical result and the idea was dropped in favor of the puppet.|$|E
