25|$|The {{specific}} {{functions of}} the ego, {{as determined by the}} relative predominance of sense or intellect, are either {{functions of the}} senses (or organism) or functions of the intellect. The former fall into the two classes of feelings (subjective) and perceptions (objective); the latter, according as the receptive or the spontaneous element predominates, into cognition and volition. In cognition, thought is ontologically oriented to the object; and in volition it is the teleological purpose of thought. In the first case <b>we</b> <b>receive</b> (in our fashion) the object of thought into ourselves. In the latter we plant it out into the world. Both cognition and volition are functions of thought as well as forms of moral action.|$|E

500|$|Like many {{educational}} institutions for hearing children during the 1800s and early 1900s, schools for deaf children were segregated based on race. The first {{school for the}} deaf in the United States, the American School for the Deaf (ASD), was founded in 1817 but did not admit any Black students until 1952. Of the schools for the deaf that were founded, few admitted students of color. Seeing a lack of educational opportunities for Black deaf children, Platt Skinner founded the Skinner School for the Colored Deaf, Dumb, and Blind in 1856 in Niagara Falls, New York. Skinner described his school as [...] "the first effort {{of its kind in}} the country... <b>We</b> <b>receive</b> and instruct those and only those who are refused admission to all other institutions and are despised on account of their color." [...] The school moved to Trenton, New Jersey, in 1860. After it closed in 1866, no Northern state created an institution for Black deaf children. Even after these states outlawed segregation by 1900, integration was sparse, as some institutions allowed Black students and others did not.|$|E
