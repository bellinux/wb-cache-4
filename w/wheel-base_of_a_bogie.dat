Presently, there is overreliance on part-specific experiments in practice. In the present work, a risk evaluation index system <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> system has been established based on the inspection data and experts’ evaluation. Then, considering quantitative and qualitative aspects, the risk state <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> system has been evaluated using an extension theory and an entropy weight method.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{manufacturing}} {{of diesel}} locomotives, their basic parameters must {{be adapted to}} the requirements of that specific environment. One of the central issues is the choice of bogies. The article present the examples <b>of</b> selecting <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> by using multi-criteria optimization methods. The methods are adapted for Siemens bogies models SF 1, SF 2, SF 3 and SF 6. The solutions obtained by different methods were compared, and shortcomings of certain multi-criteria optimization methods for selection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> model according to its parameters were established...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{improving}} the tractive and dynamic performance of locomotives by means of using axle boxes with inclined radius links was investigated. The kinematics of axle boxes with different variants (different angles) and designs of inclined radius links, based on the vector contour method for link mechanisms, was studied. The results <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> design with vertically inclined radius links {{were used for the}} improvement of vertical load distribution for locomotives. The behavior <b>of</b> <b>a</b> locomotive running in a curve is more complicated because the lateral forces appear between <b>a</b> flange <b>of</b> the wheel {{and the head of the}} rail in the contact zone, and the values of wheel slip are higher than for straight sections of track. These two factors are the main reasons for wheel wear. Theoretical and experimental investigations to reduce wear and to improve vehicle dynamics were made, and the results obtained show that an effective solution can be reached by the use of inclined links to the longitudinal axis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> in the horizontal plane. Questions about the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> with <b>a</b> radial installation and active steering are discussed...|$|R
40|$|It {{would be}} {{desirable}} to obtain <b>a</b> stress profile <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> frame {{with reference to}} the railway track on which it runs. In this paper <b>a</b> structural analysis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical open-shaped railway vehicle bogie frame, based on a computer dynamic simulation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> real operating environment, is carried out. The analysis has confirmed that this type of bogie frame is very sensitive to torsion, which suggests that the twist loading case should be carefully investigated if <b>an</b> open-shaped <b>bogie</b> frame is involved in <b>a</b> particular <b>bogie.</b> It is also shown that the potential failure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>bogie</b> frame may be ascertained at the design stage by putting the <b>bogie</b> frame in <b>a</b> simulated service environment...|$|R
30|$|Research on {{the load}} {{spectrum}} of the bogie frame can adopt multi-body system dynamics simulation to obtain the main load of the bogie. Rigid and elastic bogie frames are used to establish a model for multi-body system dynamics. Simulation calculation indicates that the loads of rigid and elastic bogie frames possess similar maximum dynamic amplitude; however, the function frequency <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> with <b>an</b> elastic frame is significantly higher than that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> with <b>a</b> rigid frame within a different dynamic amplitude range of the main load [10, 11]. If <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> frame {{is regarded as a}} rigid body, its load-stress transitive relation is linear, and the load-stress coefficient obtained with a quasi-static method can be employed as a reference for research on the load spectrum [12]. If <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> frame is regarded as an elastic body [13 – 15], a transient analysis can be conducted, and the input could include modal information coupled with nonlinear processing of the wheel-rail relationship [16 – 19]. As a result, the transitive relation between the measured load and stress is nonlinear and thus requires the adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nonlinear fitting method for optimized fitting of the multi-input model.|$|R

50|$|The derailment, {{according}} to the first Polizia Ferroviaria survey, was caused by <b>a</b> critical failure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> switch.

50|$|The Types VC and VC1 were in {{many ways}} similar to the manufacturer’s Type VA which entered {{production}} in the same year, but they were slightly longer at 2,950 mm, with <b>a</b> <b>wheel-base</b> <b>of</b> 2,120 mm. <b>A</b> carriage format Voiturette body provided space for two while the covered carriage Tonneau / Phaeton format body offered ample space for four.|$|R
30|$|In {{the absence}} of sidelong stimulations in {{straight}} lines, wheel and rail contact areas are shown in Fig.  1 and will generally be focused {{in the center of}} the wheel and the rail.

30|$|The anti-warp {{performance}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> {{equipped with}} <b>a</b> wedge-type damper was poor and would worsen after wedge wear, which {{would result in}} a poor riding index and damping force reliability [13]. The normal force of the friction pair of the wedge-type bogie is equal to that of the lever-type bogie with the same φ, where the width of {{the upper end of the}} lever is the same as the wedge. Therefore, the nonlinear critical speed of the lever-type car should be similar to that of the wedge-type car.|$|R

50|$|In 1897 it was rebuilt as a 4-4-0ST, or saddle tank. The large bunker {{and rear}} water tank were reduced in size.

50|$|The {{locomotives}} had <b>a</b> wheelbase <b>of</b> only 9 ft, {{and this}} was too short to operate the track circuits. Since this made their use impracticable, each was permanently coupled to a tender, which consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> removed from <b>a</b> redundant District line Q Stock car. The weight of the bogie was increased to 17 tons, and it was fitted with tripcocks and sleet brushes, {{so that it could}} be used for clearing snow and ice from the current rails. Although the tenders were permanently coupled to the locomotives, they carried separate numbers, and were identified as DT81, DT82 and DT83. The tender increased the wheelbase to 28 ft.|$|R

30|$|The {{study of}} load {{spectrum}} is the hotspot {{of the current}} bogie frame research [1 – 3].

The load spectrum <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bogie</b> is usually obtained with the method of measured load spectrum. It can also be obtained with the multi-body system dynamics simulation method.

The vibration of each natural modes, except the body-bending mode, tends to increase uniformly with the operation speed. The vibration of the first body-bending mode varies greatly due to the averaging effects of the track roughness through the length between truck centers in the car, and it deteriorates the riding comfort further in the speed ranges near 270 km/h and higher than 450 km/h. As an example, the flexural rigidity of the car body is examined to determine countermeasures suitable for 270 km/h operation...|$|R
