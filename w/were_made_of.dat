5|$|In the 19th century, Thomas John Newbold, an English soldier {{working for}} the East India Company, {{estimated}} the population of Kuala Terengganu to be around 15,000 to 20,000 Malays with 600 Chinese, but it was presumably an overestimation. There were few brick buildings in the town. The principal brick buildings were a mosque and a custom house. Most of the houses <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> wood and thatch. The Chinese settlement in Kuala Terengganu, Kampung Cina, had become an old and established settlement. Most of the houses and shops in Kampung Cina <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> stone and brick.

5|$|As Bristol {{expanded}} {{in the early}} 20th century, {{the need for a}} new station to serve the outskirts grew, and on 29 August 1927, the Great Western Railway opened a station at Parson Street, named Parson Street Halt. There were two platforms, one {{on each side of the}} two running lines. There was a wooden shelter on the westbound platform, and a metal shelter on the eastbound platform. The platforms <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> wood, with access from the main road via steps. No goods facilities were provided.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1920s, {{the station}} was proving {{inadequate}} for the passenger numbers, and so work began on a comprehensive rebuild in 1926.

5|$|Edward Grant, a {{historian}} of science, {{has provided evidence}} that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the celestial spheres to be solid {{in the sense of}} three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not consider them solid in the sense of hard.

5|$|Established in 1667 by the German alchemist J. J.

5|$|Fireworks: Fireworks first {{appeared}} in China during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), in the early age of gunpowder. The common people in the Song era could purchase simple fireworks from market vendors; these <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> sticks of bamboo packed with gunpowder, although grander displays {{were known to be}} held. Rocket propulsion was soon applied to warfare, and {{by the time of the}} mid 14th century there were many types of rocket launchers available.|$|E
5|$|Higher (av. 9m) and thicker (av. 3m) walls. Walls <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> {{stone or}} stone facing with rubble core. The greater {{thickness}} would protect the wall from enemy mining. The {{height of the}} walls would force attackers to use scaling-ladders. The parapet of the rampart would have crenellations to provide protection from missiles for defenders.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, John Evans, then {{a former}} {{governor}} of the Colorado Territory, constructed a toll road from Evergreen to Morrison via Bear Creek canyon. The early road offered access to various mining and logging resources along the creek. This road had over twenty bridges over Bear Creek, most of which <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> wood from the surrounding region. By the late 1870s, toll roads were no longer common, and the path's maintenance responsibilities were passed to Jefferson County.|$|E

5|$|In the Period II, the finds {{excavated}} {{revealed that}} people had moved out from pit dwelling to structures built at the ground level. However, the pits and its associated chambers formed the base floor of the superstructure, which was made up by filling the pits and covering it with mud plaster, and occasionally painted in red ochre. Post-holes around the pits revealed that the superstructures <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> wood built over compacted Karewa soil floors.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk {{was burned}} down during the Revolutionary War. After the Revolution, Norfolk was rebuilt in the Federal style, based on Roman ideals. Federal-style homes kept Georgian symmetry, {{though they had}} more refined decorations to look like New World homes.

Rooms were oval, elliptical or octagonal. Few of these federal rowhouses remain standing today. A majority of buildings <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> wood and had a simple construction.|$|E
50|$|Its {{structure}} {{differs from}} that of other string instruments. Fish skin is pulled over half of the body's surface, and the other part <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> pine.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{identifying}} conditions under which a divergence free matrix field takes values in some prescribed sets of matrices K. We treat in detail the case when K <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> two or three matrices. Our results are parallel to those on curl free matrices. In that case Ball and James showed rigidity when K <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> two matrices and Tartar proved lack of rigidity when K <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> four matrices. For our problem we prove rigidity when K <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> two matrices and lack <b>of</b> rigidity when <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> three. We give examples when the differential constraints are yet of a different type and present some applications to composites. ...|$|R
