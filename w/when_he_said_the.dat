500|$|News {{footage of}} then-President Bill Clinton was {{digitally}} altered {{to make it}} appear as if he is speaking about alien contact. This was not the original plan for the film; Zemeckis had initially approached Sidney Poitier to play the president, but the actor turned the role down in favor of The Jackal. Shortly after Poitier's refusal, Zemeckis saw a NASA announcement in August 1996. [...] "Clinton gave his Mars rock speech," [...] the director explained, [...] "and I swear to God it was like it was scripted for this movie. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> line 'We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say,' I almost died. I stood there with my mouth hanging open." ...|$|E
500|$|Coburn {{generated}} controversy {{after the}} race, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> current Triple Crown system allowed [...] "the coward's way out" [...] because fresh horses {{who had not}} run in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes could challenge horses who contested all three legs. [...] Sherman downplayed the outburst, saying, [...] " [...] was at {{the heat of the}} moment ... Sometimes the emotions get in front of you." [...] Two days later, Coburn apologized, saying he wanted to congratulate the owners of Tonalist and adding, [...] "I wanted so much for [...] to win the Triple Crown for the people of America." [...] Steve Haskin of Blood-Horse magazine summarized the race stating, [...] "when I think back... the one image that will last forever will be of an exhausted colt walking back through the tunnel with a bloodstained foot, his head down and breathing hard, and every vein protruding from his sweat-soaked body. He had given every ounce of himself, and with it all, still was beaten only [...] lengths." ...|$|E
500|$|Jared Harris {{was told}} after the tenth episode {{read-through}} by series creator Matt Weiner that Lane Pryce's time {{was at an}} end. About Lane's forced retirement, Harris stated: [...] "In the beginning, he doesn't know that's the reason he's being called into the office. Once it comes up, {{he thinks he can}} bluff his way out of it. And then he goes through all of these emotions, from anger to denial to depression to acceptance. It was all written in there. The [...] was very specific about the different turns he would take." [...] Harris continued about his character's subsequent suicide: [...] "When Matt told me [...] idea, I laughed my ass off. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> car doesn't start, I just laughed for about five minutes. Nothing goes right for ...The sadness that I feel is that it's been such an amazing experience." [...] Pete's (Vincent Kartheiser), Don's (Jon Hamm), and Roger's (John Slattery) [...] "shocked and chaotic" [...] reactions to Lane's corpse were the actors' genuine reactions, according to Harris.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990 Germany's {{citizenship}} law {{was somewhat}} relaxed {{with the introduction}} of the Foreigner's Law; this gave Turkish workers the right to apply for a permanent residency permit after eight years of living in the country. In regards to people of Turkish origin born in Germany, who were also legally [...] "foreign", they were given the right to acquire German citizenship at the age of eighteen, provided that they gave up their Turkish citizenship. Hence, they were deprived of the right to hold dual citizenship because it would increase the Turkish population in the country. Chancellor Helmut Kohl officially stated this as the main reason for denying dual citizenship in 1997 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> following: ...|$|E
2500|$|In Norway, the Germans did {{retain the}} twelve divisions, {{indicating}} the Germans assessed a higher threat there. Besides being implausible, Cockade also failed because the Allies {{did not work}} hard {{enough to make the}} deception look real. [...] The Royal Navy would not risk its battleships and Eaker did not want to divert resources from the strategic bombing offensive. Cockade did have one success: the Germans believed the story that the Allies had 51 divisions in the British Isles, when there were only 17 divisions. This became important in deception operations in 1944. Cockade was best summarized by Sir Arthur [...] "Bomber" [...] Harris, commander of RAF Bomber Command, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> deception plan was [...] "at best a piece of harmless play acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{then-existing}} Pennsylvania law, Scranton {{was limited}} to a single term and could not run for reelection in 1966. That same year, {{he announced that he}} would never again seek elected office. After his term in office, Scranton attended the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention of 1967-1968 and helped write a new constitution for the state, which included a provision allowing future governors to seek a second term. In 1968, President-elect Richard Nixon asked Scranton to become Secretary of State, but he declined. He did serve as a special envoy to the Middle East but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> Nixon Administration should be [...] "more evenhanded" [...] in managing the problems of the Middle East, some in the American Jewish community regarded this as antisemitic and Nixon quickly distanced himself from the former governor. In accordance with his 1966 pledge never to seek elected office, he rebuffed a draft movement ...|$|E

It was also referenced in the song, [...] "So You Wanna Be a Cop" [...] by the Crack Rocksteady 7, in the lyric: [...] "and after 41 shots, you're grinning in the donut shop".

60|$|This {{was what}} Charlie Ferrola meant <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that <b>the</b> Van Astrachans were obtuse. They never {{could be brought}} to the niceties of moral {{perspective}} which show one exactly where to find the vanishing point for every duty.|$|R
