50|$|The only {{established}} {{function of}} ORM is {{to act as}} a carrier of basic and neutrally charged lipophilic compounds. In medicine, it is known as the primary carrier of basic (positively charged) drugs (<b>whereas</b> <b>albumin</b> carries acidic (negatively charged) and neutral drugs), steroids, and protease inhibitors. Aging causes a small decrease in plasma albumin levels; if anything, there is a small increase in alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The effect of these changes on drug protein binding and drug delivery, however, appear to be minimal. AGP shows a complex interaction with thyroid homeostasis: ORM in low concentrations was observed to stimulate the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor and intracellular accumulation of cyclic AMP. High AGP concentrations, however, inhibited TSH signalling.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA simple {{protocol}} to obtain Cu(II) -IDA (iminodiacetic acid) -modified capillaries {{was developed for}} immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). It consisted in the synthesis of IDA-silane used for a one-step coating of fused silica capillaries. The approach prevented the hydrolysis of silica potentially induced by two step coatings (γ-GPTMS, then IDA) employed in the conventional method of bonding iminodiacetic acid. The IDA content was quantified using a model relating the electroosmotic flow generated in IDA-modified capillaries to the charges induced by IDA species. The retention behavior of holotransferrin and bovine serum albumin on these IMAC columns was then investigated. Holotransferrin revealed a high affinity for Cu(II) -supports through a specific interaction with Cu(II) ions <b>whereas</b> <b>albumin</b> did not show any retention.

To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} stress on the dynam-ics of serum protein response during starvation, serum albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin changes were studied in six chair-adapted macaques during two separate 7 -day test periods: (1) Starvation&mdash;NPO + IV D 5 /W (100 cc/kg/day), and (2) Sur-gery/starvation&mdash;laparotomy and gastrostomy + NPO + IV D 5 /W (100 cc/kg/day).

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the hepatoprotective effects of JWXYS on dimethylnitrosamine- (DMN-) induced chronic hepatitis and hepatic fibrosis in rats and to clarify the mechanism through which JWXYS exerts these effects. After the rats were treated with DMN for 3 weeks, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) levels were significantly elevated, <b>whereas</b> the <b>albumin</b> level decreased. Although DMN was continually administered, after the 3 doses of JWXYS were orally administered, the SGOT and SGPT levels significantly decreased and the albumin level was significantly elevated. In addition, JWXYS treatment prevented liver fibrosis induced by DMN. JWXYS exhibited superoxide-dismutase-like activity and dose-dependently inhibited DMN-induced lipid peroxidation and xanthine oxidase activity in the liver of rats. Our findings suggest that JWXYS exerts antifibrotic effects against DMN-induced chronic hepatic injury.

Thus our study demonstrated that, as age advances liver gets irritated and the liver functions gets disturbed. The decreased concentration of calcium in postmenopausal women indicates that they are more prone to fractures and osteoporosis...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- Seed {{composition}} and reserve mobilization were investigated in wild poinsettia (Euphorbia heterophylla L.). Lipids, around 60 % of seed dry mass, {{are the major}} reserve. Proteins, including albumins (49 %), salt insoluble globulins (30 %), salt-soluble globulins (21 %) and prolamins (0. 3 %), comprise {{about a quarter of}} seed dry mass. Soluble sugars comprise about 3. 6 % of seed dry mass, sucrose being the predominant sugar. Starch was not detected in the endosperm of E. h ter phylla. Lipid depletion starts after initial imbibition, and is completed between 72 and 96 hours. Protein fractions exhibit different degradation patterns, salt-soluble globulins being continuously degraded after the start of imbibition whereas salt insoluble fractions are degraded between 36 and 72 hours, and albumins between 60 and 84 hours. Globulin depletion is accompanied by an increase in free amino acids in the endosperm <b>whereas</b> intense <b>albumin</b> depletion is not. This result suggests that during albumin depletion there is a rapid transfer of amino acids to the growing embryo. Histochemical studies indicated that light accelerates protein degradation in the micropylar area of the seed. Soluble sugars increase in the embryo with no concomitant decrease in the endosperm, suggesting that sugars are mostly originated from the catabolism of lipids...|$|R
