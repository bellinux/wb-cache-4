5|$|After the 1953 armistice, {{the defense}} of the Korean Demilitarized Zone was handled by the South Korean and American armies. The eastern half of the border was handled by the South Korean Army <b>while</b> <b>I</b> Corps took charge in the west. For the next 18 years, the corps oversaw US forces on the DMZ, seeing only {{occasional}} incidents with the North Korean army. In 1971, under Nixon's détente policy, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, leaving the 2nd Infantry Division as the only US Army unit in Korea. I Corps remained in Korea as a two-division formation until 1972 when it was reduced to zero strength and was replaced in 1982 by the Third Republic of Korea Army (TROKA).|$|E
5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a <b>while,</b> <b>I</b> failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E

5|$|The {{planting}} was recreated in the 1930s. No {{original plan}} of the renaissance garden survives, although records show fruit was grown in the 17th century. The garden has decorative hedges, trimmed into {{the shapes of the}} Scottish thistle, English rose, and French fleur-de-lis. Further planting is clipped into letters, spelling out the two Lindsay family mottoes, Dum Spiro Spero (<b>while</b> <b>I</b> breathe I hope), and Endure Forte (endure firmly).|$|E
5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching <b>while</b> <b>I</b> recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{it was not}} an easy {{introduction}} to the front for the New Zealanders. On arriving in their sector, they found the defensive arrangements to be poor and immediately set about improving the trenches and wire emplacements. Although the bulk of the division's personnel manned secondary defences rearward of the front line to avoid the German artillery, the forward areas had to be constantly patrolled as a deterrent to an attack and to give the impression they were fully manned. The static nature of the war meant that the Divisional Mounted Troops, intended to be used as scouts, were redundant and, along with two Light Horse squadrons from the Australian infantry divisions, were soon transferred to a new formation designated 1st ANZAC Light Horse Regiment. In July, the New Zealand Division was transferred to the newly arrived II ANZAC Corps <b>while</b> <b>I</b> ANZAC moved south to the Somme.|$|E
