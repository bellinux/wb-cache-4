60|$|Freedom can {{be fully}} {{appreciated}} only {{by those who}} have been for a long period deprived of liberty. It is impossible to comprehend the feelings of joy that welled up in Martin's bosom as he clambered up the rugged cliffs among which he had found shelter, and looked round upon the beautiful valley, now lying {{in the shadow of the}} mountain range behind which the sun had just set. He sat down on a rock, regardless of the <b>wet</b> <b>condition</b> of his clothes, and pondered long and earnestly over his position, which was still one of some danger; but a sensation of light-hearted recklessness made the prospect before him seem very bright. He soon made up his mind what to do. The weather was extremely warm, so that, after wringing the water out of his linen clothes, he experienced little discomfort; but he felt that there would not only be discomfort but no little danger in travelling in such a country without arms, covering, or provisions. He therefore determined on the bold expedient of revisiting the Indian village during the darkness of the night in order to procure what he required. He ran great risk of being retaken, but his necessity was urgent and he was aware that several families were absent on a hunting expedition at that time, whose huts were pretty certain to be unoccupied.|$|E
60|$|The worthy friar offered Quentin {{permission}} to attend their devotions, but {{his clothes were}} in such a <b>wet</b> <b>condition</b> that the young Scot was obliged to decline the opportunity, and request permission, instead, to sit by the kitchen fire, in order to his attire being dried before morning, as he was particularly desirous that the Bohemian, when they should next meet, should observe no traces of his having been abroad during the night. The friar not only granted his request, but afforded him his own company, which fell in very happily with the desire which Durward had to obtain information concerning the two routes which he had heard mentioned by the Bohemian in his conversation with the lanzknecht. The friar, entrusted upon many occasions {{with the business of}} the convent abroad, was the person in the fraternity best qualified to afford him the information he requested, but observed that, as true pilgrims, it became the duty of the ladies whom Quentin escorted, to take the road {{on the right side of}} the Maes, by the Cross of the Kings, where the blessed relics of Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar (as the Catholic Church has named the eastern Magi who came to Bethlehem with their offerings) had rested as they were transported to Cologne, and on which spot they had wrought many miracles.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the grand}} [...] "matter of matters," [...] {{and the one}} that took up the most of Uncle Jaw's spare time, lay in a dispute between him and 'Squire Jones, the father of Susan and Silence; for it so {{happened}} that his lands and those of Uncle Jaw were contiguous. Now, the matter of dispute was on this wise: On 'Squire Jones's land there was a mill, which mill Uncle Jaw averred was [...] "always a-flooding his medder land." [...] As Uncle Jaw's [...] "medder land" [...] was by nature half bog and bulrushes, and therefore liable to be found in a <b>wet</b> <b>condition,</b> there was always a happy obscurity as to where the water came from, and whether there was at any time more there than belonged to his share. So, when all other subject matters of dispute failed, Uncle Jaw recreated himself with getting up a lawsuit about his [...] "medder land;" [...] and one of these cases was in pendency when, by the death of the squire, the estate was left to Susan and Silence, his daughters. When, therefore, the report reached him that Deacon Enos had been cheated out of his dues, Uncle Jaw prepared forthwith to go and compare notes. Therefore, one evening, as Deacon Enos was sitting quietly by the fire, musing and reading with his big Bible open before him, he heard the premonitory symptoms of a visitation from Uncle Jaw on his door scraper; and soon the man made his appearance. After seating himself {{directly in front of the}} fire, with his elbows on his knees, and his hands spread out over the coals, he looked up in Deacon Enos's mild face with his little inquisitive gray eyes, and remarked, by way of opening the subject, [...] "Well, deacon, old 'Squire Jones is gone at last. I wonder how much good all his land will do him now?" ...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the present}} study was an {{investigation}} of the influence of different storage conditions on the bond strength between cp-titanium and two veneering porcelains. Both porcelain compound systems were investigated with and without the use of porcelain bonder. The porcelains under investigation were Vita Titankeramik (Vita) and Triceram (Esprident). The titanium test specimens of I defined size of 25 mm x 3 mm x 0, 5 mm were individually manufactured at the dental laboratory Ticost (Brandenburg) as described in detail in chapter 3. 3. <<in the following, seven test specimens each were stored under different conditions: Triceram with porcelain bonder, Vita Titankeramik without porcelain bonder, all having been veneered as described in detail in chapter 3. 5. 28 test series were conducted with 7 test specimens of the four different types each under the following conditions: 28 test specimens were stored under dry conditions. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by water for on week. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by water for one month. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by water for six month. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by artificial saliva for one week. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by artificial saliva for one month. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by artificial saliva for six months. The resulting bond strength was evaluated and their effects significantly higher bond strength could only be found for Triceram with bonder stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by water for six months as compared to Triceram with bonder stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by artificial saliva for six months. When no bonder is used a range of significant differences can be found: It can be stated that bond strengths decrease with the duration of storage. Similar results were found for Vita Titankeramik. With the use of bonder no significant differences in bond strength can be found. But again, if no bonder is used bond strength values decrease significantly over time. With porcelain veneered titanium a bonder should definitely be used and is indispensable. Even after short storage durations results do not differ significantly between dry storage <b>conditions</b> and <b>wet</b> storage <b>conditions.</b> The investigations show that with longer duration of storage under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> bond strength will profit from the use of a bonder. With respect to the fact that a porcelain veneered dental restoration will exposed to <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> continually, use of a bonder is a must...|$|R

50|$|Tawing is {{a method}} that uses alum and {{aluminium}} salts, generally {{in conjunction with other}} products such as egg yolk, flour, and other salts. The leather becomes tawed by soaking in a warm potash alum and salts solution, between 20 and 30 °C. The process increases the leather's pliability, stretchability, softness, and quality. Adding egg yolk and flour to the standard soaking solution further enhances its fine handling characteristics. Then, the leather is air dried (crusted) for several weeks, which allows it to stabilize. Tawing is traditionally used on pigskins and goatskins to create the whitest colors. However, exposure and aging may cause slight yellowing over time and, if it remains in a <b>wet</b> <b>condition,</b> tawed leather will suffer from decay. Technically, tawing is not tanning.|$|E

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the North Pole, the lithosphere beneath the past Solis Planum experienced a strength contrast for a relatively long time, which suggests mechanical decoupling between the crust and mantle from 2  Ga {{to the present day}} under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> (Figs.  5, 7). The incompetent crust that existed from 3 to 2  Ga under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> likely contributed to the small elastic thickness (24 – 37  km) in the Solis Planum (e.g., McGovern et al. 2002, 2004; Ruiz et al. 2006).

5000|$|On March 18 {{the results}} of the {{investigation}} of the area called [...] "Berry Bowl" [...] was announced. This site is a large rock with a small, bowl-shaped depression, in which a large number of spherules had accumulated. The MIMOS II Mössbauer spectrometer was used to analyze the depression and then the area of the rock right beside it. Any difference in the measured data was then attributed to the material in the spherules. A large difference in the obtained [...] "spectra" [...] was found. [...] "This is the fingerprint of hematite, so we conclude that the major iron-bearing mineral in the berries is hematite," [...] said Daniel Rodionov, a rover science team collaborator from the University of Mainz, Germany.

Both Carlos Muñoz and Marco Andretti of Andretti Autosport delayed switching from the slicks to the wet tires for nearly 10 laps while most other teams pitted to make changes from dry to wet tire set-ups. This allowed both drivers to open a substantial lead before they pitted to make the change, just as the race was called due to lightening strikes in the area. The race was called before lap 48 could be run due to rain and the electrical storms with Muñoz being comfortably in the lead at the time. Andretti coming in second, and third place going to Simon Pagenaud of Team Penske. This was Muñoz's first career victory in an IndyCar race.|$|E
50|$|After the {{irrigation}} in the crop field, the water depth gradually decreases because of evapotranspiration, seepage, and percolation. Because of the installed tubes in the field, {{it is possible}} to monitor the water depth below the soil surface up to 15-20 cm. When the water level drops 15 cm below the soil surface, irrigation should be applied in the field to re-flood to a depth of 5 cm. During the flowering stage of the rice, the field should be kept flooded. After flowering, during the mid-season and late season (grain filling and ripening stages), the water level is allowed to drop below the soil surface to 15 cm before re-irrigation. To suppress the growth of weeds in the rice field, AWD method should be followed 1-2 weeks after the transplantation. In the case of many weeds in the field, AWD needs to be started after three weeks of transplantation. Usually, the fertilizer recommendations are as same as continuous flooding method. Application of nitrogen fertilizer is preferable on dry soil just before re-irrigation. To ensure a similar dry or <b>wet</b> <b>condition</b> throughout the crop field, which is essential to maintain good yield, it is important to level the rice field properly.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{isothermal}} oxidation condition, {{water vapour}} has {{little effect on}} the oxidation rate and scale composition of a nickel-based SY 625 alloy oxidized at 1100 °C. The scale is composed of an outer Cr 2 O 3 and an internal CrNbO 4 scale. The oxide scale morphology differs between dry and <b>wet</b> <b>conditions.</b> Under dry conditions the oxide scale appears to be compact and chromia pegs are observed at the internal interface. Under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions,</b> porosities are observed spread inside the scale and the chromia grain size is smaller. At this temperature some scale spallation is observed under dry and <b>wet</b> <b>conditions.</b> Under cyclic oxidation conditions the oxide scale adherence is slightly improved in wet environment. The chromia scale is adherent during the 4 first oxidation cycles. In dry air, spallation occured after the first cycle. In dry and <b>wet</b> <b>conditions,</b> after the chromia scale spallation has started, NiO and NiCr 2 O 4 form first. NiMoO 4 forms later on the alloy surface during the cycling test. The best resistance of the alloy under thermal cycling <b>conditions</b> under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> is related to the presence of a more plastic and adherent scale owing to a higher scale porosity and smaller chromia grain size compared to dry conditions...|$|R
