5|$|Tjo and Tjan hired Njoo Cheong Seng, a dramatist who had {{previously}} worked with the Orion Opera before establishing his own troupe, and his wife Fifi Young. The two had gained wide recognition through their stage work, and {{it was hoped that}} name recognition <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> audiences. The hiring of Njoo and Young was part of a trend of bringing theatrically trained actors and crew into the film industry. Terang Boelan had used stage starlet Roekiah and her husband Kartolo to great effect, and the actors had brought similar financial success to Tan's Film after they were hired.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the war, the majority of finance for the Southern government came via duties on international trade. The import tariff, enacted in May 1861, was set at 12.5% and it roughly matched in coverage the previously existing Federal tariff, the Tariff of 1857. Between February 17 and May 1 of 1861, 65% of all government revenue was raised from the import tariff. However, revenue from the tariffs all but disappeared after the Union imposed its blockade of Southern coasts. By November 1861 the proportion of government revenue coming from custom duties had dropped to one-half of one percent. Secretary of Treasure Memminger had expected that the tariff <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> about 25 million dollars in revenue in the first year alone. In fact, the total revenue raised in this way during the entire war was only about $3.4 million.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{showed a}} portion of the {{unfinished}} script to Australian director Jim Sharman, who decided to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the Royal Court Theatre, Sloane Square, Chelsea, London, which was used as a project space for new work. O'Brien had appeared briefly in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar, directed by Sharman, and the two also worked together in Sam Shepard's The Unseen Hand. Sharman <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> production designer Brian Thomson. The original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer Sue Blane, musical director Richard Hartley, and stage producer Michael White, who was brought in to produce. As the musical went into rehearsal, the working title, They Came from Denton High, was changed just before previews at the suggestion of Sharman to The Rocky Horror Show.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of its opening, it was the largest mall complex {{developed}} by CBL. In the first year, it was projected that the mall would employee 2,500 employees—instantly making it the largest employer in the city; this was expected to expand to 3,500 with the completion of the second phase. It was hoped it would generate $80 million in sales. In addition to helping to retain local shoppers who might otherwise travel the 2½ hours southeast to Houston for mall shopping, CBL and city officials expected the mall would draw shoppers from around the Brazos Valley. Before its opening, the city did not have a highly developed retail community. With the planned additions, then College Station city manager North Bardell said it was expected to generate $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, nearly equal to what the city collected in the previous fiscal year from all other sales. It <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> another $120,000 in property taxes, a half-million in taxes for College Station Independent School District, and $1 million in electric bills. The increase in jobs was seen as good for the community, and the city hoped it would attract new civic groups to the area. Taking a year longer than originally planned, the expansion was completed in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The group {{became a}} {{professional}} band in 1972, adding drummer Bennett Vartanian and changing their name to Wildcountry. During this time, the group accepted a position {{playing at the}} nearby Canyonland theme park. The park <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> established stars, such as Jerry Wallace, Bobby Bare, and Narvel Felts, and the band would back them, afterwards performing a one-hour dance set. After a while, with opportunities for the band slimmed, a discouraged Cook took a government job in Anniston, Alabama. Owen was studying English at Jacksonville State University, and Cook had an electronics job. The trio shared at $56-a-month apartment in Anniston, working to keep the band afloat with night and weekend gigs. The group decided to become professional musicians in 1973, and began performing at bars throughout the Southeast. In March, the band relocated to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, performing six nights {{a week at a}} club named The Bowery for tips. They made their best money performing cover songs of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Merle Haggard. The group could not secure a record contract and began to self-finance recordings. The group borrowed $4,000 from a Fort Payne bank to record and release their own albums to sell at shows. Vartanian dropped out of the group, and following a rotation of four more drummers, they settled on Rick Scott in 1974.|$|E
25|$|A model {{similar to}} one {{proposed}} by the late Senator Ted Kennedy <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> between 21.5 million and 67.5 million according to the group.

25|$|In 2012, the 161st Canterbury Cricket Week was {{scheduled}} to clash with {{the second week of}} the 2012 Summer Olympics in London leading to fears of a reduced attendance at the Cricket Week.

25|$|All My Children's first {{success was}} {{its focus on}} young love.

In its first year on the air, it ranked No. 17 out of 19 soap operas. Despite this, its audience grew with each passing year.|$|E

25|$|The study {{concluded}} that all six routes showed a negative net present value and therefore had a poor business case, but four of the service options would generate a small operating profit. In particular, a service to Lewes without intermediate stops at Barcombe and Isfield <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> £3.71m annually {{at a cost of}} £2.28m, giving an operating cost ratio of 1.63, although this excludes any capital costs.|$|E

Approximately 4 million annual passengers {{would be subject to}} the fare, based on the 2013 ridership figure of 21.9 million.|$|E

In Sharapova's first official Australian Open warm-up tournament at the 2011 ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand, she was seeded first. She lost to the Hungarian veteran and eventual champion Gréta Arn in the quarterfinals. After the ASB Classic, Sharapova decided to split up with Joyce, ending a successful cooperation that has brought her two Grand Slam victories and the World No. 1 ranking.|$|E
25|$|Until 1989 in Scotland and 1990 in England and Wales, local councils {{raised their}} own revenue through a tax known as rates. Every property, whether {{residential}} or commercial, {{was given a}} rateable value which estimated the annual rent it <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in.</b> In the budgeting process the council would work out the total amount it needed to raise locally, and then divide it by the total rateable value within its boundaries to produce {{the proportion of the}} rateable value that each householder or business would have to pay. This proportion was known as 'the rate' for the year and the process was therefore known as 'setting a rate'.|$|E
25|$|Later, in {{the spring}} of '71, Captain William Meade <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> a pack train from Hazelton, and he would make many {{improvements}} on that trail. Despite the fact that these roads were built and improved during the rush years, the trip was still perilous and very costly. Steamer fare on the Fraser River on the Enterprise or the Victoria was $25 and 12.5 cents a pound was added for baggage. Smaller boats near the gold fields charged $7 for the ride and 7 cents a pound for baggage. At Takla Landing, yet more money was required, as that was a road toll that charged 18 cents a pound for baggage.|$|E
