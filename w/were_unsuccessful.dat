5|$|PC Magazine {{found that}} the {{firewall}} put all ports in stealth mode. The firewall blocked ten of 12 leak tests, used to see if malware can evade the firewall's control of network traffic.

Another test was conducted using Core Impact, which successfully exploited one vulnerability on the test computer. However, other components of Norton stopped the exploit from causing harm. The other attempts <b>were</b> <b>unsuccessful</b> either because the system was invulnerable or Norton's Intrusion Prevention System stopped it. Attempts to disable the firewall <b>were</b> <b>unsuccessful</b> by PC Magazine. On the contrary, PC Pro identified 15 open ports on a computer with Norton installed.|$|E
