5|$|Although the Earth is {{the only}} body within the solar system known to support life, {{evidence}} suggests that {{in the distant past}} the planet Mars possessed bodies of liquid <b>water</b> <b>on</b> the surface. For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.|$|E
5|$|Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder {{mentioned}} that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow and many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen {{was involved in}} the process, both in wood and in glow-worms. It was not until the late nineteenth century that bioluminescence was properly investigated. The phenomenon is widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments where dinoflagellates cause phosphorescence in the surface layers of <b>water.</b> <b>On</b> land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.|$|E

5|$|Fishing {{industry}} is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded by <b>water</b> <b>on</b> all sides.

5|$|In 2005, radar data {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} large quantities of water ice at the poles and at mid-latitudes.

5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{wrote that}} some Han thinkers {{believed}} that rain {{fell from the}} Heavens (i.e. where the stars were located). Wang argued that, although rain fell from above, this common theory was false. He agreed with another theory that stated clouds were formed by the evaporation of <b>water</b> <b>on</b> earth, and that since clouds disperse rain, clouds and rain are in fact one and the same; in essence, he accurately described the water cycle.|$|E

The Panhandles were about to punt, but it was blocked. The ball landed in the end zone, and a Panhandle player landed on the ball. According to the Youngstown Vindicator, the football's {{condition}} was damaged due to the <b>water</b> <b>on</b> the field and several fumbles occurred throughout the game.|$|E

Fireworks were being discharged {{at the other end of}} the village. All that remained were burnt beams and smouldering walls, which were apparently made of old fen-mud. The villagers saved the nearby Three Horseshoes public house, by forming a bucket chain, and pouring <b>water</b> <b>on</b> its thatched roof.|$|E
5|$|Rain is {{liquid water}} {{in the form of}} {{droplets}} that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then becomes heavy enough to fall under gravity. Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh <b>water</b> <b>on</b> the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.|$|E
