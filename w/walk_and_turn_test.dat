40|$|Rationale The Standardised Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs), {{designed}} and validated to assess impairment associated with alcohol intoxication, {{are currently being}} employed by the Victoria Police (Australia) for the identification of driving impairment associated with drugs other than alcohol. Objectives The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether the SFSTs are a sensitive measure for identifying the presence of dexamphetamine and methamphetamine. Methods Three studies each employed a repeated-measures, counterbalanced, double-blind placebo-controlled design. In each study, 20 healthy volunteers completed two treatment conditions: either 0. 42 mg/kg d,l-dexamphetamine and placebo, 0. 42 mg/kg d,l-methamphetamine and placebo, or 0. 42 mg/kg d-methamphetamine and placebo. Performance was assessed using the SFSTs, consisting of the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test, the <b>Walk</b> <b>and</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>test,</b> and the One Leg Stand test. Blood and saliva samples were obtained before and immediately after the administration of the SFSTs (120 and 170 min post drug administration). Results At 120 and 170 min post drug administration, d,l-dexamphetamine blood levels were 83. 16 and 98. 42 ng/ml, respectively; d,l-methamphetamine levels were 90 and 95 ng/ml, respectively; and d-methamphetamine blood levels were 72 and 67 ng/ml, respectively. None of the three amphetamine doses impaired performance on the SFSTs. Using the SFSTs, the presence of dexamphetamine was identified in 5 % of cases, d-methamphetamine in 5 %, and d,l-methamphetamine in 0 % of cases. Conclusions Under these conditions, the SFSTs are not a sensitive measure for detecting the presence of low levels of amphetamine...|$|E
40|$|Road {{fatalities}} {{related to}} marijuana intoxication have steadily {{increased over the}} last 10 years (Drummer, 1994; Drummer, 1998; Drummer & Gerostamoulos, 1999). This {{has led to the}} introduction of sobriety testing in Victoria, Australia to test for driving impairment caused by marijuana and other psychotropic drugs. Surveys have reported an increase in community concern in Australia over the use of marijuana and an increase in the prevalence and use of marijuana (National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Survey; 1985, 1988, 1991, 1993; National Drug Household Survey; 1995, 1998). Commensurate with the increase in the use of marijuana in society, road statistics indicated that the number of road accidents and deaths involving the presence of THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) in driver specimens has also increased (Drummer & Gerostamoulos, 1999). Consistent with these mortality statistics, past research examining the effects of THC on driving ability indicate that THC impairs both car control (Moskowitz, 1985), and the maintenance of the lateral position of a vehicle (Ramaekers et al., 2000). Intoxication by THC is more likely to result in the crashing into obstacles on a driving course than when not intoxicated (Hansteen et al., 1976). These findings indicate that marijuana impairs driving ability and since the prevalence of marijuana use is increasing this poses a significant risk on our roads. It is essential therefore, that a tool that detects levels of THC in drivers, similar to breath analysis instruments used for the detection of alcohol in drivers, is introduced. To date, there is no such reliable instrument, that could be used on the roadside, and that accurately measures the level of THC in humans. For this reason, some government departments have considered the use of sobriety tests to detect impaired driving. In particular, the Standardised Field Sobriety test (SFSTs) that comprises the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test (HGN), <b>Walk</b> <b>and</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>test</b> (WAT) and the One Leg Stand test (OLS) were implemented in Victoria, Australia from December 1 st 2000. The validity of these tests have been previously examined by other researchers and their conclusions suggest that sobriety tests have a varied accuracy in detecting impairment caused by drugs, ranging from 44 % to 94 % (Heishman et al., 1996; Compton, 1986). The present study examines the efficiency of sobriety tests to detect impairment in driving caused by marijuana. The SFSTs were examined, as well as the Romberg Balance test (RB) and the Finger to Nose test (FTN) taken from the Drug Evaluation and Classification Program (DECP) (Los Angeles Police Department, USA). The present study was conducted by Swinburne University, Victoria, Australia. The National Institute on Drug Abuse in the USA (NIDA) provided the marijuana cigarettes. The major objectives of the study were to examine the influence of cannabis on driving performance and on performance on the sobriety tests. The relationship between simulated driving performance and sobriety test performance was then examined to establish the accuracy of sobriety tests to predict driving ability. The present study also examined whether any differences in performance either on the driving tests or on the sobriety tests exist between regular cannabis users and non-regular cannabis users. Driving stress was an additional variable assessed to establish whether individuals with low, normal or high driver stress perform differently on the driving task after the consumption of a low and high dose of cannabis. We tested 40 participants comprising 14 females and 26 males. All participants completed a medical examination questionnaire, demographics questionnaire, Frequency of Cannabis Use Questionnaire and Intoxication Rating Questionnaire. All participants completed 3 marijuana sessions involving the administration of a placebo cigarette (0 % THC, weight 702 mg,. 000 gm &#x 2206;- 9 -THC; 0. 0 mg/kg THC), the administration of a low THC cigarette (1. 74 % THC, weight 779 mg,. 813 gm &#x 2206;- 9 -THC; 0. 2 mg/kg THC) and the administration of a high THC marijuana cigarette (2. 93 % THC, weight 790 mg, 1. 776 gm &#x 2206;- 9 -THC; 0. 73 mg/kg THC). All sessions were randomised (using Latin-square design), counter-balanced and double-blind. In each session, participants completed 3 sobriety tests and 2 driving simulator tests. Sobriety tests were scored by allocating a score of 1 for each sign (error, e. g., hopping during test performance to maintain balance) observed by the administrator. Generally, a score of 2 or more constituted impairment to a degree equivalent to a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) above 0. 10 %. The driving simulator test comprised 36 variables. Each time the participant performed an error, a loading factor was added to the corresponding variable (e. g., collision (variable) loading factor is 10, if a collision occurred twice a score of 20 was allocated to this variable). The sum of all 36 variables constituted the level of overall driving impairment. Blood samples were taken throughout each session approximately 20 minutes apart. Intoxication Rating Questionnaires revealed that participants reported that the subjective effect of placebo cigarettes was much weaker than the cigarettes that they usually smoke and that no psychological (such as time distortion) and physiological (such as increased heart rate) changes were experienced. For the low THC cigarettes most participants described the strength, and the effects, as similar to cannabis that they usually smoke. The high THC cigarette was described by most participants as being much stronger, and having some different symptoms, when compared to cannabis that they usually smoked. There were however, some differences in the description of the low THC and the high THC cannabis cigarettes between regular and non-regular cannabis users. Regular users reported that the high THC cigarette was more similar to the cannabis that they usually smoke, whereas non-regular users stated that this was more likely to be the case for the low THC cigarette. Results from the driving simulator task revealed that THC impaired the driving variables: 'traddling the solid line' and 'straddling the barrier line'. The results indicated that increasing levels of THC increasingly impaired the ability to maintain the steady position of a vehicle within the correct traffic lane. The consumption of low and high doses of THC resulted in two or more wheels of the vehicle moving over a solid line marked out for traffic moving in the opposite direction. Low and high doses of THC also resulted in two or more wheels of the vehicle moving over a broken/barrier line marked out for traffic moving in the same direction. Increasing levels of THC appear to impair both balance and attention required to control the position of a vehicle in traffic. These results are consistent with past research that indicates that THC impairs car control (Moskowitz, 1985) and increases the standard deviation of the lateral position of a vehicle (Smiley et al., 1981; Ramaekers et al., 2000). Research into the effects of THC on brain cannabinoid receptors indicate that THC interferes with normal functioning of the cerebellum, the brain region responsible for balance, posture, and the coordination of movement (Childers & Breivogel, 1998). When driving ability was impaired the level of THC in the blood was between 3 and 5 ng/ml. These findings are consistent with previous research that has reported that driving is maximally impaired by THC plasma levels of 13 ng/ml (approximately 8 ng/ml in blood, using a multiplication factor of 1. 6 (Giroud, et al., 2001) (Berghaus et al., 1995). The {{results of the present study}} also indicated that THC impairs performance on sobriety tests with more individuals impaired with increasing levels of THC (e. g., at Time 1; placebo: 2. 5 %, low THC: 23. 1 %, and high THC: 46. 2 %). Performances on the sobriety tests RB and FTN were unrelated to the level of THC. The test most related to the level of THC was the OLS test, where almost all signs of this test were observed, after the consumption of both low and high THC cigarettes. The accuracy of a 'new' sign in the scoring procedure of the HGN test: head moves/jerks (HMJ) was also identified. Including HMJ increased the percentage of individuals scored as impaired after the consumption of low and high THC cigarettes (e. g., at Time 1; placebo: 2. 5 %, low THC: 38. 5 % and high THC: 56. 4 %). Including HMJ as a sign significantly improved the accuracy of the SFSTs to detect impairment associated with the level of THC. The mean level of THC in the blood, when the highest number of participants were classified as impaired, was 70 ng/ml. Differences in performance were observed between regular cannabis users and nonregular cannabis users. Non-regular cannabis users were more impaired on the driving simulator task after the consumption of low and high levels of THC when compared to regular users. Non-regular users recorded significantly longer RTs to emergency situations, more collisions, and shorter distances between the vehicle and an object (after an emergency stop) when compared to regular cannabis users. Signs exhibited during sobriety test performance were related to the level of THC more often for nonregular users compared to regular users. The level of THC in the blood was higher in regular users, compared to non-regular users, at all times in both THC conditions. When driving ability was impaired and significantly related to the level of THC, the SFSTs were also related to level of THC. Sobriety test performance was related to driving impairment, because, as driving impairment increased with the level of THC, so did the number of signs present during the performance of the sobriety tests. Since nonregular users performed more poorly on the driving task compared to regular users, it is no surprise that they exhibited a larger number of signs during the sobriety testing. Although there was a positive linear relationship between driving ability and sobriety tests, such as the relationship between straddling barrier lines and the OLS test, the validity of sobriety tests to predict driving impairment in part depends upon the size of this relationship. Using performance on the SFSTs to assess 'impairment', 46. 7 % of individuals in the high THC condition were impaired. A discriminant analysis was performed to determine whether the remaining 53. 3 % of participants were also impaired but not classified as impaired, or whether the SFSTs correctly classified them as not impaired. The results indicated that the sobriety tests (SFSTs; HGN, WAT and OLS) correctly assessed 76. 3 % of participants in the high THC condition as either impaired on driving or not impaired on driving. Specifically, this percentage included the correct identification of 84 % of impaired drivers as impaired, but only 61. 5 % of unimpaired drivers as unimpaired. The best predictor of driving impairment was the OLS test. In the low THC condition the sobriety tests correctly classified 100 % of impaired drivers as impaired, but this occurred at the expense of falsely classifying most unimpaired drivers as also impaired. This finding suggests that sobriety tests detect the presence of THC even when driving is not impaired. Examining the utility of including the 'new' sign HMJ in the SFSTs indicated that when identifying impairment on the driving task performed at Time 2, in both the low and high THC condition, the SFSTs were a better predictor of driving impairment when HMJ was included than when the sign was not included. This finding suggests that the inclusion of HMJ in SFSTs scoring procedure increases the likelihood of detecting drivers who are impaired by THC. In conclusion, the results suggest that THC impairs driving ability by reducing one's ability to maintain a safe position in traffic. At this time THC blood levels are between 3 and 5 ng/ml. THC also impairs driving ability differently for non-regular and regular users of cannabis, where non-regular users are more impaired by THC than regular users. When this occurs, THC blood levels in non-regular users are between 2 and 12 ng/ml, and in regular users between 5 and 16 ng/ml. Performance on the sobriety tests is also impaired by increasing levels of THC. The OLS test is the most sensitive test in detecting the presence of THC. In the present study the SFST battery and each individual test that it comprises are moderate predictors of driving impairment but do misclassify 16 % of impaired individuals and 38. 5 % of not impaired individuals. In addition, the results suggest that sobriety tests are more sensitive to the presence of THC than actual driving impairment. This was revealed by the large number of individuals judged as impaired on driving in the low and high THC conditions even when driving was unaffected. It is important to note that when this occurred, the sobriety tests were accurate in detecting 100 % of impaired individuals. Finally, the introduction of the 'new' sign HMJ is likely to increase the accuracy of the SFSTs to detect individuals impaired by THC and this sign should be considered for inclusion by policing agencies...|$|E

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in awareness of the role of drugs other than alcohol in the causation of road accidents and deaths, with the most recent report indicating that 33 % of all Victorian (Australia) road fatalities are drug (other than alcohol) related (TAC, 2006). Currently in Victoria, one of the classes of drugs reported to be of most concern is the amphetamines. The epidemiological driving literature highlights a possible association between amphetamine use and road crashes. However, since the cognitive research generally indicates cognitive enhancing properties following amphetamine consumption, it remains unclear how amphetamines may be related to adverse driving. The present thesis was designed to explore this issue. In response to the increasing number of drug-related road fatalities, the Standardised Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs), designed and validated for the detection and assessment of impairment associated with alcohol intoxication, are currently being employed by the Victoria Police (Australia) for the identification of driving impairment associated with drugs other than alcohol. The present thesis was designed to evaluate whether the SFSTs are a sensitive measure for identifying impairment associated with a single acute therapeutic amphetamine dose. Furthermore, the accuracy of using the SFSTs to detect driving impairment associated with these amphetamine doses was also evaluated. The present thesis examined the effects of a single acute therapeutic dose of various amphetamine preparations, on simulated driving performance, driving-related cognitive processes (assessed using standard cognitive tasks and the electroencephalogram [EEG]), and performance on the SFSTs, in healthy, stimulant-using, non-fatigued adults. The present thesis consisted of five separate experiments. The first three experiments examined the effects of d-amphetamine, d,l-methamphetamine, and d-methamphetamine, on simulated driving performance, driving-related cognitive processes, and performance on the SFSTs. Experiment 4 and Experiment 5 assessed the effects of d-amphetamine and dmethamphetamine on visual and auditory cognitive processes using the EEG. These forms of amphetamines were selected as they are commonly used recreationally by young adult drivers, and occupationally by truck drivers. Experiment 1, Experiment 2, and Experiment 3 employed a repeated-measures, counterbalanced, double blind, placebo-controlled design. In each experiment, twenty different (i. e. 60 participants in total) healthy volunteers (10 males and 10 females) completed two treatment conditions i) placebo and ii) 0. 42 mg/kg amphetamine (~ 30 mg). Driving performance was assessed using a driving simulator task, which consisted of four driving tasks; 'freeway traffic driving' and 'city traffic driving' in both day and night conditions. Cognitive performance was assessed using a range of computer and pen and paper tasks designed to assess attention, psychomotor performance, and perceptual speed. Specifically, the tasks were: the Digit Span Test; a Digit Vigilance task; a Movement Estimation Task; the Digit Symbol Substitution Test; a Tracking Task; the Trail-Making Test; and the Inspection Time task. SFSTs performance was assessed using the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) <b>test,</b> the <b>Walk</b> <b>and</b> <b>Turn</b> (WAT) <b>test,</b> <b>and</b> the One Leg Stand (OLS) test. Three blood and saliva samples were obtained throughout all experimental sessions (120, 170, and 240 minutes after drug administration). The results indicated that 0. 42 mg/kg d-amphetamine significantly impaired simulated driving performance, in recreational stimulant users, 2 - 3 hours post-drug administration, when mean blood amphetamine concentrations were approximately 90 ng/mL. No significant driving decrements were observed following d,l-methamphetamine or dmethamphetamine, when methamphetamine blood concentrations were 90 ng/mL and 70 ng/mL, respectively. There were only few driving behaviours that were found to be significantly reduced with d-amphetamine, such as reductions in signalling adherence and driving too fast for the traffic conditions. However, during all three amphetamine conditions, drivers travelled at a slower speed on the freeway at the time that an emergency situation occurred, relative to the placebo condition. It was argued that either this may result from more cautious driving, or that the reduction in speed acted as a compensatory mechanism to permit drivers to attend to other aspects of driving. Overall, the present results indicate that a therapeutic dose of amphetamine does not produce considerable impairment to driving, as only minimal amphetamine effects were observed on driving performance. In terms of cognitive performance, the results indicated that a therapeutic dose of various amphetamines has minimal effect on driving-related cognitive functioning, with some significant improvements noted in aspects of attention, psychomotor functioning and perceptual speed. This is consistent with the failure to identify significant driving impairments, described above, following a similar dose. However, the ability to perceive and predict motion and estimate 'time to contact', assessed using a movement estimation task, was affected following d-amphetamine and d-methamphetamine consumption. In terms of performance on the SFSTs, the present thesis demonstrated that following the administration of low-level d-amphetamine, d,l-methamphetamine, and dmethamphetamine, performance on the SFSTs was not impaired. Using the SFSTs, impairment associated with low dose d-amphetamine was identified in only 5 % of cases, dmethamphetamine in 5 % of cases, and d,l-methamphetamine in 0 % of cases. These findings indicate that the degree of impairment produced with the low amphetamine dosing conditions was below the threshold of sensitivity of the SFSTs. However, as significant impairments in driving were not observed with amphetamines, the present SFSTs findings highlight that these tests are unlikely to produce false positive results during police drug evaluation procedures for amphetamine-related impairments. Experiment 4 and Experiment 5 similarly employed a repeated-measures, counterbalanced, double blind, placebo-controlled design. In each experiment, twenty healthy volunteers (10 males and 10 females) completed two treatment conditions i) placebo and ii) 0. 42 mg/kg amphetamine (~ 30 mg). Tasks designed to assess visual and auditory cognitive functions relevant to driving were administered. Specifically, these processes were: divergent visual system pathways (magnocellular and parvocellular pathways); aspects of visual field processing (central and peripheral visual fields); mismatch negativity (MMN); prepulse inhibition (PPI); selective attention; resource allocation; and speed of processing. Two blood and saliva samples were obtained throughout all experimental session (120 and 200 minutes after drug administration). d-amphetamine and d-methamphetamine generally improved cognitive functioning, as assessed with visual and auditory ERP indices. Specifically, the results demonstrated that a low-level acute dose of d-amphetamine and d-methamphetamine improved early processing of visual information (indexed by improvements to the P 100 component for the magnocellular and parvocellular visual pathways). In addition, d-methamphetamine improved the speed at which visual information was evaluated and processed (indexed by decreases in P 300 latency), which was consistent with d-methamphetamine-related improvements in reaction time. There was a trend for d-amphetamine to improve the speed that changes in auditory stimulation were automatically detected (indexed by decreases in MMN latency). In addition, d-methamphetamine improved the ability to automatically 'screen out' irrelevant and intrusive auditory information (indexed by increases in PPI of the startle response). d-amphetamine was found to improve the speed at which auditory information was evaluated and processed (indexed by decreases in P 300 latency), which was substantiated with corresponding improvements in reaction time and accuracy. Although amphetamines were generally shown to enhance ERP indices, a trend was found for d-amphetamine to differentially affect different regions of the visual field, in terms of selective attention. Specifically, there was a trend-level indication that d-amphetamine improved indices of selective attention (denoted by increases in N 200 amplitude) for information presented centrally, but impaired indices of selective attention (denoted by decreases in N 200 amplitude) for information presented in the periphery. Although impairments to the peripheral visual field were not similarly observed with dmethamphetamine, decrements to indices of selective attention (denoted by decreases in N 200 amplitude) were also found with d-methamphetamine during the auditory oddball task. In terms of driving, these results suggest that drivers dosed with low-level amphetamine may not selectively attend to and discriminate changes within the traffic environment, although further research is required to confirm this. In conclusion, the present thesis has demonstrated that a single acute therapeutic dose of amphetamine produces minimal and inconsistent effects to driving. However, some (inconsistent) evidence was found that suggests that there may be mild impairments such as decreased ability to perceive and predict motion, tunnel vision effects, and decrements to selective attention. In addition, the present thesis highlights that at therapeutic doses, amphetamines do not impair SFSTs performance, which is in accordance with the failure to identify substantive amphetamine-related decrements to driving and cognitive functioning observed in the present thesis...|$|R

The changes observed in the angular displacement of the ankle in the frontal plane during step turn, when compared to straight walk, showed the importance of the IE rotation during turning.|$|R

40|$|A basic {{control system}} was {{developed}} for the electric model tractor, which was manufactured {{for the purpose of}} simulating the running energy of the agricultural tractor. This control system consists of a micro-computer (Z- 80 CPU), digital I/O ports, AD converters, DA converters, and others. In this paper, the control method which uses no feedback to the CPU was employed, and the control program was constructed take account of the safe starting and stopping of the tractor. Then, using the control system as developed, basic running <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>tests</b> of the model tractor were carried out. As a result of the tests, {{it became clear that the}} control system satisfies the fundamental requirements. However, the driving motor control system should be studied more carefully in the future...|$|R
50|$|His popular jazz dance act (called by {{some the}} “Jewish Charleston”) was a choreographed series of shuffles, camel <b>walks</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns.</b> It was usually {{performed}} to Darktown Strutters’ Ball. It, {{or at least}} a minute or so of it, {{can be seen in the}} film Atlantic City (1944). He typically wore a derby hat, and had a king-sized cigar in his mouth as he danced. He often performed in front of a backing danceline of beautiful women wearing leotards, short jackets and bowler hats—and “puffing” on big prop cigars.Frisco was a compulsive gambler and spent many afternoons while in New York City at the track with actor Jay C. Flippen, playwright Jerry Devine, actor Martin Gabel (husband of Arlene Francis) and Danny Lavezzo (owner of P. J. Clarke's), and when he began to incorporate stand-up comedy into his act, his humor revolved on tales about his bad luck gambling, speakeasies, and his constant state of debt.|$|R
