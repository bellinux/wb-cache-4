500|$|The win {{marked the}} second time in {{franchise}} history that the Bears won their first two games after trailing in the fourth quarter, the first being in 1971. During halftime, the team honored the 1963 Bears, two days following the death of running back Rick Casares, who was the team's leading rusher until Walter Payton surpassed him. When asked about Casares, defensive end Ed O'Bradovich stated, [...] "Oh my God, I think <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to my fellow teammates over here, what was all right, true and good about professional football was embodied in Rick Casares. Nobody loved the game more than him." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} her {{perspective on}} her music, Chana identified it as [...] "trop-electro-hip-pop". She followed this up by explaining: [...] "The definition of pop has become looser, more inclusive. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about pop, you're basically {{talking about a}} hook, a melody that catches your attention." [...] She said {{that she wanted to}} make the material both easily accessible, as well as artistic, clarifying that she never set out to make music as experimental as that of Björk. She experimented with Caribbean music after developing an interest in it while studying African-American dance and music in the Dominican Republic. When asked about how her music is received, Chana responded that various Latin communities responded to it differently as they had different definitions of mainstream and underground music.|$|E
2500|$|In his defense, many of Paul's {{supporters}} {{noted that}} Nelson Linder, {{president of the}} Austin, Texas chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), speaking outside of his official capacity as {{an officer of the}} NAACP, had spoken favorably of Paul in radio interviews. Just days after The New Republic article was published, Linder {{said in an interview that}} he had been acquainted with Paul for 20 years and felt Paul was “a very honorable guy” whose libertarian positions were being misunderstood by a lot of people. “e's got some very good ideas. But I think the problem is, from an African-American perspective, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about state vs. Federal power.... <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about states' rights and the Confederacy, and those kinds of things, sometimes it gets taken out of context.... you attract people sometimes who are still fighting the Civil War.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, Pregulman and {{his wife}} were given Chattanooga's top philanthropist honor at the 10th Annual National Philanthropy Day Luncheon and Award presentation, for their varied efforts since moving to Chattanooga in 1957. [...] After his wife spoke, Pregulman told the attendees: [...] "Helen (his wife) comes by charity work very honestly. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about philanthropy and {{community}} there's no need to write them down on paper, the words come from the heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 2, 2009, {{the day of}} Pacquiao's {{fight against}} Ricky Hatton, Mayweather {{announced}} that he was coming out of retirement and would fight Juan Manuel Márquez, The Ring lightweight champion and number 2 pound-for-pound fighter, on July 18, 2009, in a welterweight non-title fight. Marquez had previously fought Pacquiao in two controversial outings: they fought to a twelve-round draw on May 8, 2004, and Pacquiao was awarded a twelve-round split decision win on March 15, 2008. Mayweather played down Pacquiao's newfound stardom at his press conference, stating: [...] "If he wins tonight, don't be all shocked ... Cause guess what? I beat (Hatton) when he was undefeated. Pacquiao beat Oscar, it don't matter. Going down to 147 pounds was too much for (De La Hoya), he was dead after the first round.... <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> boxing, you talk Floyd Mayweather." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{graduated}} from Lancashire's Academy, 2005 was Cross' first {{year with the}} senior squad. Lancashire's veteran wicket-keeper Hegg was impressed by Cross, and said [...] "He has a really good work ethic, and he listens <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about the game. He's the one in line to take over from me." [...] Cross made hist first-class debut on 25 May 2005, along with Steven Croft and Tom Smith in a match against Oxford University. He batted just once in the match, scoring two runs, although he dismissed five batsmen, one by stumping and four caught. His second opportunity to play first-class cricket came in the last match of the season; with Lancashire's stalwart Warren Hegg injured, Cross was given the responsibility of taking over as wicket-keeper. Playing in the County Championship for the [...] first time, according to The Wisden Cricketer Cross [...] "showed enough pure technique to deserve his chance to develop". Although Hegg retired {{at the end of}} the season, Lancashire quickly signed experienced wicket-keeper Luke Sutton from Derbyshire, hampering Cross' chances to regularly play first-team cricket. In the 2005/06 Australian cricket season, Cross travelled to the southern hemisphere to play for St Kilda Cricket Club in the Victorian Premier Cricket. He spent most of the season playing for the club's second team.|$|E

2500|$|Small in stature, {{he lacked}} the overall power of his larger {{competitors}} such as Don Budge and Kramer but made up for it with brains, ball control, and speed. A master court strategist and tactician, he worked his opponent out of position and scored points with the game's best drop shot and lob as well as punishing ground strokes that let him come to the net for put-away shots. [...] Kramer, {{one of the very}} few players who was undeniably better than Riggs, writes that there is a major [...] "misconception" [...] about Riggs. [...] "He didn't play some rinky-dink Harold Solomon style, pitty-pattying the ball around on dirt. [...] He didn't have the big serve, but he made up for it with some sneaky first serves and as fine a second serve as I had seen at that time. [...] <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about depth and accuracy both, Riggs' second serve ranks with the other three best that I ever saw: von Cramm's, Gonzales's, and Newcombe's." [...] In his own autobiography, Riggs wrote, [...] "In the 1946 match with Budge , I charged the net at every opportunity. [...] Employing what I called my secret weapon, a hard first serve, I attacked constantly during my 6–3, 6–1, 6–1 victory." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 10, 2006, Ali was {{endorsed}} by The Washington Post which one county political veteran ranked as only behind that of the Democratic Party for its influence on local voters. The Post said “Political newcomer Saqib Ali has shown good command of issues and would bring new vigor to this district's delegation.” [...] On September Sept. 20, 2006, it was announced Ali had won the Democratic primary in Maryland's 39th Legislative District, defeating incumbent Delegate Joan F. Stern {{for a position on}} the slate with Del's Nancy J. King and Charles E. Barkley for the November general election. Stern had lost the outright endorsement of King and Barkley as she was not seen as a team-player. King noted that [...] "Ali was a 'breath of fresh air' to voters", while political veteran Gene Counihan said [...] "As far as I could see, he followed the book on how to win an election. I saw him on the campaign trail more than anybody. He was out door-to-door; he had impressive literature. He wanted it." [...] Ali ascribed his electoral victory to connecting with voters. [...] "Our campaign had a lot of energy. It had that underdog feel that struck a chord with people and resonated. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to real voters, not the insiders, they care if you pay attention to them. They remember that you listened to them. People appreciate new blood." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's all plain enough, now. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> about {{notching}} {{ears and}} slitting noses I judged {{that that was}} your own embellishment, because white men don't take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a different matter altogether." ...|$|R
