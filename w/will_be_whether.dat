25|$|Following {{the events}} of the season two finale, Vincent and Catherine can finally expose their {{relationship}} to the world. Vincent and Catherine will be living as a couple, but the challenge this season <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>whether</b> they can keep outside forces from tearing them apart. Season three will have a stronger focus on family, with Heather Chandler being a more prominent character and the viewers being introduced to two of Catherine's aunts. The show's costume designer Catherine Ashton announced via Twitter that the third season will reportedly end with some closure and a big cliffhanger.|$|E
25|$|The {{global warming}} {{controversy}} concerns {{the public debate}} over whether global warming is occurring, how much has occurred in modern times, what has caused it, what its effects <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> <b>whether</b> any action {{should be taken to}} curb it, and if so what that action should be. In the scientific literature, there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view, though a few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions. Disputes over the key scientific facts of global warming are more prevalent in the media than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the United States than globally.|$|E
25|$|To {{explore a}} male {{strategic}} point of view, proponents of FCC make a simple model of alternative strategies. Female A uses cosmetics {{as part of}} her ritual coalition whenever one of them menstruates; Female B and all her female neighbors use no cosmetics. Male A is prepared to work/invest to gain access; Male B tries a philanderer strategy, moving to the next cycling fertile female, neglecting the previous partner once she is pregnant. Very quickly, Male A will end up working/doing bride-service for Female A's coalition, since he has no competition from Male B. Male A gains regular fitness as a result. Male B will pair up with Female B, but is then liable to abandon her if he finds a new cycling female. She then has little support during pregnancy/breastfeeding. The question <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>whether</b> Male B gains sufficient fitness via a roving strategy of picking up cycling, non-cosmetic females. If Male A is not able to compete with Male B in terms of dominance, he is better off choosing the cosmetic females. Because Female B and her non-cosmetic female neighbors get the attentions, but no reliable investment, from Male B, they discourage any investment from the likes of Male A. Once costs of encephalization begin to bite and cooperative strategies are needed to support offspring, how many females will be choosing philanderers in preference to investors? Those females {{are not likely to be}} ancestors of large-brained hominins like ourselves or the Neanderthals.|$|E

But I have little hope of being allowed to spend the four first months of any year in England; and the question <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> <b>Whether</b> to go at once to Italy, by way of Germany and Switzerland, with my family, or to settle with them in England, perhaps at Hastings, and go abroad myself when it may be necessary. I cannot decide till I return; but I think the latter the most probable.|$|E

60|$|We do {{not seek}} the struggle, we have our work to do; {{but if it is}} to come, it could never come better than now. Never again perhaps, {{certainly}} not for many years, will such an opportunity be presented to the British democracy. Never will the ground be more favourable; never will the issues be more clearly or more vividly defined. Those issues <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>whether</b> the new taxation, which is admitted on all sides to be necessary, shall be imposed upon luxuries, superfluities, and monopolies, or upon the prime necessaries of life; whether you shall put your tax upon the unearned increment on land or upon the daily bread of labour; whether the policy of constructive social reform on which we are embarked, and which expands and deepens as we advance, shall be carried through and given a fair chance, or whether it shall be brought to a dead stop and all the energies and attention of the State devoted to Jingo armaments and senseless foreign adventure. And, lastly, the issue <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>whether</b> the British people in the year of grace 1909 are going to be ruled through a representative Assembly, elected by six or seven millions of voters, about which almost every one in the country, man or woman, has a chance of being consulted, or whether they are going to allow themselves to be dictated to and domineered over by a minute minority of titled persons, who represent nobody, who are answerable to nobody, and who only scurry up to London to vote in their party interests, in their class interests, and in their own interests.|$|E
60|$|Then the {{question}} <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> <b>whether</b> {{we are to}} defer putting ourselves into a posture for the common defence, either by armament, or negotiation, or both, until Spain is actually attacked,--that is, whether our court will take a decided part for Spain, whilst Spain, on her side, is yet in a condition to act with whatever degree of vigor she may have, whilst that vigor is yet unexhausted,--or whether we shall connect ourselves with her broken fortunes, after she shall have received material blows, and when we shall have the whole slow length of that always unwieldy and ill-constructed, and then wounded and crippled body, to drag after us, rather than to aid us. Whilst our disposition is uncertain, Spain will not dare to put herself {{in such a state}} of defence as will make her hostility formidable or her neutrality respectable.|$|E
6000|$|But {{it is not}} so for all. What then? His will be done, as done {{it surely}} <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> <b>whether</b> we humble {{ourselves}} to resignation or not. The impulse of creation forwards it; the strength of powers, seen and unseen, has its fulfilment in charge. Proof of a life to come must be given. In fire and in blood, if needful, must that proof be written. In fire and in blood do we trace the record throughout nature. In fire and in blood does it cross our own experience. Sufferer, faint not through terror of this burning evidence. Tired wayfarer, gird up thy loins; look upward, march onward. Pilgrims and brother mourners, join in friendly company. Dark through the wilderness of this world stretches the way for most of us: equal and steady be our tread; be our cross our banner. For staff we have His promise, whose [...] "word is tried, whose way perfect:" [...] for present hope His providence, [...] "who gives the shield of salvation, whose gentleness makes great;" [...] for final home His bosom, who [...] "dwells in the height of Heaven;" [...] for crowning prize a glory, exceeding and eternal.

WE SHALL NOT DIE!" ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{court found}} that a person acting under threats of death or bodily harm can in some cases negate the mens rea {{component}} of an offence.

50|$|The basic {{structure}} {{here can be}} pertinent to a domestic service operating against a non-national group within its borders. Depending on the legal structure of the country, there may be significant, or very few, restrictions on domestic HUMINT. The most basic question <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>whether</b> criminal prosecution, or stopping operations, is the goal. Typically, criminal prosecution will be the primary goal against drug and slavery groups, with breaking up their operations the secondary goal. These priorities, however, are apt to reverse in dealing with terrorist groups.|$|E
