For all of his screaming {{and all of his}} darkness, he was just lovable." [...] "My Friends" [...] addressed more of Kiedis' own somber thoughts rather than those of [...] "his friends": [...] "My friends are so distressed/And standing on the brink of emptiness/No words I know of to express/This emptiness." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to feature flashbacks with Sayid, an Arab character. The {{producers}} knew they had to tread carefully with the character due to possible prejudices against Arabs. The actor, Naveen Andrews, said, [...] "we were all pretty nervous, in the sense that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> we owed a real obligation, not just to Iraqis but the entire Arab world about how this character would be played." [...] In an early draft of [...] "Solitary", Rousseau told Sayid that she and her research team were studying time. When ABC saw this draft, they asked the producers to remove this line, explaining that they did not want the show to venture into science fiction during the first season. The character of Sullivan, to whose medical woes Jack tended, was created to make the rest of the survivors think that Rousseau's team was killed by an illness. The idea for Hurley's golf course came from script coordinator Brent Fletcher; it was based on a miniature golf course he created in the offices for the television show Angel.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hidden Place" [...] was {{directed}} by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin and co-directed by M/M (Paris). It was shot in London over four days in February 2001. It was originally planned for a song from Selmasongs, but Björk felt the project was more appropriate for Vespertine. The video consists of close-up shots panning around Björk's face, as fluids flow {{in and out of}} her facial orifices. M/M (Paris) explained the concept behind the video:We always wanted to get as close to her as we could, as <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> she had never been portrayed as the [...] "real" [...] and beautiful woman she is. This is somehow taboo, to observe a pop star with no makeup from a distance of half an inch. Then the idea of the liquid works as a visualization of all possible emotions pulsating and circulating in her very busy brain. The loop idea was a main point for us as well, trying to extend the usual time frame of pop video super-fast editing, to make it hypnotising, mesmerising and irritating, like an eternally burning fireplace.|$|E

500|$|Staff writer Tracy Tormé was {{not pleased}} with the [...] "1940s tribal Africa" [...] theme of the aliens, and because the combat scene {{towards the end of}} the episode resembled the Kirk versus Spock fight in [...] episode [...] "Amok Time". Fellow Star Trek writer Maurice Hurley said that it was [...] "a good idea, but the {{execution}} just fell apart. Again, if you take that script and if the actors had been told to give it a different twist, that show would have been different. But it became too baroque and fell apart. But the concept of having a guy say 'I have to have somebody kill my wife and this is the person' is a good idea." [...] Some of the cast, including Jonathan Frakes, sought to prevent the episode from being re-aired. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2012, Patrick Stewart agreed with fans that considered the season 2 episode [...] "" [...] to be [...] "the first truly great episode of the series", stating that the first season [...] "had several quite weak episodes"; referring to [...] "Code of Honor" [...] in particular he said, [...] "I can think of one very early on that involved a race of black aliens that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> quite embarrassed about." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; {{no one even}} knew we were recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat. You have to let it morph and move and breathe." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E

Levy describes his political views as a teenager as typically mainstream. [...] "I was a full member of the nationalistic religious orgy.

It is an urgent priority to promote a safer and more wholesome environment, especially for young people.|$|R
5000|$|Goldie Foxx and Dyna Mink {{made the}} {{instrumental}} beats {{for all the}} tracks, while Chubby Cherry wrote the melodies and lyrics and performed the vocals. Cherry said the group had originally tried writing together in a studio, but later chose to work from a distance [...] "partly because the studio literally disappeared. <b>We</b> also <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> the urge {{to go to the}} other room and send each other stuff by email, which means {{we spend a lot of}} time getting lost between places." [...] Additional writing was done on [...] "Eros and Apollo" [...] by Chris Smith and [...] "Jenny" [...] by Rob Davis. Mixing was handled by James F.

2500|$|MacLachlan's {{reluctance}} {{was also}} {{caused by a}} decline of quality in the second season of the show. He said [...] "David and Mark [...] were only around for the first season... I think <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> a little abandoned. So I was fairly resentful when the film, Fire Walk with Me, came around." [...] Although he agreed {{to be in the}} film, MacLachlan wanted a smaller role, forcing Lynch and co-writer Robert Engels to rewrite the screenplay so that Teresa Banks's murder was investigated by Agent Chester Desmond and not by Cooper as originally planned. MacLachlan ended up working only five days on the movie.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the book}} Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests, Chevy Chase recalls being confronted by Murray shortly before an SNL {{broadcast}} in which Chase {{had returned to}} guest host. The issue, likely to do with Chase's insistence on doing the [...] "Weekend Update" [...] segment that had {{been taken over by}} Jane Curtin, led to Murray and Chase trading insults, with Murray telling Chase to go have sex with Jacqueline Carlin, Chase's wife at the time, while Chase commented that Murray's face looked [...] "like something Neil Armstrong had landed on." [...] The argument eventually turned physical. Murray later said of the incident, [...] "It was an Oedipal thing, a rupture. Because <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> mad he had left us, and somehow I was the anointed avenging angel, who had to speak for everyone. But Chevy and I are friends now. It’s all fine.” The two later starred together in Caddyshack in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|Confident in his skill, Mannock {{arrived in}} France on 31 March 1917 at 40 Squadron {{headquarters}} near Aire, Lens. He {{did not give}} his new squadron-mates a good first impression. On his first night he inadvertently {{sat down in the}} chair of a popular pilot killed that day and proceeded to ask pilots about their personal scores and offer, without invitation, his own views on air combat. Lieutenant Lionel Blaxland recalled; [...] "He seemed a boorish know-all, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> the quicker he got amongst the Huns the better; that would show him how little he knew." [...] Mannock flew the squadrons Nieuport 17 scout the following day. As the days passed, he preferred to remain airborne by virtue of his squadron's hostility. The public school boy-dominated squadron detested his [...] "gutter politics" [...] and mannerisms although Mannock was befriended by Irishman Lieutenant de Burgh, of the same ilk. Mannock would forge friendships with new pilots. George McElroy arrived in September and became Mannock's protégé.|$|E

6000|$|THE {{main purpose}} of this story is {{to appeal to the}} reader's {{interest}} in a subject which has been the theme of some of the greatest writers, living and dead--but which has never been, and can never be, exhausted, because it is a subject eternally interesting to all mankind. Here is one more book that depicts the struggle of a human creature, under those opposing influences of Good and Evil, which <b>we</b> have <b>all</b> <b>felt,</b> which <b>we</b> have <b>all</b> known. It has been my aim to make the character of [...] "Magdalen," [...] which personifies this struggle, a pathetic character even in its perversity and its error; and I have tried hard to attain this result by the least obtrusive and the least artificial of all means--by a resolute adherence throughout to the truth as it is in Nature. This design was no easy one to accomplish; and it has been a great encouragement to me (during the publication of my story in its periodical form) to know, on the authority of many readers, that the object which I had proposed to myself, I might, in some degree, consider as an object achieved.|$|R
6000|$|The Doctor, in his hey-day, {{had been}} cool over great things, but now, in his retirement, he was fussy over trifles. The {{man who had}} {{operated}} without the quiver of a finger, when not only his patient's life but his own reputation and future were at stake, was now shaken to the soul by a mislaid book or a careless maid. He remarked it himself, and knew the reason. [...] "When Mary was alive," [...] he would say, [...] "she stood {{between me and the}} little troubles. I could brace myself for the big ones. My girls are as good as girls can be, but who can know a man as his wife knows him?" [...] Then his memory would conjure up a tuft of brown hair and a single white, thin hand over a coverlet, and he would feel, as <b>we</b> have <b>all</b> <b>felt,</b> that if <b>we</b> do not live and know each other after death, then indeed we are tricked and betrayed by all the highest hopes and subtlest intuitions of our nature.|$|R
2500|$|Subsequent to {{the band}} {{recording}} the instrumental album, {{it was announced that}} Rossetti had recently recovered from a disorder affecting his voice and would indeed contribute vocals to Pelagial. [...] Some editions of the album include a second disc featuring the all-instrumental version of Pelagial with an alternate mix. Guitarist Jona Nido later explained the band's reversal: [...] "Loïc is the frontman of this band and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>felt</b> that The Ocean and this album needed him... I'm glad we decided to record vocals in the end, because it really adds a new dimension to the album that was not there before." [...] Staps later said that Rossetti's vocal health was [...] "part of the reason we decided to have it instrumental originally". [...] He confirmed that part of the logic for releasing both the vocal and instrumental versions of the album was that the band can shift to an instrumental configuration for live performances if Rossetti's health problems return.|$|E

2500|$|For Daredevil's red suit, {{introduced}} {{at the end}} of the first season, Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on Daredevil comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which lead to the use of rivets and [...] "architectural" [...] shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists higlighted certain areas with red, with [...] "deeper portions" [...] in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, [...] "because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor's face is going to be doing something else". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by Andy Park, [...] "There was a discussion early in the process, because Charlie Cox [...] Chris Brewster are both right handed, of having the billy clubs holster on the right leg. But Daredevil wears those billy clubs on the left hand side.
