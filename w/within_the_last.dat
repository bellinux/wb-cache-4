5|$|Due to the {{characteristically}} intermittent eruptions {{of active}} volcanoes such as Lassen Peak, {{there is some}} threat from the volcanoes of the LVNP.

Pyroclastic flows and lahars could easily occur near glaciated areas and in river valleys like Hat Creek Valley. In addition to the volcanic hazards that could possibly occur, one volcano did erupt in the 20th century in LVNP: (Lassen Peak). Lassen's eruptions (1914-21, though most activity occurred between 1914-17) were very small compared to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 20th century {{to at least}} the mid-1980s, {{educational}} policies in Mexico focused on the hispanicization (castellanización) of indigenous communities, teaching only Spanish and discouraging the use of indigenous languages.

Even so, Nahuatl is still spoken by well over a million people, of whom around 10% are monolingual.
