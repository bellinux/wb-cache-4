5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Philipp {{attended}} the 4. Volksschule (Pestalozzischule—4th elementary school) in Meissen. Philipp {{was a very}} good student. His mother understood that education was essential to Philipp's future. She <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to raise the funds to pay for higher education in order to send Philipp to a Gymnasium (secondary school). In 1927, she managed to have Philipp admitted to the Franziskaneum in Meissen, the Realgymnasium—a secondary school built on the mid-level Realschule to achieve the Abitur (university entry qualification)—in Meissen. Alma, desperate to secure her son's schooling, wrote to the city council of Meissen in 1932 asking if the school fees could be waived.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} was {{illustrated}} with paintings by the Swiss artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm, engraved by W. Angus and aquatinted. Grimm {{had lived in}} England since 1768, and was quite a famous artist, costing 2½ guineas per week. In the event, he stayed in Selborne for 28 days, and White recorded that he <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> on 24 of them. White also described Grimm's method, which was to sketch the landscape in lead pencil, then {{to put in the}} shading, and finally to add a light wash of watercolour. The illustrations were engraved (signed at lower right) by a variety of engravers including William Angus and Peter Mazell.|$|E

5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, as it seems to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
5|$|The mounted police {{initially}} deployed with 310 {{horses in}} 1873, both as mounts and as draught animals, but {{large numbers of}} these died on the march, and {{for much of the}} 1870s there were shortages of horses, impacting on the police's work. The importance of horses to the force's work grew, particularly once the new patrol system was introduced by Commissioner Herchmer. By the 1880s the police's horses were looked after carefully and given good veterinarian support, although they were <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard.</b> A large riding school was built in Regina at a cost of $30,000 in 1886 to allow training throughout the cold winter months. At their peak {{towards the end of the}} century, the force owned around 800 horses, and needed to purchase 100 new mounts each year. The police initially used a wide range of saddlery, mostly of the British Army's Universal pattern, but this was found to be unsuitable for the prairies. After some experimentation, the force settled on the Western, or Californian, style of saddle in the 1880s, which was more comfortable for both the rider and horse.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} speculated {{that the reason for}} this was because Vince McMahon did not want the WWF to look weak while {{fighting}} the Alliance, as he <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to put down his competition, especially WCW.

25|$|After the Sarajevo assassination, {{more than}} 30 {{citizens}} of Bečkerek were accused by the Austria-Hungary’s authorities of high treason. Among them was Dr. Emil Gavrila, who together with Svetozar Miletić and Jaša Tomić, <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> {{on the cultural}} and social strengthening of Serbs. The Serbs recruited in the Austria-Hungary’s army began soon to desert, {{so that they would}} not fight against their own people. 7000 of them formed volunteer detachments (people were from Banat and Srem) at the Eastern front and fought at Dobruja, but 79 of them fought on the Salonice front, too.|$|E
25|$|The medieval Baldrick was {{probably}} the only Baldrick of the four who could really be described as clever. Baldrick, an ex-dung shoveller (a respected position, which he had <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to get – earlier jobs include milking pigs and mucking out lepers) and Son of Robin the Dung Gatherer, first met Prince Edmund at the feast before the Battle of Bosworth Field and using flattery became his Squire. The two, along with Lord Percy, toasted their new friendship, unaware that from that point onwards, their descendants' lives would be eternally entwined.|$|E
25|$|Such {{a massive}} and {{difficult}} iron and charcoal making operation need a massive and hardened workforce. The furnace alone needed {{as many as}} sixty people {{working around the clock}} in twelve-hour shifts. The iron works support staff included a company clerk, a host of teamsters, woodcutters, the colliers, farmers and household servants. There was a wide gap between the classes. Workers were housed in small homes and <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for low wages. The owners and supervisors of the furnace lived in mansions with sizable servant staffs. Historians have likened life at the furnace to life in a feudal barony.|$|E

25|$|However, Clark {{remained}} belligerent in his {{attacks on}} the Trudeau government, angrily clashing with the prime minister in Parliament. He hired experienced staffers such as Lowell Murray, Duncan Edmonds, and William Neville, who shaped his policies and ran his office efficiently. He improved his party's standing in national opinion polls. Clark <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> and gradually earned the respect of most people, including his own caucus, by presenting a series of well thought out speeches and questions in Parliament. He benefited when live television came to the House of Commons in 1977, allowing viewers {{to see that he}} was evolving into a real rival for Trudeau.|$|E
25|$|The F3000 race at the Birmingham Superprix {{was just}} as sunny as the two {{previous}} ones, there was a carnival atmosphere. But not certainly for Martin Donnelly as he {{got a lot of}} attention for wrong reasons. During the qualifying session after a spin at the Holts Corner, he abandoned his car, and watched with horror as Erico Cheli t-boned his car. His Eddie Jordan Racing team <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to get the Reynard car repaired, and thankfully he started the race with an incomplete livery. His team mate Jean Alesi fought throughout the race with Marco Apicella. It stayed that way at the end, with Alesi beating Apicella by a slender margin. Donnelly came back to finish third.|$|E
25|$|McLane {{moved to}} the U.S. Senate and served there from March 4, 1827 until April 29, 1829, when he resigned. Leading up to the presidential {{election}} of 1828, he <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> in a losing effort to win Delaware for Andrew Jackson. In doing so he completely cut his ties to the Claytons and the dominant political faction in the state. Clearly he would have little hope of reelection to the U.S. Senate or any future in Delaware politics. All his considerable hopes for a prestigious position rested with an appointment from the new president. But a former Federalist from an inconsequential opposition state {{would have to wait}} until Jackson met other obligations. Having failed {{to become a part of}} the initial cabinet, as he had hoped, McLane reluctantly accepted appointment as Minister to England, arranged by his friend Martin Van Buren, now U.S. Secretary of State.|$|E

25|$|After a {{few weeks}} Genie became much more {{responsive}} to other people, and shortly afterwards began paying attention to people speaking, but at first she remained mostly unexpressive and {{it was unclear whether}} she responded more to verbal or nonverbal stimuli. Shortly afterwards Genie showed clear responses to nonverbal signals, and her nonverbal communication skills quickly became exceptional. A month into her stay Genie started becoming sociable with familiar adults, first with Kent and soon after with other hospital staff. She was clearly happy when someone she knew visited and sometimes <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to get a person to stay, expressing disappointment if she failed; for no discernible reason, her greetings were far more energetic than her relatively mild unhappiness when people left. After the state dropped charges against Genie's mother she began visiting Genie twice a week, and {{over the course of a}} few months they steadily grew better at interacting with each other.|$|E
25|$|At Pisa Thomas <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> on his commission, {{sometimes}} 14 {{hours per}} day. The strain {{was too much}} for his wife, perhaps depressed also by her loss. She ran off with an Englishman, but later returned. The issue of adultery came up again. Violent accusations followed, indignantly repudiated; a diplomatic correspondence ensued, and a demand was made, and supported by the grand duke, for an apology, which the professor refused to make, preferring to lose his chair. He set out once more for Scotland, but was intercepted by the Florentine cardinal Luigi Capponi, who persuaded him to remain at Bologna as professor of Humanity. This was the most distinguished post in the most famous of continental universities, and Dempster was {{at the height of his}} fame. Though his Roman Antiquities and Scotia ilustrior had been placed on the Index pending correction, Pope Urban VIII made him a knight and gave him a pension.|$|E
25|$|Some of Genie's {{pronunciation}} {{rules and}} limitations were characteristic of typical General American English speakers, and her progress with learning to pronounce individual phonemes followed relatively normal patterns for a first-language learner, {{but many others}} were highly atypical. Her speech typically contained unusually extensive deletions and substitutions, including vowel reduction, neutralization, and consonant modifications, and she typically spoke in an extremely high-pitched and monotonic voice. Curtiss determined that, despite the unpredictability with which Genie applied many of her pronunciation rules, there were several clearly defined patterns in her speech. Some of Genie's pronunciation rules and phonological limitations were normal for General American English speakers, and she clearly limited the variability of her substitutions. Similar to young children, Genie's enunciation remained far better in imitation than in her own utterances. The scientists <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to strengthen Genie's voice and improve her articulation, but in her dissertation Curtiss wrote that Genie's speech was still extremely difficult to represent using standard IPA.|$|E

25|$|From his {{writings}} and {{the testimony of}} all who knew him, Ryelandt appears first and foremost as {{a man with a}} great sense of duty. Duty towards God above all: he was a deeply religious man, who tried to go to mass every day, who was knowledgeable about his religion, and who conceived of his music making as a religious duty. Duty towards his music: he was privileged in being able to devote himself exclusively to music, but he was highly conscious this was a privilege and <b>worked</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> both as a student of Tinel (who drove him hard) and as a composer. Towards his family: he was always extremely solicitous of his wife, but especially during her illness, when he would organize serenades for her as she could no longer attend concerts; he made time for his children, considering their education extremely important, and encouraging them; and he was “Bon-Papa Musique” for his grandchildren, for whom he played his Scènes Enfantines. Towards his students, whose work he corrected with respect instead of denigrating it, and who greatly appreciated his teaching qualities: “Even though he followed the classical method of teaching harmony and counterpoint …, you never had the impression that you were learning something boring,” wrote one of them.|$|E
