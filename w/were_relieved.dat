5|$|The Germans {{put in a}} {{determined}} counter-attack at dawn with a whole battalion, which was turned back after a stiff fight. That night, reinforcements were brought up from the 2nd Brigade, and {{early in the morning}} on 24 July the Germans opened up with a devastating artillery barrage.

Although initially some progress was made, the Germans {{managed to hold}} Orsonga throughout December amidst intense hand-to-hand fighting. Finally, the Māoris were withdrawn from the line {{on the night of}} 15/16 January 1944 when they <b>were</b> <b>relieved</b> by an Indian unit.

5|$|At 15:30 on 21 August the Battle for Hill 60 began. Charging {{straight}} at the hill, the regiment suffered sixty per cent casualties, among them Hutton in command. He was replaced by Major Hurst, from the 1st Squadron, and they succeeded in capturing the Turkish trench within fifteen minutes of going over the top. But {{on either side of}} them the rest of the attack had failed, leaving the regiment and the Otago Mounted Rifles isolated {{from the rest of the}} force. Not having the manpower to continue the assault, they were ordered to dig in and hold the position. They held on until 23 August when they <b>were</b> <b>relieved</b> by the Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings {{were heavily}} invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended {{the house and}} the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire, resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they <b>were</b> <b>relieved</b> by the 71st Highlanders, a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by Hugh Halkett's 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out {{until the end of the}} battle.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, many <b>were</b> <b>relieved</b> {{to have survived}} {{the worst of the}} Category4 hurricane; their {{complacency}} turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of information, as every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days. Because Iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island, communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers. Though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed, many Kauai citizens insisted on paying. In addition, entertainers from all of Hawaii, including Graham Nash (who owns a home on the north shore of Kauaʻi) and the Honolulu Symphony, provided free concerts to the victims.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the incident, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and USAF conducted an investigation, the results of which were released on 19 October 2007.

As a result, four USAF commanders <b>were</b> <b>relieved</b> of their commands, numerous other USAF personnel were disciplined or decertified to perform certain types of sensitive duties, and further cruise missile transport missions from—and nuclear weapons operations at—Minot Air Force Base were suspended. In addition, the USAF issued new nuclear weapons handling instructions and procedures.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Pact, the Scandinavian countries and Finland <b>were</b> <b>relieved.</b> The Germans and Soviets were now allies, and there was no German threat against the Soviet Union. But shortly afterwards, Germany invaded Poland and Great Britain and France declared war against Germany. Next, the Soviets invaded eastern Poland, and later Moscow requested that the Baltic states allow the establishment of Soviet military bases and the stationing of troops on their soil. The government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum, signing the corresponding agreement in September, while Latvia and Lithuania followed suit in October.|$|E

There they established observation posts to monitor Turkish activity, remaining until they <b>were</b> <b>relieved</b> on 30 June.|$|E
5|$|Most Germans <b>were</b> <b>relieved</b> {{that the}} {{conflicts}} and street fighting of the Weimar era had ended. They were deluged with propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels, who promised peace and plenty for {{all in a}} united, Marxist-free country without {{the constraints of the}} Versailles Treaty. The first major Nazi concentration camp, initially for political prisoners, was opened at Dachau in 1933. Hundreds of camps of varying size and function were created {{by the end of the}} war. Upon seizing power, the Nazis took repressive measures against their political opposition and rapidly began the comprehensive marginalisation of persons they considered socially undesirable. Under the guise of combating the Communist threat, the National Socialists secured immense power. Above all, their campaign against Jews living in Germany gained momentum.|$|E
