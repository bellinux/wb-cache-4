25|$|The {{juvenile}} {{golden eagle}} {{is similar to}} the adult but tends to be darker, appearing black on the back especially in East Asia. Compared to adults, juveniles have a more unfaded color. Young birds are white for about two-thirds of their tail length ending with a broad, black terminal band. Occasionally, juvenile eagles have white patches on the remiges at the bases of the inner primaries and the outer secondaries, forming a crescent marking on the wings which tend to be divided by darker feathers. Rarely, juvenile birds may have only trace amounts of white on the tail. Compared to the relatively consistently white tail, the white patches on the wing are extremely variable and some juveniles have almost no white visible. Juveniles of less than 12 months of age tend to have the most extensive amount of white to the plumage. By their second summer, the <b>white</b> <b>underwing</b> coverts are usually replaced by a characteristic rusty-brown color. By the third summer, the upper-wing coverts are largely replaced by dark brown feathers, however not all feathers moult at once giving many juvenile birds a grizzled pattern. The tail also follows a similar pattern of maturation. Due to the amount of variability in different individuals, juvenile eagles cannot be reliably aged on sight alone. Many golden eagles still have white on the tail during their first attempt at nesting. The final adult plumage is not fully attained until the birds are between 5 and a half and 6 and a half years old.|$|E
500|$|The {{nostrils}} are not {{divided by}} a septum, but rather are perforate; {{from the side}} one can see through the beak. The wings are broad but relatively short. The bases of the primary feathers are white, producing a white patch {{on the underside of}} the wing's edge, which is visible in flight. The tail is short and square, barely reaching past the edge of the folded wings. The subspecies differ in size according to Bergmann's Rule, and the amount of <b>white</b> <b>underwing</b> coloration also varies.|$|E

Other plumages resemble those of the smaller lesser frigatebird, but have whiter bellies and longer <b>white</b> <b>underwing</b> spurs.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic yellow-nosed {{albatross}} averages 81 cm in length. It is {{a typical}} black and white mollymawk with a grey head and large eye patch, and its nape and hindneck are white. Its bill is black with a yellow culminicorn and a pink tip. It has a blackish grey saddle, tail and upperwing, and its underparts are predominantly <b>white.</b> Its <b>underwing</b> and primaries show a narrow black margin. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} adult but with a white head and black bill. It can be differentiated from the Indian yellow-nosed by its darker head. Relative to other mollymawks it can be distinguished by its smaller size (the wings being particularly narrow) and the thin black edging to the underwing, The grey-headed albatross has a similar grey head but more extensive and less well defined black markings {{around the edge of the}} underwing. Salvin's albatross also has a grey head but has much broader wings, a pale bill and even narrower black borders to the underwing.|$|R
50|$|The white-throated swallow is 14-17 cm long. It has glossy {{dark blue}} upperparts {{and a bright}} {{chestnut}} crown. A dark blue-black breast band separates the white throat from the greyish <b>white</b> underparts and <b>underwing</b> coverts. The upper wings, underwing flight feathers and forked tail are blackish-blue, but the undertail has white patches near the feather tips. The white throat and blackish breast band are distinctions from similar Hirundo species. The outer feathers are slightly longer in the male than the female. Juveniles are duller than the adult, with shorter outer tail feathers and a browner crown. The call {{is a mix of}} warbles and twitters.|$|R
50|$|The Caucasian grouse is a {{sedentary}} species, breeding in the Caucasus and Pontic Mountains {{of northeast}} Turkey on open slopes with low Rhododendron or other scrubs but in proximity to deciduous broad-leaf forest. These bird {{have a group}} display or lek in May and June. Unlike the male Eurasian black grouse, the Caucasian grouse display is almost mute but for a thin whistling of the cock fluttering his wings as he leaps and turns in the air, producing a flash of <b>white</b> as the <b>underwing</b> feathers are briefly revealed. The hen lays up to ten eggs in a ground scrape and takes all responsibility for nesting and caring for the chicks, as is typical with gamebirds.|$|R
50|$|White-shouldered tanagers are 14 cm {{long and}} weigh 14 g. They are long-tailed {{and with a}} mostly black stout pointed bill. The adult male is glossy black, apart from <b>white</b> <b>underwing</b> coverts and a {{conspicuous}} white shoulder patch. The shoulder patch is the most obvious difference from the similar but larger white-lined tanager, in which the smaller white area is rarely visible except in flight.|$|E
50|$|The trumpeter {{hornbill}} (Bycanistes bucinator) is a medium-sized hornbill, with length between 58 and 65 cm, {{characterized by a}} large grey casque on the bill, smaller in females. The eyes are brown or red, with pink surrounding skin. Body mass is between 0.45 and 1 kg. It is similar to silvery-cheeked hornbill. Distinguishing features include an all-black back, white belly and <b>white</b> <b>underwing</b> coverts (in flight, wings present white tips), and red facial skin.|$|E
50|$|The adult rufous-winged buzzard is 38-43 cm long. It has a grey {{head and}} underparts, with some {{streaking}} on the crown, neck and breast. The {{rest of the}} upperparts are rufous grey, and the uppertail is bright rufous. In flight, from above it shows rufous-chestnut flight feathers and the rufous uppertail, and from below it has a grey body, <b>white</b> <b>underwing</b> coverts, and greyish flight feathers and undertail. The juvenile is duller and browner, with a brown-grey head and white supercilium.|$|E
50|$|The Indian yellow-nosed {{albatross}} weighs 2.55 kg, is 76 cm {{long and}} is 2 m across the wings. The adult has a pale grey or white head and nape, {{with a dark}} grey mantle, upperwing, and tail. Its rump and underparts are <b>white,</b> and its <b>underwing</b> is <b>white</b> with a black tip with a narrow black margin at the leading edge. Its bill is black with a yellow upper ridge and a red tip. The juvenile has a white head and all black bill. It is difficult to distinguish from the closely related grey-headed albatross and Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross, the latter with which it was long considered conspecific and is still considered by some a subspecies of. It can be distinguished from the Atlantic yellow-nosed by its head, the grey plumage of which is lighter on the Indian yellow-nosed.|$|R
50|$|It has a {{total length}} of 44 - 55 cm, with the Australian {{subspecies}} larger than subspecies from New Guinea and nearby islands. The plumage is overall <b>white,</b> while the <b>underwing</b> and -tail are tinged yellow. The expressive crest is yellow. The bill is black, the legs are grey, and the eye-ring is whitish. Males typically have almost black eyes, whereas the females {{have a more}} red or brown eye, but this requires optimum viewing conditions to be seen. The differences between the subspecies are subtle. C. g. fitzroyi {{is similar to the}} nominate race but lacks the yellow on the ear tufts and has slightly blueish skin around the eye. C. g. eleonora is similar to C. g. fitzroyi but is smaller and has broader feathers in the crest, and C. g. triton is similar to C. g. eleonora except it has a smaller bill.|$|R
500|$|This hawk is a medium-sized, slender {{species with}} short, rounded wings and a long, rounded tail. It is [...] long, with the tail {{contributing}} [...] The wingspan is [...] across. The adult of the nominate subspecies, Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis, has a blackish-brown crown and upper neck while {{the sides of}} the neck and a broad collar are a dark rufous-brown. The feathers {{on the top of the}} head are slightly pointed, giving this species a hint of a crest. The remaining upperparts are a dark chocolate brown. The cheeks are light brown while the throat is buffy white with streaks. The eyes are large and dark brown or grey in females and yellow in males while the beak is short but deep. It also has a black median streak. The bird's underparts are white with variable amounts of rufous wash and a number of large, round blackish spots. The serpent eagle's thighs are barred sepia-brown and white, while the undertail is <b>white.</b> The <b>underwing</b> is largely <b>white</b> with some black spots and brown coloration. The tail is light brown, with five to six broad black bars. The claws are short and sharp, while the legs are yellow. Sexes are similar, though the female averages about three percent larger than the male. Immatures have a white crown and mantle, while the upper back has rounded brown or black spots that vanish as the bird ages. The wings and tail are greyish-brown and paler than those of the adults and are more darkly barred.|$|R
50|$|When {{circling}} overhead, the <b>white</b> <b>underwing</b> of {{the bird}} becomes conspicuous. In its flight, behaviour, and voice, which {{is more of a}} dovecot coo than the phrase of the wood pigeon, it is a typical pigeon. Although it is a relatively strong flier, it also glides frequently, holding its wings in a very pronounced V shape as it does. Though fields are visited for grain and green food, it is often not plentiful enough as to be a viewed as pest.|$|E
50|$|However, the lores are dark, {{creating}} a dark stripe {{through the eye}} (the stripe does not extend through the eye in mangrove kingfisher), and the underwing, primaries and secondaries are black with <b>white</b> <b>underwing</b> coverts (there is a black carpal patch on the white coverts in mangrove kingfisher). The inner webs of {{the base of the}} flight feathers are white, {{creating a}}n indistinct white wingbar (white completely absent from wings in mangrove kingfisher). The breast is white (tends to be much greyer in mangrove kingfisher). The sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults and have a brown bill.|$|E
50|$|The {{nostrils}} are not {{divided by}} a septum, but rather are perforate; {{from the side}} one can see through the beak. The wings are broad but relatively short. The bases of the primary feathers are white, producing a white patch {{on the underside of}} the wing's edge, which is visible in flight. The tail is short and square, barely reaching past the edge of the folded wings. The subspecies differ in size according to Bergmann's Rule, and the amount of <b>white</b> <b>underwing</b> coloration also varies. As it probably forms a cline over its entire range, the species is often considered monotypic.|$|E
50|$|The adult {{crowned eagle}} is quite strikingly plumaged. Its crown is dark to rufous-tinged brown with a prominent, oft-raised black-tipped double crest, which {{can give the}} head a {{somewhat}} triangular appearance. The upperparts of an adult are a blackish brown-grey color, with a variable tinge of blue. The throat is brown while the belly and breast are white overlaid densely with blackish bars and blotches, variably marked with cream or rich buff-rufous coloration. The wing primaries are white at the base, broadly tipped with black and crossed by two black bars. The tail is black with brownish-grey bands. The thighs and legs are barred and closely spotted with black and <b>white.</b> The <b>underwing</b> coverts of adults are a bold chestnut coloration, spotted lightly with black. The adult crowned eagle has eyes that can range from yellow to almost white, a cere and feet of an ochre-yellow color and black talons. In the wild, misidentification of an adult is improbable thanks to the species' bearing and voice. The strongly barred outer wings and tail are all diagnostic in flight. Further simplifying identification, details such as the crest, the bird's upright perching posture and large size are unique to this animal. While they do differ somewhat in size, the genders' sexual dimorphism by size is relatively modest and eagles {{are unlikely to be}} sexed by this alone. However, the male may be distinguished by his more rapid wing beats (4 or 5 per second) from the more sluggish female (3 or 4 per second).|$|R

5000|$|B. b. yenisseensis (Buturlin, 1911)- Known as {{the eastern}} Siberian eagle-owl. This race {{is found in}} central Siberia from about the Ob eastward to Lake Baikal, north to about latitudes 580 to 590 N on the Yenisei River, south to the Altai, Tarbagatai and the Saur Mountain ranges and in Tannu Tuva and Khangai Mountains in northwestern Mongolia, grading into B. b. sibiricus near Tomsk {{in the west and}} into B. b. ussuriensis in the east of {{northern}} Mongolia. The zone of intergradations with the latter in Mongolia seems to be quite extensive, with intermediate eagle-owls being especially prevalent around the Tuul River Valley, resulting in owls intermediate in coloration between B. b. yenisseensis and B. b. ussuriensis. B. b. yenisseensis is a large race, with wing chord lengths of 435 - 470 mm in males and 473 - 518 mm in females. B. b. yenisseensis is typically much darker with more yellowish ground colour than B. b. sibiricus. It does have a similar amount of dazzling <b>white</b> on its <b>underwing</b> as does sibiricus. It is buffy-greyish overall with well-expressed dark patterning on the upper-parts and around the head. The underside is overall pale greyish with black streaking.|$|R
