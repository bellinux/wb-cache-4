5|$|Communications on {{the island}} failed due to the winds; the entire island was left without power and phone service. The winds greatly damaged 715power poles and 513transformers, leaving about $52million in {{electrical}} damage reported (2002USD, $ USD). The local weather office's communication link was cut off after flooding damaged a telecommunication facility, causing the National Weather Service in Honolulu, Hawaii, to provide backup support by temporarily issuing warnings and advisories. Many anemometers near the northern coastline failed from the winds. The winds collapsed several walls at the Guam Memorial Hospital, resulting in major damage throughout the northern two-thirds of the facility and several units being shut down. Several hotels, churches, and schools received moderate damage, and the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport received damage to navigation equipment. Typhoon Pongsona also left 65% of the island's <b>water</b> <b>wells</b> inoperable, with most of Guam left without water service following the storm. Officials estimate the typhoon destroyed 1,300homes, severely damaged 1,825, and lightly damaged 4,800.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{archaeologists have}} {{unearthed}} Han iron farming tools throughout China, from Inner Mongolia {{in the north}} to Yunnan in the south. The spade, shovel, pick, and plow were used for tillage, the hoe for weeding, the rake for loosening the soil, and the sickle for harvesting crops. Depending on their size, Han plows were driven by either one ox or two oxen. Oxen were also used to pull the three-legged iron seed drill (invented in Han China by the 2nd century BCE), which enabled farmers to plant seeds in precise rows instead of casting them out by hand. While artwork of the Wei (220–265 CE) and Jin (265–420 CE) periods show use of the harrow for breaking up chunks of soil after plowing, it perhaps first appeared in China during the Eastern Han (25–220 CE). Irrigation works for agriculture included the use of <b>water</b> <b>wells,</b> artificial ponds and embankments, dams, canals, and sluice gates.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The study {{centered}} {{on the effect of}} different qualities of water on concrete compressive strength. The concrete mix of M 20 grade with water cement ratio of 0. 5 were investigated. Water samples, such as tap <b>water,</b> waste <b>water,</b> <b>well</b> <b>water,</b> bore <b>well</b> <b>water</b> & mineral water (packed drinking water) were collected from various sources at college campus and were used to cast 150 mm concrete cubes. The cured cubes were crushed on 7 & 28 days for compressive strength estimation. The results showed that the compressive strength of the concrete cubes made with mineral <b>water,</b> tap <b>water,</b> <b>well</b> <b>water,</b> waste water increased with days & not having much variation in their compressive strength...|$|R

25|$|In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{issued an}} {{emergency}} order against Range Resources, {{stating that the}} company's drilling activities in Parker County, Texas had contaminated at least two residential drinking <b>water</b> <b>wells.</b> The company denied the allegations, and said the presence of methane {{was a result of}} naturally occurring migration, and had shown up in nearby <b>water</b> <b>wells</b> long before Range drilled its gas wells. However, after a January 2011 Texas Railroad Commission (TRRC) hearing, TRRC staff concluded that, based on chemical composition, the gas in the <b>water</b> <b>wells</b> came from the shallow Strawn Formation, rather than the deeper Barnett Shale, in which the Range wells were completed. They also concluded that pressure tests by Range showed mechanical integrity of the casing. EPA and the two homeowners were invited to present evidence at the TRRC hearing, but did not. In March 2012, the EPA dropped its order against Range.|$|E
