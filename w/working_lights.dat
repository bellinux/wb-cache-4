25|$|Lights: Each cave diver {{should have}} at least three {{independent}} sources of light. One is considered the primary and is intended for general use during the dive. The others are considered backup lights and may be lower powered as they are not intended for exploration. Each light must have an expected burn time of at least the planned duration of the dive. If any diver loses light function so that they have fewer than three <b>working</b> <b>lights,</b> protocol requires that the dive is turned for all members of the dive team and exit started immediately.|$|E
500|$|Balfour Castle dominates {{views of}} the {{southwest}} of the island and {{can be seen from}} the tower of St. Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall. The castle library features a secret passage hidden behind a false set of bookshelves. The Balfours escaped unwelcome visitors through this passageway, which leads to the conservatory door, enabling the butler to truthfully tell visitors that the Balfours were not in the house. Another feature of the castle is the stags' heads with gaslights at the tips of their antlers, although these are no longer used as <b>working</b> <b>lights.</b> The castle grounds feature deciduous woodland (now rare in Orkney) and [...] of walled gardens. Though built around an older structure that dates at least from the 18th century, the present castle was built in 1847, commissioned by Colonel David Balfour, and designed by Edinburgh architect David Bryce.|$|E

500|$|Third scale miniatures several {{meters in}} height {{were created to}} give the film the effect of realism, {{rather than relying on}} {{computer}} generated imagery (CGI). For the whaling station miniatures and life-sized sets, over 700 bags of artificial snow were used (roughly 15–20 tons). A 4.5-meter miniature of an icebreaker with <b>working</b> <b>lights</b> and a mechanical moving radar was created, costing almost $37,000 and taking 10 weeks to create. Visual effects producer Arthur Windus, claimed miniatures were beneficial in the filming process: [...] "With computer graphics, you need {{to spend a lot of}} time making it real. With a miniature, you shoot it and its there." [...] A scale 25-meter miniature of the whaling station was created in several months. It was designed so the model could be collapsed and then reconstructed, which proved beneficial for a six-second shot which required a re-shoot.|$|E

Smaller vehicles included the Isetta bubble car, the rare Meadows Frisky, the Fiat 500 and the Goggomobil. Also added were exotic sports cars such as the Aston Martin DB Mark III, Jensen 541, Daimler Dart SP250, and Bristol 406, along with more mundane models such as the Hillman Minx and Austin A40.|$|E
50|$|Lightning's {{paint scheme}} is {{nearly the same}} as it was in the first movie (his large {{lightning}} bolt is repainted dark red, and a smaller bolt is threaded through his number, and has only three sponsor stickers on either side), though it is modified for the World Grand Prix with green-tinted flames on the end of his large bolt and a Piston Cup logo on the hood instead of his usual Rust-Eze sponsor. His reflective lightning decals are removed, he has a different spoiler, and his sticker headlights and taillights are replaced with actual <b>working</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
