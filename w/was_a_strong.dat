In this paper, {{this problem is}} answered. The main conclusion is that if X <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Σ*-space and every point of X <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Gδ-set of X, then X <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> Σ-space. <b>As</b> a corollary, we have that a T 2 -space <b>is</b> <b>a</b> σ-space iff it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Σ*-space with a Gδ-diagonal.
