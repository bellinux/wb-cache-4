25|$|Among these trench-built solid-walled {{buildings}} were three that lay some distance {{west of the}} great hall, with the amphitheatrical structure Hope-Taylor {{referred to as the}} assembly-structure lying between them: a pair of rectangular buildings placed end to end with what {{appears to have been a}} <b>wattle</b> <b>fence</b> between them, and an associated building that Hope-Taylor interpreted as a kitchen. These three were the only buildings on the site oriented north-south rather than east-west, and were constructed at the same time as or shortly before the assembly-structure. They were destroyed along with the Great Enclosure around 633, after which a church was built at the east end of the site. The southern building of the pair Hope-Taylor was convinced was a temple. No pottery or other indications of normal domestic use were found in this building. Nor were scattered animal bones. The building had been constructed in two stages: the second was constructed around the first (which was one of the few buildings on the site not to have been burned down), using carefully finished carpentry and heavy buttresses similar to those of the great hall. Inside the inner wall, the trench had been left open or opened up to form a pit approximately 6 feet long and more than 1 foot wide, which was full of animal bones; these had been deposited in at least 9 layers and stacked against the wall above the pit after space ran out, and there were half again as many as were found elsewhere on the site. They were mostly bones of oxen, with an extremely high proportion of skulls, and evidently had mostly been slaughtered as young calves, when their meat would be tender, rather than either shortly after birth when male calves would be surplus to dairy farming or after reaching full growth and being usable as draft animals. There were three non-structural postholes from which the posts had been removed before the building was burned and demolished. In addition, outside the northwest corner of the building there was a pit 4 feet in depth in which a post had been placed; nothing was found here except unusually clayey soil compared to the rest of the site, and crushed animal teeth, probably from sheep or goats; numerous thin, pointed stakes had been driven into the ground around this feature. And south of the pit, on the west side of the building, were traces of the successive erection of at least four temporary huts. A smaller, similar set of traces lay to the west of the screen between that building and the one to the north. South of the temple building was a rectangular enclosure that appeared to have been unroofed. There was no door out to this area from the building; both buildings had doors on their two long, east and west sides. Finally, of the graves in the western cemetery area of the site, the northernmost 16 were grouped around the temple building; but no burials lay to the east of the enclosure, suggesting that was where the gate was. All but one body, a child who was buried doubled-over, were buried with their heads to the west. Hope-Taylor considered the burials associated with free-standing posts beside the building and pointed out that although the form of burialstretched out and without grave goodswould have been acceptable to Christians, the dating and association with the un-Christian building mean that at least some of the burials must have occurred during heathen times.|$|E

50|$|In Glasgow, Sp. Coll. Ferguson MS 6 (f. 220v), {{a couple}} {{depicted}} performing intercourse are hidden under a sheet {{and a blue}} bedspread. Their child is shown sleeping in a small rocking cradle, along with a young servant boy standing {{at the foot of}} the bed. At the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin MS Ger. Quatro. 848 (f. 30v), the related illustration has been defaced by being covered with a brown wash even though they appear to be covered to their waists by bed clothes. The child and young servant boy at the end of the bed were not damaged. This implies that the defacer was likely offended by the sexual nature of the scene. Another illustration in the Berlin manuscript (f. 18r), in which the couple makes love on a bed in a forest surrounded by a <b>wattle</b> <b>fence,</b> has also been defaced with wash, although not to the same degree as the image of the couple in bed.

5000|$|The hortus conclusus {{was one of}} {{a number}} of depictions of the Virgin in the late Middle Ages {{developed}} to be more informal and intimate than the traditional hieratic enthroned Virgin adopted from Byzantine icons, or the Coronation of the Virgin. The subject began as a specific metaphor for the Annunciation, but tended to develop into a relaxed sacra conversatione, with several figures beside the Virgin seated, and less specific associations. Germany and the Netherlands in the 15th century saw the peak popularity of this depiction of the Virgin, usually with Child, and very often a crowd of angels, saints and donors, in the garden - the garden by itself, to represent the Virgin, was much rarer. Often walls, or trellises close off the sides and rear, or it may be shown as open, except for raised banks, to a landscape beyond. Sometimes, as with a Gerard David's The Virgin and Child with Saints and Donor (Below) the garden is very fully depicted; at other times, as in engravings by Martin Schongauer, only a <b>wattle</b> <b>fence</b> and a few sprigs of grass serve to identify the theme. Italian painters typically also keep plants to a minimum, and do not have grass benches. A sub-variety of the theme was the German [...] "Madonna of the Roses", sometimes attempted in sculptured altarpieces. The image was rare in Orthodox icons, but there are at least some Russian examples.|$|E
5000|$|Fishing weir - In medieval Europe, large fishing weir {{structures}} were constructed from wood posts and <b>wattle</b> <b>fences.</b> 'V' shaped structures in rivers {{could be as}} long as 60 metres and worked by directing fish towards fish traps or nets.

50|$|A {{new series}} of bolder, more {{numerous}} attacks occurring in many of Kirov's localities began {{in the spring of}} 1945. On April 29, in the village of Golodayevshchina of the Rudakovskiy district, 17-year-old Maria Berdnikova was attacked by a wolf, concealed by thick vegetation, on a field some 50 meters from stables. When the girl's cries attracted a crowd, the wolf repeatedly picked her up, scaled a 1 meter high <b>wattle</b> <b>fence</b> and left her only after carrying her for 200 meters. As the villagers carried the girl off, the wolf followed them {{to the edge of the}} village, ignoring their cries and threatening gestures. The wolf approached the village several times that day, and carried off a lamb the day after. The official who investigated the incident was G.P Kamenskiy, who postulated that the wolf's daring behaviour was likely explained by the complete absence of hunters or rifles in the village, as arm bearers and firearms had been called to the Eastern front. On May 1, in the Mamaevschchina village of the Vasilkovskiy locality, 7-year-old Volodya Gorev was grabbed on the throat by a wolf and carried toward a forest. He was released only after a villager fired a shot, and survived the ordeal as his neck had been protected by a thick scarf. Later, in the village of Shiriaevo of the Nemskiy district, 5-year-old Pimma Molchanova was grabbed by a wolf while washing rubber boots with a friend by a rivulet. A rescue party discovered the girl's body 500 meters away from the rivulet with a throat bite and a partially eaten leg.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the history}} of gardens the High Medieval hortus conclusus {{typically}} had a well or fountain at the center, bearing its usual symbolic freight (see [...] "Fountain of Life") {{in addition to its}} practical uses. The convention of four paths that divided the square enclosure into quadrants, was so strong that the pattern was employed even where the paths led nowhere. All medieval gardens were enclosed, protecting the private precinct from public intrusion, whether by folk or by stray animals. The enclosure might be as simple as woven <b>wattle</b> <b>fencing</b> or of stout or decorative masonry; or it might be enclosed by trelliswork tunneled pathways in a secular garden or by an arcaded cloister, for communication or meditative pacing.|$|R
50|$|From a {{utilitarian}} standpoint, {{vegetable and}} herb gardens helped provide both alimentary and medicinal crops, {{which could be}} used to feed or treat the monks and, in some cases, the outside community. As detailed in the plans for St. Gall, these gardens were laid out in rectangular plots, with narrow paths between them to facilitate collection of yields. Often these beds were surrounded with <b>wattle</b> <b>fencing</b> to prevent animals from entry. In the kitchen gardens, fennel, cabbage, onion, garlic, leeks, radishes, and parsnips might be grown, as well as peas, lentils and beans if space allowed for them. The infirmary gardens could contain Rosa gallica ("The Apothecary Rose"), savory, costmary, fenugreek, rosemary, peppermint, rue, iris, sage, bergamot, mint, lovage, fennel and cumin, amongst other herbs.|$|R

50|$|The four {{walkways}} of the Bonnefont cloisters surround {{a medieval}} herb garden. The Bonnefont cloisters are a composite {{from a number}} of monasteries from the region, in large part from a late 12th century Cistercian abbey at Bonnefont-en-Comminges, southwest of Toulouse in southern France. The abbey was intact until at least 1807, when it was documented. By the 1850s, all of its architectural features had been removed, and could be found in the surrounding areas, decorating public and private buildings. Today the cloisters contain twenty-one double capitals, surrounding a garden that contains many typical features of the medieval period, including a centralwellhead, raised flower beds, and <b>fences</b> lined with <b>wattle</b> <b>fences.</b> The marbles are highly ornate and decorated; some contain two registers, some with grotesque figures.|$|R

50|$|Some of humans' {{earliest}} manufactured items {{may have}} been made from willow. A fishing net made from willow dates back to 8300 BC. Basic crafts, such as baskets, fish traps, <b>wattle</b> <b>fences</b> and <b>wattle</b> and daub house walls, were often woven from osiers or withies (rod-like willow shoots, often grown in coppices). One of the forms of Welsh coracle boat traditionally uses willow in the framework. Thin or split willow rods can be woven into wicker, which also has a long history. The relatively pliable willow {{is less likely to}} split while being woven than many other woods, and can be bent around sharp corners in basketry. Willow wood is also used in the manufacture of boxes, brooms, cricket bats, cradle boards, chairs and other furniture, dolls, flutes, poles, sweat lodges, toys, turnery, tool handles, veneer, wands and whistles. In addition, tannin, fibre, paper, rope and string can be produced from the wood. Willow is also used in the manufacture of double basses for backs, sides and linings, and in making splines and blocks for bass repair.|$|R

They also used astronomy to help in figuring {{the best time of}} year to plant their gardens as well as the best time to harvest. Concerning the structure of the gardens, they often were enclosed with fences, walls or hedges in order to protect them. Stone and brick walls were typically used by the wealthy, such as manors and monasteries. However, <b>wattle</b> <b>fences</b> were used by all classes and were {{the most common type of}} fence. They were made using local saplings and woven together. They were easily accessible and durable, and could even be used to make beds. Bushes were also used as fencing, as they provided both food and protection to the garden. Gardens were typically arranged to allow for visitors, and were constructed with pathways for easy access. [...] However, it was not uncommon for the gardens to outgrow the monastery walls, and many times the gardens extended outside of the monastery and would eventually include vineyards as well.|$|R

[...] All the Saxons who had left the camp were slain, their short battle-axes being unfit to cope with the heavy swords and long lances of their enemies; and taught by this success, William caused some of his troops to feign a flight, draw them beyond the rampart, turn on them, and cut them down.

The houses are scattered about under the tall cocoanuts, which, as you will see in the picture, appear to be trying to get out of the ground in which they are growing. This peculiar appearance is probably the result of the continual sweeping up of the village, and sometimes the people find it necessary to place <b>wattle</b> <b>fences</b> round the roots and fill in with the sweepings of the village. Here, unlike Nara, the houses are all separate, and neighbours are given rather a wide berth. Timoteo's house stands near the centre of the village inside a neat fence.

In Scots language the word 'Wynd' has been used since at least the 13th century to describe frequently winding, narrow streets or alleys which aptly describes the appearance of known deer hay winds and elricks and wynding would be the creation of narrow alleys or entrances. At Parkmoor the deer would naturally enter the Windy Gill to drink and could then be driven by men and hounds towards the deer hay wind. The area that was supposed by John Smith to be an Ancient British Stockade and the area later used as a bowling green may {{have been involved in the}} processing of the deer by comparison with the use of elricks.|$|R
40|$|The {{negative}} impacts which {{invasive alien species}} have on ecosystems are well documented but there is paucity of information on their impacts on rural communities. Due to ecological impacts that {{may be associated with}} Acacia dealbata invasions the Agricultural Research Council Plant Protection Institute is considering releasing a biocontrol agent for A. dealbata. The actual social impacts of A. dealbata invasion and control are likely to be related to its importance in rural livelihoods. This thesis reports on the perceptions and livelihood uses of A. dealbata in the Eastern Cape. Three study sites were assessed, Matatiele, Mount Fletcher and Maclear. The study involved 150 household surveys, one focus group discussion and one transect walk at each site, key informant interviews and frequent house visits to acquire reliable data. Results show that 100 % of households in the three sites use Silver Wattle extensively for firewood. In Matatiele 64 %, 72 % in Mount Fletcher and 84 % of households in Maclear use Silver <b>Wattle</b> for <b>fencing.</b> To carve tools 76 % in Matatiele, 76 % in Mount Fletcher and 84 % households in Maclear use Silver Wattle. For medicinal purposes 18 % in Matatiele, 20 % in Mount Fletcher and 16 % in Maclear use Silver Wattle, whilst 78 % in Matatiele, 80 % in Mount Fletcher and 80 % in Maclear use it for fodder purposes. Many respondents felt that Silver Wattle is too abundant within their areas such that it now has many {{negative impacts}} associated with it. Perceptions of local people towards A. dealbata are neither static nor uniform, but are influenced by time since the invasion and now abundance of the species. There are no alternatives which provide the same services provided by Silver Wattle. Benefits and constraints due to A. dealbata invasion are experienced by everyone irrespective of wealth and gender. In conclusion, Silver Wattle is a valuable resource to these rural communities, but increasing abundance is incurring high costs to grazing resources and landscape accessibility...|$|R
40|$|Restoration {{biology is}} a {{relatively}} new branch of biology and many restoration practices, while transferable, require some degree of tweaking. This is because the same plant ecosystem might be at different levels of ecological ruin and heavily influenced by everything from soil quality, to mountain aspect and sunshine levels, to fog-interception rates. Additionally, different plants of the same ecosystem might respond differently to varying treatments. The plants of this study are located on Santa Rosa Island, off the coast of Santa Barbara in Southern California. For the restoration at Soledad Ridge, the treatments include three combinations of drip-irrigation lines, erosion-control <b>wattles,</b> and fog-catching <b>fences.</b> For this study Coyote brush (Baccharis pilularis) and Purple-needle grass (Stipa pulchra) were assessed for growth. This was done by collecting applicable plant measurements (stem diameter, height, and canopy length and width) in 2017 and by both (1) comparing the numbers to measurements taken in 2016 and (2) comparing the differences among experimental treatments. The results show that B. pilularis does best in the fog fence treatment for all measurements, even after excluding casualties. Meanwhile, S. pulchra survivors do just as well in the wattle treatment as compared to the fog fence treatment after casualties are taken into account, but overall survivorship is better in the control treatment. This suggests that restoration of B. pilularis should include fog fences, but restoration of S. pulchra does not require additional measures beyond the control treatment of irrigation only...|$|R
40|$|Beginning in the 1800 s, {{sheep and}} cattle {{ranching}} have caused significant erosion and devegetation of Santa Rosa Island, Channel Islands National Park. In {{an effort to}} contain what little soil is left and rebuild the native chaparral, the Cloud Forest Restoration Project is testing erosion control structures such as <b>wattles,</b> leaf litter <b>fences</b> and silt dams. This summer a drip irrigation system was installed along with fog capturing fences to supply water to native plants transplanted near the erosion control structures. As the project has grown, more irrigation {{has been added to}} increase the area available for transplanting. This irrigation system varies in elevation, slope, and diameter and lengths of irrigation lines. Because this project is experimentally monitored, it is important that all the transplants obtain the same amount of water. To check the efficiency of this system, the flow rates of 1. 9 L/hr rated pressure-compensating emitters along ¾” diameter polyethylene irrigation tubing were checked. Flow rates were relatively consistent at 1. 53 L/hr, 1. 60 L/hr and 1. 59 L/hr for 1 / 3, 2 / 3 and the whole system turned on, respectively. Although one might expect the addition of more irrigation line and emitters to decrease water pressure and thus the flow rate of individual emitters, the flow rates of emitters were found to be unaffected, indicating the effectiveness of the pressure-compensation. However, the flow rates of emitters were consistently lower than their 1. 9 L/hr rating. In conclusion, the irrigation system is currently providing equal water to each of the transplants, but at a rate lower than expected...|$|R
40|$|Santa Rosa Island (SRI), part of Channel Islands National Park off {{the coast}} of Santa Barbara, is home to {{thousands}} of native and endemic flora and fauna. While full of unique island endemics, Santa Rosa Island has an extensive ranching history. A sheep and cattle ranching business was operated from the mid- 1800 s until 1998 and a deer and elk hunting operation ran until 2011. Together these operations led to extensive ecological degradation of the island ecosystem {{as a result of the}} grazing caused by ungulates. In December of 2015, the Cloud Forest Restoration Project began with the goal of restoring the island ecosystem through the initiation of active restoration techniques on a key ridgeline of the island, Soledad Ridge. Active restoration techniques and treatments include the installation of wattles for erosion control, fog fences to harvest water from fog, and the establishment of native plants. This study focuses on the impact of three different restoration treatments on the germination and survival of the endemic island scrub oak (Quercus pacifica). Island scrub oak seeds were collected in October of 2016 and planted on the restoration site in December of 2016. In July of 2017, an island scrub oak survey was conducted to determine the percentage of seedlings that successfully germinated and how the various restoration treatments impacted the germination rates. It was concluded that 646 of an estimated 3000 island scrub oak seedlings survived. There was a higher average percent of island scrub oak seedlings that successfully germinated under restoration treatments with either a <b>wattle</b> and/or fog <b>fences</b> in addition to an irrigation line. The next step of the study will be to focus on monitoring and measuring the overall growth of the establishment of the island scrub oak seedlings...|$|R
