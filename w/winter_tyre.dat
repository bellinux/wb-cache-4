40|$|To {{cope with}} winter weather conditions, {{potentially}} including snow and ice, {{it is common}} to use <b>winter</b> <b>tyres,</b> or "all-seasons" tyres assumed to be safe both in summer and winter. In some northern countries, <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> are mandatory. It is commonly assumed that <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> are noisier than normal tyres (here called summer <b>tyres)</b> and <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> equipped with studs are assumed to be extra noisy. This paper presents a study where noise and rolling resistance properties of <b>tyres</b> for <b>winter</b> conditions are compared to summer and all-season <b>tyres.</b> The <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> include types optimized for central European climate, tyres optimized for Nordic climate and tyres with studs. In total, approx. 50 car tyres have been tested. Noise properties have been measured with the CPX method and rolling resistance has been measured with a trailer method; all measurements made on two road surfaces; SMA 8 and DAC 16. Results indicate that <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> are not noisier than summer tyres; except for studded tyres. Despite high differences among individual tyres, rolling resistance is approximately similar among the main types; surprisingly including also studded tyres. An alarming result was that there was no correlation between measured values and values on the tyre labels. QC 20180201 </p...|$|R
30|$|Nordic <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> {{designed}} for snowy and icy driving conditions {{are widely used}} in many countries with wintry road conditions involving icy and snowy road surfaces (e.g. Finland, Canada, Norway, Russia and Sweden). Those tyres are either studded or unstudded. Unstudded Nordic <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> are allowed in many other countries as well, but total bans on studded tyres have been imposed in e.g. Germany, Japan and many states in the U.S. because of their negative environmental effects. There are also unstudded <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> designed specifically for central Europe; however, they are intended primarily for high speed and wet surfaces and not for icy and snowy road surfaces, and are therefore {{outside the scope of}} this study.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the grip of <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> on ice and snow deteriorates with age {{to such an extent that}} <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> above a certain age e. g. 10 years should be {{forbidden}} to use.

The results would also be of use for ordinary consumers as a guidance. This investigation that was carried out on wet smooth ice is the third of three part studies. The first was on smooth ice at - 3 °C and the second on rough ice at - 3 °C. They have been reported in VTI meddelande 923 and VTI notat 34 - 2003. The aim of the investigation is to investigate the correlation between ice grip of <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> and their age, tread depth and tread rubber hardness and for studded tyres also stud protrusion and stud force. The investigation comprises 23 studded and 42 non studded <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> and four summer tyres mainly of the in Sweden popular brands Gislaved, Michelin and Good Year, primarily of size 195 / 65 R 15. Most of the tyres had been driven in ordinary traffic and were manufactured from 1981 to 2003. A small number of new <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> were also tested.

All were radial tyres manufactured between 1981 and 2003. Most of the tyres had been driven in ordinary traffic. A small number of new <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> were also tested. As reference some new summer tyres were tested as well. The steering and braking performance of the tyres has been measured in a special climate controlled indoor high speed flat bed test facility developed by the VTI.

50|$|Cadence braking (or {{any other}} type of braking) will not help much on {{extremely}} slippery surfaces such as ice (in theory it would, but in practice the ice can be so slippery that it makes little difference—a <b>winter</b> <b>tyre</b> would make more difference). Also, on very loose surfaces, a quicker stop can be achieved by simply locking the wheels, causing a wedge of loose material to build up ahead of the wheels and create a substantial braking force. This is useful only when stopping in a straight line, because locking the wheels means all steering control would be lost. In such conditions, ABS actually increases the stopping distances. On poor surfaces, in the past, rally drivers timed the pulsing of brake application so as {{to take advantage of the}} load transfer as the vehicle pitches forwards and backwards in response to the initial braking effort. With modern, over-dampened, and stiffly sprung suspensions this is less likely to be effective.|$|E

With the 19-inch wheels (standard fit in most markets), the theme continues—the fronts are all 8.5J×19H2 ET42, and the rears are 11.0Jx19H2 ET50. 19-inch wheels for the <b>winter</b> <b>tyre</b> package have a ½" [...] narrower rear compared to the summer tyre wheel package. There is also a corresponding difference in tyre sizes—18's are 235/40 ZR18 95Y XL (eXtra Load) in front and 285/35 ZR18 101Y XL at the rear. For the 19-inch tyres, two different options are available—all fronts are 235/35 ZR19 91Y, and the rears are either 295/30 ZR19 100Y XL or 305/30 ZR19 102Y XL.

40|$|Abstract. Winter tyres {{must be able}} to {{cope with}} the {{slipperiness}} which occurs {{on the surface of the}} roads during winter. The slipperiness is generated by water vapour in the atmosphere, precipitating and transforming into a solid form i. e. in ice form, either directly or after refrigeration or cooling. Many experimental studies e. g. <b>winter</b> <b>tyre</b> tests have been carried out by many companies and authorities independently from each other to determine if there are any types of tyres which have the best grip on different road surface conditions in the winter. The purpose of this study is to compile, analyse, compare and evaluate the obtained results of some <b>winter</b> <b>tyre</b> tests which have been performed in Sweden during years 2007 - 2010. The study aims further to find out which types of these tyres are most appropriate as an asset and increase the traffic safety on Swedish winter roads. Both studded tyres and non-studded tyres, so-called friction tyres or all season tyres were used in the tests. The method of the study is partly based on a theoretical study by reviewing some literature in this area and furthermore studying some practical cases i. e. <b>winter</b> <b>tyre</b> tests. The results of the tests are given in tables and figures showing the function of different types of the studded and non-studded tyres on different road conditions. All test-tyres have been supplied by several tyre manufacturers. The stud...|$|E

40|$|Every {{winter in}} Sweden, winter roadways pose {{problems}} for heavy vehicles. Steep gradients {{can be difficult}} to pass when it is slippery, which has implications also for other traffic when congestion occurs. To reduce the problems it has been discussed whether to impose a legal requirement for <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> on drive axle for trucks. This papers presents test results of the available snow grip from test track measurements comparing different drive axle tyres. A summer tyre, together with three <b>winter</b> <b>tyres,</b> of which one was retreaded, were selected for tests. The results of the traction tests show that there can be a big difference in grip between <b>winter</b> and summer <b>tyres</b> on packed snow. The difference between the tyres, however, is strongly dependent {{on the nature of the}} snow surface, so it is difficult to give general values. Theoretical calculations show that a vehicle’s rolling resistance can have a major impact on a vehicles climbing ability. With a high rolling resistance, which may be the result of loose snow on the road, the difference between good and bad grip on the drive tyres becomes even more significant...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{investigated}} how tyres with different road grip affect the stability of passenger cars equipped with Electronic Stability Control (ESC) systems during winter road conditions. The introduction of ESC in passenger cars has been very positive for traffic safety. An ESC system's function is however dependent on forces between road and tyres. Thus, {{it is not clear}} how important the tyre road grip performance is for the ESC system to function properly. Field tests on ice with six different drivers were used for assessing how well an ESC system can help the driver in a specific critical situation during slippery road conditions, namely a sudden double lane change. Four different studless winter tyres were used in the study: one studless <b>winter</b> <b>tyre</b> for Nordic conditions, and three studless winter tyres for central European conditions. The specific tyres were chosen to represent a large difference of road grip on ice and snow, and <b>winter</b> <b>tyre</b> tests in the media served as a guide for picking out the tyres...|$|E
40|$|Particles from {{road and}} tire wear have {{in recent years}} {{come to the fore}} as an {{important}} and relatively unexplored contribution to air particulate pollution. Mechanically generated wear particles are relatively coarse (> 0. 5 microns), but in controlled trials in VTI's road simulator it has been found that an ultra-fine fraction (< 100 nm) of particles is formed from tyre and pavement wear. This project was initiated to identify the source of these nanoparticles. The results show that the nanoparticles of the size 30 - 50 nm occur only from tests with studded tyres. One of the two tested Nordic unstudded winter tyres produced an even finer particle fraction (< 10 nm), while the other unstudded <b>winter</b> <b>tyre</b> type did not give rise to nanoparticles. Tests with summer tyres did not result in the formation of nanoparticles. It is clear that the fine particle fraction contains higher relative concentrations of sulphur, which is present at relatively high levels in both bitumen and tyres. It is unclear whether the ultrafine particles formed from studded tyre wear of road pavement in the road simulator also occur in real traffic. If so, this may affect the assessment of health effects from different traffic related particle sources...|$|E
40|$|In {{the autumn}} of 2008, the Swedish Road Administration was {{commissioned}} by the Swedish Government to calculate the consequences of different reductions of studded tyre use. The commission, passed on to VTI, was required to determine: 1. The effects on road safety levels each a reduction would have 2. The changes in winter service standard required to alleviate any reduction in road safety levels 3. The estimated cost of such changes. VTI had just one month to complete the commission. Therefore, as {{there was no time}} for new studies. Existing models and data had to be used. Sales of European and Nordic stud-less winter tyres are distributed equally. Usage in traffic was therefore assumed to be equal as well. The estimated increase of accidents due to restrictions in the use of studded tyres is quite large, except in the event of studded tyres being banned in April. If everyone that does not use studded tyres selected the Nordic <b>winter</b> <b>tyre</b> available there would be a lower accident increase if the use of stud-less winter tyres is distributed equally. If restrictions on studded tyre use were introduced on the national road network, maintaining the accident numbers at existing level would require a completely change of winter service rather than changing up one standard class...|$|E
