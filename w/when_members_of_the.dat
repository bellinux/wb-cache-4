5|$|Dissatisfaction {{with this}} state of affairs {{continued}} to loom over Nerva's reign, and ultimately erupted into a crisis in October 97, <b>when</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage. He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians. Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair. Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor, and with this decision all but abdicated.|$|E

5|$|The Second Doctor {{was portrayed}} by Patrick Troughton, whose serials were more action-oriented {{than those of}} his predecessor. Additionally, after The Highlanders, stories {{moved away from the}} purely {{historical}} ones that featured during William Hartnell's tenure; instead, any historical tales also included a science fiction element. Patrick Troughton retained the role until the last episode of The War Games <b>when</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Doctor's race, the Time Lords, put him on trial for breaking the laws of time and forced him to regenerate.|$|E
5|$|Ewondo {{who learned}} were highly favoured {{in the early}} days of the colonial regime. Station {{commander}} Hans Dominik sent four such individuals to attend the mission school of the German Pallottine Fathers in Kribi, a settlement on the coast. There, Atangana learned German language, history, and geography; mathematics; and Roman Catholicism. Father Heinrich Vieter especially liked the boy, and Atangana became the first Ewondo baptised a Roman Catholic; he took the Christian name Karl. Atangana's schooling had just ended <b>when</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bulu ethnic group, one closely related to the Ewondo, invaded Kribi and sacked the school and church in 1899. Atangana waited out the revolt in Douala with the Fathers until the colonial militia defeated the rebels the following year.|$|E
5|$|In July 1969, the {{prominent}} Luo politician Mboya was assassinated by a Kikuyu, with suspicions being voiced that Kenyatta's government had been responsible. The killing sparked riots in Nairobi, and ethnic tensions were stoked across Kenya. In October 1969, Kenyatta visited Kisumu, located in Luo territory, {{in order to}} open a hospital financed with Soviet aid. He was greeted by a crowd shouting KPU slogans and he lost his temper. <b>When</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd started throwing stones, Kenyatta's bodyguards opened fire on them, killing and wounding several. In response {{to the rise of}} KPU, Kenyatta had introduced oathing, a system in which individuals came to Gatundu to swear their loyalty to him. Journalists were discouraged from reporting on the oathing system, and several were deported when they tried to do so. Many were pressured or forced to conduct the oaths, generating a condemnation from the country's Christian establishment. In response to the growing condemnation, the oathing was terminated in September 1969, and Kenyatta invited leaders from other ethnic groups to a meeting in Gatundi.|$|E

5|$|Józef Piłsudski, Polish commander-in-chief, {{determined}} that regaining control of Vilnius, whose population consisted mostly of Poles and Jews, {{should be a}} priority of the renascent Polish state. He {{had been working on}} plans to take control of Vilnius since at least March; he gave preliminary orders to prepare a push in that direction—and counter an expected Soviet westward push—on March 26. One of Piłsudski's objectives was to take control of Vilnius before Western diplomats at the Paris Peace Conference could rule on whom the city, demanded by various factions, should be given to. The action was not discussed with Polish politicians or the government, who at that time were more concerned with the situation on the southern Polish–Ukrainian front. By early April, <b>when</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kresy Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Kresów) Michał Pius Römer, Aleksander Prystor, Witold Abramowicz, and Kazimierz Świtalski met with Pilsudski, stressing the plight of occupied Vilnius and its inhabitants' need for self-government, Piłsudski was ready to move.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Cuba, Castro {{became a}} {{prominent}} figure in {{protests against the}} government’s attempts to raise bus fares, a mode of transport used mostly by students and workers. That year, Castro married Mirta Díaz Balart, a student from a wealthy family through whom he was exposed to the lifestyle of the Cuban elite. The relationship was a love match, disapproved of by both families. Mirta’s father gave them {{tens of thousands of}} dollars to spend in a three-month honeymoon in New York City, and the couple also received a U.S. $1,000 wedding gift from the military general and former president Fulgencio Batista, a friend of Mirta’s family. That same year, Grau decided not to stand for re-election, which was instead won by his Partido Auténticos new candidate, Carlos Prío Socarrás. Prío faced widespread protests <b>when</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MSR, now allied to the police force, assassinated Justo Fuentes, a self-educated black Cuban who was a prominent UIR member and friend of Castro's. In response, Prío agreed to quell the gangs, but found them too powerful to control.|$|E
5|$|The now-isolated Rangers fended off {{numerous}} counter-attacks {{from the}} German 914th Grenadier Regiment. The {{men at the}} point became isolated and some were captured.

By then, Rudder's men {{had run out of}} ammunition and were using captured German weapons. Several men were killed as a result, because the German weapons made a distinctive noise, and the men were mistaken for the enemy. By the end of the battle, the Rangers casualties were 135 dead and wounded, while German casualties were 50 killed and 40 captured. An unknown number of French collaborators were executed.|$|E
