5|$|In United States House of Representatives v. Price (previously United States House of Representatives v.

5|$|Michael II in Epirus <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brothers' agreement, and {{continued}} to pursue his own policies independently of his uncles. In 1241, when Manuel died, Michael moved quickly to occupy Thessaly. In June of the same year, John Asen died, leaving the throne to his seven-year-old son Kaliman (r. 1241–46). Coupled with the increasingly deteriorating situation of the Latin Empire, this development left John Vatatzes of Nicaea as the pre-eminent ruler of the region, and the obvious candidate for the capture of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{attended}} Stanford University {{during the}} 1965-66 academic year. He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> counterculture of the 1960s then taking {{form in the}} San Francisco Bay Area. As opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War grew, a group staged a May 1966 sit-in at Stanford's administration building to demonstrate against draft status tests; Romney joined a counter-protest against that group. He continued to enjoy occasional pranks.|$|E
5|$|Separating {{provision}} for cyclists from other road traffic <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remit of the 1960s town redevelopment, and in 1996 {{the perception of}} {{provision for}} cyclists was very poor. A Basingstoke Area Cycling Strategy was developed in 1999 and subsequently an extensive cycle network has been developed mainly utilising on-road routes or off-road routes that run parallel with and directly alongside roads. Basingstoke was linked to Reading on the National Cycle Network route 23 in May 2003 and the route was extended south to Alton and Alresford in April 2006.|$|E

5|$|The Bulldogs beat Richmond AC 39–0 in {{the final}} game of the season. Richmond AC <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> APFA, and this was the team's only game in 1920. The Bulldogs scored 13 points in the first, third, and fourth quarter to win in the shutout. Guyon scored two rushing {{touchdown}}s, while Jim Thorpe threw touchdown passes to Corcoran and Lowe. The other two touchdowns came on runs by Whelen and Grigg. Guyon made two field goals, and Thorpe added a third.|$|E
5|$|The brigade's {{other units}} were the 3rd Airlanding Anti-Tank Battery from the Royal Artillery, the 3rd Parachute Squadron of the Royal Engineers and the 224th (Parachute) Field Ambulance from the Royal Army Medical Corps. During {{operations}} the artillery support {{available to the}} brigade would also include a battery of howitzers from the 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Airlanding Light Regiment, although it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brigade.|$|E
5|$|Allward chose a {{relatively}} new construction method for the monument: limestone bonded to a cast concrete frame. A foundation bed of 11,000 tonnes of concrete, reinforced with hundreds of tonnes of steel, served as the support bed for the memorial. The memorial base and twin pylons contained almost 6,000 tonnes of Seget limestone. Sculptors carved the 20 approximately double life-sized human figures on site from large blocks of stone. The carvers used half-size plaster models produced by Allward in his studio, now {{on display at the}} Canadian War Museum, and an instrument called a pantograph to reproduce the figures at the proper scale. The carvers conducted their work year-round inside temporary studios built around each figure. The inclusion of the names of those killed in France with no known grave <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original design, and Allward was unhappy when the government asked him to include them. Allward argued that the inclusion of names <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original commissioning. Through a letter to Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission in October 1927, Allward indicated his intention to relegate the names of the missing to pavement stones around the monument. The collective dismay and uproar of the commission forced Allward to relent and incorporate the names of the missing on the memorial walls. The task of inscribing the names did not begin until the early 1930s and employed a typeface that Allward designed for the monument.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2009 season, Fredrikstad told Tegström that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club's {{long-term}} {{plans and}} that he was welcome to find another club. Fredrikstad turned down an offer from Stabæk to buy the striker. He did not start a single match in the pre-season, but he came on as a substitute and scored a goal against Strømsgodset in the second match of the 2009 season. Tegström spent most of the 2009 season on the bench, but in the 2009 Norwegian Football Cup tie against Ranheim, he came on as a substitute and scored two goals in the extra time.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 12th century the former {{territory}} of the kingdom of the Rhinns was part of Galloway kingdom, but the area to the north was not. Strathgryfe, Kyle and Cunningham had come {{under the control of the}} Scottish king in the early 12th century, much of it given over to soldiers of French or Anglo-French origin. Strathgryfe and most of Kyle had been given to Walter fitz Alan under King David I, with Hugh de Morville taking Cunningham. Strathnith still had a Gaelic ruler (ancestor of the famous Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray), but he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom of Galloway. The rest of the region—the Rhinns, Farines, Carrick, Desnes Mór and Desnes Ioan, and the sparsely settled uplands of Glenken—was probably under the control of the sons of Fergus, King of Galloway, in the years before Donnchadh's career in the region.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, {{and in that sense}} caused a longer harm to the public as a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} public domain, and then second, that King Kong <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use the courts to turn a profit.|$|E

5|$|Harihara, (also {{known as}} Harisvara) a Lingayati writer and the patron of King Narasimha I, wrote the Girijakalyana {{in the old}} Jain Champu style which {{describes}} the marriage of Shiva and Parvati in ten sections. He {{was one of the}} earliest Virashaiva writers who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vachana literary tradition. He came from a family of accountants (Karanikas) from Halebidu and spent many years in Hampi writing more than one hundred ragales (poems in blank verse) in praise of Virupaksha (a form of Shiva). Raghavanka was the first to introduce the Shatpadi metre into Kannada literature in his Harishchandra kavya which is considered a classic even though it occasionally violates strict rules of Kannada grammar.|$|E
5|$|However, after 1912 {{he became}} more radical and began to {{predicted}} the liberation of the Africans {{and the end of}} colonial rule, and began to foster closer links with a number of other independent African churches. From 1914, he preached more militant sermons, often referring to Old Testament themes, concentrating on such aspects as the Israelites' escape from slavery in Egypt , Chilembwe himself <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apocalyptic Watch Tower movement, which was popular in central Africa at the time and later became known as Kitawala in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but some of his followers may have been influenced by it. The leader of Watch Tower, Charles Taze Russell had predicted that Armageddon would begin in October 1914, which some of Chilembwe’s followers equated to an end to colonial rule.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, as {{a general}} strike was {{underway}} {{in the country to}} demand a renegotiation of the French role in Syria, Quwatli was appointed the Bloc's vice president of internal affairs, but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treaty negotiation committee which led talks with the French in Paris in March. A new treaty was established {{by the end of the}} month, although the French did not ratify it. Between then and fall, Quwatli spearheaded efforts to unify nationalists ranks in Syria, convincing LNA leader Sabri al-Asali to join the Bloc's highest governing body. By enlisting the support of many prominent pan-Arabists like himself, Quwatli strengthened his position within the Bloc, particularly in regards to his chief nationalist rival Jamil Mardam Bey.|$|E

5|$|In 1967 Casino Royale {{was adapted}} into a parody Bond film {{starring}} David Niven as Sir James Bond and Ursula Andress as Vesper Lynd. Niven had been Fleming's {{preference for the}} role of Bond. The result of a court case in the High Court in London in 1963 allowed Kevin McClory to produce a remake of Thunderball titled Never Say Never Again in 1983. The film, produced by Jack Schwartzman's Taliafilm production company and starring Sean Connery as Bond, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eon series of Bond films. In 1997 the Sony Corporation acquired all or some of McClory's rights in an undisclosed deal, which were then subsequently acquired by MGM, whilst on 4 December 1997, MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights to Never Say Never Again from Taliafilm. As of 2015, Eon holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008 {{the band}} also {{announced}} that for their 30th anniversary in 2009, {{they would be}} staging a fifth Madstock festival in London's Victoria Park on 17 July 11 years after the last Madstock concert. It was originally rumoured that the newly reformed The Specials would make an appearance after finishing their reunion tour. However, this did not occur, although original Specials keyboardist Jerry Dammers – who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reunion line-up – was announced as a support act with The Spatial AKA Orchestra shortly before the festival. Dammers would support Madness again during their 2009 Christmas tour, when he opened each night with a DJ set.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Connex Norge {{offered to}} {{purchase}} Timetoget from NSB, and start operations. However, by February, Connex had changed their mind, {{and no longer}} wanted to purchase the company. Terje Bulling admitted that Timetoget {{had a very good}} agreement for operating the Arendal Line, and that a fourth Y1 railcar had been bought from Sweden for this route. However, when NSB had tried to sell Timetoget, this agreement <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate. By April, NSB estimated that they had lost NOK10 million on their engagement in Timetoget. However, they had three Y1 trains, and would be able to start using them on the Bratsberg Line and the Arendal Line.|$|E
