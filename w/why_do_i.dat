Ask your parents for once!". This is in reference to Chef's tendency to give advice to the boys. While the children are trying to think of what is the most important thing for a man, Cartman says [...] "Ham?", to which Stan angrily replies, [...] "No, not ham, you fat fuck!".

500|$|Nolan {{shoots the}} {{entirety}} of his films with one unit, rather than using a second unit for action sequences. In that way, Nolan keeps his personality and {{point of view in}} every aspect of the film. [...] "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> need to be there at all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because then {{why did you want to}} do an action film?" [...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|E

In a 1985 interview with India Today, she remarked, [...] "The life and happiness in our house {{came to an end}} the day I and Rajesh got married," [...] sharing her unhappy marital experience and calling their marriage [...] "a farce". Asked in Filmfare whether she would want to marry again, Kapadia replied, [...] "I'm very happy and content. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> need to get married again? Once was more than enough." [...] In 2010, reporter Dinesh Raheja stated that [...] "the bitterness between Rajesh and Dimple washed away", noting that they are seen together at parties and that Dimple campaigned for Khanna's election and also worked in his film Jai Shiv Shankar. In a later interview she reflected back positively on her marriage, referring to it as her [...] "biggest high".|$|E

2500|$|Although, at {{the time}} when Călinescu's work was first published, Aderca was already marginalized, he made a point of {{replying}} to the allegations. Sebastian, who read a version of this rebuttal during one of his visits to Aderca's home, admired the effort: [...] " [...] very nice, very accurate—but how did he find the strength, the inclination, the curiosity to write it? A sign of youthful vitality. [...] <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> not feel personally 'aimed at' in what is said, done, or written against me?" [...] Writing in 2009, literary historian Alexandru George took Călinescu's side against Aderca: the allegation of antisemitism was [...] "very unconvincing", and the rebuttal came just as Călinescu was being incriminated for philosemitism by the far-right Gândirea magazine. Others also note that the very mention of Aderca's name in Călinescu's work was valid proof of Călinescu dissidence. Aderca's own replies, leading up to the 1945 article Rondul de noapte, became topics of scandal, and, according to Călinescu's disciple Alexandru Piru, came as a [...] "curious", [...] "violent outburst".|$|E

The split served as a license to party for Haggard, who {{spent much of the}} next decade becoming mired in alcohol and drug problems. Haggard has stated that he was in his own mid-life crisis, or [...] "male menopause," [...] around this time. He said in an interview from this period: [...] "Things that you've enjoyed for years don't seem nearly as important, and you're at war with yourself as to what's happening. [...] 'Why don't I like that anymore? [...] <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> like this now?' And finally, I think you actually go through a biological change, you just, you become another....
