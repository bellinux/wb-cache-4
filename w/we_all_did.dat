5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>did,</b> that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today than when I was a young writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>did</b> some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E
500|$|Wolfgang's {{original}} intention {{with the}} album {{was to create a}} collection of previously released b-sides along with three reworked demos, with Eddie saying: [...] "It would [...] a record of our more hardcore songs and none of the pop stuff. That was the initial plan, but the deeper we dug, the more we found. At the same time I was writing new songs. Dave got very excited about that. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>did.</b> We ended up recording demos for 35 songs." [...] After deliberating over whether to self-produce the album or choose a producer from a list that included Rick Rubin and Pat Leonard, Roth suggested John Shanks. Shanks liked the first three songs, and agreed to produce the album, working alongside Wolfgang to pick the demos that would be developed into the album's tracks. While all of Van Halen's albums since 1984 had been produced inside 5150, Roth persuaded the band to work at Henson Recording Studios—where he had been recording for over a decade.|$|E

60|$|It is {{no part of}} my {{intention}} to defend humility on practical grounds. Practical grounds are uninteresting, and, moreover, on practical grounds the case for humility is overwhelming. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> know that the 'divine glory of the ego' is socially a great nuisance; <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>do</b> actually value our friends for modesty, freshness, and simplicity of heart.

500|$|... "Clumsy" [...] {{was written}} by Talay Riley, Warren [...] "Oak" [...] Felder and Alex Niceforo, with {{production}} being handled by the latter two; Mischke served as a vocal producer. Spears, Riley, Felder, Zaire Koalo, Trevor Brown and Mischke provided crowd vocals on the track, which were recorded at 158 Studios, Westlake Village, California, and at House of Blues Studio, Encino, California. Musically, [...] "Clumsy" [...] portrays a [...] "synth-laden" [...] electro track, with a [...] "folksy verse stomp" [...] and a [...] "futuristic club beat." [...] It additionally incorporates [...] "stomping drums and finger snaps" [...] in its instrumentation, as well as doo-wop [...] "hand-claps and soulful vocal riffs as it builds to an explosive electronic drop." [...] In an interview with radio show The Cooper Lawrence Show, the singer confirmed {{that she and her}} team [...] "literally went into the booth together and did all the claps [...] all the sound effects are real, they're from us, our feet and everything, it's all real, so <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>did</b> it together, it's like very old-school." [...] Joey Nolfi, writing for Entertainment Weekly, saw [...] "Clumsy" [...] as being [...] " [...] sonically in-line with songs heard on 2011's Femme Fatale and 2013's Britney Jean." [...] The Guardian Alex Macpherson opined that [...] "its rapacious giddiness shares something of the same spirit as Ariana Grande's 'Greedy'." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took {{a bit of time}} for us to realize {{that we were going to}} make an album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>did.</b> To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling yourself out of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying. It's much easier to stay at home.” ...|$|E

But she did do every ounce of every one of her dances .... wasn't used for everything. It {{was more like a}} safety net. If Nat wasn't able to do something, you'd have a safety net.

2500|$|At the time, {{some of the}} Beatles {{defended the}} use of the Butcher photograph. Lennon said that it was [...] "as {{relevant}} as Vietnam" [...] and McCartney said that their critics were [...] "soft". However, this opinion was not shared by all band members. George Harrison said in The Beatles Anthology that he thought the whole idea [...] "was gross, and I also thought it was stupid. Sometimes <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>did</b> stupid things thinking it was cool and hip when it was naïve and dumb; {{and that was one of}} them." [...] In 2007 George Martin, the Beatles' producer, recalled that the cover had been the cause of his first strong disagreement with the band. He added: [...] "I thought it was disgusting and in poor taste … It suggested that they were madmen. Which they were, but not in that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{reports of}} the bombing {{and the loss of}} four children's lives were glorified by white supremacists, who in many {{instances}} chose to celebrate the loss as [...] "four less niggers", as news of the church bombing and the fact that four young girls had been killed in the explosion reached the national and international press, many felt that they had not taken the civil rights struggle seriously enough. The day following the bombing, a young white lawyer named Charles Morgan Jr. addressed a meeting of businessmen, condemning the acquiescence of white people in Birmingham towards the oppression of blacks. In this speech, Morgan addressed his audience with a speech in which he lamented: [...] "Who did it ? <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>did</b> it! The 'who' is every little individual who talks about the 'niggers' and spreads the seeds of his hate to his neighbor and his son ... What's it like living in Birmingham? No one ever really has known and no one will until this city becomes part of the United States." [...] A Milwaukee Sentinel editorial opined, [...] "For the rest of the nation, the Birmingham church bombing should serve to goad the conscience. The deaths... in a sense, are on the hands of each of us." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{resigned}} from the advertising industry in 1964, moved into a modest apartment near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel ("It wasn’t Paris in the 1920s, but I was happy" [...] DeLillo has said of this time), and began work on his first novel. Reflecting on {{the early days of}} his writing career, he remarked: [...] "I lived in a very minimal kind of way. My telephone would be $4.20 every month. I was paying a rent of sixty dollars a month. And I was becoming a writer. So in one sense, I was ignoring the movements of the time." [...] His first novel, Americana, was written over the course of four years and finally published in 1971, to modest critical praise. Americana concerned [...] "a television network programmer who hits the road in search of the big picture". DeLillo revised the novel in 1989 for paperback re-printing. Reflecting on the novel later in his career, he admitted, [...] "I don't think my first novel would have been published today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>did</b> some work on the book and it was published." [...] Later still, DeLillo still felt a degree of surprise at Americana being published, noting [...] "I was working on my first novel, Americana, for two years before I ever realized that I could be a writer [...] I had absolutely no assurance that this book would be published because I knew that there were elements that I simply didn't know how to improve at that point. So I wrote for another two years and finished the novel. It wasn’t all that difficult to find a publisher, to my astonishment. I didn't have a representative. I didn’t know anything about publishing. But an editor at Houghton Mifflin read the manuscript and decided that this was worth pursuing." ...|$|E
