25|$|What {{disturbs}} Delano are incidents {{he observes}} among the hatchet polishers, oakum pickers, {{such as when}} a black boy stabs a white one. Apparently Cereno does not care about this behavior, not even when Atufal, a regal-looking slave appears in chains but still refusing to humble himself. The whispering between Cereno and Babo makes Delano feel uncomfortable. Gradually his suspicions increase, as he notes Cereno's sudden waves of dizziness and anxiety, the crew's awkward movements and whisperings, and the unusual interaction of the slaves and the whites. Yet Delano answers Cereno’s questions about the crew, cargo, and arms aboard the Bachelor’s Delight <b>without</b> <b>reserve,</b> reasoning that the innocent are protected by the truth. When The Rover arrives with the supplies, Delano sends her back for more water while he continues to observe curious incidents.|$|E
500|$|One of Murray's {{friends in}} the Society, E. O. James, {{described}} her as a [...] "mine of information and a perpetual inspiration ever ready to impart her vast and varied stores of specialised knowledge <b>without</b> <b>reserve,</b> or, be it said, much if any regard for the generally accepted opinions and conclusions of the experts!" [...] Davidson described her as being [...] "not at all assertive... never thrust her ideas on anyone. [...] she behaved in fact rather like someone who was a fully convinced member of some unusual religious sect, or perhaps, of the Freemasons, but never on any account got into arguments about it in public." [...] The archaeologist Glyn Daniel observed that Murray remained mentally alert into her old age, commenting that [...] "her vigour and forthrightness and ruthless energy never deserted her".|$|E
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} in Potsdam, {{according}} to Admiral Tirpitz's notes, Wilhelm [...] "expressed himself <b>without</b> <b>reserve</b> regarding Bethmann's incompetence" [...] in foreign affairs. Bethmann Hollweg suggested that Germany sign a naval agreement with Britain limiting {{the size of the}} High Seas Fleet to keep Britain out of the war. Admiral Tirpitz went on to record: [...] "The Kaiser informed the company that the Chancellor had proposed that in order to keep England neutral, we should sacrifice the German fleet for an agreement with England, which he, the Kaiser had refused." ...|$|E

50|$|The Revolución Juliana (July 9, 1925) {{initiated}} {{the process of}} founding a national bank issuer. The country's crisis, caused by non-convertibility of the currency, banknote printing <b>without</b> <b>reserves</b> to support the increase in currency, inflation, speculation, abuse of credit, unbalanced payments, lack of official control over the banks and banking anarchy and strife, required cleaning up the currency situation.

2500|$|Deitch {{encountered}} {{difficulty finding}} actresses who would portray lesbians <b>without</b> <b>reserve</b> with many refusing {{to audition for}} the film. Patricia Charbonneau was the first actress to be cast and [...] went to Los Angeles with Deitch so she could audition with those reading {{for the role of}} Vivian Bell. Deitch noticed the chemistry between Charbonneau and Helen Shaver immediately. She persuaded actors to work for scale, and after casting completed, the film was shot on location in Reno in 31 days. Limited funds often necessitated filming two scenes in one day, with little room for retakes. Renting space in a real casino {{was out of the question}} and a dressed set in a room of an abandoned hotel served as the gambling casino in the film.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, set {{its policy}} repo rate, the {{interest}} rate on its one-week deposit facility, at 0.25%, {{at the same time}} as setting its overnight deposit rate at -0.25%. The existence of the negative overnight deposit rate was a technical consequence of the fact that overnight deposit rates are generally set at 0.5% below or 0.75% below the policy rate. This is not technically an example of [...] "negative interest on excess reserves," [...] because Sweden does not have a reserve requirement, but imposing a reserve interest rate <b>without</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements imposes an implied reserve requirement of zero. The Riksbank studied the impact of these changes and stated in a commentary report that they led to no disruptions in Swedish financial markets.|$|E

50|$|Incidentally, {{a similar}} method {{was used by}} Lotus 1-2-3, in the early 1980s, to {{discover}} the recalculation dependencies in a spreadsheet. Namely, a location was reserved in each cell to store the return address.

50|$|The {{high tide}} of the White {{movement}} against the Soviets {{had been reached}} in September 1919. By this time Denikin's forces were dangerously overextended.
