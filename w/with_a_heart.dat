The exception was the ship's engineer, Allan Ramsay, {{who had been}} taken ill <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> condition in the Falklands during the outward voyage. He chose to remain with the expedition, but he grew steadily weaker as winter progressed. He died on 6 August, and was buried on the island.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, Sanford began {{preparations}} {{two years}} later for {{a run for the}} 1976 Democratic presidential nomination. Announcing his candidacy on June 1, 1975, he juggled campaign appearances with his obligations as president of Duke. While he developed a following among educators, {{he did not have a}} satisfactory campaign theme by the new year. Then, while campaigning in Massachusetts in January, he suffered sharp pains and was diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> murmur. On January 25, Sanford withdrew from the primaries, the first Democrat to do so that year.|$|E

5|$|Donna Jackson is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC medical drama Holby City, played by actress Jaye Jacobs. She {{appeared in the}} programme from its sixth series in 2004, to its thirteenth in 2011, and from its nineteenth in 2017. Donna entered the series as a staff nurse, characterised as a wild-child with a chaotic personal life. During her tenure, she grew to take her work more seriously, becoming a ward sister and accepting more personal responsibilities by adopting her half-niece Mia (Jada Wallace-Mitchell). A tart <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> character, Donna had many romantic liaisons with her colleagues, including a one-night stand with midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). She ultimately {{fell in love with}} agency nurse Keiran Callaghan (Barry Sloane), and departed to be with him after he was injured in Afghanistan as part of the Territorial Army.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{early life}} {{has been the subject}} of {{historical}} conjecture. Vasari, the 16th-century biographer of Renaissance painters, tells a story of Leonardo as a very young man: A local peasant made himself a round shield and requested that Ser Piero have it painted for him. Leonardo responded with a painting of a monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that Ser Piero sold it to a Florentine art dealer, who sold it to the Duke of Milan. Meanwhile, having made a profit, Ser Piero bought a shield decorated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> pierced by an arrow, which he gave to the peasant.|$|E
5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> condition, in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the operating room with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding their breath to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in a rude manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.|$|E

5|$|Available {{evidence}} indicates that the real Lad was born in December 1902, and that unlike his fictional counterpart, Lad was a collie of unknown lineage with no American Kennel Club registration papers. After living five years <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> tumor, the dog died on September 3, 1918 and his obituary was featured on a multi-page spread of the September 14, 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine. Terhune reported that he received hundreds of letters from fans asking him to publish more stories about Lad, and that over 1,700 people visit Lad's grave at Sunnybank. In 1922, he collected together eleven more short stories into a novel; the stories were published earlier in The Ladies' Home Journal, with some new stories and some from other magazines. The new set of stories primarily revolved around the themes of right and wrong, abuse of authority, and justice. Intending {{it to be the}} last book he would write about his late collie, Terhune killed the fictional Lad in the last chapter of the novel. The novel was published by George H. Doran as Further Adventures of Lad. Seven years and twenty other novels later, he would change his mind and release one more Lad novel, Lad of Sunnybank, which was published by HarperCollins.|$|E
5|$|The promotional {{phase of}} the {{gameplay}} mainly deals with the idol conversing with various other characters and doing events, {{some of which are}} necessary to progress the game. There are also times when the player is given choices that directly affect the idol. Over the course of a conversation, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from. Depending on which choice is made will effect how well or poorly the communication is received, which results in either bad, normal or good memories. A bad memory will decrease an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by a horizontal bar in the top-left of the lower screen. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from blue to yellow and finally to red as enthusiasm increases. A normal memory will reward the player <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> point, used later during auditions. A good memory will reward the player with two heart points and increased enthusiasm. If the player chooses to take the day off, an idol's enthusiasm will automatically increase. Days off also give the idol the chance to either stay at home, or go out into town and meet with other characters. The player can check on days off if there are any presents fans have sent the idols, which contain in-game items.|$|E

25|$|Valves are {{integral}} to the normal physiological functioning of the human heart.
