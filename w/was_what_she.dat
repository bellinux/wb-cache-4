5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

Her parents divorced within a year of her birth, and she was raised by her mother, with help from an older sister, in Hollister and Warrenton. Connie Hedgepeth named her third daughter Faith because she believed that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> needed to raise a third child when she already had two teenage daughters and a husband with a drug problem.|$|E

25|$|King {{played a}} {{prominent}} role in the years after her husband's 1968 assassination when she took on the leadership of the struggle for racial equality herself and became active in the Women's Movement. King founded the King Center and sought to make his birthday a national holiday. King finally succeeded when Ronald Reagan signed legislation which established Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. She later broadened her scope to include both opposition to apartheid and advocacy for LGBT rights. King became friends with many politicians before and after Martin Luther King's death, most notably John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Robert F. Kennedy. John F. Kennedy's phone call to her during the 1960 election <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> liked to believe was behind his victory.|$|E
25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} she noticed a small notebook lying open on in the drawer of Emily's portable writing desk and of my sister Emily's handwriting. She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt, more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E

In an interview with MTV News, Tyler confessed that she felt [...] "scared and vulnerable" [...] while filming Jersey Girl, adding [...] "I was so used to those {{other elements of the}} character [...] On The Lord of the Rings, a lot of things were done in post-production, whereas this was really just about me and Ben sitting there, just shooting off dialogue."

500|$|The {{song was}} co-produced by Canadian electro-pop band Dragonette, with Martina Sorbara. Roberts stated that Dragonette {{were among the}} first people who worked on the record. Roberts {{discussed}} the 1940s influence on the record, noting [...] "When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that." [...] She stated that {{when it came to the}} production of the track she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was into at that point. The track was written in February 2010, and when asked about working with Dragonette on the track, Roberts responded, [...] "I was with them for quite a while writing, and they were the first people that I went in with when I started making the record. I learnt a lot from them. They're really lovely people, they work really hard, they're so talented." ...|$|E

Cristina said she [...] "thought this <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted." [...] He wanted her to say she knew it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted, so he left her in the chapel. Cristina then returned to their apartment and discovered Burke had left, taking with him the things that meant something to only him (his trumpet, his Eugene Foote collection, his grandmother's picture, and his lucky scrub cap), leaving Cristina devastated.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first decade}} of her career saw her billed most often as 'the Great Little Tilley'. The gender {{ambiguity}} of her name was causing problems for audiences, however, so she and her manager father were asked {{to come up with}} another. She was billed as Vesta Tilley {{for the first time in}} April 1878, when performing at the Royal Music Hall in Holborn, London. [...] "Vesta" [...] referred to both the Roman goddess of hearth and home, and a brand of safety matches; [...] "Tilley", a diminutive of Matilda, <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was called as a child.|$|E

2500|$|At seventeen, Emily {{attended}} the Roe Head Girls' School, where Charlotte {{was a teacher}} but managed to stay {{only a few months}} before being overcome by extreme homesickness. Charlotte later stated that: [...] "Liberty was the breath of Emily's nostrils; without it she perished. The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless, very secluded but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life, to one of disciplined routine (though under the kindest auspices), <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> failed in enduring... I felt in my heart she would die, if she did not go home, and with this conviction obtained her recall." [...] She returned home and Anne took her place. At this time, the girls' objective was to obtain sufficient education to open a small school of their own.|$|E

Inayat Khan said that, should she go missing, she would like Vera to avoid worrying her mother as far as possible. The normal procedure, as Inayat Khan knew, was that when an agent went to the field, Vera would send out a periodic [...] "good news" [...] letters to the family, letting them know the person concerned was well. If the agent went missing, the family would be told so. What Inayat Khan was suggesting was that bad news should be broken to her mother only if it was beyond any doubt that she was dead. Vera said she would agree to this arrangement if it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted. With this assurance Inayat Khan seemed content and confident once more. Any doubts in Vera's mind were also now settled.|$|E
2500|$|At age 12, Tallchief {{began to}} work with Bronislava Nijinska, a renowned {{choreographer}} who had recently opened her own studio in Los Angeles, and David Lichine, a choreographer and former dancer. Nijinska [...] "was a personification of what ballet was all about", Tallchief recalled. [...] "I looked at her, and I knew this was what I wanted to do." [...] Nijinska imparted {{a strong sense of}} discipline and the belief that being a ballerina was a full-time task. [...] "We didn't concentrate only {{for an hour and a}} half a day", Tallchief recalled. [...] "We lived it". It was under Nijinska that Tallchief decided ballet <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted to devote her life to. [...] "Before Nijinska, I liked ballet but believed that I was destined to become a concert pianist", she recalled. [...] "Now my goal was different." [...] Nijinska saw Tallchief was serious and began devoting great attention to her.|$|E
2500|$|On August 8, 2006, Maressa Orzack {{was quoted}} in an {{interview}} that she felt that over 40 percent of all World of Warcraft subscribers were addicted to the game. She went further by stating that she feels Blizzard Entertainment, the game's developer, structures the game to be deliberately addictive and designs it to keep people in. While she agreed that other personal issues can have an effect she felt that the cause of the problem <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> described as the game's [...] "inherent addictiveness". Describing the addiction as similar to gambling, Orzack cited variable-ratio reinforcement as the mechanism that keeps people playing. Continuing, she added that she feels willpower or self control is not a factor, and that MMORPGs like World of Warcraft should carry warnings in a similar way to cigarettes. There was disagreement about Orzack's conclusions, with it being described a [...] "ridiculous claim" [...] that an addiction to an enjoyable activity and describe it a “serious mental disorder”. Other commentators were concerned that the term [...] "addiction" [...] was being used too frequently, and noting that at the time gaming and internet addiction {{were not included in the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.|$|E
