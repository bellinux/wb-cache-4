5|$|The first dent to morale {{came after}} about a <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> volunteers were first issued ranks in the Rhodesian Army. In {{the eyes of some}} of the French-speaking soldiers, the ranks {{assigned}} appeared to have been chosen almost at random by their superiors, and did not reflect their actual respective levels of training, ability and experience. Some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline. The brazen attitude of most of the company's soldiers jarred strongly with that of their Rhodesian commanders, who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of the Frenchmen had little inclination to meet.|$|E
5|$|The {{recruitment}} of Chris Dawes during the 2012 trade period meant Watts would remain playing in defence for the 2013 season according to Mark Neeld; former Melbourne player, David Schwarz, said {{prior to the}} commencement of the season that Watts would flourish in defence {{and that he would}} ultimately become a consistent player. The opening round loss to Port Adelaide by seventy-nine points at the MCG where he managed just seven disposals saw the players booed by Melbourne fans as they left the field; things did not become easier the next <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> club lost to Essendon by 148-points at the MCG, a game in which he was substituted out and was jeered by the crowd when this was announced. His poor to start to the season led to him being dropped for the round three match against West Coast at the MCG; instead of playing for Casey in the VFL, he did not play any football for the weekend. Despite not playing and football for the week, he was recalled to the senior side for the forty-one point win against Greater Western Sydney at the MCG in round four.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} size of the egg mass is {{characteristic}} of the species. Ranids tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas bufonids produce long, cylindrical strings. The tiny yellow-striped pygmy eleuth (Eleutherodactylus limbatus) lays eggs singly, burying them in moist soil. The smoky jungle frog (Leptodactylus pentadactylus) makes a nest of foam in a hollow. The eggs hatch when the nest is flooded, or the tadpoles may complete their development in the foam if flooding does not occur. The red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water below. The larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten. In general, the length of the egg stage depends on the species and the environmental conditions. Aquatic eggs normally hatch within one <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> capsule splits as a result of enzymes released by the developing larvae.|$|E

25|$|The 1996 route saw a {{decrease}} in the amount of kilometers that were dedicated to time trials and the removal of the climbing time trial that had been a staple in years past. Lluis Simon of El Punt felt that the penultimate stage that crossed Mendola, Tonale Pass, Gavia Pass, Mortirolo, and Aprica would be the hardest of the race. Paolo Viberti, a writer for El País, believed that the race would be decided by the final <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> race entered the Alps and the lengthy individual time trial.|$|E

25|$|If {{high doses}} were used more than 30 days, cut dose {{immediately}} to twice replacement, and reduce by 25% each week until replacement is reached. Then change to oral hydrocortisone or cortisone {{as a single}} morning dose, and gradually decrease by 2.5mg each <b>week.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> morning dose is less than replacement, the return of normal basal adrenal function may be documented by checking 0800 cortisol levels prior to the morning dose; stop drugs when 0800 cortisol is 10 μg/dl. Predicting the time to full adrenal recovery after prolonged suppressive exogenous steroids is difficult; some people may take nearly a year.|$|E

Another twist this season saw a previously evicted HouseGuest returning to the game on Day 35, with the returning HouseGuest decided partly by the HouseGuests themselves.

25|$|A permit {{cancellation}} {{policy was}} adopted in 1998. Cancellations, some made {{ahead of time}} and some not, some reported to FWP and some not, had long been a problem, and FWP believed they contributed to under-use of the river and contributed to public dissatisfaction with the permit policy. Beginning in 1991, FWP began to distribute cancelled permits to outfitters and private groups on the permit waiting list. But with the rapid {{rise in the number of}} people using the Smith River, FWP changed this policy in 1998, so that cancelled permits would not be reissued on any <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> number of people on the river exceeded 300. Although the total numbers of floaters on the river declined slightly in 1998 to 4,128, average group rise rose to 6.47.|$|E
25|$|Both times Bart {{improved}} {{a higher}} percentage of articles than Lisa, but the actual number of articles each edited (the bottom number of their ratios, also known as the sample size) were not the same for both of them either <b>week.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> totals for the two weeks are added together, Bart and Lisa's work can be judged from an equal sample size; i.e., the total number of articles edited by each. Looked at in this more accurate manner, Lisa's ratio is higher and, therefore, so is her percentage. Also when the two tests are combined using a weighted average, overall, Lisa has improved a much higher percentage than Bart because the quality modifier had a significantly higher percentage. Therefore, like other paradoxes, it only appears to be a paradox because of incorrect assumptions, incomplete or misguided information, or a lack of understanding a particular concept.|$|E
25|$|Bukhanovsky's 65-page {{psychological}} profile {{described the}} killer as a reclusive man aged between 45 and 50 years old who had endured a painful and isolated childhood, {{and who was}} incapable of flirting or courtship with women. This individual was of average intelligence, likely to be married and to have fathered children, but also a sadist who suffered from impotence and could achieve sexual arousal only by seeing his victims suffer. The murders themselves were an analogue to the sexual intercourse this individual was incapable of performing, and his knife became a substitute for a penis which failed to function normally. Because many of the killings had occurred on weekdays near mass transport hubs and across the entire Rostov Oblast, Bukhanovsky also argued that the killer's work required him to travel regularly, and based upon the actual days of the <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> killings had occurred, the killer was most likely tied to a production schedule.|$|E
