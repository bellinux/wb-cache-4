5|$|In February 2013, Gavyn Davies for The Financial Times {{emphasized}} that a key {{difference between the}} 1930s and the 21st century outbreaks {{is that in the}} thirties some of the retaliations between countries were carried out not by devaluations, but by increases in import tariffs, <b>which</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much more disruptive to international trade.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent obstructive sleep apnea, a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness ("CO2 narcosis"). Other symptoms present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) {{that is difficult to}} control with medication. The high carbon dioxide can also cause headaches, <b>which</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worsening in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Banff National Park spans three ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, {{which consists}} mainly of dense forest, comprises 53percent of Banff's area. 27percent {{of the park}} is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at , with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are {{more common in the}} subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, <b>which</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.|$|E
5|$|In general, the {{objective}} events follow a set organizational outline {{from year to}} year. Language and literature focuses on a single novel or a set of plays in addition to multiple short literary selections <b>which</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> poems or excerpts from short stories. The art and music sections include several selections with which students must familiarize themselves in addition to historical information. Economics remains fairly static; 85% of the material focuses on a standard course of macroeconomics and microeconomics and the remaining 15% focuses on the year's topic. For example, in 2005 the themed material covered the economics of ancient Egypt and Rome. Science and social science reflect the season's theme. Unlike the other events, there is no basic information that carries over. The math curriculum has varied as well, occasionally dropping and adding new subjects or shifting the weight of particular subjects.|$|E

5|$|The {{electron}} {{configurations of}} Lr+ and Lr2+ {{are expected to}} be 7s2 and 7s1 respectively, unlike the lanthanides <b>which</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 5d1 as Ln2+. However, in species where all three valence electrons of lawrencium are ionized to give at least formally the Lr3+ cation, lawrencium is expected to behave like a typical actinide and the heavier congener of lutetium, especially because the first three ionization potentials of lawrencium are predicted to be similar to those of lutetium. Hence, unlike thallium but like lutetium, lawrencium would prefer to form LrH3 than LrH, and LrCO is expected to be similar to the also unknown LuCO, both metals having a valence configuration of σ2π1 in their respective monocarbonyls. The pπ–dπ bond is expected to be observed in LrCl3 just as it is for LuCl3 and more generally all the LnCl3, and the complex anion − is expected to be stable just like its lanthanide congeners, with a configuration of 6d1 for lawrencium; this 6d orbital would be its highest occupied molecular orbital.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers do {{not have}} such {{a wide range of}} songs and calls as do {{passerine}} birds, and the sounds they make tend to be simpler in structure. Calls produced include brief high-pitched notes, trills, rattles, twittering, whistling, chattering, nasal churrs, screams and wails. These calls are used by both sexes in communication and are related to the circumstances of the occasion; these include courtship, territorial disputes and alarm calls. Each species has its own range of calls, <b>which</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the 1 to 2.5 kHz range for efficient transmission through forested environments. Mated couples may exchange muted, low-pitched calls, and nestlings often issue noisy begging-calls from inside their nest cavity. The wrynecks have a more musical song and in some areas, the song of the newly arrived Eurasian wryneck is considered to be the harbinger of spring. The piculets either have a song consisting of a long descending trill, or a descending series of two to six (sometimes more) individual notes, and this song alerts ornithologists to the presence of the birds, as they are easily overlooked.|$|E

25|$|In social insects such as ants and termites, {{members of}} {{different}} castes develop different phenotypes.
