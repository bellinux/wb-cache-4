This paper presents the development and experimental evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>swelling</b> curve for a dry bed of packed aggregates immersed in water using the pedostructure concept.

A few minutes after the media supply, the hydrogel villi were tightly fitted to the mold. It seems that these phenomena resulted from the movement <b>of</b> <b>water</b> across hydrogel villi structure. In this work, hydrogel villi structures were fabricated by an alginate–collagen mixture and the gelation of alginate was based on electrostatic crosslinking by calcium ion.

The {{purpose of this paper}} was to clarify the effect of relative humidity (RH) of the conditioning on solute diffusivity in the impregnated wood.

Temporal variability of the evaporation rate <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and <b>of</b> the <b>swelling</b> rate <b>of</b> the sample also were examined.

In order to investigate the moisture distribution in swelling soils a detailed knowledge of volume change properties, flow characteristics and total potential <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in the soil is essential.

Moisture diffusivity in swelling soil under different overburden pressures is measured using Gardner's (1956) outflow method. Behaviour of equilibrium moisture profiles in swelling soils is theoretically explained, solving the differential equation by considering the physical variation of individual soil properties with moisture content and overburden pressure. Using the measured volume change data and moisture potentials under various overburden pressures, the behaviour of possible moisture profiles are described at equilibrium and under steady vertical flows in swelling soils.

Indeed, the curve which giving swelling according to time, reveals two quite distinct phases, one fast which starts with the flood of the sample, the other slow one which evolves/moves in time. According to Chen (1988), the first phase would be the result of a relaxation partial of the constraints in the partially saturated vacuums. This phase would correspond to a macroscopic swelling, compared to a water run-off within the meaning of Darcy, which is governed by the permeability of the medium and the gradient of suction, i. e. a <b>water</b> filling <b>of</b> the large pores separating the grains. The second phase would represent the process of progressive hydration of argillaceous minerals starting from water existing in the pores. Thus starting from this direction, our work, consists in plotting the curves <b>of</b> kinetics <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> according to time for two natural clay soils of Algiers “Ouled Fayet and Cheraga ” with the calculation of the pressures and rates <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the latter in a first place, then by studying the behavior an...|$|R
40|$|Cases <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> in tunnels {{excavated}} through Triassic sulphate-bearing rocks {{from the}} Gipskeuper and the Anhydritgruppe are presented and {{discussed in this}} series of papers {{in order to gain}} a better understanding of the expansive phenomena in these materials and to identify the most relevant ones. Part I deals with main features <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> in tunnels and alternative supports designs for their control an mitigation, as well as with the phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> in tunnels from Baden-Württemberg (Germany) excavated through the Gipskeuper.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the physical and mechanical properties of particleboards formed of bamboo (Bambusa tuldoides) and pine (Pinus taeda) and combinations between them. To this end, panels were made, defined {{by the use of}} each type of particle (pure or mixed), being set 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of proportion to the dry weight, total of 36 panels. The physical tests performed were the moisture content, mass density observed, absorption <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and <b>swelling</b> in thickness and the mechanics were static bending test, screw withdrawal test and internal bond. The results tested for simple correlation and regression analysis. In general, panels pure pine showed better results than just the panels formed by bamboo. The inclusion of bamboo decreases mainly the mechanical properties of panels. All panels were below the minimum standards for the physical and mechanical tests, only internal bond in panels of pine homogeneous had higher values than commercial standards...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper {{describes}} the mechanism of interactions between hydrocarbon solvents and vulcanized rubber (representing crosslinked network structure). The problem has been discussed {{from the point of view}} of thermodynamic principles <b>of</b> <b>swelling,</b> temperature and material factors affecting <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> filled rubber vulcanizates, as well as the impact <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> on properties <b>of</b> the materials. In the second part of the paper results of own research, devoted to <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> sulphur vulcanizates of EPDM rubber in hydrocarbon solvents contained in mineral oils and fuels, or their mixture. Using headspace Gas Chromatography, the degree <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> rubber vulvanizes by different components of solvent mixture in a function of temperature, has been determined...|$|R
