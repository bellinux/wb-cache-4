500|$|Eve's {{character}} and storylines initially elicited {{a positive response}} from Passions cast members. Johnson praised the show for its use of its African American characters like Eve. He appreciated the show's representation of [...] "a full African American family" [...] on daytime television with serious storylines, not [...] "just a flash in the pan". According to Johnson, the Russell family was also well-received by African American viewers. He said {{the chance to work}} with Tracey Ross, who he called the it girl for the African American community following her appearance on Star Search, influenced his acceptance of the role. Marshall commented on the absurdity of her character's rivalry with Eve, particularly their fight in the Crane mansion. She went on to praise Ross' acting, and said: [...] "t's a gift as an actor to have a good relationship with your scene partner when you're always the aggressor because you can go <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> go and not be afraid." ...|$|E
500|$|Marshall based her {{understanding}} of Liz on the character's relationship with Eve, which served as the primary focus for her character development and story arcs. Liz was initially {{not included in the}} show's descriptions of Eve's past. In the 2001 tie-in novel , Eve is characterized as the only child of [...] "too-busy Harvard history Professor Warren Johnson and journalist Tanya Lincoln Johnson". Marshall felt Liz was irredeemable for her actions against Eve and her love interest Julian Crane. Interpreting the character as having a form of mental illness due to her repeated sexual abuse, Marshall said that [...] "very emotion she has it twisted". Ross added to Marshall's commentary by recommending that Liz should get [...] "some serious electroshock therapy". Marshall found Liz's rivalry with Eve to be absurd, particularly a scene in which they fight in the Crane mansion. She went on to praise her working relationship with Ross, saying: [...] "t's a gift as an actor to have a good relationship with your scene partner when you're always the aggressor because you can go <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> go and not be afraid." ...|$|E

She also was upset that Adams had started inviting himself to see Elvis, and Juanico felt that she was trying to compete for Elvis' attention. Adams would talk often about Natalie Wood to Elvis, constantly discussing her figure and her beauty, something else that caused Juanico to feel that she would soon lose Elvis to the glitz of Hollywood. Presley's own mother even commented about Adams, [...] "He sure is a pushy little fellow".|$|R

This means, after all kind of sophisticated simulation based part and product optimisation, {{there is a time}} <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> parts <b>to</b> have a hand on, to test and verify them and even produce them in a new way to face actual economical and ecological challenges. The additive manufacturing technology bears also a paradigm shift: from manufacturing-driven design to design-driven manufacturing. Based on a long-time practical in-house experience state-of-the-art applications with already proven practical relevance (among them is the bionic handling assistant awarded with the German Prize for Achievements in Technology and Innovation) highlight this new freedom of design. Subsequent the current state of additive manufacturing as possibility for serial production will be discussed. There shows up both: real usable potentials and existing restrictions, too. The results of different research studies on PA-based specimen and parts manufactured by laser sintering (SLS) regarding mechanical properties, reproducibility, long-term behaviour and cost deployment will be presented.
