There exists no necessity whatever in the mills employed in manufacturing <b>woollen</b> <b>cloths,</b> and did we deem it needful to legislate on the subject, so difficult is the business, we should feel ourselves utterly at a loss how to act." ...|$|R
5|$|In 1337 Flemish weavers {{settled and}} {{introduced}} {{the manufacture of}} <b>woollen</b> <b>cloth.</b> More Flemish weavers, fleeing the Huguenot persecutions, settled here in the 17th century. The second wave of settlers wove fustian, a rough cloth made of linen and cotton. Digging sea coal was recorded in 1374. There was an outbreak of the plague in the town in 1623.|$|E
5|$|To {{supplement}} their income, {{the inhabitants of}} Milnrow entered the domestic system, producing flannel and <b>woollen</b> <b>cloth</b> in purpose-built weavers' cottages, some of which from the Early Modern period have survived as listed buildings. Coalmining and metalworking also flourished in this period, but the Industrial Revolution supplanted the domestic industries and converted Milnrow into an urban mill town that mass-produced textile goods in cotton mills, such as Ellenroad Ring Mill (now a museum). The Milnrow Urban District was established in 1894 and was governed thereafter by its own district council until its abolition in 1974.|$|E
5|$|During the Tudor {{period the}} Reformation {{produced}} a gradual shift to Protestantism, {{and much of}} London passed from church to private ownership. <b>Woollen</b> <b>cloth</b> was shipped undyed and undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries, where it was considered indispensable. But the reach of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England {{were likely to be}} Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity. The Royal Exchange was founded. Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.|$|E

25|$|Leeds {{was mainly}} a {{merchant}} town, manufacturing <b>woollen</b> <b>cloths</b> and trading with Europe via the Humber estuary {{and the population}} grew from 10,000 {{at the end of}} the seventeenth century to 30,000 {{at the end of the}} eighteenth. As a gauge of the importance of the town, by the 1770s Leeds merchants were responsible for 30% of the country's woollen exports, valued at £1,500,000 when 70 years previously Yorkshire accounted for only 20% of exports.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, the River Aire was navigable to Knottingley, and boats {{carrying}} up to 30tons {{traded on the}} river, which was tidal up to this point. The traders of Leeds were keen to have a navigable link to the town, to make easier the export of <b>woollen</b> <b>cloth,</b> but bills presented to Parliament in 1621 and 1625 had failed. William Pickering, who was mayor of Leeds, had made further attempts to obtain an act of Parliament for improvements to the river in 1679, again without success. As the 1600s drew to a close, a number of bills were passed for other rivers, and there was general support for river navigations. A bill was drawn up in 1698, with support from wool traders in Leeds and general merchants in Wakefield. John Hadley surveyed the Aire, and Samuel Shelton surveyed the Calder. Although the bill {{had a lot of}} support, it was opposed by the City of York, who feared that the River Ouse would be damaged by the scheme.|$|E
25|$|Leeds {{developed}} as a market town in the Middle Ages {{as part of the}} local agricultural economy. Before the Industrial Revolution, it became a co-ordination centre for the manufacture of <b>woollen</b> <b>cloth,</b> and white broadcloth was traded at its White Cloth Hall.|$|E
25|$|The cioareci are peasant pants {{of white}} <b>woollen</b> <b>cloth</b> (dimie, pănură or aba) woven in four threads, {{therefore}} thicker than the ițari.

Here, they are also known as bernevici.|$|E
50|$|Chain stitch, {{which is}} {{adaptable}} and {{relatively easy to}} create, was used in Persia for Resht embroidery, with densely worked flowers and arabesques on felted <b>woollen</b> <b>cloths.</b> A type of embroidery similar to heavy chain stitch, known as kurar, was previously used by Bedouin to create dresses {{for both men and}} women. It required four people, with each person carrying four threads which were either of varying colors or silver and gold.|$|R
40|$|After a {{visit of}} Return, a trade ship of English East India Company, to Japan in 1673 to re-open trade with Japan, was refused by Tokugawa Shogunate, the Company {{continued}} {{to try to}} sell English wool to Japan and Taiwan through various routes. A factory was established in Taiwan and asked the king of Taiwan to carry English wool to Japan. But Taiwan merchants {{refused to accept the}} company's request saying that Japanese merchants might dislike buying English wool. Dutch East India Company may buy English <b>woollen</b> <b>cloths</b> in Bantam or in Batavia from English Company and bring them to Amoy and Nagasaki. English Company's documents in British Library reveal English <b>woollen</b> <b>cloths</b> were not well bought in Amoy, and loaded them in a returning ship to Surat, India, via Taiwan. Ching dynasty prohibited the merchants of coastal area to trade freely with foreign merchants till Ching's army did overcome the rule of the family of Cheng Ch'eng-kung, 'Coxinga', Taiwan king, in 1682. Then, in 1684, the government changed trade policy and let foreign traders have contact with Chinese ones under the strict regulation of Ching Government in Canton. But in Japan the strict trade regulation of European goods still existed after 1673. Only little amount of <b>woollen</b> <b>cloths</b> was permitted to be bought by Japanese wealthy people. After 1684 Chinese adventurers into South East Asia increased their number and settled in various plantations there. Pirates in East Chine Sea became regulated by coastal guards of Ching dynasty, less smuggling prevailed since then. The Dutch and English East India Company tried to get copper from logistics between Asian nations. But triangle trade system by European companies did have a hard time to manage through in {{the last decade of the}} seventeenth century...|$|R

Solomon was committed for trial and lodged in Newgate Prison.|$|E
25|$|Piece Hall is {{the former}} cloth hall, where pieces of <b>woollen</b> <b>cloth</b> were traded. Opened on 1 January 1779, trading took place for two hours on a Saturday morning {{in a total of}} 315 {{merchant}} trading rooms. After the mechanisation of the cloth industry, the Piece Hall became a public market. Piece Hall is host to many arts, crafts and independent shops. It is currently closed to the public for redevelopment, and due to be fully reopened in 2017.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of <b>woollen</b> <b>cloth</b> was well established {{here by the}} time of Queen Elizabeth I. It expanded rapidly after the late 18thcentury. The first textile mill was built at Dogley in about 1787 and used waterpower to prepare wool for spinning and for fulling the finished cloth. In about 1800 another mill opened at Linfit, which used steam power. Both mills gradually took on other processes and developed into substantial businesses under the Kenyon and Hey families. By 1880 there were eight mills at work in the township.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Brief {{description}} of about 500 cloth fragments found during excavations in caves in the Bandiagara cliff (Mali). The majority {{dates from the}} XI th up till the XVth century and {{could be attributed to}} the Tellem culture. Some more recent cloths (XVIIth-XVIIIth century ?) are probably of Dogon origin.

5000|$|According to The New Gazetteer of Lancashire (1830) the Irk had [...] "more mill seats upon it {{than any}} other stream of its length in the Kingdom" [...] and [...] "the eels in this river were {{formerly}} remarkable for their fatness, which was attributed to the grease and oils expressed by the mills from the <b>woollen</b> <b>cloths</b> and mixed with the waters." [...] However, {{by the start of}} the 20th century the Irk Valley between Crumpsall and Blackley had been left a neglected river, [...] "not only the blackest but the most sluggish of all rivers".|$|R
50|$|All {{differences}} between {{old and new}} customs and subsidies had disappeared under the Commonwealth. The General or Great Statute (1660) provided a scale of duties, 5% on imports and exports, with special duties on wines and <b>woollen</b> <b>cloths</b> accompanied by a new book of rates. A house tax levied after the French pattern on each hearth, was introduced and established in 1662. Poll taxes were used as an extraordinary resource, as were the last subsidies, voted in 1663, and then forever abandoned. Licences on retailers and fees on law proceedings were further aids to revenue, which, in the later years of Charles II, and in the short reign of his successor, was kept up {{to the level of}} increasing expenditure, but only with difficulty.|$|R
25|$|The {{explosive}} {{growth of the}} textiles industries in several specialized Dutch cities, like Enschede (<b>woollen</b> <b>cloth),</b> Haarlem (linen), and Amsterdam (silk) was mainly caused by the influx of skilled workers and capital from the Southern Netherlands in the final decades of the 16th century, when Calvinist entrepreneurs and workers were forced to leave the Spanish-dominated areas. It was therefore not due to a specific technological development, but more {{to the fact that}} a whole industry migrated, lock, stock, and barrel, to the Northern Netherlands, thus reinvigorating the northern textile industry, that had been moribund before the Revolt.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electrostatic}} generators {{are called}} friction machines {{because of the}} friction in the generation process. A primitive form of frictional machine was invented around 1663 by Otto von Guericke, using a sulphur globe that could be rotated and rubbed by hand. It may not actually have been rotated during use and {{was not intended to}} produce electricity (rather cosmic virtues), but inspired many later machines that used rotating globes. Isaac Newton suggested the use of a glass globe instead of a sulphur one. Francis Hauksbee improved the basic design, with his frictional electrical machine that enabled a glass sphere to be rotated rapidly against a <b>woollen</b> <b>cloth.</b>|$|E
25|$|Surrey's most {{significant}} source of prosperity in the later Middle Ages was the production of <b>woollen</b> <b>cloth,</b> which emerged during that period as England's main export industry. The county was an early centre of English textile manufacturing, benefiting from the presence of deposits of fuller's earth, the rare mineral composite important {{in the process of}} finishing cloth, around Reigate and Nutfield. The industry in Surrey was focused on Guildford, which gave its name to a variety of cloth, gilforte, which was exported widely across Europe and the Middle East and imitated by manufacturers elsewhere in Europe. However, as the English cloth industry expanded, Surrey was outstripped by other growing regions of production.|$|E
60|$|Putting a large {{key into}} the lock, Lumley turned it with all due solemnity, for it was his plan among savages to make all acts of {{importance}} as impressive as possible in their eyes. And this act of visiting {{for the first time}} the stores--the palace of wealth--the abode of bliss--the red-man's haven of rest--was a very important act. It may not seem so to the reader, but it was so to the savage. The very smell of the place was to him delicious--and no wonder, for even to more cultivated nostrils there is an odour about the contents of a miscellaneous store--such as tea, molasses, grindstones, coffee, brown paper, <b>woollen</b> <b>cloths,</b> sugar, fish-hooks, raisins, scalping-knives, and soap--which is pleasantly suggestive.|$|R
60|$|Some {{of those}} Flemings were induced {{to come to}} England in this reign too, and to settle in Norfolk, where they made better <b>woollen</b> <b>cloths</b> than the English had ever had before. The Order of the Garter (a very fine thing in its way, but hardly so {{important}} as good clothes for the nation) also dates from this period. The King {{is said to have}} picked 'up a lady's garter at a ball, and to have said, Honi soit qui mal y pense--in English, 'Evil be to him who evil thinks of it.' The courtiers were usually glad to imitate what the King said or did, and hence from a slight incident the Order of the Garter was instituted, and became a great dignity. So the story goes.|$|R
5000|$|Unusually for a foreigner, Spinola {{was fully}} naturalised in 1552, {{which gave him}} the right to pay taxes and customs dues at the rates applied to the English. In 1559 he was an {{exporter}} of <b>woollen</b> <b>cloths</b> and an importer of wines. In 1561, he confessed to exporting another trader's goods on his own licence: [...] "27th Dec. 1561.

25|$|Colbert {{then saw}} Pierre-Paul Riquet and his {{project as a}} way to pursue a policy of {{economic}} expansion in the service of absolutism in Languedoc. In fact, Riquet proposed himself to implement the salt tax and to build the Canal du Midi. Thus, the construction of the canal would permit the creation of a direct passage between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic without passing through the Strait of Gibraltar controlled by the Spaniards, the aim being to destroy the Spanish trade and establish a commercial flow through Languedoc. The Languedoc region had many resources such as wheat, wine from Minervois, <b>woollen</b> <b>cloth,</b> silk, and salt which producers were struggling to export due to lack of trade. By passing through the Canal du Midi, Colbert hoped to distribute goods in the different regions of le Midi to strengthen royal power and open up Toulouse and its region.|$|E

500|$|In {{the north}} of the county, in and around the Teifi Valley, there was a {{thriving}} woollen industry in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Here water-power provided the energy to drive the looms and other machinery at the mills. The village of Dre-fach Felindre at one time contained twenty-four mills and was known as the [...] "Huddersfield of Wales". The demand for <b>woollen</b> <b>cloth</b> declined in the twentieth century and so did the industry.|$|E
5000|$|Since the 18th century, {{especially}} in the 20th century, along with the metal processing, the processing of wool and silk, etc., went also on. In the Grand Bazaar of Gjakova felt <b>cloth,</b> <b>woollen</b> and silk fabrics (<b>cloths),</b> <b>woollen</b> and silk pipings (galloons) etc. used to be produced and sold in great amounts and were exported in even greater amounts in the markets and fairs of the neighboring provinces of Balkan countries, in Medieval countries and in Central European countries, too. Beautiful and high quality carpets and rugs were produced and sold there. The year book ("Salname") of Prizren Vilayet of 1874 used to mention the great number of tailors (“terzis”), tanners (“tabaks”) and embroiderers. The tailors used to work, according to it, first class cord dolmans and waistcoats for women and men, but these products used to meet only the country's needs. But for their own needs, the inhabitants of kasaba (the town) used to produce a kind of rough <b>woollen</b> cloth-worsted <b>cloth.</b> This shows that the textile artisan production had exceeded the patriarchal borders and had entered widely into the road of production of goods for market.|$|R
50|$|The {{seeds are}} sown from December to January in small plots (almacigas) {{sheltered}} from the sun, {{and the young}} plants when at 40 to 60 cm in height are placed in final planting holes (aspi), or if the ground is level, in furrows (uachos) in carefully weeded soil. The plants thrive best in hot, damp and humid locations, such as the clearings of forests; but the leaves most preferred are obtained in drier areas, on the hillsides. The leaves are gathered from plants varying in age from {{one and a half}} to upwards of forty years, but only the new fresh growth is harvested. They are considered ready for plucking when they break on being bent. The first and most abundant harvest is in March after the rainy season, the second {{is at the end of}} June, and the third in October or November. The green leaves (matu) are spread in thin layers on coarse <b>woollen</b> <b>cloths</b> and dried in the sun; they are then packed in sacks, which must be kept dry in order to preserve the quality of the leaves.|$|R
