We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
500|$|The {{two songs}} {{performed}} by Artie and Quinn were not reviewed as enthusiastically. Both Futterman and Slezak {{approved of the}} harmonies in [...] "I'm Still Standing", though Futterman thought the number felt [...] "more subdued than we'd expect", and Slezak wrote that [...] "the song choice <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a groaner" [...] before he appended a [...] "B" [...] grade. Chaney gave the song a [...] "C" [...] and said that [...] "something about this segment wasn’t as dynamic {{as it should have}} been". Votta and Strecker both described the performance as [...] "pleasant", the latter also added a [...] "B−" [...] grade. Strecker gave a [...] "B" [...] to the other song, [...] "Up Up Up", which she said was [...] "mostly background music" [...] and the song itself [...] "not particularly memorable". Chaney's [...] "B" [...] was far more complimentary: she characterized the performance as [...] "the most energetic set piece of the night" [...] which [...] "made nice use of the infectious Givers song". Futterman thought that [...] "the sugary vocals work well for Artie and Quinn", but Votta wrote that [...] "the vocal is so indistinct it could be anyone".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire that appeared in early August 2016, Eastwood discussed Donald Trump and how this generation, as he put it, is a [...] "pussy generation." [...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I'm sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tomkinson {{thinks the}} impure motives behind {{the idea of}} God being pure spirit are only too obvious. He says it was {{originally}} a pagan form of self-flattery to imagine there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> God in us all. He traces its history from Nimrod, through Pythagoras to Pliny the Elder and tells how they loved to commission statues of themselves to impress others. Scriptural literalists (from Augustine to Richard Baxter) fall into a similar error of human imaginings. Yet there was always an underground stream of the truth. He cites the followers of Sabilis which we would probably label Sabellianism. Also the Athrapamorphets. These truth-sayers were persecuted by the dominant culture due to the take-over of the church {{by the state and}} because the Apostles [...] "preached the faith in a personal God, but in that they clothed it within the appellation of several titles, it appeared more intricate and mysterious" [...] than it really was.|$|E
2500|$|Nalbandian did {{not reach}} another Wimbledon final in 2003, as he was knocked out in the round of 16 by Tim Henman. He did however have an {{impressive}} run at the U.S. Open, taking out both of the Wimbledon finalists 20th seed Mark Philippoussis and second seed Roger Federer {{on the way to}} a semifinal matchup with Andy Roddick. It was the second time in less than a month that he had met Roddick in a high-stakes match, having lost to him in the final of the Rogers Cup a few weeks earlier. Nalbandian started strongly, taking a two sets to love lead, and held a match point in the third-set tiebreak. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> controversy during the match, when a fan yelled [...] "out" [...] at 7–7 in the tiebreak, causing Nalbandian to mishit his following shot when he thought the linesman was the one who called it. Roddick took the point and eventually prevailed in the tiebreak. Ultimately, he was unable to finish the match off and eventually lost 6–7, 3–6, 7–6, 6–1, 6–3. He finished 2003 ranked No. 8 in the world.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} by Warner Bros., using its new Vitaphone sound process. Vitaphone was originally intended for musical renditions, and The Jazz Singer follows this principle, with only the musical sequences using live sound recording. The moviegoers were electrified when the silent actions were interrupted periodically for a song sequence with real singing and sound. Jolson's dynamic voice, physical mannerisms, and charisma held the audience spellbound. Costar May McAvoy, according to author A. Scott Berg, could not help sneaking into theaters day after day as the film was being run. [...] "She pinned herself against a wall {{in the dark and}} watched the faces in the crowd. In that moment just before 'Toot, Toot, Tootsie,' she remembered, 'A miracle occurred. Moving pictures really came alive. To see the expressions on their faces, when Joley spoke to them ... you'd have thought they were listening to the voice of God.'" [...] "Everybody was mad for the talkies," [...] said movie star Gregory Peck in a Newsweek interview. [...] "I remember [...] 'The Jazz Singer,' [...] when Al Jolson just burst into song, and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> dialogue.

[...] She said when the chance to portray Lexa presented itself, she was excited because {{of the quality of the}} show and its actors, and because the character allowed for a multifaceted dynamic; this resulted in Lexa being the character she has favored portraying thus far. [...] "Thankfully, (show creator) Jason , the creative team, the writers, and the hair and make-up are very collaborative," [...] Debnam-Carey said. [...] "They're really willing to create something.

2500|$|Much of the pregame hype {{surrounded}} {{the conflict between}} Parcells and Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Kraft {{took control of the}} team after Parcells was hired, {{and the two of them}} had different ideas on how to run the organization. Six days before the Super Bowl, in an article by Will McDonough, the Boston Globe reported Parcells would leave the Patriots after the Super Bowl to become the coach of the New York Jets. The book Patriot Reign alleges the Patriots have cell phone records showing Parcells was in constant contact with the Jets during the week. Then-Patriots defensive coordinator (and now head coach) Bill Belichick is quoted as saying Parcells' plans to leave for the Jets were a distraction, [...] "Yeah, I'd say it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a distraction all the way around. I can tell you first-hand, there was a lot of stuff going on prior to the game. I mean, him talking to other teams. He was trying to make up his mind about what he was going to do.
