5|$|In 1828 Alexandre Brongniart's son, the {{botanist}} Adolphe Brongniart, {{published the}} introduction to a longer work {{on the history of}} fossil plants. Adolphe Brongniart concluded that the history of plants could roughly be divided into four parts. The first period <b>was</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> cryptogams. The second period <b>was</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> the appearance of the conifers. The third period brought emergence of the cycads, and the fourth by the development of the flowering plants (such as the dicotyledons). The transitions between each of these periods was marked by sharp discontinuities in the fossil record, with more gradual changes within the periods. Brongniart's work is the foundation of paleobotany and reinforced the theory that life on earth had a long and complex history, and different groups of plants and animals made their appearances in successive order. It also supported the idea that the Earth's climate had changed over time as Brongniart concluded that plant fossils showed that during the Carboniferous the climate of Northern Europe must have been tropical.|$|E

Later researchers confirmed the existence and widespread European distribution of this taxon. Tuomikoski's use of the name S.cyanea, however, was incorrect as Bolton's type refers to the purple-brown spored species S.aeruginosa. Despite this, the misapplied name S.cyanea has persisted in some contemporary field guides.|$|E
