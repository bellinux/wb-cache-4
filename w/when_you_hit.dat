500|$|King told D. X. Ferris that [...] "whenever 'Raining Blood' {{comes in}} the set, it just electrifies the whole crowd. People just shit <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> the first few notes. Like 'Jesus Christ it's a guitar, settle down.'" [...] In the past, Slayer used fake blood to cover their bodies when {{performing}} the song live. However, when asked about using fake blood in future performances, King remarked [...] "It's time to move on, but never say never. I know Japan never saw it, South America and Australia never saw it. So you never know." ...|$|E
500|$|Hanneman and King's dual guitar solos {{have been}} {{referred}} to as [...] "wildly chaotic," [...] and [...] "twisted genius." [...] Original drummer Lombardo would use two bass drums (instead of a double pedal, which is used on a single bass drum). Lombardo's speed and aggression earned him the title of the [...] "godfather of double bass" [...] by Drummerworld. Lombardo stated his reasons for using two bass drums: [...] "When you hit the bass drum, the head is still resonating. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> it in the same place right after that, you kinda get a 'slapback' from the bass drum head hitting the other pedal. You're not letting them breathe." [...] When playing the two bass drums, Lombardo would use the [...] "heel-up" [...] technique.|$|E
500|$|As {{stated by}} Scott Shetler of AOL Radio and Matthew Horton of BBC, the song {{features}} an aggressive tone, and dizzying percussion and electro elements create a [...] "frenzied pace that Hilson matches with an intense vocal delivery." [...] During {{the bridge and}} the chorus, she utters gasps and groans, like 'oohs and aahs' while singing the lyrics. As the first verse begins, Hilson sings: [...] "Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / You know how I like it Daddy <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> the spot / Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / Imma take control when I climb up on top". As the song progresses, Hilson sings that she is [...] "so good, I'll make you think the bed is my workplace [...] Yeah, it's me, that's where you wanna be / I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] just before Ross's verse begins, seemingly summing up the image Hilson is going for: [...] "She looks like an angel, but she's sexy as hell." [...] As a whole, the lyrical arrangements are about sexual desire and not holding back.|$|E

2500|$|Motion capture {{was used}} to capture the {{character}} animations in the game. LucasFilm partner Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) generated the animation. The size of each character presented issues during development and developers had {{to find ways to}} adjust the moves, based on the opponent. For example: Chewbacca will throw lower punches when fighting Princess Leia. Each character averaged around 1,200 polygons, roughly twice the count of similar fighting games. In developing the button combo system the staff wanted buttons to have context with the character's movements. [...] "We want to make it so that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> the left button, you really hit with your left arm combo." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theodore Modis says [...] "nothing {{in nature}} follows a pure exponential" [...] and {{suggests}} the logistic function {{is a better}} fit for [...] "a real growth process". The logistic function looks like an exponential at first but then tapers off and flattens completely. For example world population and the United States's oil production both appeared to be rising exponentially, but both have leveled off because they were logistic. Kurzweil says [...] "the knee in the curve" [...] {{is the time when}} the exponential trend is going to explode, while Modis claims if the process is logistic <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> the [...] "knee" [...] the quantity you are measuring is only going to increase by a factor of 100 more.|$|E

2500|$|When Sebastian {{decided to}} record {{an album of}} Memphis soul {{classics}} it was suggested by Universal Music Publishing that Steve Cropper should be contacted {{to see if he}} would like to be involved. Cropper was interested, and he arranged for the other two members of The Mgs Donald 'Duck' Dunn and Steve Potts to participate. He also called in Lester Snell, who is a mainstay Memphis organ/keyboard player who has worked with artists including Eddie Floyd, David Porter and Isaac Hayes. The Memphis Album was recorded live on analogue tape at Ardent Studios Memphis in August 2007. The recording engineer Curry Weber explained the reason for this on AllMemphisMusic, an online Memphis radio station, [...] "Going to tape is just such a richer and warmer tone <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> it first of all. Not a lot of guys these days are talented enough to go to tape, cause it's so definitive and destructive. When you're on tape, it's on tape, and it's really hard to go in and fix a bunch of stuff like you can with computer these days." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a {{televised}} joint interview {{prior to their}} second bout in 1974, Ali continued to insult Frazier, who took exception to Ali calling him [...] "ignorant" [...] and challenged him to a fight, {{which resulted in the}} two of them brawling on the studio floor. Ali {{went on to win the}} 12 round non-title affair by a decision. Ali took things further in the build-up to their last fight, The Thrilla in Manila, and called Frazier [...] "the other type of negro" [...] and [...] "ugly", [...] "dumb" [...] and a [...] "gorilla" [...] At one point he sparred with a man in a gorilla suit and pounded on a rubber gorilla doll, saying [...] "This is Joe Frazier's conscience... I keep it everywhere I go. This is the way he looks <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> him." [...] According to the fight's promoter Don King, this enraged Frazier, who took it as a [...] "character assassination" [...] and [...] "personal invective". One night before the fight, Ali waved around a toy pistol outside Frazier's hotel room. When Frazier came to the balcony, he pointed the gun at Frazier and yelled [...] "I am going to shoot you." [...] After the fight, Ali summoned Frazier's son Marvis into his dressing room, and told him that he had not meant what he had said about his father. When informed of this by Marvis, Frazier responded: [...] "you ain't me, son. Why isn't he apologizing to me?" ...|$|E

When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like.

Upon his return to the Indians in 2011, the club again sported the high socks as a tribute. His batting stance featured him pointing his bat to center field prior to the pitch. Thome adopted this stance from Charlie Manuel, who was the Indians hitting coach, and since then Ryan Howard has also adopted it. Thome credits his calm demeanor to his role model during his early playing years, Eddie Murray, once commenting, [...] "Eddie taught me to play the game exactly the same <b>when</b> <b>you</b> fail and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> succeed. <b>Hit</b> a home run, hey, enjoy the moment, but then let it go.
