5|$|Elizabeth, firstly Countess of Holland and on <b>widowhood,</b> {{secondly}} Countess of Hereford (1282–1316). Among her eleven {{children were}} the earls of Hereford, Essex, and Northampton, and the countesses of Ormond and Devon.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} opened further for {{childbirth}} (defibulation or deinfibulation), and closed again afterwards (reinfibulation). Reinfibulation can involve cutting the vagina again {{to restore the}} pinhole size of the first infibulation. This might be performed before marriage, and after childbirth, divorce and <b>widowhood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although female life {{expectancy}} in Byzantium {{was lower than}} that of men, due to death in childbirth, wars and the fact that men married younger, female <b>widowhood</b> was still fairly common. Still, some women were able to circumvent societal strictures and work as traders, artisans, abbots, entertainers, and scholars.|$|E
5|$|Women {{have tended}} to be {{overlooked}} in Byzantine studies as Byzantine society left few records about them. Women were disadvantaged in some aspects of their legal status and in their access to education, and limited in their freedom of movement. The life of a Byzantine Greek woman could be divided into three phases: girlhood, motherhood, and <b>widowhood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aravan {{is known}} as Kuttantavar in the {{religious}} sect which bears his name, and {{in which he is}} the chief deity. His main temple is in Koovagam, Tamil Nadu. Here, the marriage of Aravan and Mohini, Krishna's female form, and her <b>widowhood</b> and mourning, after Aravan's sacrifice, forms the central theme of an 18-day annual festival either side of the night of the full moon in the Tamil month of Cittirai (April–May). The day of the full moon is the central day of the festival, when Aravan's sacrifice is ritually re-enacted.|$|E
5|$|At mid-afternoon, as the chariot reaches alukalam, Aravan is {{stripped}} to his skeletal straw body. Most Aravanis have left and men wedded to Aravan also break their thalis and bangles and perform all the rites of <b>widowhood</b> (the vellikkal rites) before {{the image of}} Aravan. Meanwhile, a paratiyar (Mahabharata-reciter) {{tells the story of}} the culmination of the war, symbolic of Aravan fulfilling his wish of seeing the war. Hiltebeitel suggests that while the Aravanis weep for Aravan's kalappali, the villagers weep for the death of an ancestor, as life leaves Aravan's head at the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|During Queen Victoria's <b>widowhood,</b> Edward {{pioneered the}} idea of royal public {{appearances}} as we understand them today—for example, opening the Thames Embankment in 1871, the Mersey Tunnel in 1886, and Tower Bridge in 1894—but his mother did not allow Edward {{an active role in}} the running of the country until 1898. He was sent summaries of important government documents, but she refused to give him access to the originals. He annoyed his mother by siding with Denmark on the Schleswig-Holstein Question in 1864 (she was pro-German) and in the same year annoyed her again by making a special effort to meet Giuseppe Garibaldi. Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone sent him papers secretly. From 1886, Foreign Secretary Lord Rosebery sent him Foreign Office despatches, and from 1892 some Cabinet papers were opened to him.|$|E
5|$|Sitric {{married an}} unnamed sister of Æthelstan in 926. Historians {{generally}} describe her as Æthelstan's only full sister, but Maggie Bailey {{points out that}} this rests on the late testimony of William of Malmesbury, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes no such distinction when recording her marriage to Sitric. William did not know her name, but traditions first recorded at Bury in the early twelfth century identify her as Saint Edith of Polesworth. The truth of his identification is debated, but regardless of her name {{it is likely that}} she entered a nunnery in <b>widowhood.</b> According to some late sources, such as the chronicler John of Wallingford, Amlaíb Cuarán was the son of Sitric and this West Saxon princess.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata portrays Iravan as dying {{a heroic}} {{death in the}} 18-day Kurukshetra War (Mahabharata war), the epic's main subject. However, the South Indian cults have a {{supplementary}} tradition of honouring Aravan's self-sacrifice to the goddess Kali to ensure her favour and {{the victory of the}} Pandavas in the war. The Kuttantavar cult focuses on one of the three boons granted to Aravan by the god Krishna in honour of this self-sacrifice. Aravan requested that he be married before his death. Krishna satisfied this boon in his female form, Mohini. In Koovagam (கூவாகம்), Tamil Nadu, this incident is re-enacted in an 18-day festival, first by a ceremonial marriage of Aravan to ThiruNangais and male villagers (who have taken vows to Aravan) and then by their <b>widowhood</b> after ritual re-enactment of Aravan's sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Victoria was {{physically}} unprepossessing—she was stout, dowdy {{and only about}} five feet tall—but she succeeded in projecting a grand image. She experienced unpopularity during {{the first years of}} her <b>widowhood,</b> but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s, when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure. Only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public. Biographies of Victoria written before much of the primary material became available, such as Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria of 1921, are now considered out of date. The biographies written by Elizabeth Longford and Cecil Woodham-Smith, in 1964 and 1972 respectively, are still widely admired. They, and others, conclude that as a person Victoria was emotional, obstinate, honest, and straight-talking.|$|E
5|$|In North Indian manuscripts of the Ramayana, some interpolations {{elaborate}} Tara's lament. Tara {{mentions the}} hardships of <b>widowhood</b> and prefers death to it. She blames Rama for unjustly killing Vali and tells him {{that if they had}} forged an alliance, Vali could have helped him recover Sita. Tara invokes the power of her chastity and curses Rama so that he will soon lose Sita after he regains her. She declares that Sita will return to the earth. The curse also appears in the North-western Indian manuscripts. In several vernacular adaptations of the Ramayana like the Oriya Vilanka Ramayana by Sarala Dasa, Tara's curse is reiterated. Apart from the usual curse to Rama of his separation from Sita, in the Bengali Krittivasi Ramayana, Tara additionally curses Rama that in his next birth, he will be killed by Vali. The Mahanataka and the Ananda Ramayana narrate that Vali is reborn as the hunter who kills Krishna, Rama's next birth.|$|E
5|$|Marriages {{were often}} {{the subject of}} careful negotiations, {{particularly}} higher in society. Marriage lost its sacramental status at the Reformation and irregular marriage continued to be accepted as valid throughout the period. Women managed the household and might work beside their husbands and, although obedience to husbands was stressed, {{this may have been}} limited in practice. Divorce developed after the Reformation and was available for a wider range of causes and accessed by a much larger section of society than in England. Because of high mortality rates <b>widowhood</b> was a relatively common state, and some women acquired independence and status, but others were forced into a marginal existence and remarriage was common. The elaborate funerals and complex system of prayers for the dead that dominated in late Medieval Scotland were removed at the Reformation and simpler services adopted. Burial inside the church was discouraged. As a result separate aisles for the rich and graveyards with stone markers for the majority became common.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March 1773, Edgeworth's {{first wife}} Anna Maria Elers {{gave birth to}} their fifth child, Anna Maria Edgeworth, {{at the age of}} 29. Ten days later she died from puerperal fever. Edgeworth was still in Lyon to avoid temptation leaving his {{expectant}} wife in the care of Day. On learning of the death of his wife, Edgeworth travelled to London, where he consulted Day as to Honora Sneyd's situation. On learning that she remained in good health and unattached, he promptly headed to Lichfield to see Honora at the Sneyds, with the intention of proposing. His offer was accepted immediately, and {{there was no mention of}} the conventional waiting period before remarrying after <b>widowhood.</b> Although Mr. Sneyd was opposed to his daughter's marriage, the couple were married at Lichfield Cathedral on 17 July 1773, officiated by Canon Thomas Seward, Anna Seward being a bridesmaid. After marrying, problems with the Edgeworth family estates in Ireland required the couple to immediately move to Edgeworthstown, County Longford in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} {{also stated}} that the flag was once held in an iron chest, within Dunvegan Castle. The key to the chest was then always {{in the possession of}} the hereditary flag bearers. The c.1800 manuscript related how, on the death of the MacLeod chief Tormod, son of lain Breac, the succession to the chiefship nearly fell to the family of the MacLeods of Talisker. The young widow of the last chief refused to give up Dunvegan Castle to the next heir, knowing herself to be pregnant (although she had only been married six weeks previous to her <b>widowhood).</b> In time, she gave birth to Tormod, the next chief. The c.1800 manuscript stated that at around this time, a man who wished to curry favour with the expectant heir (MacLeod of Talisker) attempted to steal the flag. Even though the Fairy Flag was later found, both the staff and iron chest were never seen again. Historically, the old chief, Tormod (son of Iain Breac), died in the autumn of 1706, and his son, Tormod, was born in July 1705.|$|E
5|$|The {{requisite}} Papal dispensation {{was obtained}} dated 22 April 1472. Michael Hicks {{has suggested that}} the terms of the dispensation deliberately understated the degrees of consanguinity between the couple, and the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first degree consanguinity following George's marriage to Anne's sister Isabel. First degree consanguinity applied in the case of Henry VIII and his brother's widow Catherine of Aragon. In their case the papal dispensation was obtained after Catherine declared the first marriage had not been consummated. In Richard's case, there would have been first degree consanguinity if Richard had sought to marry Isabel (in case of <b>widowhood)</b> after she had married his brother George, but no such consanguinity applied for Anne and Richard. Richard's marriage to Anne was never declared null, and it was public to everyone including secular and canon lawyers for 13 years.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Veerashaivaism was revolutionary and {{challenged}} the prevailing Hindu caste system which retained royal support. The social {{role of women}} largely depended on their economic status and level of education in this relatively liberal period. Freedom was more available to women in the royal and affluent urban families. Records describe the participation {{of women in the}} fine arts, such as Chalukya queen Chandala Devi's and Kalachuris of Kalyani queen Sovala Devi's skill in dance and music. The compositions of thirty Vachana women poets included the work of the 12th-century Virashaiva mystic Akka Mahadevi whose devotion to the bhakti movement is well known. Contemporary records indicate some royal women were involved in administrative and martial affairs such as princess Akkadevi, (sister of King Jayasimha II) who fought and defeated rebellious feudals. Inscriptions emphasise public acceptance of <b>widowhood</b> indicating that Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow used to immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre) though present was on a voluntary basis. Ritual deaths to achieve salvation were seen among the Jains who preferred to fast to death (Sallekhana), while people of some other communities chose to jump on spikes (Shoolabrahma) or walking into fire on an eclipse.|$|E
25|$|Princess Tamar, {{who married}} Shirvanshah Manuchehr III (died c. 1154), {{and became a}} nun in <b>widowhood.</b>|$|E

25|$|It {{was in his}} mother’s {{memory that}} Loomba set up his charity, The Loomba Foundation, which works to raise {{awareness}} of the issue of <b>widowhood</b> and which raises funds to educate the children of poor widows in India and empower widows in other developing countries in south Asia and across Africa. The flagship of the charity’s awareness campaign is International Widows Day, which takes place annually on 23 June, the anniversary of his mother’s <b>widowhood.</b> Following a sustained campaign, on 21 December 2010 the United Nations General Assembly formally recognised, by unanimous acclaim, 23 June as International Widows Day.|$|E
25|$|Friedrich Ratzel in The History of Mankind {{reported}} in 1896 {{that in the}} New Hebrides {{there was a kind}} of convention in cases of <b>widowhood,</b> that two widowers shall live with one widow.|$|E
25|$|Within the dharmashastric {{tradition}} espousing sati as a justified, {{and even}} recommended, option to ascetic <b>widowhood,</b> there remained a curious conception worth noting the achieved status {{for a woman}} committing sati. Burning herself on the pyre would give her, and her husband, automatic, but not eternal, reception into heaven (svarga), whereas only the wholly chaste widow living out her natural life span could hope for final liberation (moksha) and breaking the cycle of rebirth. Thus, acknowledging that performing sati only achieved an inferior otherworldy status than successful <b>widowhood</b> could achieve, sati became recommended when coupled with a dismissal of the effective possibility for a widow to remain truly chaste.|$|E
25|$|During her <b>widowhood</b> {{she often}} {{stayed at the}} Augustinian convent of San Clemente on San Gallo, where her sister Porzia was abbess. Giulia is {{recorded}} as a patron of this convent {{as well as other}} Augustinian convents.|$|E
25|$|As a princess, Clémentine was {{sought after}} as a bride by royal {{families}} throughout Europe. In 1836, it was rumoured that Clémentine would marry her cousin, Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, when {{the period of}} his <b>widowhood</b> expired.|$|E
25|$|During her <b>widowhood,</b> Maria Letizia {{maintained}} {{an open and}} scandalous relationship with a military man twenty years her junior. Upon her death on 25 October 1926, he was revealed to be the sole heir in her will, as her son died in 1918.|$|E
25|$|In the sadanku or puberty ceremonies, the devadasi-initiate begins her {{marriage}} with {{an emblem of}} the god borrowed from the temple as a stand-in 'bridegroom'. From then onward, the devadasi is considered a nitya sumangali: a woman eternally free from the adversity of <b>widowhood.</b>|$|E
25|$|Loomba {{has become}} {{well known for}} his {{fundraising}} and campaigning concerning the issue of <b>widowhood</b> in the developing world. His mother, Shrimati Pushpa Wati Loomba, was widowed {{at the age of}} 37 in India, and Loomba experienced first-hand the social and economic discrimination that widows in that country faced.|$|E
25|$|Everyone has {{the right}} to a {{standard}} of living adequate for {{the health and well-being of}} himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, <b>widowhood,</b> old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.|$|E
25|$|Training {{methods are}} {{as varied as}} the pigeons themselves. Some fanciers believe their system is the secret to their success and guard these hard learned lessons closely. Most fanciers will explain their basic {{strategy}} but some may be reluctant to share the details of their success. One of the most popular systems is <b>widowhood.</b> This system uses the birds desire to reproduce as motivation to try to give the bird a sense of urgency on race day. The use of <b>widowhood</b> is usually begun by first allowing the racer to raise a baby in their nest box. After the baby is weaned the hen is removed and often the nestbox is closed off, from then on the only time these birds are allowed to see their mate or enter the nest box is upon returning from training or a race. This conditioning {{is one of the key}} elements in a lot of racing programs.|$|E
25|$|A strong-willed, {{independent}} and unconventional woman, she caused a royal scandal when in 1902 {{she had a}} child fathered by her personal secretary. In her <b>widowhood,</b> she lived {{most of the year}} in the South of France. During World War I, she decided to settle in neutral Switzerland, living in Lausanne. She died after a stroke a few years later.|$|E
25|$|Her home in Boston, {{after her}} marriage, was a {{delightful}} one. Her house was soon a centre of attraction; and, surrounded by friends, she exercised there a gracious hospitality, and met {{the men and}} women who made the Boston of that epoch famous. Here was born her daughter, Florence, who later married William Sehaefer, of South Carolina. Here her husband died, and here she has remained through the days of her <b>widowhood</b> till the house become historic.|$|E
25|$|The Nigerian society (both {{historical}} and contemporary) has been dotted with peculiar cultural {{practices that are}} potently hurtful to women’s emancipation, such as early/forced marriage, wife-inheritance and <b>widowhood</b> practices. As daughters self-identify as females with their mother and sisters, and sons as males with their father and brothers, gender stereotyping becomes institutionalized within the family unit. Also, the dominant narratives of religion in both colonial and post-colonial Nigerian society privileges men at the detriment of women, even in educational accessibility.|$|E
25|$|Elliot's wife {{accompanied}} him to Guiana from 1830 to 1833, and to China from 1834 to 1841 {{as well as}} to all of his subsequent postings around the world. After ten years of <b>widowhood,</b> she died on 17 October 1885 aged 80 years at the home of her husband's nephew Capt (RN retired) Hugh Maximilian Elliot, The Bury, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. She is buried at the Heath Lane Cemetery, Hemel Hempstead where a stone cross bears a worn inscription to her memory.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of <b>widowhood,</b> Maria Isabella was still young, with a will to live and a certain beauty, despite her {{increasing}} obesity. Surrounded by admirers, she had a weakness for handsome officials younger than her. According to court rumors, she took lovers. Her behavior made her an easy target for libels and exasperated Ferdinand II. Maria Isabella was kind to her daughter-in-law Maria Cristina of Savoy, who married Ferdinand II on 21 November 1832. The new queen achieved a reconciliation between mother and son.|$|E
25|$|In her <b>widowhood,</b> Maria Alexandrovna {{continued}} to live in Coburg. The outbreak of World War I divided her sympathies. She sided with Germany against her native Russia. Her only surviving brother, Grand Duke Paul, her nephew Tsar Nicholas II and many other relatives were killed during the Russian Revolution and she lost her considerable fortune. From 1893 until her death, she had {{the distinction of being}} a Russian grand duchess (by birth), a British princess and royal duchess (by marriage), and the consort (and later widow) of a German sovereign duke.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} is {{not allowed}} to a Muslim woman during menstruation, postpartum period, during fasting and certain religious activities, disability and in iddah after divorce or <b>widowhood.</b> Homosexual relations and same sex marriages are forbidden to women in Islam.
