5|$|One {{person could}} say that 'Hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write to me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide {{every day of my}} life for the last ten years until I heard that song, and I realized, after all, I can be my own hero,' and that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> you know?

5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E

500|$|The book {{notes the}} artist's {{reluctance}} {{to be interviewed}} or engage with the public, and quotes him as saying: [...] "It's {{very hard for me}} to relate to people asking questions that are not only boring but don't have anything to do <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> ... It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what I really want to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E
500|$|Vocalist Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic, which aided {{the grieving}} process. He commented, [...] "you {{have to get}} back on the horse.

I'm a musician. I'm going to make music. What Dime would have told me was, 'You make music, motherfucker. Get back on it. Do what you do.' So, that's what I did." [...] Before the shooting, Phil Anselmo made the statement [...] "Dimebag deserves to be severely beaten" [...] in the December 2004 edition of Metal Hammer. He denied making the comments and apologized, although Abbott requested Metal Hammer to provide the audio tapes to prove the authenticity of what Anselmo said. Abbott found the quote authentic and referred to him as the [...] "master of lies".|$|E
500|$|Lundgren {{has said}} that, as a child, he was {{insecure}} and suffered from allergies, describing {{himself as a}} [...] "runt".

He took up Kyokushin karate at the age of 10, and began lifting weights as a teenager. Lundgren stated that [...] "My dad always told me that if I wanted to make something special <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I had to go to America." [...] After graduating from high school with straight As, he spent some time in the United States in the 1970s on various academic scholarships, studying chemical engineering at Washington State University and Clemson University. He studied chemical engineering for a year at Washington State University, [...] prior to serving his mandatory one year in the Swedish Marine Corps at the Amphibious Ranger School. [...] In the late 1970s, he enrolled at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and graduated with a degree in chemical engineering. The name [...] "Dolph" [...] comes from a distant relative of one of his first hamsters.|$|E

[...] "Out of Time" [...] {{was also one of}} the first songs written for the album, and was written while the band was in Australia. McKinnon said the song was the most personal on the record. Skaff had a major hand in writing [...] "If I Leave". The song describes [...] "different things you got through being on the road" [...] and [...] "a relationship ending when you're not really around enough to actually take care of it in person."

500|$|Soon after {{returning}} to England, Phips joined back up with Increase Mather and again supported him in dealing with Whitehall. Increase Mather's diary says they are together on March 25, 1691, and again on March 26. On March 31, they are together as Increase Mather writes {{a response to the}} Board of Trade. Also at this meeting is Sir Henry Ashurst. These three—Mather the clergyman, flanked by two knights: Sir Phips & Sir Ashurst—would emerge later as the major proponents of the various compromises that brought about a new charter. Not counting Phips, there seem to have been a total of four agents acting on behalf of Massachusetts in seeking to restore the old charter. The two agents holding official commission papers from the Massachusetts council—Cooke and Oakes—were also the least compromising and the least politically deft. The Board of Trade seems to have sought a policy of pushing through a new charter by cleaving the two knights away from these two agents. July 24, Increase Mather records in his diary that he would [...] "part <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> sooner than [...] ". Not long after this Increase Mather left London on vacation. August 11, 1691, a letter was written from Whitehall to the King William's secretary: [...] "I must now desire your Lordship to acquaint the King {{that they are willing to}} accept their Charter... and no longer Insist upon the Alterations mentioned..." [...] This could not have been Cooke and Oakes, as they never wavered in their stance opposing a new charter. Mather's diary entry one week later (August 19) indicates that he is still either unaware or has not yet accepted this move. On August 20, the Earl of Nottingham told a committee that he had been with Sir William Phips who informed him that the New England agents [...] "did acquiesce therein [...]" [...] By August 27, Increase Mather had decided to participate in the process of shaping this new charter, if reluctantly.|$|E
500|$|On January 25, 1994, the Chandlers' {{lawsuit was}} {{settled out of}} court with $15,331,250 to be held in a trust fund for Jordan, $1.5 million for each of his parents and the family's lawyer slated to receive $5 million for a total of {{approximately}} $23 million (although another source showed Feldman was to receive $3 million based on a September 1993 retainer, for a total of $21 million). According to a motion passed to Judge Melville in 2004, leading up to the 2005 trial, Evan Chandler himself is the one who initiated the settlement with Jackson's insurer. [...] Jackson's insurance company [...] "negotiated and paid the settlement, over the protests of Mr. Jackson and his personal legal counsel" [...] and was [...] "the source of the settlement amounts"; as noted in a 2005 memorandum in People v. Jackson. It also noted [...] "an insurance carrier has the right to settle claims covered by insurance where it decides settlement is expedient and the insured may not interfere with nor prevent such settlements", as established by a number of precedents in California. Defeating the right would involve convincing a court with the power to overrule the precedent that the earlier decision was either wrongly decided or more often, 'clearly' wrong (depending on the criteria of the court) or the court must be convinced to distinguish the case. That is, to make the ruling narrower than that in the precedent due to some difference in facts between the current and precedent case, while still supporting the result reached in the earlier case. In 2004, Jackson's attorney Thomas Mesereau in People v. Jackson said [...] "People who intended to earn millions of dollars from his record and music promotions did not want negative publicity from these lawsuits interfering with their profits. Michael Jackson now regrets making these payments. These settlements were entered into with one primary condition – that condition was that Mr. Jackson never admitted any wrongdoing. Mr. Jackson always denied doing anything wrong...Mr. Jackson now realizes the advice he received was wrong." [...] Jackson explained why had he tried to settle: [...] "I wanted to go on <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Too many people had already been hurt. I want to make records. I want to sing. I want to perform again...It's my talent. My hard work. My life. My decision." [...] He also wanted to avoid a [...] "media circus".|$|E
