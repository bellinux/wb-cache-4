25|$|Pignut hickory {{tends to}} develop a {{pronounced}} taproot with few laterals and is rated as <b>windfirm</b> (21). The taproot develops early, which may explain the slow growth of seedling shoots. Taproots may develop in compact and stony soils.|$|E
50|$|True hickories such as mockernut {{develop a}} long taproot with few laterals. The species is <b>windfirm.</b> Early root growth is {{primarily}} into the taproot, which typically reaches {{a depth of}} 30 to 91 cm during the first year. Small laterals originate along the taproot, but many die back during the fall. During the second year, the taproot may reach a depth of 122 cm, and the laterals grow rapidly. After 5 years, the root system attains its maximum depth, and the horizontal spread of the roots is about double that of the crown. By age 10, the height is 4 times {{the depth of the}} taproot.|$|E
40|$|A forest {{management}} plan for Kielder Forest District has been developed from earlier projects in Northumberland forests. It {{has been designed to}} cope with the {{forest management}} and landscape problems arising from the clear felling and re-stocking of large areas of even-aged forest in the Borders where windthrow is pre-valent and protection from deer is necessary. The aim has been to restructure the forest by creating distinct permanent felling coupes with relatively <b>windfirm</b> boundaries conforming to the scale and shape of the landscape. Thereafter the felling sequence for these new compartments has been arranged so far as possible to im-prove the distribution of age classes within the forest by exploiting any differences in species and rates of development in the present crops at different elevations. Dis-counted revenue (DR) losses for felling plans based on the new structure have been calculated. No significant losses arose from the new plans...|$|E
40|$|Forestry {{operations}} {{have long been}} understood to contribute to non-point source pollution. With the implementation of federal regulations to thwart such pollution and protect water quality, North Carolina adopted rules called Forest Practice Guidelines (FPGs). This research assesses the efficacy of a specific FPG called Streamside Management Zones (SMZs) for the North Carolina Forest Service (NCFS). Specifically, it examines whether SMZ characteristics influence tree windthrow and if such changes are related to differences in total suspended solids (TSS) levels in North Carolina Piedmont streams. Our results indicate that windthrow {{is more common in}} SMZs than in unharvested forest stands. We found that drivers of windthrow vary by location; slope, aspect, and distance to stream contribute to both increased and decreased probability of windthrow. Results also indicate differences in windprone species across sites, but similarities in <b>windfirm</b> species across sites. The majority of sites experienced greater windthrow of larger diameter trees. These results will help to inform the direction of future research conducted by the NCFS and to help develop guidance surrounding FPGs in North Carolina...|$|E
40|$|Live trees, {{standing}} dead trees, and downed logs {{have been}} retained in some forest harvest {{sites in the}} Pacific Northwest to fulfill various ecological objectives. To assess the fates of retained trees following partial cutting of mature forests in the central western Cascade Range in Oregon, we inventoried standing live and dead trees and toppled trees in 21 cutting units in 1993 and 2001. In 1993, 1 – 10 years after cutting, an average of 65 % of the initially retained trees (average of counts for all sites) were alive and standing, 12 % had been toppled or topped by wind, 13 % had become snags by natural processes, and 10 % were converted to snags by management action, including cutting, blasting, girdling, and inoculation with fungi. By 2001, when cutting-unit ages ranged from 9 to 18 years, 54 % of the retained trees were alive and standing, 10 %– 21 % had been toppled or topped by wind, 11 %– 22 % had become snags by natural processes, and 14 % had been converted to snags by management action.

40|$|Routinely {{collected}} booking {{records of}} salvaged timber {{from the period}} 1979 – 2008 were used to empirically model the (1) storm damage probability; (2) proportions of storm-damaged timber and (3) endemic storm damage risk in the forest area of the German federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg by applying random forests. Results from cross-validated predictor importance evaluation demonstrate that the relative impact of modeled gust speed fields on the predictive accuracy of the random forests models was greatest compared {{to the impact of}} forest and soil features. Forest areas prone to storm damage occurring within a period of five years were mainly located in mountainous upland regions where maximum gust speed exceeds 31 m/s in a five-year return period and conifers dominate the tree species composition. While mean storm damage probability continuously increased with increasing statistical gust speed proportions of storm-damaged timber peaked at a statistical maximum gust speed value of 29 m/s occurring in a five-year return period. Combining the statistical gust speed field with daily gust speed fields of two exceptional winter storms improved model accuracy and considerably increased the explained variance. Endemic storm damage risk was calculated from endemic storm damage probability and proportions of endemically storm-damaged timber. In combination with knowledge of local experts the storm damage risk modeled in a 50 m × 50 m resolution raster dataset can easily be used to identify areas prone to storm damage and to adapt silvicultural management regimes to make forests more <b>windfirm...</b>|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Stream {{buffer strips}} are an {{important}} tool for protecting the stream environment. This research documents the losses from 40 stream buffer strips, in the Western Cascades of Oregon, established 1 to 15 years before the study. Predictive equations are developed which identify the major reasons for buffer strip losses. Losses from wind, sunscald, logging damage, and other factors were estimated. The effectiveness of buffer strips for stream shading was quantified. Wind is the major cause of stream buffer strip mortality. Damage from wind is often sudden, and catastrophic, while damage due to logging or disease and insects occurs at a slower rate. The average percent of standing timber remaining in the, stream buffer strips sampled was 84 percent, ranging from 22 to 100 percent. Additional losses occured over the winter of 1975 - 1976, amounting to 5 percent of an initial sample of 34 buffer strips. A second set of 6 buffer strips suffered a 52 percent loss. The combined array of buffer strips lost 13 percent additional volume in this relatively mild winter. Topography and uncut timber stand protection {{are the most important}} factors modifying the amount of windthrow in a buffer strip. The distance to the cutting line in the direction of damaging winds was the most important single variable influencing buffer strip survival, with increasing distances leading to significantly poorer survival. Two other significant protection factors were the distance and change in elevation from the buffer strip to the nearest major ridge in the direction of damaging winds. Nearby ridges and steeper slopes give better protection. Timber factors also influence stream buffer strip survival. Increasing values for the following timber factors are associated with significantly poorer survival: average stand height, average height of trees taller than 100 feet, number of trees per acre taller than 160 feet, original timber volume per acre, original basal area per acre, and average volume per tree. Western red cedar (Thuja plicata) was the most <b>windfirm</b> tree species, followed by western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and true fir (Abies EE), in decreasing order of windfirmness. Species tolerance to wet sites,. plus the timber factors described above, may help explain the windfirmness canking. Wet sites increase a tree's susceptibility to windthrow. Water table measurements in two buffer strips with windthrow indicated that the water table rose high enough to reach a tree's rooting zone, while the water table in a buffer strip without windthrow did not enter the root zone. Water tables within a tree's rooting zone may result in poorer rooting and tree anchorage The above factors, combined in multiple regression equations developed in this study, account for approximately 68 to 95 percent of the variation in predicting buffer strip survival. Measured buffer strip shading shows that a buffer strip 85 feet wide shades a stream as well as an average undisturbed canopy, while 75 percent of the undisturbed canopy shading can be achieved with a buffer strip 52 feet wide. Width alone is not adequate for buffer strip design as topographic, timber stand, and understory factors greatly influence stream shading. Windthrow in stream buffer strips poses a difficult salvage problem, and may also damage the stream environment. Therefore, on sites very susceptible to windthrow, the best stream protection alternative may be to carefully remove the streamside trees with directional falling methods...|$|E
