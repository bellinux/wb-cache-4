40|$|Abstract. The <b>Wireless</b> <b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Networks</b> (WLANs) {{are often}} used as a {{wireless}} extension to the typical office network infrastructure providing mobility to the users. In addition Wireless Personal <b>Area</b> <b>Networks</b> (WPANs) serve interconnection to computer and mobile phone peripherals as headsets, input devices, printers etc. Thus it is common that WLANs and WPANs have {{to operate in the}} same area. IEEE 802. 11 b/g is the most popular WLAN technology operating in the 2. 4 GHz Industrial Medical and Scientific (ISM) band. On the other hand Bluetooth (BT) is the technology often used to support WPANs. As BT also uses the 2. 4 GHz ISM band, there an issue of interference between WLANs and PANs. In this work the performance degradation in <b>Wireless</b> <b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Networks</b> and <b>Wireless</b> <b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Networks</b> due to coexistence is examined by real measurements. Both 802. 11 to 802. 11 and 802. 11 to Bluetooth coexistence is addressed...|$|R
