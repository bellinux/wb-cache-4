40|$|Experimental {{observations}} on large tokamaks {{show that the}} number of runaway electrons produced in disruptions depends sensitively on the magnetic field strength. The presence of a <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> <b>instability</b> (WWI) excited by runaway electrons may be the reason for this observation since the linear growth rates of these waves are such that they are stable for high magnetic field (so the runaway beam can form) but unstable for low magnetic field. The quasi-linear diffusion process due to the WWI represents a very efficient pitch-angle scattering mechanism for runaways and consequently may stop runaway beam formation. In this work, the criterion for runaway suppression by WWI is compared with a criterion for substantial runaway production obtained by calculating how many runaway electrons can be produced before the induced toroidal electric field diffuses out of the plasma...|$|E

40|$|Although <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> are {{studied for}} almost a century, they are still subject of intense research. Laboratory {{experiments}} are of particular value for the interpretation of satellite data, which is often ambiguous or at least difficult to understand. The linear plasma experiment VINETA, {{which is designed to}} form a large (4. 5 m column length, up to 40 cm diameter) and dense (n e ≤ 10 19 m – 3) plasma with great flexibility in the magnetic field configurations (max. field B 0 = 100 mT). In the present contribution we discuss investigations on electron <b>whistler</b> <b>waves,</b> right-hand polarised electromagnetic waves in the frequency range ω ci ce, and ion <b>whistler</b> <b>waves,</b> left-hand polarised electromagnetic waves below the ion cyclotron frequency ω ci. Firstly, the dispersion behaviour of electron <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> is studied at wavelength up to the plasma dimensions. For smaller wavelengths {{it turns out that the}} dispersion relation derived for unbounded <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> describes the experimental observations well. For wavelengths greater than the vacuum vessel diameter it is necessary to take the boundary into account. The transition between the two regimes is studied for constant plasma conditions. Secondly, ion <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> are considered. In a single-component plasma, the wave dispersion has a real solution only for frequencies below the ion cyclotron frequency ω ci. In a multicomponent plasma, the dispersion relation of ion <b>whistler</b> <b>waves</b> exhibit a different behaviour. In an intermediate frequency regime located between the two neighbouring ion cyclotron frequencies, the wave has a maximum group velocity. This feature is used as a diagnostic tool in satellite measurements to determine the ion composition in atmospheric plasmas, but the results have been subject of a scientific debate. Our laboratory study shows first results on ion <b>whistler</b> <b>wave</b> measurements and aims to contribute to clarify the discussed discrepancies...|$|R
