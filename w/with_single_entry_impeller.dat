The results show that: the internal flow field of the hydrocyclone is quite complicated, {{which means that the}} fluid flow parameters in the same location vary widely within different directions, such as track, velocity, separation and so on. The flows of cylindrical section and conical section are very different, at the same time, the main separation process is completed in the conical section.

It is proposed that matrix generators <b>with</b> <b>single</b> <b>entries</b> ± 1, ±i over a complex field are {{the building blocks of}} all physical states. The axiom that vacuum states have non-zero minima requires that all matrix elements are non-zero. In the paper [1], an extended curvature tensor was calculated and N= 6 d spaces were found. The 4 d Weyl spinors are local gauge invariant under SU(4) and a 4 d space metric. The transition of a space-like gamma matrix to time like gamma matrix results in the emergence of Space-Time. The dark sector consists of SU(4) gluons modifying the gravitational potential and the cosmological constant is the ground state of the asymmetric curvature scalar. SM fermion sector with 3 generations of quarks & leptons emerges from symmetry breaking of SU(4). ...|$|R

In addition, high non-incurring fabrication cost and manufacturing delays demand chips to be sold in large volume, thus targeting a larger market to be cost effective. How can we achieve performances comparable to customized solutions in a single chip design? The answer is Polymorphous Architecture.

40|$|Variable Geometry Turbines {{are widely}} used in High Pressure Loop Exhaust Gas Recirculation to enhance {{positive}} pressure gradient between turbine inlet and compressor outlet. Multiple-entry turbines (twin or double) can achieve an enhanced pulse energy extraction when compared <b>with</b> <b>single</b> <b>entry</b> devices. However, when EGR takes place, an imbalance of mass flow can lead to significant energy loss. This thesis presents the design and experimental assessment of a novel asymmetric double entry turbine that aims to achieve pulse energy recovery {{even in the face}} of high EGR. The asymmetric double entry volute was developed with two different scroll lengths: a small scroll that feeds the rotor between azimuth angle of 0 ° and 160 °, beyond which rotor is fed by the large scroll. A pivoting action is designed to enable an optimisation of the optimum angle in each scroll sector. Extensive testing was carried out to characterise the novel turbine under various steady and unsteady flow conditions (full, partial, unequal, in phase and out of phase). The peak recorded efficiency for the full admission nozzleless condition was found to be 78...|$|R
