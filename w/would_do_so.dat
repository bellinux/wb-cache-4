5|$|David Ogden Stiers as Fenton Q. Harcourt, a {{board member}} of the Smithsonian Institution who dismisses Milo's belief in the {{existence}} of Atlantis. Stiers previously worked with Michael J. Fox in Doc Hollywood. He earlier voice-acted for Disney in Beauty and the Beast as Cogsworth, Pocahontas as Governor Ratcliffe, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame as the Archdeacon and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> again in Lilo & Stitch as Jumba.|$|E
5|$|Working as an {{additional}} producer, Don Was helped keep Weiland's {{and the rest of}} the band's separate recording sessions in sync by bringing them together to perform live. When the band performed together, they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> acoustically, so each member could hear the nuances of the songs. Weiland credited Was for helping Stone Temple Pilots re-learn how to play together again. Was also worked closely with Weiland during the recording of the vocals.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{left the}} {{mainland}} on May 19, and his final stop was in Hawaii, {{where he was}} a guest of Admiral Felix Stump, the commander of United States Pacific Fleet. The reason for the visit was to discuss Diệm's concerns over America's reaction if South Vietnam came under communist attack. Stump reiterated Washington's opinions that nuclear weapons would be used to defend any anti-communist country that was attacked by communists, in accordance with public statements made by Eisenhower and Dulles. He said the Americans <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> by dropping nuclear weapons on communist China.|$|E

5|$|Republican {{legislative}} {{leaders said}} that they would not whip their members to vote for Shumlin, leaving them free to vote their consciences. Though Republican Lieutenant Governor Phillip Scott did not have a vote, he said that he would vote for Shumlin, and Republican State Representative Kurt Wright said that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Initially, no Democrats indicated that they would vote for Milne. Indeed, several Democrats whose districts voted for Milne over Shumlin {{said that they}} would vote for Shumlin, citing his plurality win.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Constantinople {{came as a}} {{shock to}} the papacy, which ordered an {{immediate}} counter-attack {{in the form of a}} crusade. Only Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy responded but under the condition that a powerful monarch assist him; however, none <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Pope Pius II then ordered another crusade. Again, no substantial efforts were seen by any of Europe's major leaders of the time. This forced the Pope himself to lead a crusade. His death in 1464 led to the disbanding of the crusade at the port of Ancona.|$|E
5|$|After {{disembarking}} in Sydney, {{the troops}} received {{three weeks of}} leave during which time {{they were allowed to}} return to their homes. The 9th Division then carried out welcome home marches across Australia, with the 2/15th taking part in the march through Brisbane. After this, the division was transported to Kairi on the Atherton Tableland in north Queensland where it was converted to the jungle establishment and began training for operations against the Japanese. The reorganisation saw the battalion establishment drop to around 800 men, and the loss of many vehicles and heavy equipment. Lieutenant Colonel Colin Henry Grace was appointed to command the battalion in May 1943 and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> {{for the rest of the}} war. Amphibious training was carried out at Trinity Beach, near Cairns, with the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment in July 1943.|$|E

5|$|Central to Gray's was {{the system}} shared across the Inns of Court of {{progress}} towards {{a call to}} the Bar, which lasted approximately 12 to 14 years. A student would first study at either Oxford or Cambridge University, or at one of the Inns of Chancery, which were dedicated legal training institutions. If he studied at Oxford or Cambridge he would spend three years working towards a degree, and be admitted to one of the Inns of Court after graduation. If he studied at one of the Inns of Chancery he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> for one year before seeking admission to the Inn of Court to which his Inn of Chancery was tied—in the case of Gray's Inn, the attached Inns of Chancery were Staple Inn and Barnard's Inn.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1853, Ezra and Oliver Meeker {{received}} a three-month-old letter from their father, stating {{that he and}} other family members wanted to emigrate, and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> if Oliver Meeker could return to assist them. They immediately responded that Oliver would return to Indiana by early the following year, and put their plans on hold to prepare for and finance his journey by steamship and rail. In August 1854, Ezra Meeker received word that his relatives were en route, but were delayed and short on provisions. He quickly went to their aid, intending to guide them through the Naches Pass into the Puget Sound area. When he found his family's party close to the first Fort Walla Walla (near Richland, Washington), he learned that his mother and a younger brother had died along the Trail. He guided the survivors through the pass and to his claim on McNeil Island.|$|E
5|$|Light {{wind shear}} and {{favorable}} ocean temperatures led to steady intensification of the storm, and satellite images indicated that an eye had developed late on August 31. Minimum pressure lowered to , and the maximum winds increased to 100mph, Category2 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm quickly reached Category3, a major hurricane, and soon after, Category4. As it did so, its eye became ragged, while its lateral {{movement to the}} northwest rose to 17mph around the southern periphery of a strong deep-layer ridge over the United States. By September 1, the hurricane reached its peak intensity of 160mph (260km/h) and a minimum pressure of 921mb (hPa). It had reached Category5, the second of three such powerful storms that <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> during the season.|$|E

5|$|Surprised by Aberhart's {{refusal to}} be drawn into open conflict, the insurgents needed time to {{reassess}} their strategy. They got that time when, on March17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day adjournment while the federal government selected a replacement. When the legislature reconvened March 22 or 23, the dissidents filibustered against the budget. Albert Bourcier opened debate, and was followed by, among others, Edith Rogers, Ansley, and Wilson Cain. On March24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections by a vote of 27 to 25. Though the insurgents considered this a vote of non-confidence in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> if the budget itself was defeated.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{producers}} knew that Macfayden {{would leave the}} series, {{they did not know}} when he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> and so the first two episodes were initially written without him. In either case, {{the producers}} created a new character, Adam Carter. In addition, the writers heavily researched the episodes; many of the story lines are based on truth. The producers also took information from advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The series was directed in five blocks of two episodes in each. Filming started in January 2004 and took place over six to seven months. Shooting took place almost entirely in London, England, with some scenes shot in a cross-English Channel ferry in the fifth episode.|$|E
5|$|Having {{finished}} his school career, Crawford joined the first MCC tour of South Africa in the 1905–06 season. The team {{was not particularly}} strong—before the tour, critics judged it to possess the equivalent strength of a moderate county side. The MCC was criticised by the press in both England and South Africa for omitting many of the strongest players. As {{the youngest member of}} the team, Crawford was given the traditional role of writing press reports to be sent back home during the tour. When the team played in Worcester during the tour, the local press carried a report that Crawford planned to remain in South Africa. The 1906 Wisden carried the same story; in a comment on his success in 1905, it suggested that it was uncertain for how long he would play, and questioned whether, if he played Test cricket, he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> for England or South Africa. The cricket historian Nigel Hart queries why Wisden mentioned South Africa; Crawford's only known connection came through his uncle, who had left South Africa five years before.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{agreement}} was ineffective in the meantime. The VNQDD kidnapped Giap and the Propaganda Minister Tran Huy Lieu and held them for three weeks until Ho agreed to remove Giáp and Lieu from the cabinet. As a result, the VNQDD's Vũ Hồng Khanh became defence minister, with Giap as his deputy. What the VNQDD and other non-communist nationalists thought to be an equitable power-sharing agreement {{turned out to be}} a ruse. Every non-communist minister had a communist deputy, and if the former refused to approve a decree, the Vietminh official <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Many ministers were excluded from knowing the details of their portfolio; Khanh was forbidden to see any military statistics and some were forbidden to attend cabinet meetings. In one case, the Minister of Social Works became a factory worker because he was forced to remain politically idle. Meanwhile, Giáp was able to stymie the activities of VNQDD officials of higher rank in the coalition government. Aside from shutting down the ability of the VNQDD officials to disseminate information, he often ordered his men to start riots and street brawls at public VNQDD events.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 20 November Stavka telephoned Stalingrad Front {{commander}} Andrei Yeremenko asking if he would begin his portion of the offensive on schedule, at 08:00. He responded he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> only if the fog lifted; although the 51st Army opened its artillery barrage on time because front headquarters could not contact the division, {{the rest of the}} forces prepared for the operation received orders to postpone the attack until 10:00. The 51st Army engaged the Romanian 6th Corps, taking many prisoners. As the 57th Army joined the attack at 10:00, the situation developed {{in such a way that}} the Stalingrad Front could throw its armored corps into battle. The German 297th Infantry Division watched as its Romanian support failed to put up resistance against the Red Army. However, confusion and lack of control caused the Soviet 4th and 13th Mechanized Corps to stumble as they began to exploit the breakthroughs achieved by the opening offensive.|$|E
5|$|Mahitsielafanjaka (Mahitsy) {{became the}} {{residence}} of Andrianampoinimerina after he moved his capital from Ambohimanga to Antananarivo. Described in 1888 as the seat of ancestral spiritual authority at the Rova, the traditional sacrifice of a rooster during the ceremony of the Fandroana took place here, and ombiasy (astrologers) asked to perform sikidy (divination) for a sovereign <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> within this space. The building also formerly housed a major royal idol called Manjakatsiroa (or the entire collection of royal idols, according to another account) until the supposed public burning of all such relics by Queen RanavalonaII in 1869 following her conversion to Christianity. Built in 1796, the traditional wooden Mahitsy follows traditional architectural norms: the roof {{is supported by the}} central pillar, and two superimposed beds—the highest for the king and the other for his wives—are located in the northeast corner, the portion of the home reserved for royalty and the ancestors. These beds are raised high off the ground to protect the sleepers from a nocturnal attack. Items formerly on display in this building {{after the end of the}} Merina monarchy in 1897 until the destruction of the original structure in the 1995 fire included Andrianampoinimerina's filanzana (palanquin), several wooden trunks and a pot of jaka (zebu confit) said to date from the king's reign.|$|E

5|$|Navarro stated, on 21 August 2010, {{that the}} case was stagnating because an {{official}} interpreter was unable to be found for the case in Peru. The Peruvian association of translators and interpreters and the Dutch embassy both separately stated {{at the time that}} they have been unable to locate one to officially translate Spanish into Dutch. Unlike Aruba and the United States, Peru does not guarantee the right to a speedy trial. On 6 September, a Peruvian appeals court voted 2 to 1 to reject Van der Sloot's motion that he is being unlawfully held. Because 3 votes are required for a decision, if a fourth judge voted in Van der Sloot's favor, a fifth judge would be required to break the tie. Peruvian statutes permit a suspect to be detained for up to 18 months for interrogation, though Navarro expressed skepticism that law enforcement officers <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> with his client.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 1958, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{announced}} a one-year moratorium on nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958, if the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom {{also agreed to}} suspend testing. Britain had already indicated that it <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> and the Soviet Union agreed on 30 August. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, all three all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline. The British scientists needed to gather as much data as possible {{to allow them to}} design production nuclear weapons. Moreover, as the prospect of increased American cooperation grew after October 1957, they knew that {{the quality and quantity of}} what the Americans would share would depend on what they had to offer. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies such as the use of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride permitted a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices. It would be the biggest and most complex British test series.|$|E
5|$|Peter Forsberg's number 21 {{became the}} fourth jersey number retired by the Avs on opening night, a contest Colorado would lose to Detroit 3–0. Colorado {{redeemed}} themselves in game {{two of the}} season on October 10, 2011, against the 2011 Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins. Varlamov negated all 30 shots registered by Boston and posted the fifth shutout of his career and first win as an Avalanche in the regular season. Milan Hejduk scored the game-winning goal and first goal of the season for the club in a 1–0 victory over the defending champions. In April 2012, The Avs were eliminated from playoff contention and finished 11th place in the Western Conference. Despite a 20-point improvement from last season's efforts, the team failed to reach {{the playoffs for the}} second straight year, the first time the Colorado club <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in their 17 years playing in Denver. Head coach Joe Sacco signed a two-year contract extension shortly {{after the end of the}} season. Stand out rookie Gabriel Landeskog overtook Matt Duchene as the youngest in franchise history to lead the team in goals, scoring 22 in 82 games.|$|E
