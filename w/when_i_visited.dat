Fallingwater {{has been described as}} an architectural tour de force of Wright's organic philosophy. Wright's passion for Japanese architecture was strongly reflected in the design of Fallingwater, particularly in the importance of interpenetrating exterior and interior spaces and the strong emphasis placed on harmony between man and nature. Contemporary Japanese architect Tadao Ando has said of the house,I think Wright learned {{the most important aspect of}} architecture, the treatment of space, from Japanese architecture. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, I found that same sensibility of space. But there was the additional sounds of nature that appealed to me.|$|E

All of Nintendo's regional offices took {{a day of}} silence on July13 across all of its social media accounts in remembrance of Iwata. Members of the gaming industry and fans alike expressed their sadness on social media over Iwata's death and gratitude for his accomplishments. Fans established memorials across the world, including at the Japanese Embassy in Moscow, Russia, and the Nintendo World Store in Manhattan, New York. Shuhei Yoshida, president of SCE Worldwide Studios, stated: [...] "I pray that Mr. Iwata, who contributed {{so much to the}} development of the gaming industry, rests in peace." [...] Composer and director Junichi Masuda, most known for his work with the Pokémon games, tweeted: [...] "He was a man who understood Pokémon, and a great leader. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> the other day, he was well. I will pray for his soul from the bottom of my heart." [...] The Tokyo Institute of Technology issued a memorial statement on August4, with Iwata's former classmates and professors contributing their memories. At The Game Awards 2015, Reggie Fils-Aimé delivered a tribute to Iwata, describing Iwata as [...] "fearless" [...] and [...] "unique, in the fullest meaning of the word." ...|$|E

"The {{presentation}} of ambassadorial credentials to the Shah {{was a rather}} formal undertaking," [...] reads a photograph caption in Helms' memoirs, which shows him in formal attire, standing before the Shah who is dressed in military uniform. Yet already Helms enjoyed an elite student experience which he shared with the Shah: circa 1930, both had attended Le Rosey, a French-language prep school in Switzerland. Decades later the CIA station chief in Iran first introduced Helms to the Shah. Helms was there about an installation to spy on the Soviets.

2500|$|... 1992 {{was also}} a {{significant}} year in Zaitsev's career, because {{it was then that}} he presented for the first time his recent fashion collection, as well as his paintings and works on paper in prestigious venues, both in New York and in Beverly Hills. Never before was Russian fashion design demonstrated on the American runways, and never before were Zaitsev's most personal paintings and drawings allowed to be exhibited in the West. Fashion shows and exhibitions were held at the Bowles-Sorokko Galleries on both the East and the West Coasts, and they were widely attended, marking the beginning of cultural exchanges in the area of visual arts between the USA and the new Russia. According to Serge Sorokko, then president of the Bowles-Sorokko Galleries, Mr. Zaitsev was a lifelong painter, but was never free to exhibit publicly his art before. [...] " [...] because his work was outside the dogmas of socialist realism," [...] Mr. Sorokko told The New York Times. [...] "He was permitted to paint only for his own soul. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> his home in Moscow, I saw 20 years of pictorial work on his walls." ...|$|E

2500|$|Around 222, {{at the age}} of 24, Sun Huan was {{commissioned}} as General of the Household Who Pacifies the East (安東中郎將) and ordered to join Sun Quan's general Lu Xun at the Battle of Xiaoting against Liu Bei, who launched a campaign against Sun Quan to retake Jing Province. During the preliminary stages of the battle, Sun Huan led a separate force to attack Liu Bei's vanguard force at Yidao (夷道) but ended up being besieged by the enemy. He requested for reinforcements from Lu Xun but was denied. When the other officers urged Lu Xun to help Sun Huan, Lu declined, saying that Sun Huan was capable of holding his ground and that the siege would automatically be lifted later. Sun Quan's forces eventually inflicted a devastating defeat on Liu Bei's forces at the Battle of Xiaoting. As Lu Xun predicted, the siege on Yidao was lifted, after which Sun Huan led troops to block Liu Bei's retreat route, but Liu managed to escape by travelling across the mountainous areas. Liu Bei later remarked, [...] "(Sun) Huan was still a child <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>visited</b> Jing, but now he is forcing me to this extent!" [...] After the battle, Sun Huan came to see Lu Xun and he told the latter, [...] "Earlier on, I was indeed very resentful when you refused to help me. But now, after the victory, I see that you have your own style of despatching the troops." ...|$|E
