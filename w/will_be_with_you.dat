On May 3, 2010, Primus announced a new tour with Gogol Bordello, Wolfmother, and the Dead Kenny G's. The press release for the tour revealed that the band were looking to [...] "refine their chops before heading into the studio to record their first album of brand new music since 1999's Antipop." [...] Correlating with this announcement, the Primus website was updated with an animation of an elevator with its twelfth floor featuring a stylized question mark, and a sign reading [...] "Primus <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> shortly", alluding to future plans. In 2011, Claypool elaborated on the band's decision to record an album, stating that [...] "(Lane) coming back has just breathed life back into the project.

2500|$|Even {{before the}} Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government’s Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI, in Washington) {{had already begun}} {{providing}} war news and commentary to the commercial American shortwave radio stations for use {{on a voluntary basis}} through its Foreign Information Service (FIS, in New York) headed by playwright Robert E. Sherwood, the playwright who served as president Roosevelt’s speech writer and information advisor. Direct programming began a week after the United States’ entry into World War II in December 1941, with the first broadcast from the San Francisco office of the FIS via a leased General Electric’s transmitter to the Philippines in English (other languages followed). Next step was the live broadcast to Germany, which was called Stimmen aus Amerika ("Voices from America") and was transmitted on February 1, 1942. It was introduced by [...] "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" [...] and included the pledge: [...] "Today, and every day from now on, we <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> from America to talk about the war... The news may be good or bad for us – We will always tell you the truth." [...] Roosevelt approved this broadcast, which then-Colonel William J. Donovan (COI) and Sherwood (FIS) had recommended to him. It was Sherwood who actually coined the term [...] "The Voice of America" [...] to describe the shortwave network that began its transmissions on February 1, from 270 Madison Avenue in New York City.|$|E
