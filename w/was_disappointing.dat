5|$|He {{made his}} {{first-class}} cricket debut against South Australia in 1909–1910 and <b>was</b> <b>disappointing,</b> scoring three and one and taking 1/35.

5|$|The Flames {{continued}} to struggle after the Olympic break; they finished {{the season in}} tenth place in the West and missed {{the playoffs for the}} first time since 2003.

5|$|When first {{released}} in 2001, Itanium's performance <b>was</b> <b>disappointing</b> compared to better-established RISC and CISC processors. Emulation to run existing x86 applications and operating systems was particularly poor, with one benchmark in 2001 reporting {{that it was}} equivalent at best to a 100MHz Pentium in this mode (1.1GHz Pentiums were on the market at that time).|$|E
5|$|Both {{forces were}} {{composed}} of troops from several states and lands, including numerous mercenaries; for example, Bohemian mercenaries fought on each side. The knights also invited guest crusaders. Twenty-two different peoples, mostly Germanic, joined them. Teutonic recruits included soldiers from Westphalia, Frisia, Austria, Swabia and Stettin (Szczecin). Two Hungarian nobles, Nicholas II Garay and Stibor of Stiboricz, brought 200 {{men for the}} Knights, but support from Sigismund of Hungary <b>was</b> <b>disappointing.</b>|$|E

5|$|Even by Sammarinese standards, {{qualification}} for the 1998 World Cup <b>was</b> <b>disappointing.</b> Losing {{every game}} by three goals or more, San Marino failed {{to score a}} single goal.

The closest game was against Cyprus, a 1–0 defeat on 18 November 1998.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{intended}} to develop reconnaissance and bomber versions, but these plans were disrupted by the German invasion in June 1941. The project was stymied {{by the failure}} of its intended inline engine, the Mikulin AM-37, and its performance <b>was</b> <b>disappointing</b> when a second prototype was built later with M-82 radial engines. It was cancelled in 1943 after at least two prototypes were built.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{having been}} {{eliminated}} from the FA Cup, Small Heath arranged a friendly with Notts County, refereed by the Test cricketer and former England international footballer Billy Gunn, which gave {{them an opportunity to}} try out reserve players Jack Jones and Alec Leake. On a hard, snow-covered pitch, Billy Walton scored all three goals in a 3–3 draw, but the attendance of under a thousand, though understandable because of the weather conditions, <b>was</b> <b>disappointing.</b> Jones made his competitive debut, standing in for the injured Hallam, as Small Heath again struggled in muddy conditions and, for the fourth time this season, lost to West Bromwich Albion.|$|E

5|$|Expectations for Schenn {{were high}} {{heading into the}} 2009–10 season. During {{training}} camp, Toronto Head Coach Ron Wilson named {{him as one of}} the team's top four defencemen. As the season progressed, however, Schenn's play <b>was</b> <b>disappointing,</b> and Wilson kept him out of the line-up for a game in October and again for a three-game stretch in December. Towards the end of the season, Schenn and some of his younger teammates improved their play. In a game against the Ottawa Senators, Schenn posted his first career two-goal game, helping him finish the season with new career-highs in goals (5) and points (17) in 79 games played.|$|E
5|$|However he {{struggled}} with poor form during the 1950–51 season as his first marriage {{was coming to an}} end and he came into increasing conflict with his teammates. He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 – breaking Lawton's own transfer record in the process – as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club's directors. He also found that the well paid job he was promised outside of football did not transpire. His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950–51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951–52 <b>was</b> <b>disappointing,</b> and he was made available for transfer.|$|E
5|$|Sales {{performance}} <b>was</b> <b>disappointing.</b> Jaguar {{had intended}} to produce up to 350 cars, but production ceased in 1994 with 275 production cars produced, not all {{of which had been}} sold; some left-hand drive examples were still available in 1997. The recession left many of those who placed a deposit unable to complete the purchase. The index linking of contracts exacerbated the issue, and added almost £200,000 to the purchase price between early 1990 and mid-1992. The McLaren F1 suffered from similarly poor sales performance, with just 71 cars sold against McLaren's target of 300. McLaren's F1 program eventually turned a small profit thanks to the sale and servicing of the 28 GTR racing variants produced.|$|E

5|$|Arguments rumbled on {{and there}} were endless delays. Early {{versions}} of the sticky bomb were prone to leaks as well as breakage in transport. There were understandable concerns over the explosive charge: pure nitroglycerin is notoriously susceptible to the slightest knock, but the mixture developed by ICI proved to be very safe even if it should get into the hinges of the storage boxes. By December 1940, fewer than 66,000 had been produced {{and the rate of}} production <b>was</b> <b>disappointing</b> at five to ten thousand per week. Further, it was suggested that the original order of one million be reduced to 200,000. Minor improvements to the design were made, of which the most significant was to replace the glass flask with plastic. Finally, after passing all the required tests, the sticky bomb – now the No 74 Grenade Mk II – was accepted by the Ordnance Board; it was put into full-scale production and it became a service issue.|$|E
5|$|In April 1953, at the {{invitation}} of the French government, she traveled to the Cannes Film Festival, where she met Pierre Galante, an executive editor for the French journal Paris Match. Following a long-distance courtship and the requisite nine-month residency requirement, deHavilland and Galante married on April 12, 1955, in the village of Yvoy-le-Marron, and settled together in a three-story house near the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris' 16th arrondissement. That same year, she returned to the screen in Terence Young's period drama That Lady (1955), about a Spanish princess and her unrequited love for King Philip II of Spain, whose respect she earned in her youth after losing an eye in a sword fight defending his honor. According to Tony Thomas, the film uses authentic Spanish locations effectively, but suffers from a convoluted plot and excessive dialogue, and while deHavilland delivered a warm and elegant performance as Ana de Mendoza, the film <b>was</b> <b>disappointing.</b> Following her appearances in the romantic melodrama Not as a Stranger (1955) and The Ambassador's Daughter (1956)neither of which were successful at the box officedeHavilland gave birth to her second child, Gisèle Galante, on July 18, 1956.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, {{the film}} {{released}} in 10 screens in 3 major cities along with special screenings for the Tamil diaspora {{in the smaller}} cities. In United Kingdom, the film debuted on the box-office list at No.9 with earnings of about £14,000 per screen {{and was the first}} Tamil film to enter UK Top 10. In United States, Sivaji was released in 24 screens with subsequent additions of 19 and 21 screens for the Tamil version and Telugu version respectively. The producers of the film claimed that the film was going to be dubbed in Chinese and Japanese by Ayngaran International, the holder of international rights of the film. The response in Cape Town <b>was</b> <b>disappointing,</b> while the box-office collections in Johannesburg and Durban allowed it to become the first Tamil film to feature in the South African box-office top 10. Singapore Airlines bought a 3-month exclusive in-flight screening rights to the film, a first for the airline for any Tamil film.|$|E

5|$|Stalin died in March 1953, {{and in the}} {{reorganisation}} that followed, the Presidium was abolished and {{a smaller}} Politburo reconstituted. Although Brezhnev was not made a Politburo member, he was appointed head of the Political Directorate of the Army and the Navy with the rank of Lieutenant-General, a very senior position. Brezhnev's patron Khrushchev succeeded Stalin as General Secretary, while Khrushchev's opponent Malenkov succeeded Stalin as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Brezhnev sided with Khrushchev against Malenkov, but only for several years. On 7 May 1955, Brezhnev was made General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR. On the surface, his brief was simple: to make the new lands agriculturally productive. In reality, Brezhnev {{became involved in the}} development of the Soviet missile and nuclear arms programs, including the Baykonur Cosmodrome. The initially successful Virgin Lands Campaign soon became unproductive and failed to solve the growing Soviet food crisis. Brezhnev was recalled to Moscow in 1956. The harvest in the years following the Virgin Lands Campaign <b>was</b> <b>disappointing,</b> which would have hurt his political career had he remained in Kazakhstan.|$|E
5|$|The first hemisphere-wide {{effort to}} {{eradicate}} smallpox {{was made in}} 1950 by the Pan American Health Organization. The campaign was successful in eliminating smallpox from all American countries except Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. In 1958 Professor Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox. The proposal (Resolution WHA11.54) was accepted in 1959. At this point, 2 million people were dying from smallpox every year. Overall, however, the progress towards eradication <b>was</b> <b>disappointing,</b> especially in Africa and in the Indian subcontinent. In 1966 an international team, the Smallpox Eradication Unit, was formed {{under the leadership of}} an American, Donald Henderson. In 1967, the World Health Organization intensified the global smallpox eradication by contributing $2.4 million annually to the effort, and adopted the new disease surveillance method promoted by Czech epidemiologist Karel Raška.|$|E
5|$|York again drew Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth {{round in}} 1985–86, {{and took the}} lead through Gary Ford only to concede a {{stoppage}} time equaliser. Tony Canham scored at Anfield and York had a second goal disallowed before York succymbed to a 3–1 defeat in extra time. York lost only three home league matches all season, but missed out on promotion after finishing seventh. In the summer of 1986 he sold MacPhail to Bristol City for £15,000, whilst many of the veteran players he signed {{when he first came}} to the club were coming to the end of their careers. The 1986–87 season <b>was</b> <b>disappointing</b> for York as they were knocked out of the FA Cup by non-League team Caernarfon Town and ended the season in 20th-place. They did though manage to beat Chelsea 1–0 in the League Cup, but lost the return fixture at Stamford Bridge 3–0. Smith ended up falling out with the club's directors, who invested money in the club's facilities rather than on players, and released goalkeeper Andy Leaning against his wishes.|$|E
