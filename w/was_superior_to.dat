5|$|Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando was {{released}} roughly {{a year after}} the original game and received critical acclaim, to the point of frequently being viewed {{as one of the best}} PlayStation 2 games ever made.

5|$|Allegedly, Vattier {{had tried}} to take title {{to a piece of}} {{property}} in Cincinnati already owned by the Hinde family. Hinde challenged Vattier in court. Henry Clay represented Hinde in the Ohio State Court proceedings. Hinde claimed that Vattier tried to use the lot to pay Findlay by claiming to have a bill of sale and title that <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> the Hinde family. After more than fifteen years, the case reached the United States Supreme Court in 1833. The Court ruled that Vattier took title to the property illegally and that the property belonged to Hinde and his children. Originally owned by Hinde's father-in-law, James Bradford, after his death the property passed to Hinde's wife, Belinda (Bradford) Hinde.|$|E
5|$|Bolt {{turned his}} main {{focus to the}} 200 m and equalled Roy Martin's world junior record of 20.13 s at the Pan-American Junior Championships. This {{performance}} attracted interest from the press, and his times in the 200 m and 400 m led to him being touted as a possible successor to Johnson. Indeed, at sixteen years old, Bolt had reached times that Johnson did not register until he was twenty, and Bolt's 200 m time <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> Maurice Greene's season's best that year.|$|E
30|$|Consider the {{following}} three cases: First, the conditional mean regression shows that State I <b>is</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> State II and that proposition is correct directly. Second, the quantile regression shows that state I <b>is</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> state II, and the proposition is correct. Thirdly, the conditional mean regression shows that State III <b>is</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> State II and the quantile regression shows that State I is better than State III. One can then conclude that State I is better than State II. As a result, the proposition holds through the transitivity.|$|R

5|$|In Original Stories, Wollstonecraft {{employed}} the then-burgeoning genre of children's literature {{to promote the}} education of women and an emerging middle-class ideology. She argued that women {{would be able to}} become rational adults if they were educated properly as children, which was not a widely held belief in the 18th century, and contended that the nascent middle-class ethos <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> the court culture represented by fairy tales and to the values of chance and luck found in chapbook stories for the poor. Wollstonecraft, in developing her own pedagogy, also responded to the works of the two most important educational theorists of the 18th century: John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E

At season's end, he was rewarded with selection for Australia's non-Test tour of New Zealand in February and March 1957. The hosts had Test status at the time, but Australia refused to ratify games against their trans-Tasman neighbours as Test matches, citing the weakness of the New Zealand team.|$|E

5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> quinine in {{both children and}} adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet {{was further}} {{reinforced}} in January 1779 by ten ships {{of the line}} under Admiral John Byron, who assumed command of the British Leeward Islands station. Throughout {{the first half of}} 1779, both fleets received additional reinforcements, after which the French fleet <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> that of the British. Byron departed St. Lucia on June 6th in order to provide escort services to British merchant ships gathering at St. Kitts for a convoy to Europe, leaving d'Estaing free to act. D'Estaing and the French governor-general at Martinique, the marquis de Bouillé, seized the opportunity to begin a series of operations against nearby British possessions.|$|E
5|$|The XSBF-1—piloted by {{test pilot}} Bud Gillies—flew {{for the first}} time on December 24, 1935. Following initial testing, which found the {{aircraft}} to be reasonably faultless, the XSBF-1 was delivered to the U.S. Navy for evaluation in competition with two other biplanes submitted to the 1934 specification, the Great Lakes XB2G and the Curtiss XSBC-3. Unusually for biplanes, all three types possessed retractable landing gear. The evaluation showed that the design from Curtiss <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> the Grumman and Great Lakes designs, and an order was placed for the Curtiss type, designated SBC-3 Helldiver in service, in August 1936.|$|E

5|$|Artisans and {{craftsmen}} {{during the}} Han had a socio-economic status between that of farmers and merchants. Yet some {{were able to}} obtain a valuable income, such as one craftsman who made knives and swords {{and was able to}} eat food fit for nobles and officials. Artisans and craftsmen also enjoyed a legal status that <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> merchants. Unlike lowly merchants, artisans were allowed by law to wear fancy silks, ride on horseback, and ride in carriages. There were also no laws which barred artisans from becoming officials. An artisan painter who worked at the Imperial Academy turned down many offers to become nominated for public office. In contrast, a bureaucrat who appointed a merchant as an official could suffer impeachment from office, while some even avoided nominations by claiming they were merchants.|$|E

Palmer from the Armored Force, and Gladeon M. Barnes from the Ordnance Department. He spoke with key British generals including Harold Alexander, Bernard Montgomery and Richard McCreery, and American commanders including Eisenhower, Patton, Thomas B. Larkin and Orlando Ward. Eisenhower was defensive, suspicious that Marshall may have sent Devers to replace him, and nervous when Devers had critical comments about {{the handling of the}} 1st Armored Division. Devers and his party received a great deal of feedback, both positive and negative about American equipment. Devers noted that the M4 Sherman <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> the M3 Lee that the 1st Armored Division was equipped with, but urged the development of the more powerful 76mm gun.|$|E

Mike Moehnke of RPGamer cited the games as not being perfect, but <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> the Super Famicom game Legend of the Super Saiyan.

As a result, Sultan Fuad I promulgated a decree on 15 March 1922 whereby he adopted {{the title of}} King of Egypt. It {{has been reported that}} the title change was due not only to Egypt's newly independent status as the Kingdom of Egypt, but also to Fuad I's desire to be accorded the same title as the newly installed rulers of the newly created kingdoms of Hejaz, Syria and Iraq. Egyptian nationalist leader Saad Zaghlul maintained that the reason for the change of title from Sultan (equivalent to emperor) to the lesser title of King was because the British would not recognize an independent Egyptian ruler whose title <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> their own monarch.|$|E
5|$|Playing in a torrential downpour, the Buccaneers {{scored the}} first shutout in {{franchise}} history to clinch their first playoff berth and the NFC Central title. The Chiefs were held to a franchise-low 80 yards of total offense. Despite the rain, Ricky Bell claimed that the field had better traction than the dry field they had played on the week previously in San Francisco. Bell carried the ball 39 times for 137 yards in such bad weather that the game had to be played under lights. The Buccaneers lost four previous scoring opportunities to a fumble, two interceptions, and a fumbled snap on a field goal attempt. Shut out {{of the end zone}} on three tries with first-and-goal from the 9-yard line, the Buccaneers brought Neil O'Donoghue in to kick what would be the winning field goal with 8:50 remaining. Tampa Bay would hold the ball for all but four plays {{for the rest of the}} game. The Chiefs players gave the Buccaneers little credit after the victory, saying that the AFC <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> the NFC and that the Buccaneers would never have won the AFC West.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{military}} equipment was mass-produced in state-run fabricae ("factories") which brought together advanced forging technology and skilled artisans. Roman weapons were mostly made of internally produced steel such as chalybs Noricus which <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> unhardened iron. In contrast, forging technology, capacity and personnel were more limited in Germania libera, {{although there is}} evidence that production and standardization of equipment had greatly improved since the time of the Roman Principate. Steel-making was also known in Germania libera (spathae and rapier-like swords out of flexible steel were in use). But Alamanni production of sophisticated forge-products such as metal armour, helmets and swords was on a much smaller scale than the Romans'. Simple weapons such as axes and knives seem often to have been made of unhardened iron.|$|E
