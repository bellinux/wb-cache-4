5|$|I think we’re {{going to}} have {{problems}} politically until <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sort of third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.|$|E
500|$|Fewer critics responded {{negatively}} to the season; Seattle Post-Intelligencer critic Melanie McFarland reacted very bitterly, stating [...] "Three years {{off the air}} has not made the 'Family Guy' team that much more creative". Critics of both PopMatters and IGN criticized the first few episodes but felt the show regained its humor after [...] "Don't Make Me Over"; IGN's Mike Drucker commented [...] "At that point, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> amazingly creative humor. It's almost like MacFarlane and gang decided they had thanked their fans enough and could return to what made the show successful in the first place." [...] Media watchdog group the Parents Television Council, a frequent critic of the show, branded the episodes [...] "North by North Quahog", [...] "The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz", [...] "Brian Sings and Swings", [...] "Patriot Games", and [...] "The Courtship of Stewie's Father" [...] as [...] "worst show of the week".|$|E
500|$|... "Stupid in Love" [...] {{garnered}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Leah Greenblatt for Entertainment Weekly praised Rihanna's {{high level of}} emotional conviction on [...] "Stupid in Love", writing {{that it is a}} piece of [...] "self-lacerating balladry." [...] Neil McCormick for The Daily Telegraph thought that the song was a direct reference to Rihanna and Brown, writing [...] "Rihanna notoriously received a black eye prior to the 2009 Grammy awards when she was attacked by her then boyfriend, R singer Chris Brown. Clearly, this is a potentially life-changing incident, and <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sense of the emotional aftermath on the ballad Stupid In Love." [...] Norman Mayers for Nu-Soul Magazine concurred with McCormick, writing that Rihanna does not shy away from what happened between herself and Brown, rather, she confronts it directly on [...] "Stupid in Love". Alex Thornton for HipHopDX wrote {{that it is difficult to}} listen to the song without thinking of [...] "you know who," [...] referring to Brown.|$|E

500|$|... "The Box" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Salon.com {{gave the}} episode an A-, explaining [...] "this week's episode was {{chock full of}} good stuff. <b>We</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> more fun nuggets about how Earth 2 differs from Earth 1... Your Bose headphones cannot protect you from the awesome sonic power of [...] "The Box". UGO Networks' Alex Zalben wrote [...] "Two weeks in, Fringe {{is still the best}} damn show currently on TV". Zalben loved the serial aspects of the plot, praised Anna Torv's performance, but disliked how no one has realized Fauxlivia's true identity. Josh Wigler from MTV enjoyed the episode particularly because although he found the parallel universe a [...] "compelling world, sometimes it's nice to just kick your feet up on the table and know that you're home... Two episodes down, and it's safe to say that the third season of [...] "Fringe" [...] is off to a very strong start". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly thought it was a terrific episode, with [...] "a tremendously clever game-changer of an ending...This Fringe was {{a good example of how}} far the series has come since its first season, dominated by pre-credits scare-scenarios for Fringe Division to investigate, some of which spilled over into the show's mythology. Now, Fringe is a seamless whole".|$|E
2500|$|The {{invention}} of a hedge-breaching device is generally credited to Curtis G. Culin, a sergeant in the 2nd Armored Division's 102nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron. However, military historian Max Hastings notes that Culin {{was inspired by}} [...] "a Tennessee hillbilly named Roberts", who during a discussion about how to overcome the bocage, said [...] "Why don't <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> saw teeth {{and put them on}} the front of the tank and cut through these hedges?" [...] Rather than joining in the laughter that greeted this remark, Culin recognized the idea's potential. A prototype tusk-like assembly was created by welding steel scrap (from destroyed [...] "Czech hedgehogs") to the front of a tank to create a hedge cutter. The teeth helped prevent the vulnerable underside of the tank from being exposed while it knocked a hole in the hedgerow wall. On 14 July, Lieutenant General Omar Bradley inspected the tank and [...] "watched in awe as a hedgerow exploded... to make way for the Sherman bursting through". According to Hastings, Culin, [...] "an honest man", attempted to give credit to Roberts, but this was forgotten in the publicity surrounding the invention. Hastings concludes: [...] " [...] became a very American kind of national hero".|$|E

6000|$|... “I’ve got an idea!” cried Dave. “Why can’t <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> farmer {{to hook up}} a {{carriage}} or a sleigh and {{take us to the}} Hall that way?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In torrents! I can't see a yard {{ahead of}} me. I bet <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> floods after this. I expect {{they are out}} now, if one could only see." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This ain't no {{weather to}} judge by," [...] was his comment. [...] "Wait till <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> cross-winds and the ships starts to roll. Maybe then ye won't be so {{settled in the}} stomach." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you ever}} mean to turn in, or must I lay every blessed son of you away? All hands {{want to become}} divers; but unless <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sleep before mornin' there won't be much work done!" ...|$|E
