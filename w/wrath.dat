They faced The Public Enemy and Harlem Heat but lost when Rocco Rock from The Public Enemy pinned The Barbarian. At Fall Brawl 1997, The Barbarian and Meng faced <b>Wrath</b> and Mortis. Because <b>Wrath</b> and Mortis {{were part of}} a heel group, WCW had the Faces of Fear compete as faces during the match. <b>Wrath</b> and Mortis won the match, as <b>Wrath</b> pinned Meng for the victory. The Faces of Fear were {{successful}} at World War 3 1997, however, when they defeated the team of Glacier and Ernest Miller.|$|E

5|$|Alphonse {{is guided}} by the homunculus <b>Wrath</b> to the {{underground}} city beneath Amestris' Central City to reopen the Gate of Alchemy. There, they are attacked by the homunculus Gluttony, who fights and mortally wounds <b>Wrath.</b> At Wrath's insistence, Alphonse transmutes and sacrifices the two homunculi to use as material to open the Gate. Meanwhile, in Munich, the Thule Society persuades Noah into guiding them on how to correctly open the Gate based on what she had learned from reading Edward's mind. Edward learns from Lang that the Thule Society {{plans to use the}} weapons from his world to help Adolf Hitler in his attempt to start a revolution, and heads to stop them. Hohenheim and Envy are both transmuted {{at the same time that}} Alphonse transmutes Gluttony and <b>Wrath.</b> With the Gate opened, Eckhart leads a fleet into the other world, where she gains the ability to use alchemy.

5|$|In April 1996, after {{continued}} Hezbollah rocket {{attacks on}} Israeli civilians, the Israeli armed forces launched Operation Grapes of <b>Wrath,</b> which {{was intended to}} wipe out Hezbollah's base in southern Lebanon. Over 100 Lebanese refugees {{were killed by the}} shelling of a UN base at Qana, in what the Israeli military said was a mistake. Finally, following several days of negotiations, the two sides signed the Grapes of <b>Wrath</b> Understandings on 26 April 1996. A cease-fire was agreed upon between Israel and Hezbollah, which would be effective on 27 April 1996. Both sides agreed that civilians should not be targeted, which meant that Hezbollah would be allowed to continue its military activities against IDF forces inside Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, Namco Bandai {{reported}} that the two main games had collectively sold more than 1.7 million copies worldwide, with <b>Wrath</b> of the White Witch selling over 1.1 million copies alone. By the end of 2011, it was {{reported that}} Dominion of the Dark Djinn sold over 560,000 units; it was the 33rd best-selling game in Japan in 2010, and the 45th best-selling in 2011. Following the release of <b>Wrath</b> of the White Witch in the United Kingdom, it topped the charts, selling out in many stores across the region.|$|E
5|$|Level-5 {{worked with}} {{localization}} company Shloc to translate <b>Wrath</b> of the White Witch for Western regions; the two studios collaborated for many weeks. The team found great difficulty when localizing {{the game for}} Western regions, particularly due to the large amounts of text and audio that required translation. Other {{minor changes to the}} artwork and animation also occurred, such as making Oliver bow in a Western manner. By December 12, 2012, development on the localized version of <b>Wrath</b> of the White Witch stopped as the game was submitted for manufacturing. It was released in North America on January 22, 2013, in Australia on January 31, and in Europe on February 1.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{had never}} been happy with the brightly lit {{corridors}} and feel of the Enterprise, a dissatisfaction that extended to his work on The <b>Wrath</b> of Khan. For The Undiscovered Country, Meyer wanted the Enterprise interiors to feel grittier and more realistic; the metal was worn around the edges to look used without looking beat up. Narita's plans to transform {{the look of the}} Enterprise on a scale not seen since The <b>Wrath</b> of Khan were complicated by the necessary use of existing sets.|$|E
5|$|Sir Thursday– Sir Thursday is {{the fourth}} Trustee of the Will, and is afflicted with the sin of <b>Wrath.</b> He is a {{military}} Denizen, and believes in order and control. The Will breaks free from him when Arthur makes him sufficiently angry.|$|E
5|$|The Undiscovered Countrys Cold War allegory and {{references}} to literary history were recognized among researchers and cultural historians. According to scholar Larry Kreitzer, The Undiscovered Country has more references to William Shakespeare {{than any other}} Star Trek work until at least 1996. The title itself alludes to Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1. Meyer had originally intended The <b>Wrath</b> of Khan to be called The Undiscovered Country. Whereas the undiscovered country referred to in Hamlet (and its intended meaning in The <b>Wrath</b> of Khan) is death, Star Trek VIs use of the phrase refers to a future where Klingons and humans coexist in peace.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Wrath</b> of Khan {{opened on}} June 4, 1982 in 1,621 theaters in the United States. It made $14,347,221 in its opening weekend, {{at the time}} the largest opening weekend gross in history. It went on to earn $78,912,963 in the US, {{becoming}} the sixth highest-grossing film of 1982. It made $97,000,000 worldwide. Although the total gross of The <b>Wrath</b> of Khan was less than that of The Motion Picture, it was more profitable due to its lower production cost. The film's novelization, written by Vonda N. McIntyre, stayed on the New York Times paperback bestsellers list for more than three weeks. Unlike the previous film, <b>Wrath</b> of Khan was not promoted with a toy line, although Playmates Toys created Khan and Saavik figures in the 1990s, and in 2007 Art Asylum crafted a full series of action figures to mark the film's 25th anniversary. In 2009 IDW Publishing released a comic adaptation of the film, and Film Score Monthly released an expanded score.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Wrath</b> of Khan was {{released}} in North America on June 4, 1982 by Paramount Pictures. It was a box office success, earning $97 million worldwide and setting a world record for its first-day box office gross. Critical reaction to the film was positive; reviewers highlighted Khan's character, the film's pacing, and the character interactions as strong elements. Negative reactions, however, focused on weak special effects {{and some of the}} acting. The <b>Wrath</b> of Khan is considered by some to be the best film in the Star Trek series, and is often credited with renewing substantial interest in the franchise.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} portion of reviews drew parallels between Carnivàle and David Lynch's 1990s mystery TV series Twin Peaks, a show in which Carnivàle actor Michael J. Anderson had previously appeared. Knauf did not deny a stylistic link and made comparisons to John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of <b>Wrath.</b> When Lost began to receive major critical attention, Carnivàle and its type of mythological storytelling were compared to Lost story approach in several instances.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} of peace, Tantallon again saw {{military}} action during the Bishops' Wars in 1639. The Douglas family had remained Catholic after the Scottish Reformation, incurring the <b>wrath</b> of the Presbyterian Covenanters, who opposed Charles I's attempts {{to interfere with the}} Scottish Church. In 1639, the Covenanters captured Tantallon while William, newly created Marquess of Douglas, was in Edinburgh.|$|E

5|$|Amongst other {{witnesses}} to Victor's <b>wrath</b> are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading {{him to believe}} that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.|$|E
5|$|Another {{monument}} {{marks the}} spot where the fire stopped: the Golden Boy of Pye Corner in Smithfield. According to the inscription, it was evidence of God's <b>wrath</b> on the City of London for the sin of gluttony that the fire started at Pudding Lane and stopped at Pye Corner.|$|E
5|$|At {{no point}} during The <b>Wrath</b> of Khan are Khan and Kirk {{in the same}} location; they {{speak to each other}} only over {{communication}} links such as view screens. This was {{due in part to the}} fact that the set of the Reliant was a redress of the Enterprise bridge, and the two actors' scenes were filmed four months apart. Montalbán recited his lines with a script assistant instead of to William Shatner.|$|E
5|$|Charon– The former ferryman of the River Styx in the Underworld who guided {{lost souls}} to their final destination. Kratos {{encountered}} Charon on the River Styx twice.

Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E
5|$|The commonness and {{centrality}} {{of wine in}} daily life in biblical times is apparent from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible. Positively, for example, wine {{is used as a}} symbol of abundance, and of physical blessing. Negatively, wine is personified as a mocker and beer a brawler, and drinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgment and <b>wrath.</b>|$|E
