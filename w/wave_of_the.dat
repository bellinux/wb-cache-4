5|$|The second <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1918 {{pandemic}} {{was much}} deadlier than the first. The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics; those {{most at risk}} were the sick and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily. But in August, when the second wave began in France, Sierra Leone and the United States, the virus had mutated to a much deadlier form.|$|E
5|$|A {{second wave}} set off from Singapore at 16:15, {{consisting}} of seven Vildebeests and three Albacores of No. 36 Squadron and two Vildebeests of No. 100 Squadron. They arrived over Endau at 17:30, but their escort of seven Hurricanes and four Buffalos were late and the British biplanes were set upon by ten Ki-27s and two Ki-44s before their escorts could reach them. Five Vildebeests, two Albacores and one Hurricane were lost from this <b>wave.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 72 aircrew from Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons {{who participated in}} the raids, 27 were killed, seven were wounded and two were captured. The returning pilots were congratulated by Air Vice-Marshal Paul Maltby, who promised them that further daylight attacks were unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, Operation Mallard began. Mallard was {{the final}} <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 6th Airborne Division's {{landings}} and consisted of 220 Horsa and Hamilcar gliders, carrying the 6th Airlanding Brigade and other units. The gliders arrived at their landing-zone, coming under heavy small-arms and mortar fire from nearby German positions as they landed. Casualties were light and within ninety minutes the glider-borne troops had gathered at their rendezvous points. By 00:00 7 June, the entire 6th Airborne Division had been fully deployed on the eastern flank of the invasion beaches (with the exception of 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment – part of 6th Airlanding Brigade – that was due to arrive by sea on 7 June).|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{distributions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mode {{function and}} kinematic and non-linear parameters <b>of</b> internal <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second mode are derived for the South China Sea for typical summer conditions in July. The calculations {{are based on}} the Generalized Digital Environmental Model (GDEM) climatology of hydrological variables, from which the local stratification is evaluated. The focus is on <b>the</b> phase speed <b>of</b> long internal <b>waves</b> and the coefficients at the dispersive, quadratic and cubic terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weakly non-linear Gardner model. Spatial distributions of these parameters, except for the coefficient at the cubic term, are qualitatively similar for <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> both modes. <b>The</b> dispersive term <b>of</b> Gardner's equation and phase speed for internal <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second mode are about a quarter and half, respectively, <b>of</b> those for <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first mode. Similarly to <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first mode, the coefficients at the quadratic and cubic terms of Gardner's equation are practically independent of water depth. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first mode, for <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second mode the quadratic term is mostly negative. The results can serve as a basis for expressing estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expected parameters <b>of</b> internal <b>waves</b> for <b>the</b> South China Sea...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study several aspects <b>of</b> solitary <b>wave</b> {{solutions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ostrovsky equation. Using variational methods, {{we show that}} as the rotation parameter goes to zero, ground state solitary <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ostrovsky equation converge to solitary <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Korteweg-deVries equation. We also investigate <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> function d(c) which determines <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground states. Using an important scaling identity, together with numerical approximations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solitary <b>waves,</b> {{we are able to}} numerically approximate d(c). These calculations suggest that d is convex everywhere, and therefore all ground state solitary <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ostrovsky equation are stable. ...|$|R

5|$|By 1977, {{a second}} <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> punk rock {{movement}} was breaking {{in the three}} countries where it had emerged, {{as well as in}} many other places. Bands from the same scenes often sounded very different from each other, reflecting the eclectic state of punk music during the era. While punk rock remained largely an underground phenomenon in North America, Australia, and the new spots where it was emerging, in the UK it briefly became a major sensation.|$|E
5|$|Crete {{had been}} the target of Muslim attacks since the first <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslim conquests in the mid-7th century. It had {{suffered}} a first raid in 654 and again in 674/675, and parts of the island were temporarily occupied during the reign of the Umayyad Caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715). Nevertheless, the island was never conquered and despite occasional raids in the 8th century it remained securely in Byzantine hands; Crete was too far from the Arab naval bases in the Levant for an effective expedition against it to be undertaken.|$|E

5|$|On 11 July, NATO {{prepared}} for a large-scale mission in Srebrenica involving 60 aircraft. At 2:30 PM, the first <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assault, two Dutch F-16s, bombed two Serb tanks {{on the outskirts of}} the town. Two USAF F-16s were dispatched next to attack an artillery piece, but they failed to find their target. Soon thereafter, Bosnian Serb troops seized several Dutch peacekeepers as hostages and threatened to kill them if NATO did not call off its attacks. The Dutch commander reported this back to his government, and Dutch Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve immediately telephoned the NATO operations center and ordered an end to the attacks.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslim conquests {{ended with}} the siege of Constantinople in 718, and {{the border between the}} two empires became {{stabilized}} along the mountains of eastern Anatolia. Raids and counter-raids continued on both sides and became almost ritualized, but the prospect of outright conquest of Byzantium by the Caliphate receded. This led to far more regular, and often friendly, diplomatic contacts, as well as a reciprocal recognition of the two empires.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} leap {{in quality}} is evident here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and to ride the <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the tournament}} commenced, TNA held three preview matches {{involving}} World X Cup participants. The first two were {{featured on the}} June12 episode of Impact!. In the first preview match, Team TNA's The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) were pitted against Team Japan's Speed Muscle (Masato Yoshino and Naruki Doi) in a tag team match lasting 6 minutes. The Motor City Machine Guns won when Sabin pinned Doi, after Shelley and Sabin performed a double kick to the face. The second was between Team International's Alex Koslov and Team TNA's Curry Man, which lasted 4 minutes. Koslov won the match by pinfall after a splash from the top rope. TNA held another preview match on the June19 episode of Impact!. In this match, Kaz of Team TNA defeated Koslov after smashing Koslov face-first into the mat with his signature <b>Wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Future maneuver.|$|E
5|$|During the {{fighting}} around Broodseinde on 4 October, the 39th formed the third <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 10th Brigade's attack, which went in around 6:00am. Following up the 37th and 38th Battalions, they advanced against strongly held pill-boxes towards the Gravenstafel Switch. After digging-in, a party from the 39th joined the 40th Battalion as it launched the final wave in the brigade's attack. As the 40th came up against stiff opposition, more {{men from the}} 39th were pushed forward and the objective was finally secured around 11:00am. After the battle, the 39th remained in the line until 6 October, when it was withdrawn back to Morbecque for reorganisation and rest. A couple of days later, the battalion was recommitted to {{the fighting}} and ordered to advance towards Passchendaele Ridge, attacking {{on the morning of}} 12 October despite heavy rain the previous evening. In the heavy fighting that followed, the battalion managed to secure its first objective, but was forced to withdraw when its flanks became threatened as neighbouring units had been unable to advance with them through the thick mud.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would {{typically}} deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, {{for service}} with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers {{that were already}} deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. The plan was that the Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through Bulgaria and Romania before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb. The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver and dive to low altitude, keeping {{the tail of the}} aircraft aimed at the target to avoid serious damage from the shock <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosion.|$|E

5|$|Shannon was {{discharged}} from the RAAF as a squadron leader on 15December 1945. He remained in England and became an executive with Shell and later Cunard. Shannon no longer flew after the war, but did like to drive fast cars. He also {{served as chairman of}} the No.617 Squadron Association, helping to raise funds for the Dambusters memorial at Woodhall Spa near RAF Scampton. His wife Ann died in 1990, and he married Eyke Taylor. On 8April 1993, shortly before a planned fiftieth anniversary reunion of surviving Dambusters, Dave Shannon died at his home in Sydenham, South London, aged seventy.

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Black Death forced Louis to leave Italy in May. He made Ulrich Wolfhardt {{governor}} of Naples, but his mercenaries did not hinder Joanna I and her husband from returning in September. Louis, who had signed a truce for eight years with Venice on 5 August, sent new troops to Naples {{under the command of}} Stephen Lackfi, Voivode of Transylvania, in late 1349. Lackfi reoccupied Capua, Aversa and other forts that had been lost to Joanna I, but a mutiny among his German mercenaries forced him to return to Hungary. The Black Death had meanwhile reached Hungary. The first <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epidemic ended in June, but it returned in September, killing Louis's first wife, Margaret. Louis also fell ill, but survived the plague. Although the Black Death was less devastating in the sparsely populated Hungary than in other parts of Europe, there were regions that became depopulated in 1349, and the demand for work force increased in the subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} matches of round two {{took place on}} the July10 episode of Impact!. The first was between Team International and Team Japan. In this contest, Doug Williams of Team International {{defeated}} Masato Yoshino by pinfall after slamming Yoshino neck-first onto the mat with his signature Chaos Theory maneuver at the 5 minute mark. In the final match of round two, Team TNA faced Team Mexico. Team TNA's Kaz defeated Team Mexico's Ultimo Guerrero in 5 minutes. Kaz won the bout by pinfall after slamming Guerrero face-first onto the mat with his signature <b>Wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Future maneuver. At the end of round two, the point standings for the teams were Team Mexico with three points, Team TNA with three, Team Japan with two, and Team International with two.|$|E

5|$|In England, William invaded from Normandy in 1066, {{resulting}} in three phases of castle building in England, around 80% {{of which were}} in the motte-and-bailey pattern. The first of these was the establishment by the new king of royal castles in key strategic locations, including many towns. These urban castles could {{make use of the}} existing town's walls and fortification, but typically required the demolition of local houses to make space for them. This could cause extensive damage: records suggest that in Lincoln 166 houses were destroyed, with 113 in Norwich and 27 in Cambridge. The second and third waves of castle building in the late-11th century were led by the major magnates and then the more junior knights on their new estates. Some regional patterns in castle building can be seen – relatively few castles were built in East Anglia compared to the west of England or the Marches, for example; this was probably due to the relatively settled and prosperous nature of the east of England and reflected a shortage of unfree labour for constructing mottes. In Wales, the first <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norman castles were again predominantly made of wood in a mixture of motte-and-bailey and ringwork designs. The Norman invaders spread up the valleys, using this form of castle to occupy their new territories. After the Norman conquest of England and Wales, the building of motte-and-bailey castles in Normandy accelerated as well, {{resulting in}} a broad swath of these castles across the Norman territories, around 741 motte-and-bailey castles in England and Wales alone.|$|E
