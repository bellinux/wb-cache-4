25|$|On the March 22 {{episode of}} Impact!, after Jarrett broke a guitar over Bischoff's head, Bischoff placed him and Mick Foley, another wrestler {{he had had}} {{problems}} with, {{against each other in}} a No Disqualification match, where the loser would get fired from the company. Jarrett managed to win the match, refereed by Beer Money, Inc., and with Foley fired from the company, Hogan ordered Bischoff to lay off of Jarrett. The following week, Hogan, prior to leaving on a business trip, apologized to Jarrett for Bischoff's behavior and gave him a chance to earn the number one contendership to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a match against the world champion A.J. Styles. With Hogan out of the building, Bischoff and Styles' manager Ric Flair interfered in the match and cost Jarrett the number one contendership. Later in the evening, Jarrett was announced as the second member of Abyss' Team Hogan in the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they would meet Team Flair, led by Sting. At Lockdown, Team Hogan (Abyss, Jarrett, Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy) defeated Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm), when Bischoff turned face and helped Team Hogan pick up the victory, effectively ending his feud with Jarrett. Just before Lockdown, Jarrett said that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out the answers to Sting's behavior, which led into a brawl on Impact!, with Sting leaving a beaten Jarrett in the ring, which in turn led to their match at Sacrifice. At the pay-per-view, Sting assaulted Jarrett prior to their match and then dragged him in to the ring, where he managed to score a pinfall in seconds over his bloodied opponent.|$|E
500|$|When Harry visits his parents' grave, {{the biblical}} {{reference}} [...] "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death" [...] (1 Corinthians 15:26) is {{inscribed on the}} grave. The Dumbledores' family tomb also holds a biblical quote: [...] "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also", which is from Matthew 6:21. Rowling states, [...] "They're very British books, so on a very practical note Harry <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> biblical quotations on tombstones... I think those two particular quotations he finds on the tombstones at Godric's Hollow, they sum up– they almost epitomise the whole series".|$|E
500|$|The People's Gavin Blyth and Jon Clarke {{stated that}} Toyah and Leanne were [...] "rough, tough and make other streetwise {{teenagers}} {{look like they}} are fresh out of nursery." [...] The characters were credited with increasing the show's ratings from 13 million to 19 million viewers. When Toyah met Dobber, the Daily Mirror's Tony Purnell commented [...] "If anyone <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Mr Wrong on holiday it was Toyah Battersby." [...] John Millar from the Daily Record wrote [...] "The Street should be congratulated if the plight of Toyah Battersby – a brilliant performance by young Georgia Taylor, by the way – means just one schoolgirl says no to her lusting boyfriend." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, sir, we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the President {{of these}} States and give these plans over to him. I decline to believe, sir, {{we are too}} late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> anything," [...] remarked Caleb Yates. [...] "To {{my way of}} thinking, that boy must have {{followed}} the two men when they left." ...|$|R
500|$|Hendrickson told TVSource {{magazine}} {{that she was}} [...] "petrified" [...] of filming the heavily emotional storyline. She stated, [...] "I was just really intimidated because I don’t have a child. I’ve never experienced that unconditional love with someone – for someone [...] I really didn’t have that much to connect to in my own personal life. I think that’s what scared me the most – how I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> it within myself to tell a truthful story." [...] Having previously noted that becoming a mother [...] "matured" [...] Chloe, Hendrickson said, [...] "I {{would love to see}} {{a little bit of the}} old Chloe come out of this extreme loss that she’s just experienced. I think it would make a lot of sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "They're very British books", Rowling {{revealed}} to an Open Book conference in October 2007, [...] "So {{on a very}} practical note Harry <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> biblical quotations on tombstones, [...] I think those two particular quotations he finds on the tombstones at Godric's Hollow, they (…) almost epitomize the whole series." ...|$|E
60|$|Queen Elizabeth's {{mind was}} much {{relieved}} by this letter. She {{began to think}} that she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in Richard an efficient friend to sustain her cause and that of her family against her enemies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not! and I cannot explain. Yet it is simple! I have {{an elder}} brother, of whom I never heard, to whom {{everything}} belongs. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Far from it," [...] replied Barney. [...] "Bring your {{rope and}} the swords. I think we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the rescuing of the Princess Emma the easiest {{part of our}} adventure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn’t it true?" [...] inquired his listener. [...] "He says he {{can prove}} it. And he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out what you meant by saying you were afraid of making mischief." ...|$|R
60|$|Finding a {{dozen or}} more of these rascals {{gathered}} there, Captain Morgan informed them of his present purpose--that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the Spanish captain to demand his papers of him, and calling upon them to accompany him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must apologise for my rudeness to you of last night," [...] he continued. [...] "I expected, when I {{took the}} liberty of turning you round, that I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> myself {{face to face with}} a much younger man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very sad," [...] said Johnny. Perhaps {{the major}} {{had heard about}} the {{accusation}} for the first time to-day, and <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an escape on that plea. If such was the case, it would not be so well to be particularly civil.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{ingenuity}} {{accepts the}} task, at any rate," [...] Harcutt said. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out all about it, {{and you must}} help me. It will be for both our interests." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Rollo," [...] said Charles, [...] "I {{think it}} is time for us to begin <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>find</b> our way home. I don't see how you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the way at all." ...|$|R
5000|$|Liam Lacey's {{review of}} the album in The Globe and Mail {{concluded}} on a negative sentiment, noting the production was [...] "entertaining listening - about twice. Other hosers <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> it extremely confusing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was afraid," [...] he told her, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{this farm}} kinda tame. Usually expect {{a few more}} good fellows and highballs in mine, but thanks to you, little sister, looks like I'll have a bigger time than a high-line poker Party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{has been}} a great change," [...] he {{answered}} simply. [...] "In those days I was very near starvation. I had no idea how I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> work. Yet even then I found myself longing for adventures of any sort,--anything to quicken the blood, to feel the earth swell beneath my feet." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{could not}} but smile, {{at which he}} grimaced. [...] "I gave myself away that time!" [...] he said. [...] "But do you know that, {{although}} I have kept the diary for months past, it never once struck me how I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> any particular part of it in case I wanted to look it up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{paused for}} some moments and then resumed: [...] "Perhaps it is ridiculous, but I imagine now I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the lode. The doubts I started with have gone; I feel calmly confident." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give it up. Of course, he {{may have}} friends or {{relatives}} here. But I don't know how we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out the truth about that, and what good will it do us if we do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{the depth}} of the hole that shell has made. It ought to be filled up, and I must {{calculate}} how many loads of earth and stones it will take to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Good-bye, senor,' he said; 'if ever we {{meet again}} I {{shall be the}} richest man in the world, and I will {{remember}} you.' I laughed a little--I was too weak to laugh much--and watched him strike out for the great desert to the west, wondering if he was mad, or what he thought he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> there.|$|E
60|$|They went out, {{leaving the}} door open. Duane dropped down to rest himself and to wait. He {{would have liked}} to hear Miss Longstreth's answer. But he could guess what it would be. Lawson {{appeared}} to be all Duane had thought him, and he believed he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out presently that he was worse.|$|E
60|$|Moonlight {{not being}} one of the party, and having already supped, said to her mother that she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Skipping Rabbit and have a run with her. You see, Moonlight, {{although}} full seventeen years of age, was still so much of a child as to delight in a scamper with her little friend, the youngest child of Bounding Bull.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, it {{is ridiculous}} of me," [...] she admitted. And then: [...] "But I <b>am</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{worry about it}} any longer; I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out where Mr. Caldwell is," [...] and she motioned to a passing steward.|$|R
6000|$|... "The ghostly voice!" [...] {{he muttered}} to himself. He gave a sudden shiver and then steadied himself. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{out what it}} means, or know the reason why!" [...] And he gripped his gun tightly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{out what}} this means," [...] muttered the eldest Rover. [...] "If {{we are to}} catch the fever, maybe we've got it already." [...] And {{he walked into the}} cabin, and one after another the others followed.|$|R
6000|$|At last he was [...] "through, just {{through with}} loafing around {{and not getting}} acquainted," [...] he told himself. He was tired of Zapps. There was nothing to Zapps. He would go up to Mrs. Arty's and now--he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Morton. Next morning, marveling at himself for not having done this easy task before, he telephoned to the Pennsylvania Railroad offices, asked for Morton, and in {{one-half}} minute heard: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had formed}} no {{acceptable}} hypothesis {{in regard to}} what I had seen the day before, but I {{was going to do}} something better than that; I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out if what had occurred could possibly be real and actual. If I should be convinced that this was impossible, then I intended to accept the whole affair as a dream which had taken place during an unconscious nap.|$|E
60|$|That autumn he {{left the}} beach {{as soon as he}} could, and set off alone because of a notion in his bullet-head. He <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Sea Cow, if there was such a person in the sea, and he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a quiet island with good firm beaches for seals to live on, where men could not get at them. So he {{explored}} and explored by himself from the North to the South Pacific, swimming as much as three hundred miles in a day and a night. He met with more adventures than can be told, and narrowly escaped being caught by the Basking Shark, and the Spotted Shark, and the Hammerhead, and he met all the untrustworthy ruffians that loaf up and down the seas, and the heavy polite fish, and the scarlet spotted scallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years, and grow very proud of it; but he never met Sea Cow, and he never found an island that he could fancy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not dining yet," [...] I said to him. [...] "You will excuse me. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> my Man About Town {{this night}} if I have to rake New York from the Battery to Little Coney Island." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tennessee coach Butch Jones stated [...] "Tennessee had a {{different}} look ... This football team <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> denied. They <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way <b>to</b> win the football game. I'm just happy for them because they deserve to have this feeling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go over {{to their}} camp, and after they have gone to bed take all the boats away---and take {{whatever}} else we can get hold of, too. Then I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a new camp---some place where they can't locate us very easily." ...|$|R
