5|$|The Red Bull Air Race was {{conceived}} in 2001 in the Red Bull sports think-tank {{which has been}} responsible for creating a range of new sports events across the world. The aim was to develop a new aviation race that would challenge the ability of the world's best pilots, creating a race in the sky that <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> about speed, but also precision and skill. The answer was to build a specially designed obstacle course which the pilots would navigate at high speeds.|$|E
5|$|During {{production}} Burtt had {{the opportunity}} to look at the items used by Jimmy MacDonald, Disney's in-house sound designer for many of their classic films. Burtt used many of MacDonald's items on WALL-E. Because Burtt <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> adding sound effects in post-production, the animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas, which Burtt found an unusual experience. He worked in sync with the animators, returning their animation after adding the sounds to give them more ideas. Burtt would choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character, but if he could not find one that worked, he would choose a dramatic and unrealistic noise. Burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters, before he and Stanton pared it down to a distinct few for each robot.|$|E

We are, to our very core, thinking animals, always conversing with ourselves as we interact with others. If we want to understand cause, focus on human thinking.|$|R

5|$|Fortifications such as this, and the star-shaped fortresses more {{commonly}} found in the flatter lands of the Dutch Provinces, increasingly made 16th-century warfare both difficult and expensive; victory <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> a matter of winning a battle over the enemy's army. Victory required traveling from one fortified and armed city to another and investing time and money {{in one of two}} outcomes. Ideally, a show of extraordinary force convinced city leaders to surrender. If the show of force did not intimidate a city, the alternative was an expensive siege that reduced the city to rubble and ended with storming the ruins. In the case of the former, when a city capitulated, it would have to quarter troops at its own expense, called execution, but the soldiers would not be permitted to plunder. In the case of the latter, no quarter would be given to the defenders and the victorious soldiers were released to pillage, plunder, and sack.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{invasion}} of Ireland began between 1166 and 1171, under first Richard de Clare and then Henry II of England, with {{the occupation of}} southern and eastern Ireland {{by a number of}} Anglo-Norman barons. The rapid Norman success depended on key economic and military advantages, with castles enabling them to control the newly conquered territories. The new lords rapidly built castles to protect their possessions, many of these were motte-and-bailey constructions; in Louth at least 23 of these were built. It remains uncertain how many ringwork castles were built in Ireland by the Anglo-Normans. Other castles, such as Trim and Carrickfergus, were built in stone as the caput centres for major barons. Analysis of these stone castles suggests that building in stone <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> a military decision; indeed, several of the castles contain serious defensive flaws. Instead the designs, including their focus on large stone keeps, were intended both to increase the prestige of the baronial owners and to provide adequate space for the administrative apparatus of the new territories. Unlike in Wales the indigenous Irish lords do not appear to have constructed their own castles in any significant number during the period.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} a castle <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> militaristic, but was also {{considered}} to be a stamp of authority over the population of an area and a status symbol. Some would have acted as centres of trade and administration for a manor. The earliest castles in Greater Manchester are Dunham and Watch Hill in Trafford, Ullerwood in Manchester, and Stockport Castle in Stockport. They were first recorded in 1173 as belonging to barons who had rebelled against Henry II, and at least three were motte-and-bailey castles, probably because of the speed and ease with which they could be erected. Hamon de Massey, who owned the Trafford castles and Ullerwood, and Geoffrey de Constentyn, who owned Stockport Castle, were two of the three rebels from Cheshire; the other was the Earl of Chester, the owner of Chester Castle. Castles continued to be built in the area, although the last to be built in Greater Manchester were two fortified manor houses near Bury, built more for comfort than as utilitarian military structures. Bury Castle and Radcliffe Tower followed the national trend in the 13th century; they would most likely have acted as the centre of the manor they served.|$|E

5|$|To {{catch the}} public's attention, this train <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> {{rolled out of}} the factory; it made a dash {{from one end of}} the CB, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The {{railroad}} spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the Zephyrs route were diverted to sidings and the turnouts were spiked into the proper alignment for the Zephyrs run. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route to ensure that there would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyrs crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road grade crossing was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the American Legion and the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E
