5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including <b>whether,</b> <b>and</b> how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on <b>whether</b> <b>and</b> how frequently John refers to the sacraments at all, and {{on the degree of}} importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers to one of these questions do not always correspond to their answer to the other.|$|E

5|$|Differences {{of opinion}} over social order between {{northern}} and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans, ultimately led to the American Civil War. Initially, states entering the Union alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, <b>whether</b> <b>and</b> how to expand or restrict slavery.|$|E

Both new cultures were under a strong Jastorf circles influence. The increasingly common within the Przeworsk culture area presence of objects made by the Jastorf people reflects penetration by their population. Both the Oksywie and Przeworsk cultures fully utilized iron processing technologies, and, unlike their predecessor cultures, they show no regional differentiation.|$|E

If contemporary digital culture is having an effect upon cognitive functioning, learned behaviours and learning behaviours it is imperative that educational establishments adapt to the educational needs of the learners. Our study explored 2 groups of school-aged learners. One group was deemed to be a high digital immersion group and the other group a low digital immersion group. The study’s aim was to study whether cognitive differences and/or educational differences existed between the 2 groups. Specifically this project investigated: <b>Whether</b> high <b>and</b> low digitally immersed children differ in terms of their attention <b>and</b> concentration; <b>whether</b> high <b>and</b> low digitally immersed children differ in terms of their reasoning ability; <b>whether</b> high <b>and</b> low digitally immersed children differ in terms of their attainment on a research task; <b>whether</b> high <b>and</b> low digitally immersed children differ in terms of their attainment on an Internet fact finding task; <b>whether</b> high <b>and</b> low digitally immersed children differ in terms of the way they approach and use resources in a research task; <b>whether</b> high <b>and</b> low digitally immersed children differ in terms of the way they approach and use the internet in an Internet fact finding task...|$|R
