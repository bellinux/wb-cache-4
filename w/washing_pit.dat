2500|$|At {{the north}} end of the main room, two smaller {{chambers}} were built, one of which contained a <b>wash</b> <b>pit.</b> That pit was built to the same dimensions as the one discovered in Operation Tracer's Stay Behind Cave. A ventilation conduit was installed in that chamber, with an appearance similar to that of the one for Operation Tracer. At {{the north end}} of the complex, a second passage led to the main tunnel system, as well as a steep tunnel. That steep tunnel to a lower level may have functioned as a [...] "spoil chute." [...] During the Second World War, it is generally thought that German spies observed the amount of garbage and construction debris removed from the Rock of Gibraltar at a variety of sites. It allowed German authorities to assess the amount of ongoing tunneling in the Rock. In addition, the amount of tunneling in the area of Lord Airey's Shelter during the Second World War may have served as cover while Operation Tracer's Stay Behind Cave was built.|$|R
5000|$|The depot is {{the only}} DTC depot which {{contains}} gates opening into three Delhi districts (East, North and South). The depot also contains numerous features and facilities such as eight <b>washing</b> <b>pits,</b> five parking centres (which also have scanning centres in them), a water tank each for drinking purposes and the Fire Department, four underground water tanks for washing buses, seven dormitories capable of holding 500 people, and two CNG stations (DTC buses run on CNG) utilised by 10 filling pumps. [...] In addition, the depot also contains a Logistics Park consisting of a GPS-based logistical center to monitor trip plans, bus movements and locations, punctuality and regularity of all the buses; and a center used to train new drivers. For the Commonwealth Games, the police set up a command center and a cargo scanning center as well. The depot is equipped to repair 65 buses at a time. The depot is also fully secured with the surveillance of 37 CCTVs. Electricity is provided by an 11 KV electric substation present in the depot complex.|$|R
25|$|After {{feeling the}} draft of wind in the tunnel on that Levanter day in December 1997, the Gibraltar Caving Group had pushed aside some {{corrugated}} metal sheets, and found a bricked-in area of the wall. Carefully removing some bricks, they soon revealed a doorway behind the bricked-in area of the tunnel. In addition to the observations posts, including a concrete slab for that on the west, the men found {{the remains of a}} bicycle. They also located the tubing which sheathed the aerial rod along the stairs. Cork tiles on the floor provided insulation for purposes of both warmth and sound. They were in two patterns and shapes: square tiles arranged around the periphery of the room, presumably to indicate storage areas, and narrow tiles in a herringbone pattern in the main area of the room centrally. During the course of a 28-minute documentary that was filmed and produced in 1998, the team turned on the brass tap over the <b>wash</b> <b>pit</b> supplied by the 10,000 gallon water tank. The water, while initially black, soon ran clear. The men kept the location of the cave a secret for three months while they researched it. The documentary, Operation Tracer – Stay Behind Cave, was published in April 2012 (link to documentary below).|$|R

50|$|It got {{its start}} when Andrew Carnegie, through the Edgar Thompson Steel Company, leased large tracts of iron ore in the township. Small-scale mining had taken place here since the late 18th century, but Carnegie {{organized}} a major effort to exploit the deposits in 1880. Ore was removed from a broad open <b>pit,</b> <b>washed</b> to separate it from clay, and loaded onto railcars. The Pennsylvania Railroad had extended its Fairbrook Branch to the village in 1881, and hauled the ore to steel mills in Pittsburgh. There was also an extensive narrow-gauge railroad in the pits to haul ore to the washer, and several artesian wells and a reservoir to supply water for ore washing.|$|R
50|$|Stray current {{corrosion}} occurs because: 1) {{the piping}} {{system has been}} connected accidentally or intentionally to a DC voltage source; 2) the piping does not have metal-to-metal electrical continuity throughout its length; or 3) if the voltage source is AC, one or more naturally occurring minerals coating the pipe interior may act as a rectifier, converting AC current to DC. The DC voltage forces the water within the piping {{to act as an}} electrical conductor (an electrolyte). Electric current leaves the copper pipe, moves though the water across the nonconductive section (a plastic filter housing, for example), and reenters the pipe on the opposite side. Pitting occurs at the electrically negative side (the cathode), which may happen to be either upstream or downstream with respect to the water flow direction. Pitting occurs because the electrical voltage ionizes the pipe's interior copper metal, which reacts chemically with dissolved minerals in the water, creating copper salts; these copper salts are soluble in water and <b>wash</b> away. Microscopic <b>pits</b> eventually grow and consolidate to form pin holes. When one is discovered, there are almost certainly more that have not yet leaked. A complete discussion of stray current corrosion can be found in chapter 11, section 11.4.3, of Handbook of Corrosion Engineering, by Pierre Roberge.|$|R
40|$|The botryosphaeriaceous fungi {{can cause}} decline, dieback {{and death of}} grapevines. Anecdotal {{evidence}} has indicated that these pathogens might {{be present in the}} young vines sold by propagation nurseries, so this study investigated their role in spread of this disease. Sampling of grapevine nurseries across New Zealand showed that botryosphaeriaceous infections were present in eight out of nine nurseries with infection incidence ranging from 5 to 63 %. Of the 311 propagation materials and plants received, 23 % were positive for botryosphaeriaceous infection, with a total of 120 isolates recovered. The highest incidence was in failed grafted plants (33 %), followed by Grade 1 plants (28 %), rootstock cuttings (19 %), scion cuttings (17 %) and Grade 2 plants (7 %). For grafted plants, the majority of botryosphaeriaceous species (49 %) were isolated near the graft unions while infections on rootstocks and scion cuttings were mostly from the middle and basal parts. Identification of isolates by morphological and molecular methods showed that the six species commonly found in vineyards also occurred in nurseries, being Neofusicoccum luteum (57 %), N. parvum (18 %), N. australe (8 %), Diplodia mutila (8 %), Botryosphaeria dothidea (5 %) and D. seriata (3 %), with one novel isolate of N. macroclavatum and two unidentified botryosphaeriaceous isolates. Pathogenicity tests using one-year-old Sauvignon blanc rooted canes and green shoots showed that the seven identified botryosphaeriaceous species from the nurseries were pathogenic but pathogenicity differed significantly between species and isolates within a species, with N. parvum being the most pathogenic in both assays (P≤ 0. 001). Genetic variability analysis using UP-PCR showed that N. luteum isolates of different pathotypes were genetically diverse with intra- and inter-plant and nursery variability but no association between genotype and pathogenicity was observed. Susceptibility tests using three isolates each of N. luteum, N. parvum and N. australe against the most commonly used scion and rootstock varieties (six of each) found that all varieties were susceptible to the three species with 5 C and SO 4 being the most susceptible of the rootstock varieties, and Merlot and Pinot noir being the most susceptible of the scions. Investigations into the sources of inoculum conducted in three nurseries in 2009 using conventional and molecular methods showed that the mothervines used to provide cuttings for propagation were the most likely source of botryosphaeriaceous infections. Propagules were detected on the surfaces of cuttings and dead grapevine materials, as well as in rain-water run-off, but not in soil samples collected from the mothervine blocks. The different botryosphaeriaceous isolates recovered from canes were mostly sited within the bark suggesting presence of latent infections. Since the isolates from mothervine trunk and canes were distributed in isolated patches and the UP-PCR assessment showed that they belonged to multiple genotypes and species, this indicated that they were spread from external sources. Microscopy and plating assays were not able to detect botryosphaeriaceous contamination from any of the nursery propagation stages but molecular methods using multi-species primers detected botryosphaeriaceous DNA in samples from a <b>wash</b> <b>pit,</b> pre-cold storage hydration tanks, post-grafting hydration tanks, grafting tools and callusing medium from the different nurseries. An investigation into the probable survival of N. luteum conidia during the processing of cuttings showed that they adhered rapidly and could not be totally washed from the surfaces of cuttings after 0 h, with minimal recovery of conidia after 1, 2 and 4 h incubation at room temperature. During this time they germinated and colonised the periderm, phloem and xylem but not the pith of the cuttings. At storage temperatures of 2 and 8 °C some conidia were able to germinate. At 2 °C, conidial germination was 4 % after 48 h, the number gradually increasing to 17 % after 3 weeks. At 8 °C, conidial germination was 23 % after 24 h, the number gradually increasing to 34 % after 72 h with no further increase observed up to 2 weeks. Cold storage did not kill all conidia, since conidia from 72 h and 3 weeks storage at 2 °C had 84 % and 33 % viability, respectively, while those from 8 °C storage had 72 % and 39 % viability after 72 h and 2 weeks storage, respectively. The N. luteum conidia stored at different temperatures were similarly pathogenic compared to freshly-harvested conidia but higher pathogenicity was observed on conidia stored at 2 °C for 48 to 72 h. Overall results suggest that botryosphaeriaceous infection in new vineyards may originate from latent infection that began in the nurseries, thus management of this disease should start at the nursery level to prevent this pathogen from being carried over into new vineyards...|$|R
