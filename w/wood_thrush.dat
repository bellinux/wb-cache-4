25|$|In Rabbit Hollow, {{through which}} Ackerly Creek flows, there are {{numerous}} bird species, including Louisiana waterthrush, Cooper's hawk, <b>wood</b> <b>thrush,</b> swamp sparrow, pileated woodpecker, belted kingfisher, red-winged blackbird, and gray catbird. Mammals in the hollow include rabbits, woodchucks, chipmunks, squirrels, and white-tailed deer.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} several hawk and falcon species (not grassland-dependent) {{have been}} seen at the site, and black-billed cuckoo and <b>wood</b> <b>thrush</b> have been nesting in the woodland portions. Non-bird species that have settled into the habitat include several turtle species, small-mouthed bass and sunfish in the one small pond on the site and white-tailed deer in the woodlands.|$|E
25|$|These {{mountains}} and plateau have over 20 species of reptiles represented as lizard, skink, turtle and snake. Some of the icterid birds visit the mountains {{as well as}} the hermit thrush and <b>wood</b> <b>thrush.</b> North American migrant birds live throughout the mountains during the warmer seasons. Occasionally, osprey and eagles can be found nesting along the streams. The hawks and owls are the most common birds of prey.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{species of}} birds inhabit the {{floodplains}} and slopes near Mahoning Creek. These include scarlet tanagers, black-throated green warblers, belted kingfishers, gray catbirds, black-capped chickadees, eastern wood-peewees, Louisiana waterthrushes, and <b>wood</b> <b>thrushes.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>thrushes</b> are monogamous. Breeding pairs form in mid-April to early-May, {{and usually}} last {{throughout}} the breeding season. Most thrushes {{find a new}} mate each year, and mate guarding and extra-pair copulations have not been observed in this species.|$|R
50|$|The herons roost in {{the eastern}} end with its tall sycamores. As you move towards the west, the woods become denser with beech, tulip poplars and maples. Here, {{there are a variety}} of smaller birds, {{including}} kinglets, <b>wood</b> <b>thrushes,</b> woodpeckers, and warblers.|$|R
25|$|Nyssa sylvatica is an {{important}} food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change (foliar fruit flagging) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: American robin, Swainson's thrush, gray-cheeked thrush, hermit thrush, <b>wood</b> <b>thrush,</b> northern cardinal, northern mockingbird, blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, northern flicker, pileated woodpecker, eastern phoebe, brown thrasher, eastern bluebird, European starling, scarlet tanager, gray catbird, cedar waxwing, and American crow, all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.|$|E
500|$|Although {{many species}} of bird imitate the vocalizations of other birds, the {{northern}} mockingbird is the best known in North America for doing so. Among the species and vocalizations imitated are Carolina wren, northern cardinal, tufted titmouse, eastern towhee, house sparrow, <b>wood</b> <b>thrush</b> and eastern bluebird songs, calls of the northern flicker and great crested flycatcher, jeers and pumphandles of the blue jay, and alarm, chups, and chirrs [...] of the American robin. It imitates not only birds, but also other animals such as cats, dogs, frogs, crickets and sounds from artificial items such as unoiled wheels and even car alarms. As convincing as these imitations may be to humans, they often fail to fool other birds, such as the Florida scrub-jay.|$|E
500|$|The {{park has}} good bird viewing areas along the trails, near the two lakes, {{and at the}} Nature Center. The hooded warbler, pileated woodpecker, and ruffed grouse nest in the park. [...] Goldfinches and {{northern}} cardinals {{can be seen at}} feeders near the Nature Center. [...] The pileated woodpecker, Acadian flycatcher, eastern wood pewee, white-breasted nuthatch, <b>wood</b> <b>thrush,</b> and yellow-billed cuckoo can all be observed in the park's Ogle Hollow Nature Preserve. [...] Owls and woodpeckers are known to occupy sycamore trees. [...] The cerulean warbler, whippoorwill, and broad-winged hawk all live in the Ten O'Clock Nature Preserve. [...] Wild turkeys can be seen (and heard) along the park's Trail 10, known as the Fire Tower Trail. [...] Other bird species in the park include the blue jay, the crow, the junco, the white-breasted nuthatch, and the robin.|$|E
50|$|There are 12 common {{species of}} trees in the {{watershed}} of West Branch Chillisquaque Creek. There are 22 species of herbs that are common in the creek's watershed. Ovenbirds, black-throated green warblers, <b>wood</b> <b>thrushes,</b> blue-headed vireo and common yellowheads are the major species of birds in the watershed.|$|R
50|$|Some {{bird species}} {{that have been}} spotted in local backyards are cardinals, titmice, robins, ospreys, crows, woodpeckers, flickers, mockingbirds, <b>wood</b> <b>thrushes,</b> gray catbirds, cowbirds, chickadees, blue jays, {{mourning}} doves, towhees, summer tanagers, goldfinches, house and purple finches and the ubiquitous species starling and sparrow. Kingfishers, herons and hawks are seen near Sligo Creek.|$|R
50|$|Many animals {{feed on the}} leaves, twigs, {{and berries}} of spicebush. Some mammals include whitetail deer, Eastern cottontail rabbit, opossums. Over 20 species of birds {{including}} both gamebirds and song birds such as ring-necked pheasant, bobwhite, ruffed grouse {{and others have been}} known to feed on spicebush. The berries are a favorite food of <b>wood</b> <b>thrushs.</b>|$|R
500|$|Ricketts Glen State Park has {{extensive}} acreage of [...] "interior forest" [...] that is {{far from}} open space; several bird species that are area-sensitive are found within these forests in the park, including the black-throated green warbler, red-eyed vireo, dark-eyed junco and black-capped chickadee. Two species of owl, barred and northern saw-whet, inhabit the deep forests. The hemlock forests of the glens are home to the Louisiana waterthrush, Acadian flycatcher, Blackburnian warbler, blue-headed vireo, magnolia warbler, brown creeper, golden-crowned kinglet and winter wren. <b>Wood</b> <b>thrush</b> {{are found in the}} lower elevations of the park and are replaced within the ecosystem by hermit thrush at the higher elevations. The Canada warbler and black-throated blue warbler are on several watchlists, but are common within the park. The Canada warbler inhabits blueberry thickets with white-throated sparrow, while the black-throated blue warbler is found in the forests atop the plateau with the least flycatcher. Common raven are regularly seen soaring over the forests of the park looking for carrion. Canada goose are present in the park and have been classified as a [...] "pest" [...] due to their high numbers and the large amount of fecal waste they leave on the shores of Lake Jean. Ricketts Glen's forests also support populations of [...] Nashville and yellow-rumped warblers, yellow-bellied sapsucker, red-breasted nuthatch, and purple finch.|$|E
2500|$|Catharus is a genus {{of birds}} in the thrush family Turdidae. It {{contains}} the small, mostly insectivorous or omnivorous migrant thrushes of North America and the nightingale-thrushes of Central and South America. Its closest relative is the <b>wood</b> <b>thrush</b> of the monotypic genus Hylocichla, [...] which is sometimes merged into Catharus.|$|E
2500|$|The Catharus {{species are}} either long-distance {{migrants}} or fairly resident birds. They were sometimes split {{according to this}} and morphological characters, the migrant group occasionally also including the <b>wood</b> <b>thrush.</b> Comparison of mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 as well as nuclear Î²-fibrinogen intron 7 sequence data indicates that this is incorrect. A later study by Gary Voelker and colleagues (2013) utilized 10 genes (two mitochondrial, two sex-linked and six autosomal) to compare the 12 species of Catharus and Hylocichla mustelina.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a fairly}} high level of bird {{biodiversity}} in the watershed of Tenmile Run. Birds living in the stream's watershed include worm-eating warblers, <b>wood</b> <b>thrushes,</b> ovenbirds, Eastern tufted titmouses, Eastern towhees, veerys, pileated woodpeckers, nuthatches, common yellowthroats, and American redstarts. Other bird species found in the watershed include scarlet tanagers, black-capped chickadees, and black-throated green warblers.|$|R
50|$|The book {{tells the}} first year of a <b>wood</b> <b>thrush's</b> life {{starting}} from it hatching in a forest that is in Maryland. Two children see the bird when it is young and calls it Flute. The children wait for Flute to return from migration and watch him and his mate build a nest and raise their young. In Flute's travels, he encounters many dangers. The eggs and nestlings are at more of a risk.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to countless studies and published papers, the Cornell Lab's Conservation Science Department has produced land managers' guides aimed at conserving dwindling populations of scarlet tanagers, <b>wood</b> <b>thrushes,</b> and other forest birds. The Lab worked with Partners in Flight to identify rapidly declining species and produce the first North American Landbird Conservation Plan. Lab staff {{also worked with}} multiple partners to create the first-ever State of the Birds report in March 2009.|$|R
2500|$|The Smokies {{are home}} to a diverse bird {{population}} due {{to the presence of}} multiple forest types. [...] Species that thrive in southern hardwood forests, such as the red-eyed vireo, <b>wood</b> <b>thrush,</b> wild turkey, northern parula, ruby-throated hummingbird, and tufted titmouse, are found throughout the range's lower elevations and cove hardwood forests. [...] Species more typical of cooler climates, such as the raven, winter wren, black-capped chickadee, yellow-bellied sapsucker, dark-eyed junco, and Blackburnian, chestnut-sided, and Canada warblers, are found in the range's spruce-fir and northern hardwood zones.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} recent {{additions}} to the source-sink literature is by Tittler et al., who examined <b>wood</b> <b>thrush</b> (Hylocichla mustelina) survey data for evidence of source and sink populations on a large scale. [...] The authors reasoned that emigrants from sources would likely be the juveniles produced in one year dispersing to reproduce in sinks in the next year, producing a one-year time lag between population changes in the source and in the sink. [...] Using data from the Breeding Bird Survey, an annual survey of North American birds, they looked for relationships between survey sites showing such a one-year time lag. [...] They found several pairs of sites showing significant relationships 60â80km apart. [...] Several appeared to be sources to more than one sink, and several sinks appeared to receive individuals from more than one source. [...] In addition, some sites appeared to be a sink to one site and a source to another (see Figure 1). [...] The authors concluded that source-sink dynamics may occur on continental scales.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{population}} declines of neotropical migrant songbirds breeding in {{the eastern}} deciduous forests {{have been attributed to}} forest fragmentation. Although some research has been conducted on the demographic processes occurring in forest songbirds subjected to habitat fragmentation, {{little is known about the}} physiological and health-related ramifications of forest degradation. I used <b>Wood</b> <b>Thrushes</b> (Hylocichla mustelina) to investigate whether forest fragmentation has an impact on immunological condition and infection with ectoparasites and blood-borne pathogens. I compared <b>Wood</b> <b>Thrushes</b> occurring in small, fragmented forest patches to others living in unfragmented areas for differences in morphology, immunological and body condition, behavior, and infection with hemoparasites and ectoparasites. <b>Wood</b> <b>Thrushes</b> in unfragmented sites exhibited more aggressive behaviors against standardized experimental challenges, and were in better physiological condition, as evidenced by higher hematocrits, than those from fragmented sites. Tail and wing length were negatively correlated to Julian date while total fat deposits were positively correlated to Julian date, suggesting that birds in the late summer had abraded plumage but higher energetic reserves. Total parasitemia (intensity of hemoparasite infections) positively correlated to heterophil-lymphocyte ratio (H/L) indicating heavy infections precipitated a skew in normal immunological profiles. Ectoparasite burden decreased over the course of the summer, and was negatively correlated to fat deposits, suggesting a negative impact of ectoparasites on the energetic balance of the host. Fragmentation did not appear to have an effect on either ectoparasite or hemoparasite infections. My results suggest that fragmentation has impacts on some aspects of Wood Thrushesâ behavior physiology but that such effects may not be immediately observable. Furthermore, any studies should consider timing of measurements in addition to habitat condition as important factors shaping the physiological condition and infection status of forest migrants...|$|R
50|$|Neotropical migrantsâbirds that {{spend their}} summers in Canada and the U.S. and their winters in Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and South Americaâuse Cape May Peninsula's varied {{habitats}} in great abundance during their {{long and difficult}} migrations. Due to loss of habitat throughout much of their range many of these species are in decline. Almost 100 neotropical songbird species stop to rest and feed along the Cape May Peninsula most often using forest habitats. Many songbird species also nest here including ovenbirds, <b>wood</b> <b>thrushes</b> and yellow-throated warblers.|$|R
40|$|We {{collected}} 48 nests from radio-marked and nonradio- marked female <b>Wood</b> <b>Thrushes</b> (Hylocichla mustelina) at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge {{in central}} Georgia and conducted statistical analyses {{to determine the}} sources of variation in nest size. Each nest measurement had a large coefficient of variation, but we found trends in six of eight nest measurements related to date, nest number, female occupant, or nest success. Regression analyses showed that cup depth, nest wall width, and exterior nest height decreased during the season, while cup width increased (0. 14 3 Ìc R 2 3 Ìc 0. 24). A repeated-measures linear model, comprised of study plot, nest number, and occupant effects, adequately described much {{of the variation in}} the multi-broodedr,a dio-markedf emales 2 Ì 7 (n = 24 nests) nest size (0. 55 3 Ìc R 2 3 Ìc 0. 84). Cup depth, cup width, exterior nest height, and nest weight showed differences among nest attempt number, while weight and exterior nest height showed differences related to individual females. We also found evidence that nestlings in successful nests apparently enlarged the nest cup. Very little is known about short-term variation in nest size and shape, but our results indicate that female <b>Wood</b> <b>Thrushes</b> may change the size of their nests for various reasons during the breeding season...|$|R

40|$|Biologists often {{estimate}} separate {{survival and}} movement niles from radiotelemetry and markrecapture {{data from the}} same study population.

We furnish an example using <b>wood</b> <b>thrushes</b> (Hylocichla mustelina) captured at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge in central Georgia in 1996. The model structure allows estimation of survival and capture probabilities, as well as estimation of movements away from and into the study area. In addition, the model structure provides many possibilities for hypothesis testing. Using the combined model structure, we estimated that weekly survival of <b>wood</b> <b>thrushes</b> was 0. 989 Â± 0. 007 (Â±SE).

Fidelity rates (weekly probability of remaining in a stratum) did not differ between geographic strata (~= 0. 911 Â± 0. 020; Î±[Î¨ 11,Î¨ 22]= 0. 0161, 95 % CI = - 0. 0309 to 0. 0631), and recapture rates (p = 0. 097 Â± 0. 016) of banded and radiomarked individuals were not different (Î±[Pradioed, Pbanded] = 0. 145, 95 % CI = - 0. 510 to 0. 800). Combining these data types in a common model resulted in more precise estimates of movement and recapture rates than separate estimation, but ability to detect stratum or mark-specific differences in parameters was weak.
