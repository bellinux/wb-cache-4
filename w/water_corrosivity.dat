40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} in Kashan Fajre Sepahan Galvanizing mills (KFSGM) for evaluation of <b>water</b> <b>corrosivity</b> during 2005 - 2006. A total of 18 samples were taken from various points of the water supply system for testing the specific parameters and calculation Langelier Index (LI), Ryznar Index (RI) and Pukorious Index (PI). This research showed that in raw water (sand filter effluent) LI were positive as well as RI and PI were lower than 7 which means that mentioned water is not corrosive. Also LI in treated water by reverse osmosis process was negative and RI and PI were higher than 7, so, this water has corrosive properties. Finally, calculated indexes indicate that according to LI, conditioned water is not corrosive but based on RI and P. this water tend to corrosivity which this findings is compatible with literature review statement. So it is recommended that, for water conditioning addition of preservative chemicals to be continued {{but at the same time}} another alternatives such as pH adjustment, air stripping and deoxygenating, control of carbonate concentration and split flow treatment should be studied. </p...|$|E
40|$|Ductile iron pipes {{have been}} used in North America since the late 1950 s. This paper {{describes}} research that endeavored to gain a thorough understanding of the geometry of external corrosion pits and the factors (e. g., soil properties, appurtenances, and service connections) that influence this geometry. This understanding is subsequently used in the companion paper to devise a sampling scheme and to infer the condition of ductile iron buried <b>water</b> mains. Soil <b>corrosivity</b> is not a directly measurable parameter, and pipe external corrosion is primarily a random phenomenon. The literature is replete with methods and systems that attempt to use soil properties (e. g., resistivity, pH, and redox potential) to quantify soil corrosivity and subsequently predict pipe corrosion. In this research, varying lengths of ductile iron pipes were exhumed by several North American water utilities. The exhumed pipes were cut into short sections, sandblasted, and tagged. Soil samples were also obtained at discrete locations along the exhumed pipe. Pipe sections were scanned for external corrosion using a specially developed laser scanner. Scanned corrosion data were processed using specially developed software to obtain information on pit depth, pit area, and pit volume. Statistical analyses were subsequently performed on these three geometrical attributes. Various soil characteristics were investigated to determine their impact on the geometric properties of the corrosion pits. Subsequently, a method is proposed to assess the condition of a ductile iron pipe, based on the geometry of corrosion pits of several samples extracted along the pipe. This paper describes the pipe exhumation, data preparation, and statistical analysis of corrosion pits. The companion paper describes a sampling scheme to infer pipe condition of ductile iron buried water mains. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Acid {{precipitation}} {{may increase}} human exposure to several potentially toxic metals by increasing metal concentrations in major pathways to man, particularly food and water, {{and in some}} instances by enhancing the conversion of metal species to more toxic forms. Human exposures to methylmercury are almost entirely by way of consumption of fish and seafood. In some countries, intakes by this route may approach the levels that can give rise to adverse health effects for population groups with a high consumption of these food items. A possible increase in methylmercury concentrations in fish from lakes affected by acid precipitation may thus be of concern to selected population groups. Human exposures to lead reach levels that are near those associated with adverse health effects in certain sensitive segments of the general population in several countries. The possibility exists that increased exposures to lead may be caused by acid precipitation through a mobilization of lead from soils into crops. A route of exposure to lead that may possibly be influenced by acid precipitation is an increased deterioration of surface materials containing lead and a subsequent ingestion by small children. A similar situation with regard to uptake from food exists for cadmium (at least in some countries). Human metal exposures via drinking water may be increased by acid precipitation. Decreasing pH increases corrosiveness of water enhancing the mobilization of metal salts from soil; metallic compounds may be mobilized from minerals, which may eventually reach drinking water. Also, the dissolution of metals (Pb, Cd, Cu) from piping systems for drinking water by soft acidic <b>waters</b> of high <b>corrosivity</b> may increase metal concentrations in drinking water. Exposures have occasionally reached concentrations which are in the range where adverse health effects may be expected in otherwise healthy persons. Dissolution from piping systems can be prevented by neutralizing the water before distribution. Increased aluminum concentrations in water is a result mainly of the occurrence of Al in acidified natural waters and the use of Al chemicals in drinking water purification. If such water is used for dialysis in patients with chronic renal failure, it may give rise to cases of dialysis dementia and other disorders. A possible influence on health of persons with normal renal function (e. g., causing Alzheimer's disease) is uncertain and requires further investigation. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R

A total of 16 samples were taken from various points of the Ghezel-Ozan for testing the specific parameters and calculation Langelier Index (LI), Ryznar (RI) and Puckorius Index (PI). According to equilibrium of chemical between salts exist on water on 2 half of a year, to reduce dangers of undesirable quality componentsof Ghezel-Ozan River water. The average of Langelier saturation Index for water of Ghezel-Ozan River, obtained equals 1. 22, Ryznar saturation Index is 5. 83 and Puckorius Index obtained is 4. 66. Comparison of this index showed tendency on sedimentation that must be remedied in order to prevent the sediment and corrosion pipes in order to reduce costs of replacing pipes. Determination the kind of plantation on regions that has salty water is necessary, in order to prevent reducing crop efficiency in these regions.

40|$|Potential {{health effects}} of {{drinking}} water quality changes caused by acid precipitation are presented. Several different types of water supply are discussed and their roles in modifying acid rain impacts on drinking water are explained. Sources of metals contamination in surface water supplies are enumerated. The authors present some results from their research into acid rain impacts on roof-catchment cisterns, small surface water supplies, and lead mobilization in acid soils. A good correlation was obtained between cistern <b>water</b> <b>corrosivity</b> {{as measured by the}} Ryznar Index (RI) values and standing tapwater copper concentrations. However, lead concentrations in tapwater did not correlate well with cistern water RI. A modified linear regression model that accounted for Ryznar Index change during storage in vinyl-lined cisterns was used to predict the Ryznar Index value at a copper concentration of 1000 micrograms/L. The predicted RI was greater than the RI of precipitation with a pH of 5. 3, indicating that anthropogenically acidified precipitation may result in cistern tapwater copper concentrations in excess of the 1000 micrograms/L suggested drinking water limit. Good correlations between tapwater Ryznar Index and tapwater copper and lead concentrations were not obtained for the small surface water supply. Aluminum concentrations in reservoir water were similar to those in stream source water. Limited data were also presented that indicated lead was present in acid forest soil leachate and streams draining such soils in relatively small concentrations. Where appropriate, recommendations for future research are included with the discussions of research results...|$|E

40|$|Several health {{problems}} {{may be caused}} by excess nitrate in drinking water, the most important of which being methemoglobinemia, a potentially fatal disorder, in infants under six months of age. Many {{different parts of the world}} have been facing the problem of nitrate contaminated surface and groundwaters due in large part to excessive use of nitrate-based chemical fertilizers. In the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada some groundwater sources have nitrate concentrations approaching the Health Canada and Ontario Ministry of the Environment maximum acceptable concentration (MAC) of 10 mg NO 3 [...] N/L. Finding a practical and economical way to reduce nitrate concentrations in representative groundwater in the Region of Waterloo was the overall objective of this research. To achieve this goal, nitrate removal technologies including biological denitrification, ion exchange (IX), reverse osmosis (RO), electrodialysis (ED), and chemical denitrification were reviewed and compared. IX and RO were found to be the most promising technologies for nitrate removal. They have also been approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as Best Available Technologies (BAT). To investigate the feasibility of IX and RO for nitrate removal from representative groundwater in the Region of Waterloo, bench-scale experiments were conducted and compared. These technologies could be considered for application at full- or point-of-use (POU) -scale. Decision support assistance for the selection of the appropriate technology for different technical and economical conditions is provided as an outcome of this work. Two nitrate-selective ion exchange resins (Dowex™ NSR- 1 and Purolite® A- 520 E), two non-selective resins (Purolite® A- 300 E and Amberlite® IRA 400 Cl), and a commercially-available RO POU device (Culligan® Aqua-Cleer® model RO 30), which included a particle filter and a carbon block, were tested with deionized water and real groundwater. * IX results confirmed that production time before resin exhaustion was influenced by operating conditions, specifically bed depth as would be expected. It was also confirmed that the presence of competing anions (sulfate, chloride) and alkalinity adversely affected performance, with sulfate being the main competitor for nitrate removal. The extent of these effects was quantified for the conditions tested. At the end of the runs, the non-selective resins were prone to potential nitrate displacement and release into product water and are therefore not recommended. The nitrate-selective resins did not release previously adsorbed nitrate as their capacity became exhausted. Purolite® A- 520 E was identified as the best alternative amongst the four resins for removing nitrate from the representative groundwater source. The RO unit removed roughly 80 % of the nitrate from groundwater. Background ions didn’t appear to compete with each other for removal by RO units, so RO might be a more appropriate technology than IX for nitrate removal from waters with high concentrations of sulfate or TDS. Since RO removes other background ions as well as nitrate, the product water of RO is low in alkalinity and can potentially be corrosive, if water from a small full-scale system is pumped through a communal distribution system. Post-treatment including pH adjustment, addition of caustic soda, and/or corrosion inhibitors may be required. While the carbon block did not play a substantial role with respect to removal of nitrate in the groundwater tested, a potential issue was identified when running RO systems without the carbon block. In deionized water (and presumably in very low alkalinity real waters) it was noted that RO nitrate removal efficiency dropped substantially as the alkalinity of the influent water approached zero. With respect to the scale of application of IX and RO devices, IX can be applied at full-scale without requiring large amounts of space. However, if feed water contains high concentrations of sulfate or TDS, nitrate leakage happens sooner and regeneration would be needed at more frequent intervals. Also, chloride concentrations in IX product water might exceed aesthetic objectives (AO) and should be monitored in cases of high feed water TDS. POU IX devices are not recommended when feed water nitrate concentration is high due to potential nitrate leakage into the product water when the resin is nearing exhaustion which increases public health risk. Issues associated with RO application at full-scale are high energy demand, low recovery, high costs, need of pre-treatment (fouling control), and post-treatment (corrosion control). On the other hand, POU RO devices may be acceptable since low recovery is of less importance in a household system, and product <b>water</b> <b>corrosivity</b> is less relevant. POU RO devices are preferable to POU IX units due to their lower risk of nitrate leakage into treated water. * Mention of trade names or commercial products does not constitute endorsement or recommendation for use...|$|E
40|$|To {{predict the}} {{corrosivity}} of an environment {{is not an}} easy task but nonetheless it is essential either to avoid failure and degradation or to plan for future action. On top of that, industry usually requests real-time problem solving. The methods currently available are mainly of two types: long time in-situ exposure and accelerated tests in the laboratory. What is proposed is a method that tries to fulfil the combined need of urgency and in-situ evaluation. The complexity of the problem arises from the many variables that {{play a role in the}} process. The environment corrosivity is dependent on several correlated variables making its assessment a difficult assignment. The intricacy of the relationships involved, most of them probably nonlinear, requires the application of non-conventional (statistical) pattern analysis techniques. This research aims to study the feasibility of the novel idea related to computational intelligence sensors for the assessment of environment corrosivity inspired by the concept of electronic noses. These are sensor arrays with an incorporated pattern recognition system to identify patterns in odours, vapours or gases, and automatically identify them. The idea to adapt the concept to corrosion science is based on the electrochemical potential dependency of metallic materials on the environment chemical composition. The sensor should work as an array of metallic probes working as partial selective sensors whose responses to different environments are collected as electrochemical potential values and afterwards processed by an appropriate pattern recognition system. Predictions are to be made as steel polarization resistance values which are indicators of the degree of corrosivity of the environment. To implement this idea, eight materials were selected and their electrochemical potential in selected environments was monitored. The influencing variables were also monitored and the steel polarisation rate in the same environments was measured. The large datasets obtained and the complexity of the relationships involved, requested advance mathematical procedures to process and analyse the data. The goal was to apply scientific data mining techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and Kernel-PLS (K-PLS) to corrosion science. K-PLS was recently introduced as a kernel method which is functionally equivalent to Support Vector Machines (SVM). K-PLS often yields excellent predictive models for problems with highly correlated variables and has the advantage of involving less heuristics than the corresponding ANNs. K-PLS and ANN-based modelling techniques were applied to a specific case study, and further improvements were necessary to avoid misleading interpretation of the results obtained. Although initial models yielded low errors, a closer observation of the error plots suggested the possibility of local learning instead of a more general prediction model. The application of the Leave-One-Out method (LOO) using the K-PLS technique and the appropriate tuning of relevant parameters improved the results to some extent. The conclusions obtained with K-PLS can be extended to ANNs and it became clear that both techniques perform adequately. Nevertheless, the generalization for the combined environments studied requires more data to be processed in order to obtain an acceptable prediction error.
