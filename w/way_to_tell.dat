After facing legal trouble and fines when he attempted to sell the text, Horse shelved it until playing Myst and 7th Guest in the mid-1990s, whereupon he decided a first person adventure game would be the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the manuscript's story.|$|E
5|$|As {{the episode}} ends, Olivia's {{hallucination}} of Peter points {{out to her}} {{that there is a}} <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if she is from the prime universe: by confirming her memories of her niece Ella, who did not survive birth in the parallel universe. During Olivia's final test in the tank, she is again able to cross over to the gift shop in the prime universe. She is able to recall Ella's phone number and calls her, but is brought back to the parallel universe shortly after Ella answers. As she is removed from the tank, she lies, telling Walternate the test did not work.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was {{quite similar to}} Corythosaurus in {{everything}} but {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, the crest of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were {{at the front of the}} crest and stacked vertically. It also can be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making up part of the sides of the crest, which is the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.|$|E

40|$|What time is it? Prefaced by this question, {{this paper}} investigates {{a number of}} <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> express the time in Catalan from a dialectal and pragmatic perspectiva. In this article, all dialectal {{varieties}} of the two main <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the time (one based on the next hour, i. e. “one quarter of nine”, and the other based on the current hour, i. e. “eight and a quarter”) from the data from 190 locations surveyed for the Atles Lingüístic del Domini Català are described. The results of this analysis are compared to descriptive and normative proposals: grammars, style manuals, dictionaries, and other information sources. Finally, we {{give an account of}} the decline or the success of the two <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the time in Catalan dialects by comparing them with the common <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the time in neighbor languages, and by identifying aspects of linguistic economy and the degree of similarity between the ways, and by studying their sociolinguistic development...|$|R

Love does not feel that text is necessarily the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story in a game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} 1827–40, Mary Shelley was busy {{as an editor}} and writer. She wrote the novels The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck (1830), Lodore (1835), and Falkner (1837). She contributed five volumes of Lives of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French authors to Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia. She also wrote stories for ladies' magazines. She was still helping to support her father, and they looked out for {{publishers}} for each other. In 1830, she sold the copyright for a new edition of Frankenstein for £60 to Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley for their new Standard Novels series. After her father's death in 1836 {{at the age of}} eighty, she began assembling his letters and a memoir for publication, as he had requested in his will; but after two years of work, she abandoned the project. Throughout this period, she also championed Percy Shelley's poetry, promoting its publication and quoting it in her writing. By 1837, Percy's works were well-known and increasingly admired. In the summer of 1838 Edward Moxon, the publisher of Tennyson and the son-in-law of Charles Lamb, proposed publishing a collected works of Percy Shelley. Mary was paid £500 to edit the Poetical Works (1838), which Sir Timothy insisted should not include a biography. Mary found a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the story of Percy's life, nonetheless: she included extensive biographical notes about the poems.|$|E
5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, {{the more likely it}} is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, {{the more likely it is}} for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E

5|$|Abi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she {{has plans}} of her own. The {{launderette}} closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is {{too busy to}} visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her now-deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to The Queen Victoria pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the children {{that they are in}} heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find an appropriate <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns {{but it turns out that}} he's only back for his son. Dot's step granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but is left upset when Charlie leaves to go back to Ireland with Mathew, also upsetting Jack. Dot and Jack are unaware this is part of Max Branning's (Jake Wood) evil revenge for his false imprisonment.|$|E

25|$|Objective tests assume {{personality}} is consciously accessible {{and that it}} can be measured by self-report questionnaires. Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests to be more valid and reliable than projective tests. Critics have pointed to the Forer effect to suggest some of these appear to be more accurate and discriminating than they really are. Issues with these tests include false reporting because there is no <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if an individual is answering a question honestly or accurately.|$|E
25|$|English Shepherds {{are often}} larger than Border Collie, but the quickest <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the two apart {{is to put}} them on stock. Border Collies tend to herd with a {{distinctive}} strong eye contact and a crouching stance, while English Shepherds have an upright, loose-eyed herding style. English Shepherds can work all types of stock—from the meanest bull to baby chickens. Compared to others, they are prized above specialty herding breeds for being as gentle as possible or as tough as necessary with the stock.|$|E

25|$|The first {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} original Tu-154, the A model, in production since 1974, added center-section fuel tanks and more emergency exits, while engines were upgraded to higher-thrust Kuznetsov NK-8-2U. Other upgrades include automatic flaps/slats and stabilizer controls and modified avionics. Max. takeoff weight – 94,000 kg (207,235 lb). There were 15 different interior layouts for the different domestic and international customers of the airplane, seating between 144 and 152 passengers. The easiest <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the A model from the base model is {{by looking at the}} spike at the junction of the fin and tail; this is a fat bullet on the A model rather than a slender spike on the base model.|$|E
25|$|Bradypodion pumilum has two ecomorphs: a large, brightly colored, ornate version {{often found}} in closed habitats, and a small, dull version with less {{ornamentation}} {{often found in}} open vegetation. Casque size {{is known to be}} used to communicate fighting ability, but it is yet to be known whether this size is an honest signal and if it is related to bite force. Bite force is significantly related to head size and the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the strength of the bite force is measuring the head width. Open habitat males tend to have larger heads thus having stronger bite force.Larger chameleons have a high casque (parietal crest) and are brightly colored with pink patches on their flank. The smaller chameleons found in open habitats have reduced casques and lack flank color patches at all. Battles between males can lead to severe injuries through biting.|$|E
25|$|Close {{examination}} of affected features {{show that the}} doubling is extremely irregular. This is because the coin metal does not flow from just one direction, but flows and produces wear on the die from all sides. There is no definite shape, and it can take on several different but similar appearances. It often looks like a thin metal shelf or spreading spot. It can also make lettering appear thick and twisted. There are no crisp lines affected, but things generally look bloated, enlarged, blurry, twisted, and damaged. This is different from hub doubling, because hub doubling appears as a crisp secondary image, rotated minutely from the original. When casually glancing at a coin, the difference {{is not easy to}} tell, but when magnified, the difference is obvious on most coins. Another easy <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> hub doubling from die deterioration doubling is the presence of notched serifs; the small flairs on the ends of letters will appear distinctly separated with the former, whereas they appear just blurry and washed out with the latter.|$|E

25|$|Tublat (Keith David) – A rogue ape and {{a former}} member of Tarzan's gorilla family. He {{challenged}} Kerchak for leadership but he was defeated and cast out. He is considered dangerous by all the gorillas due to his aggressive and sociopathic behavior. He is based on Kala's husband (and Tarzan's foster father) in the original Tarzan novel. His personality is also very much like the original Kerchak or Terkoz from the novel. Conversely, Kerchak's personality in the 1999 film is just like Tublat's in the original novel. He once took over another gorilla family that Gobu belonged to, but inspired by Tarzan the family overthrew him and Gobu replaced him. He often calls Tarzan a hairless runt. He has four toes on his right foot (it is possible he lost one in a fight), and this is one <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> he is in the area. In the series, he plots to dispose of Tarzan so that he can take over the gorilla pack for himself and makes no secret of his hatred against Tarzan, believing him to be unworthy of leading the gorilla family (despite Tarzan's actual success as a leader of the gorillas).|$|E
