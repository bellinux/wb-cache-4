500|$|Coward {{continued}} to perform {{during most of}} the First World War, appearing at the Prince of Wales's Theatre in 1916 in The Happy Family and on tour with Amy Brandon Thomas's company in Charley's Aunt. In 1917, he appeared in The Saving Grace, a comedy produced by Hawtrey. Coward recalled in his memoirs, [...] "My part was reasonably large and I <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> good in it, owing to the kindness and care of Hawtrey's direction. He took endless trouble with me... and taught me during those two short weeks many technical points of comedy acting which I use to this day." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
500|$|Following the election, Ann Romney {{received}} {{an offer to}} appear on the spring 2013 season of Dancing with the Stars, but although she was a fan of the show, she declined: [...] "I would've loved to have done it, and I am turning 64, and I started thinking about it. I'm not really as flexible as I should be." [...] She still mourned the election loss, perhaps more than her husband did. [...] In a late February 2013 interview, she said, [...] "And you know, the other part of it was an amazing thing, and it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of – {{a lot of people around}} us and all of a sudden, it was nothing," [...] then adding, [...] "But the good news is we like each other." [...] In October 2013, she published, and made promotional appearances for, The Romney Family Table: Sharing Home-Cooked Recipes & Favorite Traditions, a cookbook that made the New York Times Best Seller list.|$|E

500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the speech}} Obama {{and his wife}} were interviewed by Brian Williams, and when asked about what she thought, Michelle replied, [...] "And all I have to say is, honey, you didn't screw it up, so good job." [...] Obama said that he hoped his two daughters had watched the whole event, as their baby-sitter was {{permitted}} to let them stay up only if they watched the convention. Obama's grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, called Obama after the speech and told him, [...] "You did well...I just kind of worry about you. I hope you keep your head on straight." [...] She was later quoted by a journalist: [...] "I was a little amazed. It <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> an exceptional speech, or I'm being prejudiced, I don't know. But, to me, it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> exceptional." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a {{conflict}} {{with one of the}} theater's directors, who was said to have been less than careful about his hygiene, the director questioned Henriette about her bills regarding such things and she replied: [...] "It is easy to say, Mr Count, for someone with no idea how much it costs to keep oneself clean and fresh!" [...] She also writes that when she complained about men and boys trying {{to take a look at}} her when she had to change during performances, this director chased them all away, but guarded her from them by observing her himself—though, she adds, he <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> harmless. She remained neutral during the great theater strikes of 1827 and 1834.|$|E

2500|$|During a {{visit to}} the United States in 1960, the monarch of Thailand, King Bhumibol (a {{great-grandson}} of Mongkut), and his entourage explained that from what they could gather from the reviews of the musical, the characterisation of Mongkut seemed [...] "90 percent exaggerated. My great-grandfather <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> a mild and nice man." [...] Years later, during her 1985 visit to New York, Bhumibol's wife, Queen Sirikit, went to see the Broadway musical at the invitation of Yul Brynner. The then ambassador of Thailand to the US gave another reason for Thailand's disapproval of The King and I: its ethno-centric attitude and its barely hidden insult on the whole Siamese nation as childish and inferior to the Westerners.|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy spoke on several episode topics. About {{the timing of}} the episode's airdate with Hurricane Sandy's landfall, he said, [...] "It's very strange and somewhat sad. We wrote this script I think in June. We based it on several big 50s and 60s Nor'easters that hit the East Coast, obviously not as severe as the one that just hit. It's very eerie." [...] About Jessica Lange's performance, he said, [...] "She's never really played a drunkard in her career so her doing this big drunk monologue that has both comedy and tragedy sometimes within a single minute and I think she just killed it. I think its really brilliant and tragic and it contains my favorite line she's ever said, which is 'Charles Laughton is an enormous whoopsie.' I thought that <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> brilliant. Jessica Lange talking about Charles Laughton is just great. I know it was very challenging and she had a great time doing it. It was just a master class in acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buckland was {{a pioneer}} of zoöphagy: his {{favourite}} research was eating the animal kingdom. This habit he learnt from his father, whose residence, the Deanery, offered such rare delights as mice in batter, squirrel pie, horse's tongue and ostrich. After the [...] "Eland Dinner" [...] in 1859 at the London Tavern, organised by Richard Owen, Buckland set up the Acclimatization Society to further the search for new food. Buckland spoke about {{the introduction of the}} turkey, musk-duck and pheasant in the sixteenth, seventeent and eighteenth century respectively and that it was a pity that the same monotonous food was being eaten in the heyday of Queen Victoria's reign. In 1862 a hundred guests at Willis' Rooms sampled Japanese Sea slug (= sea cucumber, probably), kangaroo, guan, curassow and Honduras turkey. This <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> a modest menu, though Buckland had his eye on capybara for the future. Buckland's home, 37 Albany Street, London, was famous for its menagerie and its varied menus, including, at times, boiled elephant trunk, rhinoceros pie, porpoise heads, and stewed mole.|$|E

2500|$|Eisenhower {{remained}} {{concerned that}} despite their great intelligence value, overflights of the Soviet Union might cause a war. While the U-2 was under development, at the 1955 Geneva Summit {{he proposed to}} Nikita Khrushchev that the Soviet Union and the United States would each grant the other country airfields to use to photograph military installations. Khrushchev rejected the [...] "Open Skies" [...] proposal, and the CIA told the president that the Soviets could not track high altitude U-2 flights. This belief was based on studies using old Soviet radar systems and American systems that were not as effective at high altitudes as current Soviet systems, of which the U.S. was not aware; Knutson later said that [...] "the U-2 <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> invisible to American radar, but Russian radar were a little different - better, you might say". Although the Office of Scientific Intelligence issued a more cautious report in May 1956 that stated that detection was possible, it believed that the Soviets could not consistently track the aircraft. Dulles further told Eisenhower (according to presidential aide Andrew Goodpaster) that in any aircraft loss the pilot would almost certainly not survive. With such assurances and the growing demand for accurate intelligence regarding the alleged [...] "bomber gap" [...] between the U. S. and the Soviet Union, in June 1956 Eisenhower approved 10 days of overflights.|$|E
2500|$|While on {{tour with}} L. du Garde's A Horse! A Horse!, Pinter {{found himself in}} Eastbourne without a place to stay. He met a {{stranger}} in a pub who said [...] "I can take you to some digs but I wouldn't recommend them exactly," [...] and then led Pinter to the house where he stayed. Pinter told his official biographer, Michael Billington, I went to these digs and found, in short, a very big woman who was the landlady and a little man, the landlord. There {{was no one else}} there, apart from a solitary lodger, and the digs were really quite filthy ... I slept in the attic with this man I'd met in the pub ... we shared the attic and there was a sofa over my bed ... propped up so I was looking at this sofa from which hairs and dust fell continuously. And I said to the man, [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] And he said, [...] "Oh well I used to be...I'm a pianist. I used to play in the concert-party here and I gave that up." ... The woman <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> a voracious character, always tousled his head and tickled him and goosed him and wouldn't leave him alone at all. And when I asked him why he stayed, he said, [...] "There's nowhere else to go." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{man called}} Henry Taylor took Sara Baartman to France, from around September 1814. Taylor then sold {{her to an}} animal trainer, S. Réaux, who {{exhibited}} her under more pressured conditions for fifteen months at the Palais Royal. In France she was in effect enslaved. In Paris, her exhibition became more clearly entangled with scientific racism. French scientists were curious about whether she had the elongated labia which earlier naturalists such as François Levaillant had purportedly observed in Khoisan at the Cape. French naturalists, among them Georges Cuvier, head keeper of the menagerie at the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle,and founder of the discipline of comparative anatomy visited her. She {{was the subject of}} several scientific paintings at the Jardin du Roi, where she was examined in March 1815: as Saint-Hilaire and Frédéric Cuvier, a younger brother of Georges, reported, [...] "she was obliging enough to undress and to allow herself to be painted in the nude." [...] This was not literally true: although by his standards she appeared to be naked, in accordance with her own cultural norms of modesty throughout these sessions she wore a small apron-like garment which concealed her genitalia. [...] She steadfastly refused to remove this even when offered money by one of the attending scientists. In Paris, Baartman's promoters didn't need to concern themselves with slavery charges. Crais and Scully state: [...] "By the time she got to Paris, her existence <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> miserable and extraordinarily poor. Sara was literally treated like an animal. There is some evidence to suggest that at one point a collar was placed around her neck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, not at all," [...] replied Jimmy. [...] "We {{efficiency}} experts <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> ordinary people. One {{is apt to}} meet us in {{any place}} that nice people are supposed to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{longing to}} meet Miss Dalstan, Philip," [...] she declared. [...] "She is wonderful. And {{to think that}} you wrote it--that you created the part for her! I <b>am</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> proud of you." ...|$|R
50|$|Plus is superficially quite {{different}} from SUE or Pascal; however the underlying language semantics <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> similar. Users familiar with the C programming language will also recognize much of its structure and semantics in PLUS.|$|R
60|$|She <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> indignant; though, {{as she had}} {{distinctly}} refused Jim's offer, it {{was rather}} hard to see why.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] I said doubtfully, for I <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> {{indifferent}} {{to the fate of}} Alfred Inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him no harm.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her and gave a little gasp of relief. She was sitting {{with her back to the}} window. She <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> nice. He {{wondered}} why he had thought such things about her. His self-satisfaction returned to him.|$|E
25|$|I stopped {{after two}} {{chapters}} {{because it was}} so boring,...It <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> a bad book. I asked Ed Neumeier to tell me the story because I just couldn't read the thing. It's a very right-wing book.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> {{indifferent}} about it, Mary, {{you will}} not refuse to let me couple your name with mine when I ask him to come down. That would {{be nothing more than}} common politeness, I think." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The real {{writers on}} the show had to fix them quite often a lot, because they <b>were</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> amateurish. But they had nice thoughts, they had nice plots. They just needed fixing; the {{dialogue}} didn't work too well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Joke!" [...] Mr. Parker repeated. [...] "Precious {{little joke}} about it, I can assure you. I dare say it looked simple enough to you, but it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> a {{complicated}} business. Never mind, Eve has her pearls--and that's the great thing." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{manner to}} him was always equally pleasant, and though the young pair did not {{exchange}} very loving glances--at any rate not in public--yet they were never known to quarrel, which <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> remarkable, seeing that Béla's temper had not improved of late.|$|E
6000|$|... "You want to {{be careful}} in the future, Professor," [...] said Barwell Dawson. [...] "Science cannot afford to lose a man like you." [...] And this latter remark tickled the old {{scientist}} very much. He <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> learned, and he was glad to have it known.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people can}} only judge of things by the {{experiences}} of ordinary life, but phenomena {{outside the scope of}} this <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> numerous. How insecure it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of common knowledge, and subjective ideas.|$|R
60|$|His anxiety to meet you, however, {{is proof}} against all your coolness, and the {{energetic}} {{manner in which}} he dodges {{up and down the}} pond so as to be on the spot to greet you when you land <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> flattering.|$|R
