500|$|When Philip of Hesse's {{law on the}} {{protection}} of the Jews in his territory expired in 1538, he commissioned Bucer to create a new policy. Philip gave him a draft that was tolerant in the regulation of their affairs. Bucer rejected the favourable conditions and recommended that Jews be prohibited from all trades except those providing minimum subsistence. [...] His Judenratschlag also included his first use of negative stereotypes of the Jews. Philip's ordinance of 1539 represented a compromise. He allowed the Jews to engage in trade and commerce but included strict rules on their association with Christians. The potential for an arbitrary enforcement of the new policy <b>was</b> <b>frightening,</b> and as a result many Jews chose to leave Hesse. For this Bucer must share part of the blame.|$|E
500|$|Following the 2016 {{election}} of Donald Trump to the presidency, his administration's environmental proposals—including steep budget {{cuts to the}} EPA and deregulation—prompted several reflections on the environmental condition of the United States prior {{to the creation of}} the EPA. The New York Times, Vice Media's tech-news site Motherboard, public radio station WNYC, real estate news site 6sqft, and environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) connected Trump's declared policies to the risk of returning to a more polluted environment, with each publication evoking the 1966 smog as an example of the potential dangers of defunding and deregulation. David Hawkins, an attorney for NRDC, recalled, [...] "I was a student at Columbia Law School during the 1966 episode. It <b>was</b> <b>frightening,</b> but while that is the best-known event, heavy pollution was an everyday fact of life those days." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{founders of}} The Cockroaches were Tony Henry on drums and Joseph Hallion on saxophone; {{they were joined}} by Bruce Hatfield on bass guitar by mid-1980. After Paul {{introduced}} his brothers to The Rolling Stones, the band took their name from an obscure alias used by Keith Richards during the 1960s because, according to Anthony Field, [...] "it sounded kind of punkish and that scene was blossoming in Sydney at the time". Australian rock historian Ian McFarlane called the band's name [...] "a fitting choice, due mostly to the good-time R material that The Cockroaches played during their formative years". One of their first gigs was at their school; Paul convinced the Marist Brothers, who ran St. Joseph's, to allow a charge for the performance. Their proceeds were [...] "donated to 'the missions'". Paul booked their initial performances at local pubs, which, despite some of the member's under-age status, allowed them to perform. [...] Anthony later said, [...] "It was insane, it was fantastic. It <b>was</b> <b>frightening.</b> We didn't realise our playing was so rudimentary, but it didn't matter...Our inadequacies were made up by our spirit". According to band member Daniel Fallon, The Cockroaches honed their craft as they performed on stage.|$|E

500|$|Some {{effects were}} {{achieved}} {{in ways that}} are not immediately obvious. In one scene, a supernatural force pushes against the parlor door and bends it inward repeatedly. Though the door appears to some viewers to have been made of latex, it was in fact made of laminated wood (with a strong crew member pushing a piece of timber hard against the door). Two physical effects were used to make the spiral staircase in the library appear frightening. In one scene, the camera appears to ascend the staircase at a rapid rate. However, the point of view is backward, looking down the staircase, as the camera used the staircase's handrail as a dolly track, being lowered slowly by means of a wire. When the sequence was run in reverse at high speed, the effect <b>was</b> <b>frightening.</b> In another scene, the staircase appears to become unstable and give way as Luke Sanderson ascends it. Later, Eleanor goes up the staircase in a trance-like state. She is rescued by Dr. Markway, even as the staircase seems ready to collapse. The collapsing staircase effect was designed by a metalworker at the Borehamwood studios. The effect was created by tying portions of the steps and railing to a cable that ran inside the staircase's central pole. When the cable was slackened, these elements moved freely. [...] When tightened, the staircase appeared solid and stable. The effect was so disturbing to the cast that Robert Wise had to ascend the staircase while it was shaking in order to prove it was safe. Other effects also relied on simple cinema tricks. Early in the film, the audience sees Abigail Crain lying in bed, aging from a young child to an old woman. A camera was fixed over the bed, and four different actresses (each a different age) posed in the bed beneath the camera. Dissolves were used to show the aging process. In another scene, the characters come across a [...] "cold spot" [...] in the haunted mansion. To show the physical effect on the characters, the makeup department applied special makeup to the characters that appeared invisible in normal light. To show the effect of cold on the skin, filters were gradually drawn over the lights on the set, revealing the [...] "cold effect" [...] makeup.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{residents}} of Scottsboro have acknowledged the injustice {{that started in}} their community. In January 2004, the town dedicated a historical marker in commemoration of the case at the Jackson County Court House.

[...] The damage done to unionist farms and farmers <b>was</b> <b>frightening.</b> [...] MacDonnell continually urged compromise, but Long ignored him. [...] The dispute with Lords Dudley and Dunraven dragged on into August 1905, with their attitude of intransigence towards Long's attempts at Unionist reform, and obedience to the law. [...] On 25 May 1905, the issues were discussed in the Commons. [...] He wished to strengthen Unionism; but both Dudley and Long appealed to Balfour for adjudication. [...] Balfour opined that the Chief Secretary was both in the Commons and in the cabinet so Dudley had to be content that the power of the Lords was waning. [...] During the last quarter of 1905, Long advised the postponement of dissolution, as it would hit Unionists hard in [...] "the Country" [...] and would hand numerous electorates to radicals. [...] He warned of the loss of seats of Bristol West and South. [...] In December 1905, true to his word, he himself was defeated by 2,692 votes. [...] Long continued to distrust 'Birmingham & Co' as he called Chamberlain's struggle for a policy of Tariff recognition, which was already driving the party away from the Free Trade north. [...] Nonetheless he continued to co-operate transnationally with conservative parties in Germany, such as Reichspartei right up until the second Moroccan crisis in 1911.|$|E

Under a cover were the remains of a piece of cheese, and in a tin box was a crust of bread. She had done her marketing from day to day, buying only what was strictly needful, so that nothing was left over from one day to the next. Stroeve knew from the enquiries made by the police that Strickland had walked out of the house immediately after dinner, and the fact that Blanche had washed up the things as usual gave him a little thrill of horror.

60|$|The {{next room}} was still larger, {{but it was}} also much more crowded. Apparently Piero was keeping the Festa, for the double door {{underneath}} the window which admitted the painter's light from above, was thrown open, and showed a garden, or rather thicket, in which fig-trees and vines grew in tangled trailing wildness among nettles and hemlocks, and a tall cypress lifted its dark head from a stifling mass of yellowish mulberry-leaves. It seemed as if that dank luxuriance had begun to penetrate even within the walls of the wide and lofty room; for in one corner, amidst a confused heap of carved marble fragments and rusty armour, tufts of long grass and dark feathery fennel had made their way, and a large stone vase, tilted on one side, seemed to be pouring out the ivy that streamed around. All about the walls hung pen and oil-sketches of fantastic sea-monsters; dances of satyrs and maenads; Saint Margaret's resurrection out of the devouring dragon; Madonnas with the supernal light upon them; studies of plants and grotesque heads; and on irregular rough shelves a few books were scattered among great drooping bunches of corn, bullocks' horns, pieces of dried honeycomb, stones with patches of rare-coloured lichen, skulls and bones, peacocks' feathers, and large birds' wings. Rising from amongst the dirty litter of the floor were lay figures: one in the frock of a Vallombrosan monk, strangely surmounted by a helmet with barred visor, another smothered with brocade and skins hastily tossed over it. Amongst this heterogeneous still life, several speckled and white pigeons were perched or strutting, too tame to fly at the entrance of men; three corpulent toads were crawling in an intimate friendly way near the door-stone; and a white rabbit, apparently the model for that which <b>was</b> <b>frightening</b> Cupid in the picture of Mars and Venus placed on the central easel, was twitching its nose with much content on a box full of bran.|$|E
