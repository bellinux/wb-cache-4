5|$|In September 2009, Gorham {{began to}} {{assemble}} {{a new version of}} Thin Lizzy, and in May 2010 a new line-up was announced. Joining Gorham was original drummer Brian Downey, long-standing keyboardist Darren Wharton, Def Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell, and singer Ricky Warwick from The Almighty, while Marco Mendoza returned to fill the bass guitar role. Ex-Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wanted to participate but had previous commitments to his own solo career.|$|E
5|$|MGySgt Guadalupe Denogean is an {{immigrant}} from Mexico {{who has served}} in the Marine Corps for 25 years. Denogean was wounded in combat in Basra, Iraq. During {{the time that he}} received treatment for his wounds, he <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had any requests. His answer was that he had two: First, he wanted a promotion for the corporal who helped rescue him, and second he wanted to be an American citizen.|$|E
5|$|While {{the first}} {{interview}} was videotaped, {{at the beginning of}} the second interview, Lyons said that he wanted video recording to be stopped. It has been alleged that the decision to terminate the recording was prompted by the gardaí before the start of the second interview. A number of items discussed during the second interview were not included on the formal interview record, including anecdotes told by Lyons about his former criminal activity which gardaí believed at the time to be untrue. As the interview continued, Lyons <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wanted to make a formal statement, to which he agreed. This statement contains a number of points about the killings that were not known to the public at the time. Some of the more glaring inaccuracies mentioned in {{the first interview}} are not included in the statement, although this statement contains some notable omissions and inaccuracies.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} threatened another dissolution if {{the bill}} for the Parliament Act were not passed, and followed through on their threat when opposition in the Lords did not diminish. The general election of December produced little change from January. The calling of a second dissolution of parliament now {{seems to have been}} contrary to the wishes of Edward VII. Edward had died in May 1910 while the crisis was still in progress. His successor, George V, <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would be prepared to create sufficient peers, which he would only do if the matter arose. This would have meant creating over 400 new Liberal peers. The King did, however, demand that the bill would have to be rejected at least once by the Lords before his intervention. Two amendments made by the Lords were rejected by the Commons, and opposition to the bill showed little sign of reducing. This led Asquith to declare the King's intention to overcome the majority in the House of Lords by creating sufficient new peers. The bill was finally passed in the Lords by 131 votes to 114 votes, a majority of 17. This reflected a large number of abstentions.|$|E
5|$|Tired of the {{constant}} violence, Stuart quit hockey after the Stanley Cup championship in 1907 and joined his father in construction. As part of this job, Stuart was sent to Belleville, Ontario, to oversee {{the building of the}} Belleville Drill Shed, one of his father's contracts. While in Belleville, he continued to receive offers to join a new hockey team. He <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wanted to manage the Belleville team; a similar offer came from Peterborough, Ontario, while a town outside Toronto was said to have offered a railroad president's salary if Stuart would join them. On the afternoon of June 23, 1907, Stuart went to the Bay of Quinte, near Belleville, to swim with some friends. Stuart swam to the nearby lighthouse, about half a kilometre away from his group, climbed onto a platform and dived into the shallow water. He dived head first onto jagged rocks, gashing his head and breaking his neck. He was killed instantly. His body was brought back to Ottawa, where a service was held at his family's home before he was buried at Beechwood Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The {{province}} {{of his birth}} remains unknown, though various conjectures suggest Gallia Belgica, Gallia Narbonensis, or Northern Italy. His marriage to the daughter of Narbonensian senator Gnaeus Julius Agricola implies that he came from Gallia Narbonensis. Tacitus' dedication to Lucius Fabius Justus in the Dialogus may indicate a connection with Spain, and his friendship with Pliny suggests origins in northern Italy. No evidence exists, however, that Pliny's friends from northern Italy knew Tacitus, nor do Pliny's letters hint {{that the two men}} had a common background. Pliny Book 9, Letter 23 reports that, when he <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was Italian or provincial, he gave an unclear answer, and so <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was Tacitus or Pliny. Since Pliny was from Italy, some infer that Tacitus was from the provinces, probably Gallia Narbonensis.|$|E

25|$|When {{during a}} {{televised}} press conference he <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> believed a presidential system was {{possible in a}} unitary state. Erdoğan affirmed this and cited Nazi Germany {{as an example of}} how this is possible. However, the Turkish president's office said that Erdoğan was not advocating a Hitler-style government when he called for a state system with a strong executive. Furthermore, that the Turkish president had declared the Holocaust, anti-semitism and Islamophobia as crimes against humanity and that it was out of the question for him to cite Hitler's Germany as a good example.|$|E
25|$|While {{working the}} {{attachment}} in Philadelphia, House <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could help one of Union's western branches {{in making the}} paper dishes, as they had trouble in drying them. When House produced samples with a round flange, the design was accepted and {{he was given a}} contract to build a machine that would make twenty thousand paper dishes in 10 hours. Much work was required to maintain the heat at 800 to 900 degrees, which was necessary to dry a dish in two (2) seconds. Mr. House involved a system of using superheated steam which kept the dies at red heat. The press was first tested at his factory in Bridgeport before being shipped to Clinton, Iowa.|$|E
25|$|After {{recording}} an 8–8 {{record in}} 1988, Elway once again led {{his team to}} the Super Bowl after the 1989 season, with yet another win over the Browns in the AFC championship game, going on to face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV. However this game ended even worse for the Broncos than their previous Super Bowl losses. San Francisco blew out Denver 55–10, the most lopsided score in Super Bowl history. Although Elway scored the only touchdown for his team on a three-yard run, his performance was abysmal: 10 out of 26 completions for 108 yards with no touchdown passes and two interceptions. But he didn't try {{to hide from the}} media after the game or downplay his dismal performance. And when he <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to go back to}} the Super Bowl after three losses, he responded that he wanted to go back every year, even if his team kept losing. Still by this point, many doubted that he would ever win a Super Bowl in his career.|$|E

500|$|While embarking upon a 2010 tour, Idol <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{intended}} to perform {{music from the}} Cyberpunk album. While not distancing himself from the production, Idol stated he had no intentions of doing so immediately. Pointing out that he did wish to perform a mixture of new and older works, and would perhaps perform the music in the future, he {{intended to}} base his tour on [...] "more guitar music" [...] and pointed out that Cyberpunks keyboard-driven music {{was not going to}} be featured.|$|E

When Adolph Fischer <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew who threw the bomb, he answered, [...] "I {{suppose it was}} some excited workingman." [...] Oscar Neebe {{said it was a}} [...] "crank." [...] Governor Altgeld speculated the bomb thrower might have been a disgruntled worker who was not {{associated}} with the defendants or the anarchist movement but had a personal grudge against the police. In his pardoning statement, Altgeld said the record of police brutality towards the workers had invited revenge adding, [...] "Capt. Bonfield is the man who is really {{responsible for the deaths of}} the police officers." ...|$|E

500|$|Even {{prior to}} Hanneman's death, King had {{expressed}} {{doubt as to}} who would even play on the album. He stated that if work on the album {{could be done in}} June 2013, then it was hoped that the album could be out by the following September or October. After Hanneman's passing, Holt <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> will be featured on the album, to which he replied that he would probably be playing some solos on the album, but {{that the rest of the}} guitar work would all be King. King later confirmed this sentiment, but explained that Holt would not be participating in any of the writing, noting: [...] "fans aren't ready for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Stanfield {{worked to}} try to unify the party, Diefenbaker and his loyalists proved {{difficult}} to reconcile. The division in the party broke out in well-publicised dissensions, as when Diefenbaker called on Progressive Conservative MPs to break with Stanfield's position on a bilingualism bill, and nearly half the caucus voted against their leader or abstained. In addition to his parliamentary activities, Diefenbaker travelled extensively and began work on his memoirs, which were published in three volumes between 1975 and 1977. Pearson {{died of cancer in}} 1972, and Diefenbaker <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had kind words for his old rival. Diefenbaker {{shook his head and said}} only, [...] "He shouldn't have won the Nobel Prize." ...|$|E
500|$|Bleeding Through was an American {{heavy metal}} band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended {{influences}} stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. [...] Although {{the band was}} often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: [...] "I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're {{trying to do something}} which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long." ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{memorial}} service for John Betjeman, who died in July 1984, Larkin <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would accept the post of Poet Laureate. He declined, not least because {{he felt he had}} long since ceased to be a writer of poetry in a meaningful sense. The following year Larkin began to suffer from oesophageal cancer. On 11 June 1985 he underwent surgery, but his cancer was found to have spread and was inoperable. On 28 November he collapsed and was readmitted to hospital. He died four days later, on 2 December 1985, at the age of 63, and was buried at the Cottingham municipal cemetery near Hull. His grave {{can be found on the}} left hand side of the cemetery, close to the entrance. Its plain white headstone reads [...] "Philip Larkin 1922–1985 Writer".|$|E
500|$|Prior to the album's release, Idol <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> feared his new {{interest}} in technology {{would be seen as}} an attempt to co-opt cyberculture. Idol denied this, stating that his belief in the relevancy of cyberpunk culture was genuine, and that he didn't care what others thought of him. However, the reaction by the majority of the online community was openly hostile and suspicious of Idol's motives. It was reported that his e-mail account on the WELL received mail from angry computer users, and was occasionally flooded with e-mail spam to antagonise him. Idol was also cast by many as a naive, tech-illiterate poseur. The charge of illiteracy was not entirely false, as {{at the time of the}} album's release, Idol was still typing using the [...] "hunt and peck" [...] system, and needed notes to log onto the internet.|$|E
