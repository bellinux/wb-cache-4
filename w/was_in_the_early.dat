5|$|By 1980, Gulf {{exhibited}} many of {{the characteristics}} of a giant corporation that had lost its way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock market value of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets. Such a situation was bound to attract the interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1980s thought immune to takeover risk.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of the Picts as it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 8th century, when Bede was writing, {{was largely}} {{the same as}} the kingdom of the Scots in the reign of Alexander I (1107–1124).

5|$|A {{significant}} change {{at this time}} was that players were no longer required {{to be members of}} the Catholic Young Men's Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or Roman Catholic institution, as it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> years of its history. For instance, the Irish harp was only re-introduced to the club badge when it was last re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three pillars of the club's identity: Ireland, Edinburgh (the castle) and Leith (the ship). Geography rather than religion is now seen as the primary reason for supporting Hibs, who draw most of their support from the north and east of Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} canal was {{replaced}} by the railway, Kymer's dock continued to be used for the transfer of coal to coastal ships for another 50 years. Principal destinations included Laugharne, Carmarthen, St Clears and Llanstephan. The Kidwelly Corporation took out a lease on the dock in 1872, and the railway built a branch to it in 1873, which ran alongside the old canal. Most of the traffic had transferred to the railway by 1914, but some coasters continued to transport coal; the last recorded sailing <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1920s, and was bound for Llanstephan.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behaviour. It {{is believed to have}} been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in the ground. It roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame, allowing hunters to pick it up off its roost. The Choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests, particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. It was only recorded by Albert Stewart Meek, who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904. Despite many subsequent searches, the bird has not been definitively reported since. It {{is believed to have been}} rare when Meek collected his specimens. The indigenous peoples reported that the species was driven to extinction due to the introduction of cats, as the pigeon had never previously confronted a carnivorous mammal on Choiseul. The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul pigeon <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1940s, and the species is considered extinct.|$|E

When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs. Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E
5|$|Greaves was {{struggling}} with his fitness and his motivation. He felt {{he had become a}} journeyman footballer and lost motivation as he believed that apart from Moore, Geoff Hurst, Billy Bonds and Pop Robson, few of his teammates could play good football. Towards {{the end of his career}} with West Ham Greaves began to drink more and more alcohol, often going straight from training in Chadwell Heath to a pub in Romford, where he would remain until closing time. He later admitted that he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> stages of alcoholism. His final game came on 1 May 1971 in a 1–0 home defeat to Huddersfield Town. Greaves scored 13 goals in 40 games in all competitions for West Ham.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, David Martill et al. {{announced}} {{the preservation of}} soft tissue in a specimen referred to a cf. Scelidosaurus sp., that is, an unnamed species for which a comparison with Scelidosaurus can be illuminating. The fossil, with inventory number BRSMG CF2781, <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1990s, in an already prepared state, discovered in {{the legacy of the}} late Professor John Challinor, which had used it to illustrate his lectures with. Its provenance is unknown. It consists of a series of eight caudal vertebrae in a cut slab of carbonate mudstone, which was judged to date from the late Hettangian to Sinemurian stages. Parts of the fossil were preserved {{in such a way that}} an envelope of preserved soft tissue is visible around the vertebrae, and show the presence of an epidermal layer over the scutes. The authors concluded that the osteoderms of all basal armoured dinosaurs were covered in a tough, probably keratinous layer of skin.|$|E

5|$|St Saviour's Church {{served the}} southwestern part of Round Hill until 1981. The flint and brick building, set {{below the level}} of Ditchling Road and on its west side, <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Early</b> English Gothic Revival style and was meant to have a tower; only a stub was ever built. The architects were Edmund Scott and F.T. Cawthorn. An {{extension}} was built in 1889, and in 1904 a large reredos designed by Richard Herbert Carpenter and W. Slater was moved to the church from Chichester Cathedral. Congregations declined, and the church was demolished in 1983; flats called St Saviour's Court and a rear archway in Vere Road recall its existence.|$|E
5|$|The area {{is known}} to have been {{occupied}} since the Neolithic when people exploited the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as the Sweet and Post Tracks. The Sweet Track, named after the peat digger who discovered it in 1970 and dating from the 3800s BC, is the world's oldest timber trackway, once thought to be the world's oldest engineered roadway. The track was built between what <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 4thmillennium BC an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick, close to the River Brue. The remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby, connecting settlements on the peat bog including the Honeygore, Abbotts Way, Bells, Bakers, Westhay and Nidons trackways.|$|E
5|$|The modern Norman Cob is {{slightly}} heavier than it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 20th century, due to lighter horses of the breed being {{absorbed into the}} Selle Francais breed. In 1976, the National Stud at Saint-Lo had 186 stallions, including 60 Norman Cobs. In the same year, the breed registry was reorganized, and the Norman Cob placed in the draft horse category. The reorganization of the breed registry helped to reinvigorate Norman Cob breeding, and to bring attention {{to the risk of}} extinction of the breed. In 1980, the Institut national de la recherche agronomique and Institut national agronomique performed demographic and genetic analysis of threatened breeds of horses within France. In 1982, researchers concluded that the Norman Cob has been inbred and suffered genetic drift from its original population. The increasing average age of Norman Cob breeders also made the breed's situation precarious.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the Hall Institute <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> {{stages of}} rapid expansion. The new {{director}} of the Institute, Charles Kellaway, wanted to increase {{the activities of the}} organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in physiology, microbiology and biochemistry that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on bacteriology in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the Lister Institute in London. Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if Salmonella typhimurium was affected by bacteriophage.|$|E
5|$|Westhay Moor {{originally}} lay at {{the centre}} of the most northerly of the two lowland raised bogs that formed in the lower Brue Valley. They reached their greatest extent {{at the end of the}} Iron Age. The Neolithic people exploited the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as the Sweet and Post Tracks. The Sweet Track, named after the peat digger who discovered it in 1970 and dating from the 3800s BCE, is the world's oldest timber trackway, once thought to be the world's oldest engineered roadway.

The archaeology, history and geology of the Somerset Levels was displayed at the Peat Moors Centre until its closure in 2009. The centre also included reconstructions of some of the archaeological discoveries, including a number of Iron Age round houses from Glastonbury Lake Village, and the Sweet Track.|$|E
