They also may {{be attacked}} by Sentinels, a self-replicating robot force that patrols the planets and takes action against those that take the planet's resources. The player can fend these off using the weapons installed on the multitool. The game uses a [...] "wanted level" [...] {{similar to that of}} the Grand Theft Auto series; low wanted levels may cause small drones to appear which may be easily fought off, while giant <b>walking</b> <b>machines</b> can assault the player at higher wanted levels. While in space, the Traveller may be attacked by pirates seeking their ship's cargo, or by alien factions with whom they have a poor reputation. Here, the player can use the ship's weapon systems to engage in these battles. Should the Traveller die on a planet, they will be respawned at their last save point without their exosuit's inventory; the player can recover these materials if the player can reach the last death location. If the Traveller dies in space, they will similarly respawn at the local system's space station, but having lost all the goods aboard their ship. Again, these goods can be recovered by travelling to the point at which the player died in space, but with the added uncertainty of pirates claiming the goods first.|$|E

50|$|Doctor Koyanagi (小柳教授): Tadashi's Uncle and an inventor. He discovers it was {{his father}} who {{died of a heart}} attack in a factory during a hot summer. While {{dissecting}} the fish, the legs then clamp onto his arm. He cuts off his arm to prevent the infection from spreading to the rest of his body. He is fascinated by the machine, not caring that he lost an arm to it. He then creates his own version of the <b>walking</b> <b>machine</b> and puts the infected Kaori onto it. He is mortally wounded when he is stabbed by Kaori's <b>walking</b> <b>machine.</b> He then goes to Lab #2 where his father originally died and places himself onto another <b>walking</b> <b>machine</b> that is able to fly. When he notices Tadashi and Ms. Yoshiyama interacting, he attacks them both and captures her. In the OVA version, Koyanagi is shown as an antagonist who went insane and connected an infected Tadashi to the custom Walker.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story of}} The Tripods is a {{variation}} on post-apocalyptic literature, wherein humanity has been enslaved by [...] "Tripods": gigantic three-legged <b>walking</b> <b>machines,</b> piloted by unseen alien entities (later identified as [...] "Masters"). Human society is largely pastoral, with few habitations larger than villages, and what little industry exists is conducted under the watchful presence of the Tripods. Lifestyle {{is reminiscent of the}} Middle Ages, but small artefacts from the Modern Age are still used, such as watches.|$|E
5000|$|A {{short while}} later, Tadashi returns to find Koyanagi missing an arm. As he was {{examining}} the machine in detail, it used {{a series of}} spikes and tubes to latch on to his arm, forcing him to amputate it. The walking machine scuttles into the room, now carrying Koyanagi's arm instead of the fish. Koyanagi is fascinated by this discovery, and then reveals that the fish {{was the result of}} the Japanese Army's World War II research into a virus that causes its host to produce a deadly and repulsive stench, in a desperate effort to turn the tide of the war. His father developed a [...] "walking machine", which pumps the virus into a host and causes the host to release the gas which powers the machine's movement; <b>walking</b> <b>machines</b> were built to carry the hosts farther, allowing them to reach and sicken enemy troops. However, during the war, enemy aircraft sunk the ship carrying the prototypes for the <b>walking</b> <b>machines.</b> Soon, Kaori and Tadashi discover that hordes of marine life with legs are invading Tokyo, having gradually invaded the Kantō region. Infected by the gas, Kaori becomes depressed by her appearance and attempts to commit suicide. Tadashi takes her to Koyanagi in an effort to save her but plunges into a canal where he passes out after being injured by thousands of small walking fish. Awakening one month later, he discovers that Koyanagi has placed her into a custom-built walking machine. Upon switching the machine on, Koyanagi is mortally wounded by Kaori, who quickly escapes.|$|E
50|$|Searching for her, Tadashi {{notices that}} most of the walking fish have decayed, and that the <b>walking</b> <b>machines</b> are now {{carrying}} infected citizens instead. Journeying through Tokyo, he encounters a circus, where he learns from the ringmaster that the gas appears to be alive, taking on a soul-like appearance when ignited. Tadashi encounters Kaori and rescues her from one of the acts at the circus and takes her to Koyanagi's Lab. There Koyanagi's assistant, Ms. Yoshiyama, reveals that Koyanagi has died from his wounds. When she attempts to remove the walking machine from Kaori, Koyanagi appears, now mutated by the infection and attached to a modified walking machine that allows him to fly. Kaori notices Tadashi and Ms. Yoshiyama together and attempts to attack her. During the uproar, Koyanagi manages to capture Ms. Yoshiyama and fly away.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fighting}} {{machines are}} described in Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds and depicted on the album artwork painted by Michael Trim. This version of the tripods does have major inconsistencies when compared to Wells' description in the novel; for example, the heat-ray emanates from a proboscis in the cupola rather than from a camera-like box carried by an articulated arm on the tripod, the basket to hold captured humans is a cage on the handling machines instead of the fighting machines, and the [...] "cowl" [...] (cockpit) of the fighting machine is fixed in place, {{instead of being a}} separately moving hood. The three legs of the fighting machine have fixed joints and stiff legs rather than the jointless, free-flowing organic legs described in Wells' novel.

Because of this, she began to think she was disgusting, that Tadashi wouldn't love her if she wasn't beautiful. This, along with the horrible stench, made her attempt to commit suicide. Tadashi then immediately carries her to his uncle Koyanagi's lab for aid, however Koyanagi rigs her up to a custom walking machine and ultimately, she becomes like the walking dead creatures, except with a will of her own. As a walking machine, she is eventually destroyed by a horde of other <b>walking</b> <b>machines</b> that deem the custom walker to be a threat to their survival. In the OVA adaptation, Kaori is made into the main character instead of Tadashi. She also possesses the unexplained immunity to the infected creatures' poisons instead of Tadashi.|$|E

40|$|The four-legged <b>walking</b> <b>machine</b> BISAM (Biologically Inspired Walking Machine) {{is being}} {{developed}} at the FZI (Forschungszentrum Informatik) in Karlsruhe. The project aims to use biological inspiration to create a technical system {{taking advantage of the}} principles observed in natural locomotion. This leads to two different aims, the modeling of the natural locomotion on the one hand, and the virtual prototyping of the technical system on the other hand. The biological system is modeled to reproduce the cyclic motion and to calculate the applied driving momentum in the joints by solving the inverse dynamics problem. This is used to describe the relation between weight, velocity, foot positioning, stiffness of the legs and other important parameters that influence the stability of locomotion. These insights need to be applied to the technical system. A virtual prototype of the <b>walking</b> <b>machine</b> offers the opportunity to quickly verify the impact of adjustments to the construction and/or the control system.

40|$|Abstract — In this article, a modular neurocontroller is presented. It has the {{capability}} to generate a reactive behavior of <b>walking</b> <b>machines.</b> The neurocontroller is formed {{on the basis of}} a modular structure. It consists of the three dif-ferent functionality modules: neural preprocessing, a neural oscillator network and velocity regulating networks. Neural preprocessing is for sensory signal processing. The neural os-cillator network, based on a central pattern generator (CPG), generates the rhythmic movement for basic locomotion of the <b>walking</b> <b>machines</b> while the velocity regulating networks (VRNs) change the walking directions of the machines with respect to the sensory inputs. As a result, this neurocontroller enables the machines to explore in- and out-door environ-ments by avoiding obstacles and escaping from corners or deadlock situations. It was firstly developed and tested on a physical simulation environment, and then was successfully transferred to the six-legged walking machine AMOS-WD 06.
