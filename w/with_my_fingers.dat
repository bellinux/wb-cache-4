500|$|The {{themes of}} the album are {{reflected}} in the album cover designed by Alexander McQueen. Bj√∂rk approached McQueen explaining to him the person who wrote Homogenics songs was someone who [...] "had to become a warrior. A warrior who had to fight not with weapons, but with love. I had 10 kilos of hair on my head, and special contact lenses and a manicure that prevented me from eating <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers,</b> and gaffer tape around my waist and high clogs so I couldn't walk easily".|$|E
60|$|I {{turned on}} the instant, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> {{tightening}} round the handle of my stick.|$|E
6000|$|I merely stir, press, feel <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers,</b> and am happy, [...] To {{touch my}} person to some one else's {{is about as}} much as I can stand.|$|E
60|$|I {{pointed at}} them to Bickley <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger,</b> for really I could not speak.|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolute exhaustion--possibly mere {{hunger and}} fatigue," [...] said I, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> on the thready pulse, where {{the stream of}} life trickled thin and small.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Persuade him {{to taste}} that apple, {{and he will}} die, {{and if that is}} not enough I will touch him <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger,</b> for I am the plague,' {{answered}} she.|$|R
60|$|For a time no one {{answered}} me, and I stood listening and expectant, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> about my weapon. Some one moved about upstairs presently, and was still again. The tension of waiting seemed to brace my nerves.|$|E
60|$|I lost {{my temper}} at his persistence, and swore to myself. For a time we hated {{one another in}} silence. I drummed <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> on the floor between my knees, and gritted the links of my fetters together. Presently I was forced to talk again.|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked up}} the map once more, {{following}} the lines <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers,</b> till I found the very place where the name was printed. A village in Devonshire, not far from Torquay. Yes! That's it; Berry Pomeroy. The murderer was there {{on the day of}} that athletic meeting! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Giving the lambda a fillip <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger,</b> I {{turned it}} upside down. So the {{sentence}} now read 'o nous estin augos', and is, you perceive, the fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{tried the}} keyhole <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger.</b> The key {{was not in}} the lock. I knelt down, and looked through the keyhole. The next instant, I was up again on my feet, wild and giddy with horror.|$|R
5000|$|... "After a while I {{noticed that}} a large drop of {{something}} wet had materialized on the table. I poked it <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> and smudged it around a little before I realized with horror {{that it was a}} tear." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{might have}} retorted, [...] "He {{thinks of the}} expense before he thinks of {{anything}} else. How like a Scotchman!" [...] As it was, I was too anxious to be witty. I only drummed impatiently <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> on the table, and said, [...] "Tell me! tell me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] said he to the boys, [...] "you see I have nailed the leather, so that, when it {{lies down}} in its place, it covers the hole completely; and yet I can push it {{up a little}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers,</b> so that there will be an opening." ...|$|E
6000|$|He put {{his hand}} to his head, [...] "Give me more time," [...] he said. [...] "It hurts me when I try to {{remember}} too much. Let me finish my hat first. I want to give you my hat when it's done. You don't know how clever I am <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> and thumbs. Just look and see!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a {{difficult}} job. Pressing back the flesh <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger,</b> I succeeded, at last, in getting the hook under the bullet. This I held firmly against it, and to my delight felt, as I raised finger and hook together, that the bullet was coming. A few seconds later, I held it triumphantly between <b>my</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! But I made believe I wrote so badly, as {{that it was}} odds if any {{one could}} read it. And when I wrote slowest and smeared but <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> most, father was best pleased, as he stood looking over me.' ...|$|R
60|$|A {{sudden and}} ridiculously obvious idea struck {{me for the}} first time. A small {{electric}} bell and telephone instrument were {{by the side of the}} bed. I leaned over and pressed the knob <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger.</b> <b>My</b> companion half glanced towards me, and back again instantly towards the door.|$|R
6000|$|... 'By {{the soul}} of the emperor, could I get near you, you rogue, I would quarter you <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> alone!--A {{grinning}} scoundrel that jeers at others! A filthy flatterer that dirts the very ground he walks on! By the blood of the martyrs, should I fling the sweepings of the slaughter-house at him, he knows not where to get himself dried!' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found myself}} that the cries were {{singularly}} irritating, and they grew in depth and intensity {{as the afternoon}} wore on. They were painful at first, but their constant resurgence at last altogether upset my balance. I flung aside a crib of Horace I had been reading, and began to clench my fists, to bite my lips, and to pace the room. Presently I got to stopping my ears <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was a bit}} out of practice, but I {{guarantee}} I'd make {{a living}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> and a pack of cards anywhere yet and defy detection. I had 'em all guessing before long; and, Paul, you should have seen their faces when they tumbled to it! I tell you they bundled me out in double-quick time and I laughed all the way home. Four sharks to pitch upon me as a victim!" ...|$|E
60|$|I watched her, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> {{heart at}} my lips, as she marched {{to a corner}} of her garden, and stooped to dig up some little root there. Then, without a scrap of courage, but {{with a great deal}} of desperation, I went softly in and stood beside her, {{touching}} her <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's {{different}} in the picture," [...] I volunteered, while all the time my memory was busy reconstructing the photograph. The general trend of the landscape and {{the line of the}} distant hills were the same. The differences I noted aloud and pointed out <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>With</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> I who am a {{draughtsman}} drew in {{the thick}} dust that lay {{on the board of}} the chariot the brows of a man and beneath them two deep eyes. The gilt on the board where the sun caught it looked like light in the eyes.|$|R
60|$|I {{rose and}} waited, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> on the door. Happily it {{had one of}} those new-fashioned slip-latches which open from inside. No need to betray myself prematurely to the detective by a hand {{displayed}} on the outer handle. I glanced out at him cautiously. His head was thrust through his window, and his sloping shoulders revealed the spy, but he was looking the other way--observing the signals, doubtless, to discover why we stopped at a place not mentioned in Bradshaw.|$|E
60|$|With what {{strength}} I still possessed I {{went to work}} {{to scale}} her balcony. The task was easy even for one in my spent condition. The wall was thick with ivy, and, moreover, a window beneath afforded some support, for by standing on the heavy coping I could <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> touch the sill of the balcony above. Thus I hoisted myself, and presently I threw an arm over the parapet. Already I was astride of that same Parapet before she became aware of my presence.|$|E
6000|$|When I awoke it rained:[79] I {{was already}} quite wet, and my limbs were stiff {{and my head}} giddy with the chill of night. It was a drizzling, {{penetrating}} shower; as my dank hair clung to my neck and partly covered my face, I had hardly strength to part <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers,</b> the long strait locks that fell before my eyes. The darkness was much dissipated and in the east where the clouds were least dense the moon was visible behind the thin grey cloud-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot speak," [...] {{answered}} the giant, [...] "my mind is bursting {{and my heart}} is full. <b>With</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> I have drawn faces on the snow. I have seen men put wonderful things on flat rocks {{with a piece of}} stone, but this!--this is my country made little. It looks as if I could walk in it, yet it is flat!" ...|$|R
60|$|After {{that he took}} up his abode {{near the}} foot of the game path. I had only to splash the water there <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> when he would come from beside a green stone, or from under a log or the lily pads--for he had a dozen hiding places--and swim up to me to be fed, or petted, or to have his back scratched.|$|R
5000|$|... "Do {{you think}} you could do {{something}} useful for me? You see yourself that everyone who lives in the monastery is useful. Well, if I am called away, as I often am, while I am reading, don't you go too; stay here on the spot I mark <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger,</b> so that I'll know exactly where to start when I come back. Do you see what I mean?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{drew the}} {{familiar}} blade from its sheath, the red blade that the Wanderer had worn, and touching its keen edge <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers,</b> wept from my blinded eyes {{to think that}} never again could I hold it aloft in war or see the light flash from it as I smote. Yes, I wept in my weakness, till I remembered that I had no longer any wish to be the death of men. So I sheathed the good sword and hid it beneath my mattress lest some jailer should steal it, which, as I could not see him, he might do easily. Also I desired to put away temptation.|$|E
60|$|I {{realized}} how sorely he was hurt, yet not then in my stupidity and horror--or {{is it that}} I refused to confess it to myself?--that his hurt was mortal. Morning would come soon. I grasped tight the hand in mine. Then help. In this monotony and weariness of mind and body, the passing trees seemed to dance and gesticulate before my eyes. A torturing drowsiness crept over me which in vain, thrusting up my eyelids <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers,</b> beating my senseless {{feet on the floor}} of the cart, I tried to dispel. Once, I remember, I rose and threw my cape over his shoulder. At last I must have slept.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I had a {{block of}} stone, I'd show you," [...] said the Czarover, looking around the room. [...] "Ah, here is my throne. The back is too high, anyhow, so I'll just break {{off a piece of}} that." [...] He rose to his feet and tottered in an {{uncertain}} way around the throne. Then he took hold of the back and broke off a piece of marble over a foot thick. [...] "This," [...] said he, coming back to his seat, [...] "is very solid marble and much harder than ordinary stone. Yet I can crumble it easily <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers,</b> a proof that I am very strong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you not see?" [...] {{she said}} to me, {{pointing}} to her shoulder. Just where the finger-tip had touched the garment a round shining spot appeared, looking like a silver coin on the cloth; but on touching it <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> it seemed {{part of the original}} fabric, only whiter and more shiny on the grey ground, on account of the freshness of the web of which it had just been made.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's alive an' not bad hurt. That bullet hit him glancin'. Shore them steel bullets {{are some}} lucky for us. Dick, you needn't look so glum. I {{tell you he}} ain't bad hurt. I felt his skull <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger.</b> There's no hole in it. Wash him off an' tie-- Wow! {{did you get the}} wind of that one? An' mebbe it didn't sing off the lava!... Dick, look after Thorne now while I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why look here,' hooking his {{proposition}} on his left-hand {{fingers with}} the forefinger of his right. 'There's two Governors, ain't there? One and one, two--Lawyer Lightwood, <b>my</b> first <b>finger,</b> he's one, ain't he? Well; might you be acquainted <b>with</b> <b>my</b> middle <b>finger,</b> the T'other?' ...|$|R
