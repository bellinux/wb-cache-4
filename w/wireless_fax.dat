40|$|Objectives:To {{compare the}} crash {{reporting}} system of National Highways Motorways Police (NHMP), Pakistan, with the World Health Organization (WHO) injury surveillance guidelines. Methods: Based on information collected from field observations, key informant interviews, and review of official documents, this note firstly describes {{the reporting system}} according to the components of a surveillance system. Then the reporting is compared with WHO criteria for designing and building an injury surveillance system and attributes of such a system. Results: After a crash, a patrol officer communicates {{the information to the}} higher police authorities by <b>wireless,</b> <b>fax,</b> and on paper in the first 24 hours. Microcomputer Accident Analysis Package (MAAP) Performa filed by the officers are collected at a central location in the following 4 days, and reports are published biannually. Notable deficiencies in the reporting were nonidentification of stakeholders for data utilization and limited prospects of data recording process modification and its monitoring. Moreover, crash and injury definitions do not conform to international standards practiced elsewhere. Conclusion: NHMP crash reporting needs to be simplified and standardized, and steps should be taken to improve its utilization for prevention Purposes...|$|E
50|$|AstraQom {{developed}} {{its business}} relationship with DIDX after their joint {{participation in the}} 2011 Share Mobile Healthcare project that {{was presented at the}} 4GWorld event. The AstraCare solution was announced, and described as a unique compression solution between mobile and <b>wireless</b> VoIP, <b>fax</b> to e-mail and vice versa, data storage and other imperative Internet and mobile-friendly features. The solution was designed for small clinics such as those that provide outpatient and ambulatory care. In June 2012, AstraQom partnered with Bios Technologies, a provider of computer and network hardware and services serving the West Quebec and Ottawa areas. Bios became the provider of IP communications solutions to federal and provincial public functions, hospitals and businesses, as a re-seller for AstraQom products and services.|$|R
40|$|Modern office {{buildings}} are fully equipped and furnished spaces with arrangements including networked business equipment, such as PC-class machines, copiers, <b>wireless</b> routers and <b>fax</b> machines, and other electrical {{equipment such as}} home appliances e. g. coffee machines, and appliances for environmental comfort e. g. electric heaters. The unique characteristics of networked business equipment are well-defined usage pattern, low-power current draw, and connectivity to the local area network (LAN). Business equipment is generally used over working hours adding up to important costs, motivating {{the need for a}} system capable of tracking equipment usage and associated energy expenditure, as well as identifying cost saving opportunities. Techniques for monitoring power loads are generally based on power step edge detection, and cannot be applied to business equipment due to the low power consumption of individual devices. This paper presents NetBem, a novel energy monitoring technique ad hoc to {{office buildings}}, capturing the contribution of networked business equipment to a power load via side-band detection of the equipmentâ€™s operating state through the LAN. The technique is presented, and results from experiments within the School of Computer Science and Informatics at University College Dublin in Ireland are given...|$|R
