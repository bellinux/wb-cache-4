25|$|At {{the behest}} of our leader Herzl, I came to Basle to make {{preparations}} for the Zionist Congress. Among many other problems that occupied me then was one that contained something of {{the essence of the}} Jewish problem. What flag would we hang in the Congress Hall? Then an idea struck me. We have a flag—and it is blue and white. The talith (prayer shawl) <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> wrap ourselves when we pray: that is our symbol. Let us take this Talith from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations. So I ordered a blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it. That is how the national flag, that flew over Congress Hall, came into being.|$|E

500|$|On 5March 1917, {{shortly after}} commencing {{operations}} with No.1 Squadron, Williams narrowly avoided crash-landing when his engine stopped {{while he was}} bombing the railway terminus at Tel el Sheria. At first believing {{that he had been}} struck by enemy fire, he found that the engine switch outside his cockpit had turned off. Within 500feet of the ground he was able to switch the engine back on and return to base. On 21April, Williams landed behind enemy lines to rescue downed comrade Lieutenant Adrian Cole, having the day before pressed home an attack on Turkish cavalry whilst under [...] "intense anti-aircraft fire"; these two actions earned him the Distinguished Service Order for [...] "conspicuous gallantry". He was promoted major in May and given command of No.1 Squadron, which was re-equipped with Bristol Fighters later that year. [...] "Now for the first time," [...] wrote Williams, [...] "after 17 months in the field we had aircraft <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> could deal with our enemy in the air."

500|$|Lowell's {{earliest}} poems {{were published}} without remuneration in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1840. He {{was inspired to}} new efforts towards self-support and joined with his friend Robert Carter in founding the literary journal The Pioneer. The periodical was distinguished {{by the fact that}} most of its content was new rather than material that had been previously published elsewhere, and by the inclusion of very serious criticism, which covered not only literature but also art and music. Lowell wrote that it would [...] "furnish the intelligent and reflecting portion of the Reading Public with a rational substitute for the enormous quantity of thrice-diluted trash, in the shape of namby-pamby love tales and sketches, which is monthly poured out to them by many of our popular Magazines." [...] William Wetmore Story noted the journal's higher taste, writing that [...] "it took some stand & appealled to a higher intellectual Standard than our [...] milk or watery namby-pamby Mags <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> are overrun". The first issue of the journal included the first appearance of [...] "The Tell-Tale Heart" [...] by Edgar Allan Poe. Lowell was treated for an eye disease in New York shortly after the first issue, and in his absence Carter did a poor job of managing the journal. The magazine ceased publication after three monthly numbers beginning in January 1843, leaving Lowell $1,800 in debt. Poe mourned the journal's demise, calling it [...] "a most severe blow to the cause—the cause of a Pure Taste".|$|E

500|$|March 1917 saw the {{heaviest}} bombing campaign {{carried out by}} the squadron to date; short of its regular [...] ordnance, the pilots improvised by dropping [...] howitzer shells on Turkish forces along the Gaza–Beersheba line. During one such mission on 20March, Lieutenant Frank McNamara earned the Victoria Cross for landing his Martinsyde in the desert under enemy fire and rescuing a fellow pilot whose B.E.2 had been forced down. On 26March, No.1 Squadron took part in the First Battle of Gaza; it suffered its first combat death the next day, when one of its B.E.2s was attacked by a German Rumpler. The unit participated in the Second Battle of Gaza on 19April; like its predecessor, the attack was a failure for the Allies. Williams, later known as the [...] "Father of the RAAF", assumed command of the squadron in May. Two B.E.12s were delivered the same month; like the Martinsydes, they were armed with a forward-firing machine gun and employed as escorts for the B.E.2s. By June, mechanical issues caused by hot summer weather and the threat from new German Albatros scouts were rendering the B.E.2s largely ineffective, and Williams urgently requested newer models. Modern aircraft were eventually delivered, first the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 in October, and then the Bristol F.2 Fighter in December. [...] "Now for the first time," [...] wrote Williams, [...] "after 17 months in the field we had aircraft <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> could deal with our enemy in the air." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps Russell's most systematic, metaphysical {{treatment}} of philosophical analysis and his empiricist-centric logicism {{is evident in}} what he called logical atomism, which is explicated {{in a set of}} lectures, [...] "The Philosophy of Logical Atomism", which he gave in 1918. In these lectures, Russell sets forth his concept of an ideal, isomorphic language, one that would mirror the world, whereby our knowledge can be reduced to terms of atomic propositions and their truth-functional compounds. Logical atomism is a form of radical empiricism, for Russell believed the most important requirement for such an ideal language is that every meaningful proposition must consist of terms referring directly to the objects <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> are acquainted, or that they are defined by other terms referring to objects <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> are acquainted. Russell excluded some formal, logical terms such as all, the, is, and so forth, from his isomorphic requirement, but he was never entirely satisfied with our understanding of such terms. One of the central themes of Russell's atomism is that the world consists of logically independent facts, a plurality of facts, and that our knowledge depends on the data of our direct experience of them. In his later life, Russell came to doubt aspects of logical atomism, especially his principle of isomorphism, though he continued to believe that the process of philosophy ought to consist of breaking things down into their simplest components, even though we might not ever fully arrive at an ultimate atomic fact.|$|E
