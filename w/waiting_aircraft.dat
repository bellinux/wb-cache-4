5|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{to land in}} Brønnøysund was a Hansa-Brandenburg seaplane of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service on 23 July 1922. It was piloted by Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen and Finn Lützow-Holm, en route from Horten to Kirkenes. The following thirteen years Brønnøysund only saw occasional landings, when Norwegian Air Lines started a service from Bergen to Tromsø on 7 June 1935, which included {{a stop at the}} harbor in Brønnøysund. Passengers and mail would be rowed out to the <b>waiting</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The first season the route was flown using a single-engine Junkers W 34. The aircraft turned out to be too small and a larger Junkers Ju 52 was introduced the following season. Flights were dependent on good weather and were only operated during the summer. The route was taken over by Widerøe in 1938. All civilian flights were terminated during World War II, although the town would see occasional military landings.|$|E

Cash reserves of Swissair filed on this day were barely sufficient {{to carry out the}} first morning flights. During the morning, fuel suppliers refused to fuel the <b>waiting</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Other accounts were consolidated on the one hand because of the prior termination of the cash pooling facility from the UBS, on the other hand due to the threat of favoritism regarding debts. The banks refused a credit increase before the sales proceeded, and insisted on a formal referral validity of the sale agreement.|$|E

2500|$|Oriskany steamed to Subic Bay on 28 October, where {{victims of}} the fire were {{transferred}} to <b>waiting</b> <b>aircraft</b> for transportation to the United States. A week later the carrier departed for San Diego, arriving on 16 November. San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard completed repairs on 23 March 1967, and Oriskany, with Carrier Air Wing 16 embarked, underwent training. She then was stationed out of San Francisco Bay on 16 June to take station in waters off Vietnam.

2500|$|Smith {{requested}} close air support, {{calling for}} the <b>waiting</b> <b>aircraft</b> to drop napalm across 11 Platoon's eastern frontage. The Phantoms soon arrived; however, due to the rain and low cloud {{they were unable to}} observe the coloured smoke thrown by the Australians to mark their position through the trees. Stanley was forced to halt the artillery while the aircraft flew overhead, yet with Smith unable to establish communications with the forward air observer he wanted them out of the area so it could resume firing. Townsend directed the aircraft drop their payloads on the forward slopes of Nui Dat 2 instead, believing it the location of the Viet Cong command element. With the artillery beginning to fall again and D Company still heavily outnumbered, it proved critical in preventing them being overrun as the Viet Cong formed assault waves. Major Harry Honnor—officer commanding 161st Battery, RNZA attached to 6 RAR in direct support—served as Townsend's artillery advisor at Nui Dat and during the battle controlled the fires of the three field batteries, as well as directing the American medium artillery against depth targets. On the ground Stanley would call down the fire himself or would relay the direction of the assault, from which Honnor would select targets and order the fire, which was then adjusted by Stanley using sound ranging to bring it closer. Despite the rain and the soft ground reducing the impact of the artillery, its effectiveness was aided by otherwise favourable technical conditions, including the location of the infantry between the guns and the assaulting Viet Cong, the convenient range of [...] at which the engagement occurred, good communications afforded by the newly issued PRC-25 radios, the air burst effect created by rounds exploding in the trees, and the large supply of rounds stock-piled at Nui Dat.|$|E

50|$|Hazards to {{aircraft}} include debris, nesting birds, {{and reduced}} friction levels due to environmental {{conditions such as}} ice, snow, or rain. Part of runway maintenance is airfield rubber removal which helps maintain friction levels. The fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct (see foreign object damage). In adverse weather conditions, ice and snow clearing equipment {{can be used to}} improve traction on the landing strip. For <b>waiting</b> <b>aircraft,</b> equipment is used to spray special deicing fluids on the wings.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, the 423rd NFS {{continued}} to <b>wait</b> for <b>aircraft</b> at Charmy Down. As its aircrews had {{trained in the}} United States on the Douglas P-70, (the night-fighter version of the Douglas A-20 Havoc), {{in the absence of}} sufficient P-61s, the Ninth Air Force decided to use the 423rd personnel to form a night photographic unit equipped with A-20s. To this end, the 423rd NFS was assigned to the 10th Reconnaissance Group on 10 May 1944 and was redesignated as the 155th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron. The squadron was transferred to RAF Chalgrove.|$|R
500|$|Progress {{along the}} {{evacuation}} route south was difficult, as German patrols were very active. A night ambush by one such patrol caused {{the loss of}} six prisoners, two of them French.

5000|$|The current balloon flight {{record was}} set by Malcolm Ross (USNR) and Victor Prather (USN), {{who took the}} Strato-Lab V balloon to 34,668 m (113,740 ft) on May 4, 1961 above the Gulf of Mexico. The balloonists landed successfully, but Victor Prather slipped from the {{helicopter}} lift harness while being transferred to a <b>waiting</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier, and he drowned before US Navy divers could rescue him. Nicholas Piantanida, while attempting to set a new skydiving jump record, is claimed to have reached 123,800 feet (37.73 km) on February 2, 1966. Piantanida was unable to disconnect his breathing apparatus from the gondola, so the ground crew jettisoned the balloon at the flight ceiling. Piantanida's attempt did not set a flight record because he descended without the balloon.|$|E
5000|$|Splashdown {{occurred}} with an impact comparable to landing a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier. Freedom 7 tilted over on its right side about 60 degrees from an upright position, {{but did not}} show any signs of leaking; it gently righted itself after a minute, and Shepard was able {{to report to the}} circling aircraft that he had landed safely and was ready to be recovered. A recovery helicopter arrived after a few minutes, and after a brief problem with the spacecraft antenna, the capsule was lifted partly out of the water in order to allow Shepard to leave by the main hatch. He squeezed out of the door and into a sling hoist, and was pulled into the helicopter, which flew both the astronaut and his spacecraft to a <b>waiting</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier, [...] The whole recovery process had taken only eleven minutes, from splashdown to arriving aboard.|$|E

The banks refused a credit increase before the sales proceeded, and insisted on a formal referral validity of the sale agreement. At 15:45, CEO Mario Corti announced a cessation of flight operations due to the security risks caused by the crossing of the Flight Duty Regulations. This led to the cancellation of over 230 flights, and thousands of passengers, as well a flight crews, being stranded around the world. Flight crew corporate credit cards were blocked by the banks, with some hotels expelling the crews, and having them return home at their own expense. In addition, all tickets sold were voided.|$|E
50|$|The {{first story}} follows Hammer himself, {{as well as}} {{introducing}} Joachim Steuben, his right hand man and personal body guard. Colonel Hammer rails against the military choices made by the politician, secretary Tromp. During a face to face discussion with Tromp in his personal offices, it is revealed that the Slammer's regiment {{was created by the}} Freisland government to help control the export of 'bluebright', a rare plant and main trade commodity of Freisland. It is also revealed that as part of allowing Hammer to form the regiment, the government agreed that all members of the Slammers would be granted full citizenship of Freisland once it's usefulness had ended and Hammer gave the order for it to disband. It becomes obvious however, that Tromp, as a representative of Freisland government does not wish to follow through on their half of the deal and instead will covertly have members of the regiment arrested and executed. Colonel Hammer returns to his quarters angered at the situation. Tromp dispatches a team to have Hammer murdered but they find Hammer's own men in wait, Joachim amongst them. The Slammers' men kill Tromp and Hammer sends out a preprared order to his tanks, revealing he had foreseen Tromp's betrayal. The tanks batter the compound and Tromp's and Hammer's men engage in open combat. The story ends with the Slammers in a victorious position and with Tromp fleeing the compound to a <b>waiting</b> <b>aircraft</b> to take him away. Aboard the aircraft, Joachim is waiting and the chapter closes with Joachim pulling his pistol and ending Tromp's life. This treatment by the Freisland government is what causes Hammer's Slammers to become a true mercenary regiment.|$|E
50|$|The {{quarantine}} {{began on}} 24 October and tensions mounted as the Soviets {{continued to work}} on the missile sites and their ships continued moving toward Cuba. Then on 26 October, Khrushchev sent another message in which he offered to withdraw or destroy the weapons in Cuba, provided the United States would lift the blockade and promise not to invade the island. The increasing tempo in the military, however, continued unabated. SAC ordered over sixty B-52 bombers to continue on airborne alert, while TAC forces in Florida assumed a one-hour alert and prepared to go to a fifteen-minute alert, which involved pilots <b>waiting</b> in <b>aircraft</b> for launch orders.|$|R
