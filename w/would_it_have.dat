25|$|Drawing {{on these}} recommendations, the Russian {{government}} determined {{that in the}} future while the Russian language would remain the official Ukrainian would be permitted on a regional basis. The new administration was to be composed of strictly military personnel who would not be concerned with religious matters, and nor <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> a Russian nationalistic orientation. When the easternmost part of Galicia was briefly recaptured by the Russians in 1916, however, the Russians found that the region was economically devastated by the Russian scorched-earth policy during the previous retreat, {{as well as by the}} war, and that the population had become quite hostile towards the Russians and loyal towards the Austrians. Ukrainian and Polish schools were allowed to remain open and calls from Russian nationalistic circles within Russia to shut them down were ignored by the occupation authorities.|$|E

500|$|In 1954, Edwin H. Colbert and Roland T. Bird {{speculated that}} Deinosuchus [...] "may {{very well have}} hunted and devoured some of the dinosaurs with which it was contemporaneous". Colbert restated this {{hypothesis}} more confidently in 1961: [...] "Certainly this crocodile {{must have been a}} predator of dinosaurs; otherwise why <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> been so overwhelmingly gigantic? It hunted in the water where the giant theropods could not go." [...] David R. Schwimmer proposed in 2002 that several hadrosaurid tail vertebrae found near Big Bend National Park show evidence of Deinosuchus tooth marks, strengthening the hypothesis that Deinosuchus fed on dinosaurs in at least some instances. In 2003, Christopher A. Brochu agreed that Deinosuchus [...] "probably dined on ornithopods from time to time." [...] Deinosuchus is generally thought to have employed hunting tactics similar to those of modern crocodilians, ambushing dinosaurs and other terrestrial animals at the water's edge and then submerging them until they drowned. A 2014 study suggested {{that it would have been}} able to perform a [...] "death roll", like modern crocodiles.|$|E

2500|$|That Harey Vj {{is not a}} lost play, however, {{seems to}} be {{confirmed}} by a reference in Thomas Nashe's Piers Penniless his Supplication to the Devil (entered into the Stationers' Register on 8 August 1592), which supports the theory that Harey Vj is 1 Henry VI.

[...] It is thought that Nashe is here referring to Harey Vj, i.e. 1 Henry VI, {{as there is no}} other candidate for a play featuring Talbot from this time period (although again, there is the slight possibility that both Henslowe and Nashe are referring to a now lost play).|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Nehemiah {{differed}} {{interpreting the}} words, [...] "Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations," [...] in [...] Rabbi Judah taught that only [...] "in his generations" [...] {{was he a}} righteous man (by comparison). Had {{he lived in the}} generation of Moses or Samuel, he would not have been called righteous. Rabbi Judah said that in the street of the totally blind, the one-eyed man is called clear-sighted, and the infant is called a scholar. Rabbi Judah compared it to a man with a wine vault who opened one barrel and found it vinegar, opened another and found it vinegar, and opened a third to find it turning sour. When people told him that it was turning, he asked if the vault contained any better. Similarly, [...] "in his generations" [...] Noah was a righteous man. Rabbi Nehemiah, however, taught that if Noah was righteous even in his generation (in spite of the corrupt environment), how much more so would he have been, had he lived in the age of Moses. Rabbi Nehemiah compared Noah to a tightly closed vial of perfume in a graveyard, which nevertheless gave forth a fragrant aroma.

2500|$|In 1862 {{the newly}} created State Board of Agriculture {{appointed}} English Literature professor Theophilus Capen ("T.C.") Abbot president, much to the professor's surprise. Nevertheless, the soft-spoken Abbot remained president for twenty-two years and helped stabilize the College {{during and after the}} Civil War. One of the College's main concerns was that its Morrill Act endowment had attracted the University of Michigan's attention. [...] Advocates for the University brought a bill before the State Legislature to merge with the Agricultural College and move the Lansing faculty and facilities to the Ann Arbor campus. UM leaders argued that it was necessary to share the Morrill Act income with the financially struggling UM. At least one influential pro-merger advocate appeared persuaded more by pure academic considerations than financial self-interest. [...] Andrew Dickson White, Cornell University co-founder and first president, noted, “The State of Michigan [...] [...] [...] indeed gave its Agricultural College an excellent faculty and they have achieved much success considering their means but infinitely better <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> been to combine that Agricultural College with their noble University.” [...] While the plan initially had broad support across the state, merger opponents pointed out that Ann Arbor had inadequate facilities for an agricultural education; a move to Ann Arbor would require so much investment capital as to make the UM plan financially untenable. The Legislature voted down UM's proposal in 1863, but it returned to the floor in 1865, 1867, and again in 1869. While the College successfully fended off each takeover attempt, the persistent threat that it might move kept the Legislature from appropriating any money for new campus construction at Lansing. As a result, the College was restricted to one boarding hall and enrollment was accordingly limited for many years thereafter.|$|E
