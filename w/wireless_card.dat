25|$|During June 2011, Apple {{unveiled}} the updated Time Capsule {{with a higher}} capacity 2 TB and 3 TB. They also changed the <b>wireless</b> <b>card</b> from a Marvell chip to a Broadcom BCM4331 chip. When {{used in conjunction with}} the latest 2011 MacBooks, MacBook Pros, and MacBook Airs (which also use a Broadcom BCM4331 wireless chip), the wireless signal is improved due to Broadcom's Frame Bursting technology.|$|E
50|$|Wi-fi PC <b>cards</b> for {{accessing}} <b>wireless</b> {{networks have}} an external portion containing the antenna for improved reception (as compared with inside the laptop), but {{this portion of}} the card may be accidentally damaged while moving the laptop. 3Com manufactured <b>wireless</b> <b>cards</b> with retractable antenna portions, also under the XJACK name.

25|$|OpenBSD {{at first}} used the BSD daemon mascot. A {{specialized}} {{version of the}} daemon, the haloed daemon was drawn by Erick Green. Green was asked by de Raadt to create the logo for the 2.3 and 2.4 versions of OpenBSD. At first, it was planned to create a full daemon, including head and body, but Green was only able to complete the head part for OpenBSD 2.3. The body as well as pitchfork and tail was completed for OpenBSD 2.4. Subsequent releases saw variations, such as Cop daemon by Ty Semaka, but eventually settling on Puffy, described as a pufferfish. Since then Puffy has appeared on OpenBSD promotional material and featured in release songs and artwork. The promotional material of early OpenBSD releases {{did not have a}} cohesive theme or design, but later the CD-ROMs, release songs, posters and tee-shirts for each release have been produced with a single style and theme, sometimes contributed to by Ty Semaka of the Plaid Tongued Devils. These have become a part of OpenBSD advocacy, with each release expounding a moral or political point important to the project, often through parody. Past themes have included: in OpenBSD 3.8, the Hackers of the Lost RAID, a parody of Indiana Jones linked to the new RAID tools featured as part of the release; The Wizard of OS, making its debut in OpenBSD 3.7, {{based on the work of}} Pink Floyd and a parody of The Wizard of Oz related to the project's recent work on <b>wireless</b> <b>card</b> drivers; and OpenBSD 3.3's Puff the Barbarian, including an 80s rock-style song and parody of Conan the Barbarian, alluding to open documentation.|$|E
2500|$|Using {{professional}} grade hardware {{or modified}} consumer grade hardware {{it is possible}} to operate on 802.11a channels 116–140 (5.57–5.71GHz) and channels above 165 (> 5.835GHz).

50|$|A network scanner or sniffer is an {{application}} program that {{makes use of}} a wireless network interface card.

40|$|We {{introduce}} MAClets, {{software programs}} uploaded and executed on-demand over <b>wireless</b> <b>cards,</b> and devised {{to change the}} card’s real-time medium access control operation. MAClets permit seamless reconfiguration of the MAC stack, so as to adapt it to mutated context and spectrum conditions and perform tailored performance optimizations hardly accountable by an once-for-all protocol stack design. Following traditional active networking principles, MAClets can be directly conveyed within data packets and executed on hard-coded devices acting as virtual MAC machines. Indeed, rather than executing a predefined protocol, we envision a new architecture for <b>wireless</b> <b>cards</b> based on a protocol interpreter (enabling code portability) and a powerful API. Experiments involving the distribution of MAClets within data packets, and their execution over commodity WLAN cards, show the flexibility and viability of the proposed concept...|$|R

They validate the viability and flexibility of the proposed concept with help of different experiments.

40|$|Increasingly, 802. 11 {{devices are}} being used by mobile users. This results in very dynamic {{wireless}} channels {{that are difficult to}} use efficiently. Current rate selection algorithms are dominated by probe-based approaches that search for the best transmission rate using trial-and-error. In mobile environments, probe-based techniques often perform poorly because they inefficiently search for the moving target presented by the constantly changing channel. We have developed a channel-aware rate adaptation algorithm- CHARM- that uses signal strength measurements collected by the <b>wireless</b> <b>cards</b> to help select the transmission rate. Moreover, unlike previous approaches CHARM leverages channel reciprocity to obtain channel information, so the information is available to the transmitter without incurring RTS/CTS overhead. This combination of techniques allows CHARM to respond quickly to dynamic channel changes. We implemented CHARM in the Madwifi driver for <b>wireless</b> <b>cards</b> using the Atheros chipset. Our evaluation both in the real world and on a controlled testbed shows that channel-aware rate selection can significantly outperform probe-based rate adaptation, especially over dynamic channels...|$|R
