He called for stakeholders in the health sector to collaborate enable the ministry achieve Buhari's health agenda. According to The Nation, Adewole said for the apex policy on health to be achieved, {{we need to work}} together and working together means we can make a huge difference.

25|$|On {{all their}} {{projects}} since 1972 they worked exclusively with photographer Wolfgang Volz. At least five of their major projects were subjects of documentary films by Albert and David Maysles. Although, Jeanne-Claude and Christo worked as creative equals {{on all of}} their art projects, only Christo’s name appeared on the finished products. This was a conscious decision by both Jeanne-Claude and Christo because of the prejudices against female artists in the art world. Jeanne-Claude said, “‘The decision to use only the name Christo was made deliberately <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>young</b> because {{it was difficult for}} one artist to be established and we wanted to put all the chances on our side.’” Therefore, Jeanne-Claude took on the role as Christo’s manager in order to advance their success. The pair did not reveal Jeanne-Claude as the second half in the creative process until 1994.|$|E

"All {{the things}} that went wrong with Sabbat {{in the old days}} were really {{nothing to do with me}} and Andy Sneap, even though we had our {{disagreements}} in the days <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>young.</b> That was largely to do with record labels and management and things that were happening around us – the fact that we were selling hod-loads of records and not actually seeing any money at all and having to live on benefits at the time.|$|E
2500|$|For several months, Song did {{not meet}} with the emperor. [...] Emperor Liezu sent Li Jingsui to his mansion to comfort him and promised to make him the {{military}} governor of Zhennan, and he thereafter went to meet Emperor Liezu at a banquet. [...] At the banquet, however, they got into an argument, with Emperor Liezu accusing Song of being ungrateful and of comparing the emperor to the vicious King Goujian of Yue, and Song admitting to making such a remark and commenting that the emperor could kill him if the emperor wanted. [...] The next day, Emperor Liezu wrote a personal letter to Song, stating, [...] "You, Zisong, have long known our temper. [...] How can it {{be the case that}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>young</b> we were so close to each other, but in old age we hate each other?" [...] He subsequently made Song the military governor of Zhennan. [...] After Song arrived at Zhennan, he built a large mansion for himself and lived luxuriously, purportedly at the people's detriment. [...] He often ruled on matters while wearing a silk robe that Emperor Liezu gave him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his inaugural lecture, Lake published two important books on historical and exegetical matters concerning the New Testament during his time in Leiden: The Historical Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ (1907) and The Earlier Epistles of St. Paul: Their Motive and Origin (1911). [...] As Metzger explains: [...] "These studies, particularly the latter, revealed Lake's ability to analyze and evaluate complex historical and literary data and to set forth scholarly reconstructions with clarity and a certain persuasiveness." [...] In Historical Evidence Lake sets forth his approach: [...] "The first task of the historical inquirer is to collect the pieces of evidence; the second is to discuss the trustworthiness and meaning of each separate piece; {{and the third is}} to reconstruct the events to which the evidence relates" [...] (p.6). [...] As for the reconstruction, he explains: [...] "In any such attempt it is desirable to remember that the reconstruction of an original tradition from forms of later dates and of divergent contents must be guided by exactly the same principle as is the reconstruction of an original text from a number of extant MSS. [...] In each case the fundamental problem is the retracing of the line of development followed by the various authorities, and the solution depends chiefly on the ability to detect errors of transmission and to explain their existence" [...] (p.167). [...] As for The Earlier Epistles, Neill writes: [...] "I think {{that those of us who}} read Lake <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>young</b> will be inclined to think that this is one of the best books on the New Testament that has ever been written in the English language. [...] This is the way it ought to be done. [...] Under Lake's skillful guidance, we feel ourselves one with those new and struggling groups of Christians, in all the perplexities of trying to discover what it means to be a Christian in a non-Christian world. [...] And there is the Apostle, so very much in working clothes and without a halo; we feel in our bones the passionate eagerness of Paul for better news from Corinth, the passionate relief when the good news arrives." [...] The book brought the conclusions of the German history of religions school to the attention of English-speaking world for the first time, and all later New Testament study has been influenced by this book.|$|E
