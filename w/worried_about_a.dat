5|$|Hamilton {{set a new}} fastest lap of {{the race}} on lap 47 to reduce the time deficit to Vettel to 7.9 seconds. Petrov began to {{challenge}} de la Rosa for 12th place on the same lap. Hülkenberg's right rear tyre delaminated on lap 50, causing damage to his car's exhaust system and became the race's final retirement. Kobayashi made his only pit stop of the event on lap 53 and rejoined in ninth position behind Alonso. Button was <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> possible post-race time penalty and pushed hard to record the overall fastest lap of the race, a 1:38.766, on the 54th lap. Alonso challenged Buemi for seventh place on lap 55 {{but was unable to}} pass him. Kobayashi ran closely behind Alonso and passed him around the inside for eighth when Alonso ran wide at turn 17 on the following lap. Buemi was overtaken by Kobayashi at the final corner on the last lap of the race to clinch seventh.|$|E

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{conflict}} and rivalry was Santo Domingo (the Dominican Republic), an independent republic that Spain annexed {{at the request of}} Pedro Santana in 1861. The U.S. and Spain had competed with one another for influence in Hispaniola in the 1850s and 1860s; the U.S. was <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> possible military expansion by Spain in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico (which would make it harder to acquire Cuba).|$|E

25|$|Lord Palmerston {{replied to}} the {{question}} of the Russian ambassador about the reaction of England to a Russian intervention in Hungary, saying: Finish them quickly!, demanding that after they fulfilled their task to return in Russia immediately. Although England <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> Russian intervention in Hungary, its first concern was that the Russian Empire to not advance in the Balkans, and an important condition for this was a strong Habsburg Empire. So, an independent Hungary could have been an impediment for England's world domination policy.|$|E
25|$|After {{his first}} visit to Beijing in 1956, Sukarno began to {{strengthen}} his ties to the People's Republic of China and the communist bloc in general. He also began to accept increasing amounts of Soviet bloc military aid. By the early 1960s, the Soviet bloc provided more aid to Indonesia than to any other non-communist country, while Soviet military aid to Indonesia was equalled only by its aid to Cuba. This large influx of communist aid prompted an increase in military aid from the Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy Administrations, which <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> leftward drift should Sukarno rely too much on Soviet bloc aid.|$|E

Rovira appointed Brigadier General Juan Antonio Martínez to command the fortress which was manned by 3,000 miquelets within a week of its capture. Before he could bring help to Peyri, d'Hilliers had to call in several small garrisons. He also <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> Royal Navy threat to the port of Roses. After a week passed, d'Hilliers raked up 2,000 reinforcements and brought them to Figueres. Meanwhile, General of Division François Jean Baptiste Quesnel arrived from France with three regular battalions and the National Guard battalions of Haute-Garonne and Gers. With 6,500 infantry and 500 cavalry available, d'Hilliers imposed a blockade on Sant Ferran on 17 April.|$|E
25|$|Fannie stock plunged. Some {{worried that}} Fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt. Others <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> {{government}} seizure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson {{as well as}} the White House went on the air to defend the financial soundness of Fannie Mae, in a last-ditch effort to prevent a total financial panic. Fannie and Freddie underpinned the whole U.S. mortgage market. As recently as 2008, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) had owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market. If they were to collapse, mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive. Fannie and Freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the Chinese Government, to money market funds, to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people. If they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale.|$|E
500|$|The {{direct effects}} of the raid were fairly short-lived. [...] Because of the {{destruction}} of the crop and stored grain, the colony suffered a flour shortage that winter, although it was not severe enough to cause significant hardship. [...] Grand Pré was rebuilt, the dykes were repaired, and there was a successful harvest in 1706. [...] The memory of the raid however, lasted in the population. [...] As late as the 1740s (after Acadia had become British Nova Scotia) Grand Pré's inhabitants <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> return of English raiders, and were cautious in their dealing with British authorities.|$|E

500|$|As {{there were}} six {{producers}} between the film franchises, Davis had difficulty securing the rights as the producers were <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> film featuring the two creatures. Paul W. S. Anderson pitched Davis a story he worked on for eight years, and showed him concept art created by Randy Bowen. Impressed with Anderson's idea, Davis thought the story was like Jaws in that it [...] "just drew you in, it drew you in". Anderson started {{to work on the}} film after completing the script for , with Shane Salerno co-writing. Salerno spent six months writing the shooting script, finished its development, and stayed on for revisions throughout the film's production.|$|E

Greatly concerned at the popular outcry and <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> repeat of the Maillotin revolt of the previous decade—when Parisians armed with mallets turned against tax collectors—Charles's uncles persuaded the court to do penance at Notre Dame Cathedral, preceded by an apologetic royal progress through the city in which the King rode on horseback with his uncles walking in humility. Orléans, who was blamed for the tragedy, donated funds in atonement for a chapel to be built at the Celestine monastery.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, {{someone was}} {{eventually}} appointed and installed {{as the new}} bishop, since Pope Honorius III sent a letter directly to an unnamed Bishop of Finland in 1221. According to the letter, Archbishop Valerius had followed the situation in Finland and sent {{a report to the}} Pope, <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> threat from unidentified [...] "barbarians". It is notable that when the Pope quoted Valerius in his letter, he calls the church in Finland to have been established [...] "newly", the same claim that Anders had made 12 years earlier. The list of Swedish bishops which survives from this era is from king John Sverkerson's coronation from the year 1219 and it mentions the bishops which have been present at the coronation. Finland as well as Wäxjö are not among those five, which so seem to have been all the bishops of the Swedish realm at that time. So the Finnish bishop's possible position under Uppsala's primacy is highly improbable.|$|E

[...] Leto described the experience of filming the music video saying, [...] "It's a lyrical and slightly metaphorical surreal journey through the city of Angels, from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica Pier. We like to create an adventure and this has been an adventure. [...] This is what we were supposed to do. And I doubted the idea up until the very last minute, but the process has been phenomenal." [...] The music video premiered on November 9, 2009 at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles.|$|E
