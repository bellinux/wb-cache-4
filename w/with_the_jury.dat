The case was so popular that the involved barristers found it physically difficult to get into the court each day due to the size of the crowds gathered outside.

25|$|Other sources {{claim that}} an angry mob {{tried to kill}} Aeschylus on the spot, but he fled the scene. Heracleides of Pontus asserts that the {{audience}} tried to stone Aeschylus.

He was acquitted, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> sympathetic to the military service of Aeschylus and his brothers during the Persian Wars. According to the 2nd-century AD author Aelian, Aeschylus's younger brother Ameinias helped to acquit Aeschylus by showing the jury the stump of the hand that he lost at Salamis, where he was voted bravest warrior. The {{truth is that the}} award for bravery at Salamis went not to Aeschylus' brother but to Ameinias of Pallene.|$|E
25|$|The {{defense has}} {{obtained}} city records showing that Moore {{was up to}} date in her rent payments. Prosecutors clarified that the dispute was not about the rent but rather a scheme by Bonie to increase those payments by coercing Moore to file false documentation that would have boosted her Section 8 subsidies. To bolster this theory, in late 2015 they subpoenaed the unedited footage from an interview Bonie gave to a local cable channel that had closely covered the case. The cable channel has vigorously opposed giving up the footage to the police. It is appealing the judge's decision requiring them to let him review footage and release relevant portions to the police. A month-long trial in July 2016 ended <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> acquitting Bonie of murder charges but convicting him of the lesser included charge of manslaughter.|$|E
25|$|In 1867 Pierrepont {{conducted}} {{the case for}} the government against John H. Surratt, indicted as an accomplice in the murder of President Lincoln. Surratt, a former Confederate spy, was the last person to be tried by a U.S. Military commission in the case of Lincoln's assassination. After Lincoln's assassination, Surratt fled the United States to Montreal, Liverpool, Rome, and was finally caught in Egypt on December 2, 1866, where he was indicted and returned to the United States to face U.S. military trial. The trial opened on June 10, 1867 under Judge George P. Fisher and held immense public interest in the United States. Pierrepont argued that Surratt was involved in the conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. Government and involved with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth. Pierrepont argued that the military trial was suited for Surratt's case and quoted Bible verses that he viewed supported government was created by God {{for the express purpose of}} finding the guilty. Pierrepont argued that because Surratt had assumed an alias name, John Harrison, in staying at a hotel, and had fled the country that this proved his guilt. The trial lasted until August 10, 1867 and ended <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> unable to make any decision after a seventy-hour deliberation. As a result of the hung jury, Judge Fisher set Surratt free.|$|E
