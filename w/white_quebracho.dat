50|$|Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco Pendula, or Weeping <b>White</b> <b>Quebracho,</b> is a weeping {{tree and}} a {{cultivar}} of Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco, the <b>White</b> <b>Quebracho.</b> It was first described by Spegazzini from Santiago del Estero, Argentina in 1910. No trees {{are known to}} survive of this cultivar.|$|E

50|$|Some {{species of}} plants in danger are: timbó, samu’u, <b>white</b> and red <b>quebracho</b> and karanday. Among the animal species in danger are: carpincho, jurumi, jacaré and tapir.|$|R
50|$|The {{trees in}} the area are short and thorny; there are {{brushwood}} and cactus, dunes and small hills, especially in the north of the department. Some species of trees in this region are in danger of extinction: the urunde'y, <b>white</b> and red <b>quebracho,</b> samu'u also known as palo borracho and palo santo.|$|R
50|$|Quebracho blanco, called kebrako or <b>white</b> <b>quebracho,</b> is a South American tree species, {{native to}} Brazil, N Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay. It {{must not be}} {{confused}} with other species also known as quebracho, but belonging to the genus Schinopsis.|$|E
50|$|The {{region has}} a vast plain with {{vegetable}} coverage formed by <b>white</b> <b>quebracho,</b> palo santo, samuù, low forests, thorn bushes, and various species of cactus. It {{is an excellent}} area for the big mammals such as felines (yaguareté, puma, tirika, yaguarundí), various species of armadillos, monkeys (Ka’i mirikina y Ka’i pyhare), tagua y tapir o mboreví.|$|E
50|$|Created in 1998, {{today has}} 125.823ha. The River Timane {{is located in}} the zone and it`is {{considered}} a special river because it does not end up in any water course or lagoon. The Cerro Cabrera is in the border with Bolivia. The vegetation there is mainly a dense sabana and open forests. There are a lot of <b>white</b> <b>quebracho,</b> samuù and palo santo. Animals: wild felines, armadillos, oso hormiguero and tapir.|$|E
50|$|The area harbors several environments: {{scrubland}}, savanna, swamps, {{and small}} lakes. The scrubland is the habitat {{of the red}} quebracho (Schinopsis lorentzii), <b>white</b> <b>quebracho</b> (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco), algarrobo (Prosopis alba), and lapacho (Tabebuia spp.), {{all of which are}} commercially valuable species. The fauna includes large predators such as cougars. In the lakes one finds yacare caimans and capybaras. Elsewhere there are armadillos, South American tapirs and plains viscachas, as well as birds (more than 340 species). The fauna also includes the black howler monkey (Alouatta caraya).|$|E
50|$|The {{rainy season}} {{normally}} starts in November and new foliage appears in early spring, {{irrespective of the}} actual arrival of the rains. The leaves may not be shed at all in mild winters. In more humid areas, the predominant species is the <b>white</b> <b>quebracho</b> (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco), followed by P. flexuosa, chaparral (Larrea divaricata), Mimozyganthus carinatus and Acacia furcatispina. Under more arid conditions, P. flexuosa may predominate in open woodland with the Chilean greenwood (Geoffroea decorticans) and an understorey of caperbush (Capparis atamisquea), saltbush (Atriplex lampa) and seablite (Suaeda divaricata) also being present. The flowers produce large quantities of pollen and nectar and are beloved by bees, which also pollinate them.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was created}} in 1980 with 40.000 ha. Its size and shape is {{practically}} rectangular, {{and it makes it}} easier to protect from the biological diversity [...] It has typical landscapes of the Dry Chaco. Due to the lack of water, its vegetation is characterized by the dense forest, thorns and almost impenetrable. Its typical trees are : <b>white</b> <b>quebracho,</b> the palo santo and the samu’u.Animals: great quantity of wild mammals such as felines yaguarte and others, the three precaires (the tagua is the symbol of the area). Tte. Enciso, also has trenches and ways from the Chaco War time, which can be visited with the park guards who are specially trained to wait on tourists.|$|E
50|$|Quebracho {{produces}} tannins {{that can}} be extracted in quebracho sawmills from the heartwood of both red (Schinopsis lorentzii) and <b>white</b> <b>quebracho</b> (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco). Logs are inserted into planers to produce chips {{that are used to}} produce the quebracho extract by boiling them in vats. It is used for fine leather tanning and imparts a red-brown color. Ordinary or warm soluble quebracho (also known as insoluble Quebracho) is the natural extract obtained directly from the quebracho wood. This type of extract is rich in condensed tannins of natural high molecular weight (phlobaphenes), which are not easily soluble. Its use is therefore limited to addition of small amounts during the process of tanning leather intended for shoe soles in hot liquids (temperature above 35 °C) to improve the yield and the water-proofness of the leather. The cold soluble extracts are obtained by subjecting the ordinary extract to a sulphiting process which transforms the phlobaphenes into completely soluble tannins. The cold soluble quebracho extracts are the most universally known and used types. The chemical structure of these extracts can be described as polymers of epicatechin. The main properties of these extracts are: a very rapid penetration, a high tannin content and a relatively low percentage of non-tannins. The rather low acid and medium salt content characterise them as mild tanning extracts (low astringency). Quebracho tannins give an important added value to the quality of leathers, such as vacchetta, belts and garments, making them more compact and tear resistant with a pleasant touch. The sulphited quebracho extract may be carcinogenous in mice. Other recent studies show that quebracho tannins present a strong anti-mutagenic activity. The heartwood contains from 20 to 30 percent tannin and 3 or 4 percent water-soluble nontannin. It is said to not ferment.|$|E
