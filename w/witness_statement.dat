5|$|Before his trial, Tony {{attempts}} suicide. Whitney {{tries to}} visit but is refused, and Bianca {{sees it as}} a form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, but after {{the first day of the}} trial, he flushes the SIM card down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her <b>witness</b> <b>statement</b> was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, Mrs Taylor (Jacqueline Defferary), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer and lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, Vivien Easley QC (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the verdict is being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands.|$|E

25|$|Two other male {{suspects}} in the murder case travelled to Australia, one in April 2013 (who then later fled to the US) and one in June 2013, {{in an attempt to}} avoid prosecution. The pair were suspected of involvement in the shooting and burglary, but they were not arrested and no warrant has been issued. A team of detectives from the Gardaí travelled to Sydney in January 2014, and one of the suspects was forced to provide a <b>witness</b> <b>statement</b> to the authorities. It was reported that when his visa expired, he would be deported if he failed to leave the country of his own accord. Police in Australia were said to be monitoring his movements.|$|E

25|$|McFarlane {{applied to}} the Court of Appeal {{to be allowed to}} appeal the {{decision}} of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, however his application was refused by Lord Justice Elias on 30 January 2010. A renewed application was made before Lord Justice Laws on 15 April 2010. It contained a request that his case be heard before a specially constituted court comprising the Lord Chief Justice and five Lords Justices with proven sensibility towards religious issues. A <b>witness</b> <b>statement</b> was also submitted in support of the application by the former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, Lord Carey of Clifton. The statement supported Mr McFarlane's request for a specially constituted court, and also sought to refute suggestions that Christian teaching on same-sex unions was discriminatory and that such views were equivalent to homophobia. The application was refused in a judgement delivered on 29 April 2010.|$|E
25|$|Phil {{decides to}} sell The Queen Victoria, as revenge for Alfie's {{treatment}} of Roxy, and Kat and Alfie move {{back in with}} Mo. Kat then reveals that she is pregnant by Alfie, and discovers that she is having twins. Having spotted Stacey from the top deck of a bus, Kat decides to track her down. She visits Janine in prison, and agrees to provide a false <b>witness</b> <b>statement</b> for Michael's murder, in return for Janine dropping false charges against Stacey, {{so that she can}} return to Walford. At her trial, Janine confesses to her crimes, and Kat is charged with perjury. She is devastated when Stacey hands herself over to the police for Archie Mitchell's (Larry Lamb) murder, five years previously. Kat attends a hearing, and is given a suspended sentence. After the market is merged with Spring Lane, Kat immediately clashes with her new rival, Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) and is later surprised when Alfie reveals he has bought a pitch on the market. Kat gives birth to Bert and Ernie Moon. Stacey is released after she appeals her sentence and comes to live with Alfie and Kat. The financial situation becomes worse for the Moons when Alfie reveals they are to be evicted as they have not been paying their bills.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} episode of series three of Ashes to Ashes, {{the nature of his}} death is raised when Alex Drake discovers a <b>witness</b> <b>statement</b> implied to have been written by Gene Hunt with various parts blacked out, {{accompanied}} by Alex seeing visions of a man with injuries to {{the left side of his}} face dressed in police tunic and greatcoat. In the second episode, DCI Jim Keats, an officer from the Discipline and Complaints department, intent on removing Gene Hunt, states he believes Gene killed Sam Tyler. In the fifth episode, Gene destroys Tyler's clothes (which Alex had requested from Manchester) and the censored file in order to prevent her from learning the truth about his death. In the following episode, a suspect who is not only a known fantasist but appears very different physically from Sam tries to convince Alex that he is Sam Tyler after undergoing extensive plastic surgery, and that he is from the future. He quotes Sam's usual speech in the Life on Mars introductions, claiming that nobody else is real, although he still seems to be pleased when he, Gene and Alex are in the same room, calling them the 'Three Musketeers', and avoiding Alex's attempts to test him for future knowledge by claiming that such details are forgotten after too long in the past. Gene tells Alex that he helped Sam fake his own death, meaning Sam was still alive but had disappeared into thin air.|$|E

500|$|The trials {{took place}} not quite {{seven years after}} the Gunpowder Plot {{to blow up the}} Houses of Parliament in an attempt to kill King James and the Protestant {{aristocracy}} had been foiled. It was alleged that the Pendle witches had hatched their own gunpowder plot to blow up Lancaster Castle, although historian Stephen Pumfrey has suggested that the [...] "preposterous scheme" [...] was invented by the examining magistrates and simply agreed to by James Device in his <b>witness</b> <b>statement.</b> It may therefore be significant that Potts dedicated The Wonderfull Discoverie to Thomas Knyvet and his wife Elizabeth; Knyvet was the man credited with apprehending Guy Fawkes and thus saving the king.|$|E
500|$|The first {{incident}} near Fort Blue Mounds {{occurred when}} William Griffith Aubrey was attacked {{and killed by}} Native American warriors on June 6, 1832. [...] According to one <b>witness</b> <b>statement,</b> directly preceding the first attack at Fort Blue Mounds on June 6, there was an argument between William Aubrey's wife and a Ho-Chunk man. During the exchange the Ho-Chunk man threatened to kill her husband. Aubrey was a miner who was working for Brigham about 1½ miles away from Fort Blue Mounds when he was attacked. He and Jefferson Smith were detailed to retrieve water from a spring near the fort when they were ambushed by a small party of warriors. Aubrey was shot twice and stabbed through the neck with a spear. His companion, though shot three times, managed to escape with his life. Smith fled back to the fort, leaving his gun and horse behind. At the fort, the settlers correctly guessed that the attackers were Ho-Chunk and not the warriors of Black Hawk's [...] "British Band," [...] which was [...] away at Lake Kegonsa.|$|E
500|$|Lord Phillips {{said that}} the appeal raised the [...] "narrow issue" [...] of whether [...] "the act of {{preparing}} a joint <b>witness</b> <b>statement</b> is one in respect of which an expert witness enjoys immunity from suit", and the broader issue of whether [...] "public policy justifies conferring on an expert witness any immunity from liability in negligence {{in relation to the}} performance of his duties in that capacity." [...] He said that it was surprising that the immunity had simply been accepted in the past and never challenged. He noted that the immunity dated back to Cutler v Dixon in 1585, over 400 years ago, before English tort law developed the modern law of negligence. It was originally a complete protection for witnesses against claims for defamation, before developing to cover protection from other tort claims. [...] He noted that it was difficult to draw the line at present between expert assistance that was immune from claim and that which was not: it might be that the earlier advice was negligent, not the evidence given in court resiling from that earlier advice, even if it was the later developments about which the client complained.|$|E

500|$|Telpuk {{testified in}} court in October 2008 on various days {{spanning}} the weekend of October 5, 2008, regarding her knowledge in the famous suitcase scandal. [...] Her October 3 testimony, wherein she contradicted the testimony of Antonini, {{in which he had}} stated that he was carrying the suitcase as a courtesy to his companions, was considered a highlight of the trial. [...] On that day, her presence prompted a media frenzy [...] [...] For her part, Telpuk took the stand to testify that she had been offered political asylum by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as employment in the United States in exchange for modifying her <b>witness</b> <b>statement</b> that Mr. Antonini Wilson was the owner of the suitcase that contained the $800,000. On November 3, 2008, part of the case was decided in a Miami courtroom when Franklin Durán, a wealthy businessman who allegedly conspired to cover up both the origin and the destination of the suitcase, was convicted of acting as an [...] "unregistered agent" [...] of Venezuela on American soil. On March 17, 2009 Franklin Durán, who was facing up to 15years in prison, was sentenced to 4.|$|E
500|$|Losing four of {{his first}} five games in charge, Gannon was forced to respond to {{criticism}} over his team selections and substitutions, and announced plans to expand the club's non-playing staff. On 1 February the players met with the Chairman and rumours spread that Gannon had 'lost the dressing room', as comparisons were made with the tenure of Brian Clough in The Damned United. Yet the next day an O'Shea volley gave Vale a 1–0 win over promotion rivals Rotherham United to give Gannon his first win in charge at the club. However tension remained, as proven {{at the end of}} the month when it was reported that Gannon left the team bus on a pre-match journey after rowing with assistant manager Geoff Horsfield. Gannon had previously told the press his staff were 'underqualified', though insisted any changes would be 'implemented at a later stage' and that Horsfield was a 'great assistant'. It was later reported in the national media that Horsfield had requested a day off to deal with a family matter, Gannon then granted him permission but subsequently wrote a letter to the board complaining of his conduct. An unnamed director then handed the letter to Horsfield, who confronted Gannon over the issue, brandishing the letter as proof when Gannon denied its existence. This came on the same day that local paper The Sentinel ran an editorial that questioned his loan signings, his decision to drop Gary Roberts and branded his tactics and team selections as baffling. Having returned to the team to steer his side to a 2–1 victory over Aldershot, Gannon said [...] "there's been misrepresentation in the media over my part in this. I'm completely the innocent party". The club informed Horsfield that he would face a disciplinary hearing, whilst Gannon would not be asked to defend his actions and would merely provide a <b>witness</b> <b>statement.</b> The club took no action, and after Horsfield spent two weeks at home the pair returned to work as before. He continued to exploit the loan market, signing Dominic Blizzard from Bristol Rovers, a midfielder who played under him at Stockport.|$|E
