25|$|Instead, Chávez {{would be}} taken to La Orchila, a {{military}} base {{off the coast of}} Venezuela, until rebel leaders could decide Chávez's fate. Whilst being held at Fort Tiuna, Chávez had access to television and saw the rolling television claims of his resignation, and became concerned that he would be killed (and the death made to look like suicide) {{in order to keep the}} narrative clear. He was able to get <b>word</b> <b>out</b> that he had not in fact resigned, via a telephone call to his daughter, who, via switchboard operators at Miraflores still loyal to Chávez, was able to speak first to Fidel Castro and then to Cuban television.|$|E

[...] The locomotive and three cars left {{the station and}} the cheering crowds, estimated at 20,000people, and began its run eastward. [...] The number of people at La Grande Station is remarkable in itself since the train's schedule was planned only one day before the event; the Santa Fe used the train {{as an opportunity to}} publicize itself and got the <b>word</b> <b>out</b> to news agencies across the railroad's territory.|$|E

500|$|The Workshop devoted 8% {{of their}} initial budget to {{advertise}} the new show. [...] In what Morrow called [...] "an extensive campaign" [...] that Lesser stated [...] "would demand {{at least as}} much ingenuity as production and research", they promoted the show with educators and the broadcast industry. [...] The Workshop understood that a special effort had to be made to reach their target community because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups. To get the <b>word</b> <b>out</b> to their target audience in the inner cities, they hired Evelyn Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called [...] "remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable", as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.|$|E
500|$|Guitarist {{and band}} leader, Roger McGuinn, {{returned}} to the composition during a July 22, 1969 recording session for the band's Ballad of Easy Rider album. McGuinn decided {{to slow down the}} tempo and radically alter the song's arrangement to fashion a more somber and serious version than those recorded in 1965. In tandem with the slower tempo, the band dragged the syllables of each <b>word</b> <b>out</b> in order to emphasize the world-weariness of the song's lyric. Ultimately, McGuinn was dissatisfied with the recording of the song included on Ballad of Easy Rider, feeling that it tended to drag {{within the context of the}} album. In addition to appearing on Ballad of Easy Rider, The Byrds' 1969 recording of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] can also be found on the compilation albums The Byrds Play Dylan and The Very Best of The Byrds.|$|E
500|$|The {{self-immolation}} necessitated {{a change}} in tactics for Falun Gong. Tiananmen Square had been [...] "permanently contaminated" [...] as a venue for protest, according to journalist Ethan Gutmann, and Falun Gong's daily demonstrations in Beijing nearly ceased altogether. According to Human Rights Watch, practitioners may have concluded [...] "the protests had outlived their usefulness for demonstrating Chinese abuses or for informing an overseas audience of Falungong's harmlessness." [...] Diaspora practitioners living overseas focused their attentions on getting the <b>word</b> <b>out</b> about the treatment of practitioners by the Chinese government, issuing reports to the United Nations and human rights organisations, staging public marches and hunger strikes outside of China, and documenting human rights abuses on websites. Within China, practitioners used mass mailings and handed out literature to [...] "spread the truth" [...] and counter the government's allegations against them. In an August 2001 press release, the US-based Falun Dafa Information Center noted this shift in strategy, and said that Chinese practitioners [...] "sometimes also manage to post large posters and banners in major thoroughfares. They even set up loudspeakers on rooftops or trees around labour camps and in densely populated areas to broadcast news about the human rights abuses." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I like to think that we can use this story to really educate people and get the <b>word</b> <b>out</b> there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E

Before the release, Euronymous' family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said [...] "I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim {{were on the same}} record. I put <b>word</b> <b>out</b> that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did." ...|$|E

2500|$|A new group, the Committee for Civic Progress, {{was formed}} to help promote the bond levy. Its members {{included}} 150 business, labor, real estate leaders. The group asked the City Council to send personal letters to their constituents, asking them to support the proposal. [...] All but three council members agreed to do so. The Greater Cleveland Convention and Visitors Bureau also helped. It issued a study in which it claimed that the convention center would generate $24 {{million a year in}} new economic activity, and printed 300,000 leaflets to get the <b>word</b> <b>out</b> about the study's conclusions. Local radio and television stations donated time to the Committee for Civic Progress so it could run advertisements supporting the proposal.|$|E
2500|$|I {{think about}} my father being called ‘boy’, my uncle being called ‘boy’, my brother, coming back from Vietnam and being called ‘boy’. So I {{questioned}} myself: “What does a black man have to do before he’s given the respect as a man?” So when I was 18 years old, when I {{was old enough to}} fight and die for my country, old enough to drink, old enough to vote, I said I was old enough to be called a man. I self-ordained myself Mr. T so the first <b>word</b> <b>out</b> of everybody’s mouth is [...] "Mr." [...] That’s a sign of respect that my father didn’t get, that my brother didn’t get, that my mother didn’t get.|$|E

He also stated [...] "I was paralleling the experiences of the Irish, not just in recent times but through the penal days when the Irish were sold as slaves, through the Cromwellian period." [...] and that 50,000 Irish were shipped as slaves to Barbados between 1652 and 1659.

2500|$|In early 1983 Albini met Naked Raygun singer Jeff Pezzati through mutual {{friends and}} {{convinced}} him to play bass guitar with Big Black. Pezzati recalled that Albini [...] "knew {{a heck of a}} lot about, right from the start, how to release a record and get the <b>word</b> <b>out</b> that you have a record", and that [...] "He jumped at the chance to have a band play his stuff." [...] The two practiced in Pezzati's basement, and one day Naked Raygun guitarist Santiago Durango came downstairs and asked to play along. The trio clicked as a unit, Durango's ability to rework arrangements and tweak sounds helping to refine Albini's song ideas. According to Albini, [...] "He ended up being absolutely crucial to Big Black." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{songwriter}} and guitarist Bob Hartman met bassist John DeGroff and formed the band Dove, which he quickly disbanded when DeGroff left {{to attend a}} Bible school in Fort Wayne, Indiana, known as the Christian Training Center. Hartman soon followed, and in 1972 he and DeGroff joined two classmates, guitarist Greg Hough and drummer Bill Glover, to form Petra. The band played small Midwest venues such as churches, coffeehouses and parks, to share the message of Christianity with concertgoers. Glover said on an interview [...] "we weren't picky {{and we wanted to}} get God's <b>Word</b> <b>out</b> to our peers. We would set up in parking lots, parks, college campuses, coffee houses, etc." [...] A frequent venue was a Fort Wayne Christian-themed coffeehouse named The Adam's Apple.|$|E
2500|$|On Friday morning, September 13, 2013, Patrick Foye, the {{executive}} director of the Port Authority and an appointee of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, ordered that the lanes be reopened in a strongly worded 7:44 AM e-mail to senior PA officials and staff, including Bill Baroni and David Samson. In the e-mail, Foye called the decision to close the lanes [...] "hasty and ill-advised", said that the decision violated policy and long-standing custom at the PA, and that he believed that closing the lanes [...] "violates Federal Law and the laws of both States." [...] Foye asked his spokesman to get the <b>word</b> <b>out.</b> Upon learning this, Baroni attempted to prevent any disclosure in order to keep the public in the dark. Additionally, Baroni forwarded the e-mail to Regina Egea, Christie's Director of the authorities unit overseeing the PA, three hours after it was sent by Foye.|$|E
