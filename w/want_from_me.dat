500|$|After Readys success, Songz {{explained}} that the album {{was a result of}} his growth and new-found maturity. Commenting about the success of his singles, Songz stated that [...] "they're very strong records and they're not just radio records. They're records that embody the person I am as well as the artist I am. I think they're more definitive of who I am than any other album I've had. I've grown as an artist. I've been doing this [...] now. As I've matured, I've learned how to exude that of which I want to be felt. I've learned what my fans <b>want</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> and things of that nature." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{another such}} tradition, Ali was once reciting a sermon {{in the city}} of Kufah, when Ash'as ibn Qays, a {{commander}} in the Arab army protested, [...] "Amir-al-Momeneen! These Iranians are excelling the Arabs right in front of your eyes and you are doing nothing about it!" [...] He then roared, [...] "I will show them who the Arabs are!" [...] Ali immediately retorted, [...] "While fat Arabs rest in soft beds, the Iranians work hard on the hottest days to please God with their efforts. And what do these Arabs <b>want</b> <b>from</b> <b>me?</b> To ostracize the Iranians and become an oppressor! I swear by the God that splits the nucleus and creates Man, I heard the prophet once say, just as you strike the Iranians with your swords in the name of Islam, so will the Iranians one day strike you back the same way for Islam." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] {{said her}} husband; [...] "Joshua {{was the son}} of Nun and of Miriam, and Miriam was the sister of Moses and Aaron. What he now <b>wanted</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> was medical advice. For some time he had been afflicted with {{rheumatism}} in his left leg, which came upon him after exposure to the damp and cold.|$|R
6000|$|... "If he does, {{he never}} speaks about it," [...] the girl {{answered}} a little bitterly. [...] "All that he <b>wants</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> is my absence or my silence. When I {{came back the}} other night, he was furious. If he'd thought about it, I'm sure he'd have had me stay in London. Now that I am here, though, I am simply a prisoner." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{ten minutes}} {{the engine was}} in position, the well {{at the back of}} the church was feeding it, and the hose was carried to the doorway of the vestry. If help had been <b>wanted</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> I could not have afforded it now. My energy of will was gone--my {{strength}} was exhausted--the turmoil of my thoughts was fearfully and suddenly stilled, now I knew that he was dead.|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{what does}} it mean?" [...] cried Mr. Travers. [...] "Why doesn't the fellow apologize? Why are we kept here? Are we being kept here? Why don't we get away? Why doesn't he take me back on board my yacht? What does he <b>want</b> <b>from</b> <b>me?</b> How did he procure our release from these people on shore who he says {{intended}} to cut our throats? Why did they give us up to him instead?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Charge be damned!" [...] Mr. Horser answered. [...] "The police don't <b>want</b> {{particulars}} <b>from</b> <b>me.</b> When I say do a {{thing they}} do it. They {{know that if they}} declined it would be their last day on the force." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Thank God I do, Russ," [...] {{he replied}} feelingly. [...] "Frank Morton an' Si Zimmer, my friends an' neighbors all my prosperous days. An' friends still.

It was too unreal for her presence. And yet it was this she seemed to <b>want</b> <b>from</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "This," [...] I said, [...] "is a phase of great opportunities. The war has stirred the Empire to a sense of itself, to a sense of what it might be. Of course this Tariff Reform row is a squalid nuisance; it may kill out all the fine spirit again before {{anything}} is done. Everything will become a haggle, a chaffering of figures.... All the more reason why we should try and save things from the commercial traveller. If the Empire is anything at all, it is something infinitely more than a combination in restraint of trade...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, Barry, {{you know}} well enough that I have never loved but you! Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy! ever so angry, but the least offer of {{goodwill}} on your part did not bring me to your side? Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you, in bestowing {{one of the first}} fortunes in England upon you? Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I felt irresistibly attracted towards you. I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you. I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so; and in spite of reason and duty. What sacrifice do you <b>want</b> <b>from</b> <b>me?</b> I am ready to make any, so you will but love me; or, if not, that at least you will gently use me.' ...|$|E
60|$|I regained my compartment, which I {{was annoyed}} to find had filled up till mine {{was the only}} vacant seat. I had not had time to buy any papers or magazines, but, after all, I had enough to {{interest}} me in my thoughts. Of Tapilow I scarcely thought at all. He and I had met, and I had kept my oath. So far as I was concerned, that was the end. I had not even any fears for my own safety as regards this matter. My interview with Decresson and his friend had had a curiously convincing effect upon me. I felt that I had been tried for my crime, and acquitted, in the most orthodox fashion. For me the curtain had fallen upon that tragedy. It was the other things which occupied my mind. I seemed to have found my way into a maze, to have become mixed up in certain affairs in a most mysterious and inexplicable way. What was the meaning of that place to which Louis had introduced me? Was it {{some sort of secret}} organization,--an organization which assumed to itself, at any rate, the power to circumvent the police? And Bartot, too! Had he really the power which Louis had declared him to possess? If so, why had he baited a clumsy trap for me and permitted me to walk out of it untouched? What did they <b>want</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> these people? The thought was utterly confusing. I could find absolutely no explanation. Then, again, another puzzle remained. I remembered Louis' desire, almost command, that I should return to London by this particular train. Had he any reason for it? Was it connected in any way, I wondered, with the presence of this man and girl in the next compartment? It seemed feasible, even if inexplicable.|$|E
5000|$|After leaving Manchester City, Henshall joined Ipswich Town as a {{free agent}} by signing a two-year {{contract}} on 27 June 2014. Henshall said: [...] "Ipswich was always {{at the top of my}} list when I knew I would be moving on and it was an easy decision for me to make. I spoke to my family and my agent but it was a no-brainer really. I know what the manager <b>wants</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> and I like working under him and with the Club moving forward in the right direction, everything felt right." [...] He made his debut for the club on 12 August, starting in a League Cup match which Ipswich lost 1-0 to Crawley Town in extra-time.|$|R
5000|$|RuPaul {{has also}} said that the album is his best, adding, [...] "I {{understand}} what the public <b>wants</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> - and I am letting these children have it!". To this end, the album is strongly directed to a gay audience (even more so than previous RuPaul albums). The song [...] "Tranny Chaser", for instance, is a comedic hip-hop track about sexually curious heterosexual men who pursue casual sex with transgender women. In it RuPaul sings [...] "Is some tranny chasers up in here? Welcome to my stratosphere! Make a move...what you gonna do? I ain't got no time for no lookie-loo, boo!"; and later, [...] "Do you wanna fuck me? That don't make you gay!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Bartel {{later said}} {{he worked for}} a year on Death Race 2000 for $5,000 [...] "so when it was {{finished}} I desperately needed money. The only thing anybody <b>wanted</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> was another car picture, hence Cannonball. Corman had drummmed into me the idea that if Death Race had been [...] "harder" [...] and [...] "more real" [...] it would have been more popular. Like a fool, I believed him." [...] Bartel says [...] "I am not, and never have been, very much interested in cars and racing" [...] so he decided to load up the film [...] "cameos and character gimmicks that did interest me." [...] His favourite scene was the one where Bartel, playing a nightclub owner, plays the piano and sings while two gangsters beat up Dick Miller.|$|R
