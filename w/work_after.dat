5|$|In a 1987 sermon Lefebvre, at age 81, {{experiencing}} failing health, {{announced his}} intention to consecrate a bishop to carry on his <b>work</b> <b>after</b> his death. This was controversial because, under Catholic canon law, the consecration of a bishop requires {{the permission of the}} Pope.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{is convinced}} {{to return to}} <b>work</b> <b>after</b> {{the death of a}} close friend. However, it soon becomes apparent that his first case back on the job is much deeper than he had expected.|$|E
5|$|After 25 {{years as}} a civilian, he rejoined the Army {{to fight in the}} American Civil War. Despite his age, he quickly rose up the ranks and was {{appointed}} a brigadier general in early 1862. During the war, he took part in the Northern Virginia Campaign, the Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of Chancellorsville. His most notable contribution during the war was his defense of the Union right flank at Culp's Hill during the Battle of Gettysburg. He returned to engineering <b>work</b> <b>after</b> the war until his death in 1899.|$|E

5|$|After he graduated, Motley {{enrolled}} in 1939 at South Carolina State College, a historically black school in Orangeburg, South Carolina. He transferred before {{his sophomore year}} to the University of Nevada, {{where he was a}} star on the football team between 1941 and 1943. As a punishing fullback for the Wolf Pack, Motley played against powerful West Coast teams including USF, Santa Clara, and St. Mary's. He suffered a knee injury in 1943 and returned to Canton to <b>work</b> <b>after</b> dropping out of school.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this, Birch has overdosed three times, and wrecked ten cars. Birch entered rehab in 2006, and missed six months of <b>work.</b> <b>After</b> his return, Birch became {{addicted}} to painkillers, due to the facial injury he suffered at the Armageddon pay-per-view in December 2006. After a direct intervention by WWE owner Vince McMahon, Birch was released, and credits this with him beating his addictions.|$|E
5|$|As the temperance {{movement}} faded {{the bands}} found new benefactors in the colliery owners, and many bands {{took on the}} names of specific collieries.

5|$|At her new job, Goldman met {{a fellow}} worker named Jacob Kershner, who shared {{her love for}} books, dancing, and traveling, {{as well as her}} {{frustration}} with the monotony of factory <b>work.</b> <b>After</b> four months, they married in February 1887. Once he moved in with Goldman's family, however, their relationship faltered. On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant. Before long he became jealous and suspicious. She, meanwhile, was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her—particularly the fallout of the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago and the anti-authoritarian political philosophy of anarchism.|$|E
5|$|Cariappa's {{alliance}} with the Indian Army was spread {{over a period of}} around three decades, during which he had broad experience of staff and command <b>work.</b> <b>After</b> his retirement in 1953, he served as the Indian high commissioner to Australia and New Zealand until 1956. With a view toward ex-servicemen's welfare, Cariappa founded the Indian Ex-Servicemen's League (IESL) in 1964. He was also instrumental in setting up the Directorate of Resettlement (later Directorate General Resettlement), an inter-service organisation under the Department of Ex-servicemen Welfare, Ministry of Defence, that looked after the various issues surrounding the resettlement of retired soldiers, especially those who retired young.|$|E
5|$|During her training, {{she worked}} with the {{district}} nurses, visiting families in the Melbourne's less affluent suburbs. Her ambition {{was to become a}} doctor who improved the lives of women and children. Women of her own social class did not normally <b>work</b> <b>after</b> they married, so marriage was not something she had intended. In 1919, with the war over, she wrote to Ned urging him to complete his Rhodes Scholarship studies before returning to Australia.|$|E

5|$|Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro were {{nominated}} {{again at the}} 2007 Martín Fierro Awards. These nominations proved controversial because the program only lasted for a week in 2007 and had no second season, and both actors took a recess from <b>work</b> <b>after</b> it. Neither of them received an award for those nominations. Oreiro won the newly created award for the best dressed actress of the night, which {{is not part of}} the official awards.|$|E

An advocate of healthy living, Hsu often gave public talks at schools, welfare homes, and hospitals in Singapore and overseas about health and service to the needy. When asked about the secret of her good health and longevity, Hsu attributed her good health to a spartan lifestyle, vegetarian diet, and to her positive attitude towards life.|$|E
5|$|In May 1914, Carl Larsson resumed {{the work}} on the {{painting}} on his own initiative. During 1915, he presented a painted sketch (№ 239), which was largely consistent with the previous painting. The king had been remade based on an oil painting (№ 240) that Larsson had made with a male model named Rydberg in 1914. The king's position was more pathetically composed and expressive and it agreed more with the change of emphasis that had taken place during the evolution of the <b>work</b> <b>after</b> Larsson's decision that the sacrifice was voluntary.|$|E
5|$|In November 1930, Anna May's {{mother was}} run over {{and killed by}} an {{automobile}} {{in front of the}} Figueroa Street house.

Anna May had been paying for the education of her younger siblings, who put their education to <b>work</b> <b>after</b> they relocated to China. Before the family left, Wong's father wrote a brief article for Xinning, a magazine for overseas Taishanese, in which he expressed his pride in his famous daughter.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{the local}} {{authority}} promised to build 1,000 new houses {{to accommodate the}} workforce {{by the end of}} 1938, but by February 1939 it had only awarded a contract for 100.

In 1940 a strike took place when women replaced men on capstan lathes, the workers' union insisting this was a skilled labour job; however, the men returned to <b>work</b> <b>after</b> 10 days.|$|E
