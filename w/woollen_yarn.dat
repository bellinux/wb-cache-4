25|$|A tightly {{spun wool}} yarn made from fibre {{with a long}} staple length in it is called worsted. It is hand spun from combed top, and the fibres all lie in the same {{direction}} as the yarn. A <b>woollen</b> <b>yarn,</b> in contrast, is hand spun from a rolag or other carded fibre (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The <b>woollen</b> <b>yarn,</b> thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally bulkier yarn. There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short draw creates worsted yarns, and long draw creates woollen yarns. Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a semi-worsted yarn.|$|E

2500|$|Until {{the early}} 19th century, in Europe and the United States, groups of {{localised}} professional hand knitters specialised {{in a few}} well-known patterns in which keeping a tally of rows was barely necessary, since the pattern and expected size of the work were known by heart. From the early 19th century, when printed patterns were introduced for the recreational knitter, and until the early 20th century, <b>woollen</b> <b>yarn</b> had clear stitch definition so that rows were easily seen and counted, and a mental tally could be kept. However knitters could tally by moving objects from one pocket to another, or bracelets from one wrist to the other. For lace knitting and complicated increases, a knitter could write five-bar gate tally marks around the margins of a printed pattern.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to analyse possibilities of making different <b>woollen</b> blend <b>yarns</b> with sheep’s wool and dog’s hair fibers and to investigate geometrical and mechanical properties of these yarns. In this paper sheep’s wool and dogs’ hair fibers were compared one with other in different geometrical (fibre surface, length, diameter, linear density) and mechanical (breaking tenacity, elongation at break, breaking toughness) properties. It was estimated that the sheep’s and the dog’s fibers are visually very different, they have various types of scales, also most of the dog’s hair have channels inside them. On the next stage of this work the <b>woollen</b> blend <b>yarns</b> were made by mixing the wool of German Blackface sheep with different breed (English Spaniel, Poodle, Yorkshire Terrier) dogs’ hair 15  %, 25  % and 35  %. After evaluating the linear density and mechanical properties of <b>woollen</b> blend <b>yarns,</b> it was estimated that influence of fiber composition in the yarns on these properties is different. Different values of the investigated properties are mostly influenced by spinning system of these yarns. The condenser spinning system affects inequality and unpredictable properties of <b>woollen</b> blend <b>yarns.</b> Also, obtained results depend on the breed of protein fibers, hairy surface, hollow structure and bending rigidity of fiber, the technological process or even compatibility of used devices.

40|$|Spiral tubes {{made from}} twisted wire {{have been used}} as {{decorative}} elements on garments in Estonia for the last thousand years (the 10 th to 19 th centuries). Patterns using this technique can be found in both archaeological and ethnographical collections. The tradition documented in Estonia is a part of a bigger phenomenon that from the 6 th century AD spread across the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea (Finland, north-western Russia, Latvia, and Lithuania, in addition to Estonia). Thus far, archaeologists have regarded the spiral tube decorations mainly as a source for garment history and not much {{attention has been paid to}} understanding the patterns' construction. This article focuses on the techniques used to make the spiral tube decorations, proceeding from wiredrawing to constructing the patterns. The results from the metal analysis prove that the main raw materials used in wire-drawing have been copper alloys, with additives being mainly zinc and tin, and in lesser amounts, lead and other elements. <b>Woollen</b> and linen <b>yarn,</b> and horsehair {{have been used as}} additive materials. The <b>woollen</b> <b>yarns</b> used are usually fine and of high-quality. Two main techniques used to make the patterns can be observed: the weaving of the spiral tubes into the tablet-woven band, and the use of various types of braided mesh and bands. When considering this very long period as a whole, it is possible to discern many different regional differences in both techniques and pattern combinations. Behind the archaeological patterns, makers of different skill-levels and with different purposes can be seen: from professional craftsmen to women who made spiral tube decorations at home for personal use...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the main {{determinants}} of the adoption and use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the relationship between ICT and the patterns of innovation in an Italian industrial district. The {{aim of this}} study is to analyse the main determinants of the adoption and use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the relationship between ICT and the patterns of innovation in an Italian industrial district. The analysis is carried out on a database of 118 textile enterprises located in Biella, a well-known industrial district specialized in medium to high quality <b>woollen</b> <b>yarns</b> and textiles, that have been interviewed following a structured questionnaire. On the whole, the rate of adoption and use of ICT in Biella is rather low and this confirms the results of other studies on industrial districts that are specialized in traditional sectors. Nevertheless, our analysis also shows that considering ICT as a general technology may be misleading. Instead, it is useful to disentangle the different ICT; in particular, there are significant differences between IT involving production, administration and logistic processes and the communication technologies (CT). Moreover, on a smaller sample of 50 firms we have tested the hypothesis that adoption and use of ICT may positively influence innovation. In this case, we find that different types of innovations, for instance, product, process and organizational innovations, are influenced by very different variables...|$|R
