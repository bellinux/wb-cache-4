40|$|Restorative and {{responsive}} justice {{can be a}} strategy of social work practice that builds democracy bottom-up by seeing families as building blocks of democracy and fonts of democratic sentiment. At the same time, because families are sites of the <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> of tyranny and the <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> of neglect, a {{rule of law is}} needed that imposes public human rights obligations on families. The republican ideal is that this rule of law that constrains people in families should come from the people. Restorative {{and responsive}} justice has a strategy for the justice of the people to bubble up into the justice of the law and for the justice of the law to filter down into the justice of the people. The role of the social worker is to be a bridge across which both those democratic impulses are enabled to flow. The empowering side of the social work role fits the first side of the duality where the will of families bubble up; the coercive side of the social work role fits the second where the justice of the law filters down.

The section of the valley patrolled by the Anzac Mounted Division was crossed by the wadis Auja, Mellahah, Nueiameh and the Kelt as well as the Jordan River with several extensive marshes in the jungle on its banks.

Mugabe has himself been accused of racism; John Sentamu, the Uganda-born Archbishop of York in the United Kingdom, called Mugabe [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> of racist dictator," [...] for having [...] "targeted the whites for their apparent riches". They have been denounced as racist against Zimbabwe's white minority. Tutu stated that Mugabe became [...] "increasingly insecure, he's hitting out. One just wants to weep. It's very sad."

500|$|Some people {{interpreted}} the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined gravitational effect between the Sun and the supermassive black {{hole at the}} center of our galaxy (known as Sagittarius A*), creating havoc on Earth. Apart from the [...] "galactic alignment" [...] already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it. Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 light years from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System. This reading of the alignment was included on the History Channel documentary Decoding the Past. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as [...] "45minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> of inane sensationalism".|$|E
500|$|Since then, Who's Next {{has often}} been viewed as the Who's best album. In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said its music was more genuine than Tommy or the aborted Lifehouse project because [...] "those were art – , even with its pretensions, is rock & roll." [...] BBC Music's Chris Roberts cited it as the band's best record and [...] "one of those carved-in-stone landmarks that the rock canon doesn't allow you to bad-mouth." [...] Mojo claimed its sophisticated music and hook-laden songs featured innovative use of rock synthesizers that did not weaken the Who's characteristic [...] "power-quartet attack". In The Encyclopedia of Popular Music (1998), Colin Larkin said it raised the standards for both hard rock and the Who, whose [...] "sense of dynamics" [...] was highlighted by the contrast between their powerful playing and a counterpoint produced at times from acoustic guitars and synthesizer obbligatos. Christgau, on the other hand, was less enthusiastic about the record during the 1980s when the Who became what he felt was [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> of art-rock band", writing that Who's Next revealed itself to be less tasteful in retrospect because of Daltrey's histrionic singing and [...] "all that synth noodling".|$|E

The field includes all five components: hardware, software, data, people, and procedures by which digital equipment, information and services are protected from unintended or unauthorized access, change or destruction, and is of growing importance due to the increasing reliance of computer systems in most societies. It includes physical security to prevent theft of equipment and information security to protect the data on that equipment.

500|$|Harvey then {{returned}} to Headingley, the venue of his famous innings five years earlier. In a low-scoring match, he top-scored for the entire match with 71 in the first innings as Australia took a 99-run lead. The tourists looked set for victory and retention of The Ashes {{at the start of}} the final day, but time-wasting and defiant defence from the English batsmen left Australia a target of 177 in the last two hours. This would have required a scoring rate much higher than in the first four days of the match. Harvey quickly scored 34 at a run a minute, and Australia had made 111 in 75 minutes and were on schedule for a win. At that point, English medium-pacer Trevor Bailey began bowling with the wicket-keeper more than two metres down the leg side to deny the Australians an opportunity to hit the ball, but the umpires did not penalise them as wides. The match ended in a draw, and Harvey described Bailey's tactics as [...] "absolutely disgusting". English wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans said that the tourists [...] "were absolutely livid" [...] and he sympathised with them, saying that [...] "they were right" [...] in claiming that Bailey's bowling was [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> of negative cricket" [...] and that he had [...] "cheated [...] of victory".|$|E

English wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans said that [...] "they were right" [...] in claiming that Bailey's bowling was [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> of negative cricket" [...] and that he had [...] "cheated [...] of victory". The match was also marred by a series of umpiring decisions made by Frank Chester against the Australians, leading Hassett to request that he not be appointed for the Fifth Test, something the English cricket authorities granted.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{informed}} the fans waiting outside the venue {{that the show}} would be general admission, and told everyone to get {{as close to the}} stage as possible, regardless of the seating assignment on their tickets. Fey wanted to cancel the show but was flying to Denver from the US Festival in California with Morris when the decision to continue was made. After arriving in Denver, Fey called the amphitheatre asking to where the concert was being moved, unaware that the band had decided to proceed with the show. Guitarist the Edge said that when Fey learned of the group's decision, he could not believe it. The Edge said, [...] "I don't think he'd ever heard anything quite so crazy in his life, going on with an outdoor show in the <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> of weather, rain and wind in the mountains. He thought we'd lost our minds completely." [...] Bono went on the radio that day to confirm that the Red Rocks concert was still taking place, and to promote a concert that the band planned for the following night at the CU Events Center to accommodate fans who were unable to attend the Red Rocks show. Clayton said during the band's radio interviews, [...] "We know it's raining now but we're sure it won't be when the show starts, so please come." [...] Two hours before the concert, the downpour subsided and settled into a misty drizzle. The 9,000-person venue had sold out, but because of the inclement weather, only about 4,400 fans attended.|$|E

(Not that this deters a series of smart, attractive young women, most of them officers of the law, from jumping into bed with him.)

The Korean Armistice required both sides to facilitate their return home.

5000|$|In 1934 the French {{government}} banned, in permanence, {{performances of}} Coriolanus {{because of its}} perceived unpatriotic qualities. In the international protests that followed came one from Germany, from none other than Joseph Goebbels.

Politically acceptable writers had simply been unable to fill the gap, or had only been able to do so with the <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> of agitprop.

40|$|It {{seems that}} the years of mankind {{struggle}} against poverty have ended to a symbolic belief: "We must empower people to stand up against poverty". Empowering people depends on the equal access to cultural, economical, and political opportunities. Equal accessibility to information and knowledge sources, has {{a key role in}} developing and maintaining those equal situations. Information can create money, power, and knowledge, and increase human capability. So, any inequality in information distribution is one of the <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> of discrimination, which leads to ever-lasting poverty. The central premise of this research is that E-Government can act as a facilitator for equal access to information, empower people in all aspects of social arenas, and as a result, strengthen the poverty eradication process. To explain this hypothesis, a model was introduced, which showed how discrimination leads to poverty and inactive participation in social life. In another model, empowerment, equal access to opportunities, and their impacts on poverty eradication were developed. Finally, a comprehensive model emphasizing on the unique affect of e-government on reforming the public involvement level was suggested. The model shows how e-government results in proactive participation of people in social arenas and public policy processes...|$|R
40|$|In Norway, {{an outlaw}} was “placed outside the law” and, after the {{introduction}} of Christianity in the eleventh century, the <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> of outlaws, perpetrators described in terms revolving around the vargr and the níðingr, were denied burial in the churchyard. Such people had committed their crimes in an unmanly and stealthy way. Additionally, they may have avoided taking responsibility for their actions. Such behaviour made an otherwise redeemable act irredeemable. This norm for proper conduct is firmly rooted in pre-Christian notions, and the Church {{used it as a}} platform {{to make it easier for}} the populace to understand that whereas most people belonged within the churchyard, others clearly did not. With some modifications during the high Middle Ages, typically when additional categories of criminals were excluded from Christian burial, this principle carried through well into the early modern period. Documents which can tell us how these rules worked out in practice are few and far between, but are enough to show that the Church tried to ensure that the worst outlaws remained out of the churchyard. The outlaws’ bodies may have been buried at the place of execution, typically close to the gallows, or at the shore or under heaps of stones far away from settlements...|$|R

He got a flurry of meetings with film studio executives and producers, eventually meeting producer Tony Bill. Bill offered to pay Boam the same $200 per week he was making at Fox, but instead write screenplays. Bill's stipulation was that he get a free option on whatever was written.
