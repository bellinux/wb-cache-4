25|$|During the Adana massacres of 1909, Fred Shepard {{provided}} much {{relief to}} the Armenian victims. In this period, a group of Armenians had defended themselves from massacre.

Shepard visited the church and helped cure the sick and wounded. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> returned to their village, they found their houses burned or destroyed. Shepard secured provisions for the destitute Armenians and received a medal for his work from the Sultan and a congratulatory letter from Djemal Pasha, the governor general of Adana. In addition to medals received from the Ottoman government, Shepard also received a medal of merit from the Red Cross.|$|E
25|$|Herodotus {{mentions}} that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons {{as they had}} been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.|$|E

During these visits, Maria developed an attraction to Nikolai Dmitrievich Demenkov, an officer of the day at the Tsar's Headquarters. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> returned to Tsarskoye Selo, Maria often asked her father to give her regards to Demenkov and sometimes jokingly signed her letters to the Tsar [...] "Mrs. Demenkov." ...|$|E

She at first taught them to rub patients' heads, to [...] "lay [...] hands where the belief is to rub it out forever"; Kennedy would manipulate each student's head and solar plexus before class in preparation. The head rubbing was abandoned <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> complained about having to take their hair down, and the stomach rubbing held no appeal for them either. Eventually Eddy told them to ignore {{that part of the}} manuscript, and from then on Christian Science healing did not involve touching patients.|$|E

500|$|Since the 1970s Wintjiya {{had created}} {{artefacts}} such as ininti seed necklaces, mats and baskets, using traditional artistic techniques including weaving of spinifex grass. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> of Kintore, including sisters Wintjiya and Tjunkiya, started creating canvasses, their works bore {{little resemblance to}} those of their male peers (who had been painting for some years). Wintjiya's first efforts were collaborative, {{as one of a}} group of women who created murals on the Kintore Women's Centre walls in 1992. She then joined a painting camp with other women from Kintore and Haasts Bluff to produce [...] "a series of very large collaborative canvases of the group's shared Dreamings" [...] (dreamings are stories used to pass [...] "important knowledge, cultural values and belief systems" [...] from generation to generation). Twenty-five women were involved in planning the works, which included three canvases that were [...] square, as well as two that were Tjunkiya and Wintjiya performed a ceremonial dance as part of the preparations. Wintjiya and her sister were determined to participate in the project despite cataracts interfering with their vision. As was the case for Makinti Napanangka, an operation to remove cataracts resulted in a new brightness to Wintjiya's compositions. Sources differ on when Wintjiya and her sister Tjunkiya had their cataracts removed: Johnson suggests 1999, but art centre coordinator Marina Strocchi, who worked closely with the women, states that it was 1994. In the early 2000s Wintjiya and her sister painted at Kintore, but in 2008 they were working from their home: [...] "the widows' camp outside her 'son' Turkey Tolson's former residence".|$|E
