Jackman said, [...] "There’s no doubt that the most {{important}} relationship in his life is — we’ve seen through the movies — is his relationship with Jean Grey. Yes, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> die at the end of ‘X-Men: The Last Stand,’ but in this movie, she has a presence, which I think is vital to the movie, particularly for him confronting the most difficult thing within himself." ...|$|E

He accepted, and sought to imitate {{the production of a}} television episode by filming in high-definition. During the course of the production, Zicree received advice on directing from J.J. Abrams. In addition to Takei, Grace Lee Whitney appeared as Janice Rand. She too had played the character in The Original Series, and had most recently appeared with Takei in [...] "Flashback". Christina Moses, who portrayed Alana Sulu, was a replacement for an actress who dropped out of the production some four weeks prior to production. The producers held further auditions in California, and Zicree said that [...] "The moment <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> she was perfect".|$|E
500|$|When Jam and Lewis {{agreed to}} produce Jackson's third studio album, {{they wanted to}} appeal {{primarily}} to the African American community, in addition to achieving crossover success on the pop music charts. Jam commented {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "We wanted to do an album that would be in every black home in America... we were going for the black album of all time." [...] Before their association with Jackson, Jam and Lewis had originally planned to record an album with tracks they wrote for Sharon Bryant, but she found their lyrics and sound to be too [...] "rambunctious". The duo presented the same set of recordings to Jackson, who gave her input and took co-writing and co-production credits for the album's content. Jam and Lewis recalled that in order to collaborate with Jackson on the material, they spent the first week simply getting to know their new client. Lewis explained, [...] "We got into her head. We saw what she was capable of, what she wanted to say, where she wanted to be, what she wanted to be. We put together some songs to fit her as <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> as she revealed herself to us. It was as simple as that." ...|$|E

2500|$|British label Relentless Records {{put forward}} an {{independent}} offer. However, Tunstall {{had decided to}} sign with a US major, and initially passed up the offer. But when that deal did not work out, {{she decided to go}} with Relentless. Although Relentless co-founder Shabs Jobanputra recognised the potential in the quality of Tunstall's voice and songs in the early 2000s, his assessment then was that she [...] "wasn't ready yet" [...] and so together with Tunstall's manager, Jobanputra discussed [...] "the process of how <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> happening and how we would work, why we thought the songs were great, why we thought she was great, and why it could really work if we took enough time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} was originally created purely for {{the plot of}} [...] "Silence in the Library". Moffat knew that the team of archaeologists would have to trust the Doctor, but the Doctor's psychic paper could not explain and convince the team why he had appeared in a sealed-off library. Therefore, Moffat intended for the Doctor to {{know one of the}} archaeologists, but decided that idea was [...] "dull" [...] and instead decided to have one of them know him. When Kingston returned to the show, Moffat explained to her some details about her character's back-story, knowledge which Smith, Gillan and Darvill did not receive until later. Kingston relates that she knows her character cannot be killed off because <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> death in her introductory episode; each subsequent appearance is set at a different point in her character's personal history. Moffat had planned out that River was Amy and Rory's daughter for [...] "a long time" [...] and used [...] "Pond" [...] as Amy's last name to create a link between the two. For the filming of the sixth series, Kingston was aware of River Song's relationship to Amy and Rory, while the other cast only found out upon reading of the mid-season cliffhanger script for [...] "A Good Man Goes to War".|$|E
2500|$|Andy Pryor, {{the casting}} director, {{suggested}} Gillan to Moffat after her {{performance in the}} fourth series episode [...] "The Fires of Pompeii", in which she played a soothsayer, but Moffat originally thought Gillan was [...] "short and dumpy". Later, however, he stated that she was [...] "exactly right for the role", though she portrayed the character differently from how Moffat originally wrote. Gillan was reportedly the last to audition for the role, and stood out as she was [...] "a bit kookier" [...] than the others. Moffat said of the casting, [...] "We saw some amazing actresses for this part. But when Karen came through the door, the game was up— she was funny, clever, gorgeous and sexy. Or Scottish, which is the quick way of saying it. A generation of little girls will want to be her. And a generation of little boys will {{want them to be}} her too." [...] Doctor Who executive producer and drama chief at BBC Wales Piers Wenger concurred, [...] "We knew Karen was perfect for the role the moment <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> She brought an energy and excitement to the part that was just fantastic." [...] Gillan was aware of the show but was not as big a fan of it as her mother was, due to it not being on when she was growing up. However, she watched some with her mother after it returned in 2005, and was also a fan of other science fiction such as The X-Files, The Outer Limits, [...] and [...]|$|E

2500|$|The year 1997 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Santos' career, when she played the title role in ABS-CBN's primetime television drama Esperanza. She starred alongside Wowie de Guzman, as a surviving victim of a vehicular collision thus separating from her parents and siblings and has seek out in search for them. Speaking about the character, Santos said [...] "Kung nasaan man ako ngayon, naging malaking part talaga 'yung Esperanza. Pati na rin 'yung mga nakapag-direct sa akin dahil natuto ako ng iba't ibang style at techniques sa acting." [...] (Wherever I am now, having portrayed Esperanza {{has been a significant}} part of my journey. The directors I've worked with have immersed me to different styles and techniques of acting). Santos' performance earned her praise from critics, as the press began referring to her as the new soap opera princess. FemaleNetwork.com noted that [...] "This is one [...] role no one is likely to forget. In this , Santos played the role of Esperanza, who was separated from her family as a young girl. Throughout the show, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> experiencing a lot of hardships, and we felt her own despair whenever her tears flowed on screen". Meanwhile, Dez Lucero from Chic concluded [...] "Santos proved to be bigger in stellar power. The show showcased her [...] and became a star in her own right". The series ran for three years and was adapted for motion picture release, [...] (1999), earning Santos the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Citation as Teenage Queen of Philippine Movies.|$|E

60|$|But {{the long}} years of penance {{had not been in}} vain.

5000|$|The {{album was}} named after the eponymous actress, Blake Hazard told Indy Week’s Chris Parker: [...] "We mostly wrote and {{recorded}} the album {{over the course of}} last summer, so it was kind of the honeysuckle weeks, though it's actually the name of a British actress. <b>We</b> just <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> name in the credits one night from something we were watching and thought it was the most charming name ever.

60|$|Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, {{than when}} <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs that the {{hospitals}} and homes {{still full of}} wounded 'boys' and soldiers' widows, decidedly miss the motherly missionary's visits.|$|E
