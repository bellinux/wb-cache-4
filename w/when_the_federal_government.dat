5|$|Some {{people in}} {{government}} {{want to say}} that safety is priority number one, but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> provides some guidances for safety measure which would reduce death by 37%, such as alcohol in 1998 or motorcycle helmet in 1967, around ten years are necessary for such measures be implemented by a number of local governments.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> began {{operations}} {{under the}} new form of government on March 4, 1789, two (of the 13) states were ineligible to participate as they had not yet ratified the Constitution. Both did so while Washington was in office, thereby joining the new Union: North Carolina, November 21, 1789; and Rhode Island, May 29, 1790.|$|E
50|$|Strankman {{was jailed}} in 2002 after being charged under the Customs Act for taking 756 bushels of wheat across the U.S. border {{in protest of}} the Canadian Wheat Board's monopoly. Strankman and other farmers arrested {{received}} a pardon from Prime Minister Stephen Harper on August 1, 2012, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> Marketing Freedom for Grain Farmers Act came into effect, which allowed producers {{to opt out of}} the Canadian Wheat Board and sell wheat on the open market.|$|R
50|$|The wealth {{generated}} from gold soon disappeared {{and by the}} early years of the 20th century the economy was once again dependent on wool and wheat. This dependency meant that a dramatic fall in wool and wheat prices in the late 1920s - early 1930s saw the state's economy collapse. It was not to recover until after World War II <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government's</b> postwar immigration policy saw a huge influx of migrants, nearly all of them from Europe, in the period 1947 to 1970.|$|R
50|$|Conservative {{fortunes}} {{were further}} {{hurt by the}} Conscription Crisis of 1917 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> Conservative <b>government</b> of Sir Robert Borden invoked conscription against the opposition of Quebec. This led to riots in the province.|$|R
5|$|After this {{construction}} was complete, {{there were still}} more calls to further develop the site, and especially to provide facilities for education about the wars. A $62million proposal was presented in 2006, incorporating a museum and an underground carpark. Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall, the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members, and ran into significant funding problems <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> decided not to provide funding.|$|E
5|$|Many farmers {{distilled}} their {{corn harvest}} into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey {{was used as}} a form of currency on the frontier. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.|$|E
5|$|Jones himself {{came under}} threat of {{transfer}} or subordination in April 1943 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> began moves to unite the Air Force's command by creating an overarching Air Officer Commanding RAAF position that would have effectively replaced Jones as CAS and also been senior to Bostock. Air Marshal Drummond was again approached but once more the British Air Ministry refused to release him, having selected him for an Air Council post. MacArthur rejected two other RAF candidates, and the plan was held over. In the King's Birthday Honours that June, Jones was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E

5|$|The college moved {{several times}} during its first eleven years, before {{settling}} in its present location. Prior to Canadian Confederation, the college was financially supported by the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, the Canadian government and private citizens. After Confederation, the college faced ruin <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> withdrew its funding and the Commercial Bank of the Midland District collapsed, a disaster which cost Queen's two-thirds of its endowment. The college was rescued after Principal William Snodgrass and other officials created a fundraising campaign across Canada.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> shifted {{to a day}} school {{integration}} model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this same period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished {{to serve as the}} control sample.|$|E

50|$|Cafaro {{was hired}} as President and Chief Executive Officer to rescue Ventas, a {{healthcare}} REIT, in 1999 at a time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> company {{was on the verge}} of financial collapse. Its primary tenant - Vencor, Inc., which accounted for nearly all of its revenue - faced a serious cash squeeze and was unable to pay all of its rent. In addition, Ventas had $1 billion of bank loan debt and faced significant whistle blower claims related to Medicare fraud. Its portfolio of 271 senior nursing facilities and hospitals were largely dependent on Medicare payments to cover rent, at a time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government’s</b> reimbursements were declining.|$|R

50|$|This {{section of}} the river was an {{important}} gold, and minor iron mining area in the 19th century, with the first known gold being mined by placer in Lynches River and its tributaries near Pageland and Jefferson starting about 1828. Before the Civil War, 58 gold mines operated in South Carolina. All commercial mining ceased in 1942 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> War Labor Board and PL-208 outlawed gold mining across the country. With the value of gold locked at $35 per ounce, and federal law prohibiting private citizens from holding gold between the 1930s and 1980s, nearly all gold mines in the United States became impractical and unprofitable to operate.|$|R
25|$|On May 20, 2005, a {{gay male}} couple with a {{daughter}} brought suit in the Northwest Territories {{for the right}} to marry. The territorial Justice Minister, Charles Dent, had previously said that the Government would not contest such a lawsuit. The case was to be heard on May 27 but ended <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> legalized same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of his {{effective}} Extension leadership during the late Depression and through the war years, Davis emerged as a national agricultural leader and spokesman, which enabled him to influence the course of federal legislation throughout the Roosevelt years — in the view of some, a critical asset in an era <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> exerted an especially strong influence on farm policy.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, {{there was}} a strike by workers on coconut {{plantations}} from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo. Strikers blocked the highways of the town. In 1953, the town gained municipality status. In the 1970s, the area changed radically <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> decided to develop the Zihuatanejo-Ixtapa area into a tourist attraction. This caused the population to increase dramatically, especially in the 1980s and today the main economic base is tourism.|$|E

25|$|In 1875, the region's largest {{construction}} project in history was completed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government's</b> Intercolonial Railway (ICR) opened between Moncton and Campbellton. The following year it would link Halifax with Rivière-du-Loup and the Canadian railway network. One {{of the biggest}} geographic obstacles presented in the project was the crossing of the Miramichi River. Surveyors deemed the ideal location for bridging {{to be at the}} upper reaches of tidewater between Nelson and Newcastle, crossing the Southwest Miramichi, then a short section of land at Derby, followed by the Northwest Miramichi. The combined length of these bridges would be among the largest constructed to date in Canada (surpassed only by the Victoria Bridge in Montreal) and were the first bridges over the Miramichi River, revolutionizing transport in the region.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. Coalition for Advanced Diesel Cars {{is pushing}} for a {{technology}} neutral policy for government subsidies of environmentally friendly automotive technology. If successful, government subsidies {{would be based on}} the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards rather than supporting specific technologies like electric cars. Political shifts could drastically change adoption projections. Turbocharger sales in the United States increased <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> boosted corporate average fuel economy targets to 35.5 mpg by 2016.|$|E
25|$|Prohibition {{had been}} popular in north Florida, but was opposed {{in the rest}} of the south, which became a haven for speakeasies and rum-runners in the 1920s. During 1928–32 a broad {{coalition}} of judges, lawyers, politicians, journalists, brewers, hoteliers, retailers, and ordinary Floridians organized to try to repeal the ban on alcohol. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> legalized near beer and light wine in 1933, the wet coalition launched a successful campaign to legalize these beverages at the state level.|$|E

These were amalgamated with other government-owned railways in 1923 to form the Canadian National Railways. The CNR closed many of the Canadian Northern Railway facilities in Port Arthur. It opened the Neebing yards in Neebing Township in 1922. By 1929, {{the population of the}} two cities had recovered to pre-war levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{highways}} in Penang began in <b>the</b> 1970s <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Malaysian <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> {{decided to build}} the Penang Bridge, connecting Seberang Perai and Penang Island. The construction of the Penang Bridge, between Perai on the mainland and Gelugor on Penang Island, began in 1982 and was completed in 1985.

25|$|The {{states and}} localities had to {{organize}} and equip the volunteer regiments until later in 1861, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> became sufficiently organized {{to take over the}} project. Soon after President Lincoln's calls for volunteers, many volunteers from Illinois gathered in various large public and private buildings in Chicago and then overflowed into camps on the prairie on the southeast edge of the city. Senator Stephen A. Douglas owned land next to this location and had donated land just south of the camps to the original University of Chicago.|$|E
25|$|Conn’s {{early work}} {{came at a}} time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> was eager to develop {{alternative}} sources of energy {{in the wake of the}} 1973 oil crisis. He became one the first researchers to study the potential of nuclear fusion reactors, in which the fusion of hydrogen nuclei releases tremendous amounts of energy in the form of neutrons and energetic particles such as helium ions, the heat from which is then used to generate electricity. Nuclear fusion is the process that fuels stars, but triggering and sustaining nuclear fusion in a controlled manner on Earth so it can generate energy at a power plant is not yet a practical reality.|$|E
25|$|The Pershing Park {{site was}} {{originally}} {{occupied by a}} variety of 19th-century structures until about 1930, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> took legal title to the block and demolished the structures on it. Legislation officially designating the plot as a Pershing Square subsequently was adopted by Congress in 1957. Development of the square proved controversial, as different groups offered competing proposals for memorials to John J. Pershing, who had served as General of the Armies in World War I. These disagreements led to inaction, and by 1962 the square remained bare and often cluttered with trash. In September 1963, District of Columbia officials finally planted grass and flower beds to temporarily beautify the square.|$|E
