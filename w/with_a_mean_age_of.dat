25|$|In the United States, 10.2 {{million are}} {{estimated}} to experience angina with approximately 500,000 new cases occurring each year. Angina is more often the presenting symptom of coronary artery disease in women than in men. The prevalence of angina rises with increasing age, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of 62.3 years. After five years post-onset, 4.8% of individuals with angina subsequently died from coronary heart disease. Men with angina {{were found to have}} an increased risk of subsequent acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease related death than women. Similar figures apply in the remainder of the Western world. All forms of coronary heart disease are much less-common in the Third World, as its risk factors are much more common in Western and Westernized countries; it could, therefore, be termed a disease of affluence. The adoption of a rich, Westernized diet and subsequent increase of smoking, obesity, and other risk factors has led to an increase in angina and related diseases in countries such as China.|$|E

2500|$|Age {{determination}} of this star shows some variation {{based on the}} method used. Statistically, for stars hosting a debris disk, the luminosity of this star suggests an age of about 20–150 million years. Comparison with stars having similar motion through space gives an age in the range 30–160 million years. Given the star's position on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram of luminosity versus temperature, it has an estimated age {{in the range of}} 30–1,128 million years. λ Boötis stars like this are generally young, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> a billion years. More accurately, asteroseismology also suggests an age of approximately a billion years. [...] However, this is disputed because it would make the planets become brown dwarfs to fit into the cooling models. [...] Brown dwarfs would not be stable in such a configuration.

Methods: A total of 62 healthy, young individuals were randomly selected for participation in this study.

Plate taping test was administered to all the subjects to determine their speed and coordination of upper limb. Findings: Student’s t-test was applied between both groups to see the difference in their plate taping test’s time; its t-value was 5. 03. Conclusion: Statistical significant difference was seen between both the groups in the result of plate taping test, which suggests that smoking can affect the speed and coordination of upper limb in a negative way and cause its deterioration. Therefore, immediate quitting from smoking is of high value and requirements to have a good speed and coordination of upper-limb movements.
