25|$|Some {{invertebrate}} {{species that}} feature (partial) sexual reproduction {{in their native}} range are found to reproduce solely by parthenogenesis in areas {{to which they have}} been introduced. Relying solely on parthenogenetic reproduction has several advantages for an invasive species: it obviates the need for individuals in a very sparse initial population to search for mates, and an exclusively female sex distribution allows a population to multiply and invade more rapidly, potentially up to twice as fast. Examples include several aphid species and the <b>willow</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Nematus oligospilus, which is sexual in its native Holarctic habitat but parthenogenetic where it has been introduced into the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|Nematus oligospilus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>willow</b> <b>sawfly,</b> is a species of sawfly in the family Tenthredinidae. Native to central and northern Europe and Asia, it was first recorded in South America in the 1980s and New Zealand in 1997, and has also been introduced to Australia, South Africa and Lesotho. Its larvae feed on the leaves of various species of willow.|$|E
50|$|The <b>willow</b> <b>sawfly</b> is {{widespread}} in the Holarctic region and has spread {{to other parts of}} the world. It was recorded in South America for the first time in the 1980s, in Argentina and Chile where it caused severe defoliation of various species of willow (Salix). In 2017 it was recorded in Colombia on the ornamental willow Salix humboldtiana. It had reached New Zealand by 1997 and was also present around this time in Australia. In both of these countries it spread rapidly, with the larvae feeding on species of willow, which are not native plants in Australia and New Zealand. It has also been found in South Africa and Lesotho.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether the density of sawfly galls on Arroyo willow in the Arroyo Seco, Pasadena, California were {{affected}} by physical and biological factors. The sawfly is a small wasp that induces galls on <b>willows,</b> where the <b>sawfly</b> larvae develop. The independent biological factors that I am investigating are the amount of leaf resource, the size of the tree, and the number of shoots. The independent physical factors that I plan to examine were light, nitrogen content, distance from the water, and soil quality. In this poster, I present data only on sawfly density in the study area...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} induce galls on plants has evolved {{independently}} in many insect orders, but the adaptive significance and evolutionary consequences of gall induction are still largely unknown. We studied these questions {{by analyzing the}} concentrations of various plant defense compounds in <b>willow</b> leaves and <b>sawfly</b> galls. We found that the galls are probably nutritionally beneficial for the sawfly larvae, because the concentrations of most defensive phenolics are substantially lower in gall interiors than in leaves. More importantly, changes in chemistry occur in a similar coordinated pattern in all studied willow species, {{which suggests that the}} insects control the phenolic biosynthesis in their hosts. The resulting convergence of the chemical properties of the galls both within and between host species indicates that the role of plant chemistry in the evolution of host shifts may be fundamentally less significant in gallers than in other phytophagous insects...|$|R

40|$|The <b>willow</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Nematus oligospilus Förster, has {{recently}} been recorded from Colombia. Natural populations were searched for in Bogotá City, {{where one of the}} host plants, Salix humboldtiana, grows as an ornamental tree. Larvae and cocoons were found, which thrive on the leaves of this plant. Parthenogenetic reproduction of this sawfly was confirmed. Fecundity of every female was estimated through counting the number of eggs laid on the leaves of the host. In addition, some variations in the color pattern of the adult are described and several of its morphological traits measured. For the larval stage, the body length of each instar was measured and their stadium (intermoult period or instar duration) calculated. Six larval instars were observed regularly; only one case of seven instars occurred...|$|E
40|$|Nematus oligospilus Förster (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) is a <b>willow</b> <b>sawfly</b> {{native to}} the Northern Hemisphere which became a serious {{defoliator}} in willow plantations (Salix spp.) of the Southern Hemisphere after being introduced in the early 1980 ´s. Studies on host preferences provide useful information {{for the development of}} pest management strategies where the <b>willow</b> <b>sawfly</b> may produce tree damage and economic loss. Feeding preferences of N. oligospilus larvae were evaluated in laboratory trials by simultaneously offering leaves from four willow tree clones commonly used in commercial plantations in Argentina (Salix babylonica var sacramenta Hortus, Salix nigra Marsch., S. babylonica L. x Salix alba L. 131 - 27 and Salix matsudana Koidz. x S. alba L. 13 - 44). Larvae of N. oligospilus fed on leaves from the four clones. However, insects consumed a significantly higher proportion of S. babylonica var sacramenta leaves than of leaves from the other clones. Results indicate that all clones used in the trials were palatable to the insect, and that S. babylonica var sacramenta is the preferred host for larval herbivory. Nematus oligospilus Förster (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae), o la avispa sierra de los sauces, es nativa del Hemisferio Norte y se ha convertido en un serio defoliador en plantaciones de sauces (Salix spp.) del Hemisferio Sur, después de su introducción a principios de 1980. Los estudios sobre las preferencias de hospedador aportan información útil para el desarrollo de estrategias, donde la avispa sierra puede producir daño a los árboles y pérdidas económicas. Se evaluó la preferencia alimentaria de las larvas de N. oligospilus, mediante ensayos de laboratorio; se ofrecieron en forma simultánea hojas de cuatro clones de sauce, usados comúnmente en plantaciones comerciales en Argentina (Salix babylonica var sacramenta Hortus, Salix nigra Marsch., S. babylonica L. x Salix alba L. 131 - 27 and Salix matsudana Koidz. x S. alba L. 13 - 44). Las larvas de N. oligospilus se alimentaron de las hojas de los cuatro clones. Sin embargo, consumieron una proporción significativamente mayor de las hojas de S. babylonica var sacramenta. Estos resultados indican que todos los clones utilizados en los ensayos fueron palatables para el insecto y que S. babylonica var sacramenta es el hospedador preferido para la herbivoría de las larvas...|$|E
40|$|Invasive organisms {{can have}} major impacts {{in their new}} environments, {{affecting}} biodiversity, community structure and ecosystem processes, and {{are one of the}} main causes of species extinction. Willows (Salix spp.) are among the worst environmental weeds in Australia, with important consequences for aquatic and terrestrial environments. Nematus oligospilus Förster (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae), the <b>willow</b> <b>sawfly,</b> has been introduced inadvertently into most regions of the Southern Hemisphere, where it established and quickly became invasive. It was first found in South America, then southern Africa, New Zealand and lastly, Australia. At high population densities, N. oligospilus larvae can cause extensive willow defoliation and even lead to tree death. This thesis assessed the ecology and evolution of N. oligospilus in its introduced range to understand the reasons behind its persistence, spread and potential long-term impacts. I focused on (a) factors that determine the pest status of N. oligospilus, (b) abiotic conditions required for establishment and persistence, (c) host-plant interactions, and (d) reproductive mode and population structure. Where willows are considered beneficial introductions (i. e. New Zealand), N. oligospilus is considered a pest, whereas where willows are considered noxious weeds, such as in Australia, N. oligospilus is deemed as potentially beneficial for willow management. A major field survey in New Zealand and Australia showed that N. oligospilus was widespread in both countries, occurring on all willow taxa, albeit with major differences in population densities. Highest densities occurred on Salix fragilis and its hybrid, Salix x rubens. Ecological niche modelling based on current sawfly distributions predicted that N. oligospilus has reached its full potential distribution in New Zealand, but that it had not yet reached its full range in Australia. Molecular analyses showed that N. oligospilus is a strict parthenogen in its introduced range. Furthermore, few genotypes were found in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, with two major widespread genotypes that are environmental generalists or “superclones”. Fourteen other localized, closely related clones were detected. All clonal genotypes detected in the Southern Hemisphere are potentially derivable from the commonest one by mutation, and lineages differed in most cases by the smallest possible mutational unit in microsatellites. There was evidence of country-specific lineages derived from a local ancestor by mutation. Genotype patterns were consistent with sawflies dispersing themselves at local to regional scales, but with human assistance at larger scales. Host plant associations had strong effects on larval growth and adult oviposition, putatively related to fitness. Differences in host-plant interactions were found within clonal (microsatellite) lineages; however, it is unclear if these are due to inherited environmental effects or local adaptation. The <b>willow</b> <b>sawfly</b> represents a great opportunity to study an unimpeded invasion replicated across continents, particularly of a species that has switched from sexual to asexual reproduction during invasion. This research clearly indicates the high colonisation success and rates of spread of N. oligospilus in Australia, and that by combining field based, molecular and laboratory approaches, significant insights can be gained into the processes underlying invasion...|$|E
40|$|Invasive organisms {{can have}} major {{impacts on the}} environment. Some {{invasive}} organisms are parthenogenetic in their invasive range and, therefore, exist {{as a number of}} asexual lineages (=clones). Determining the reproductive mode of invasive species has important implications for understanding the evolutionary genetics of such species, more especially, for management-relevant traits. The <b>willow</b> <b>sawfly</b> Nematus oligospilus Förster (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) has been introduced unintentionally into several countries in the Southern Hemisphere where it has subsequently become invasive. To assess the population expansion, reproductive mode and host-plant relationships of this insect, microsatellite markers were developed and applied to natural populations sampled from the native and expanded range, along with sequencing of the cytochrome-oxidase I mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) region. Other tenthredinids across a spectrum of taxonomic similarity to N. oligospilus and having a range of life strategies were also tested. Strict parthenogenesis was apparent within invasive N. oligospilus populations throughout the Southern Hemisphere, which comprised {{only a small number of}} genotypes. Sequences of mtDNA were identical for all individuals tested in the invasive range. The microsatellite markers were used successfully in several sawfly species, especially Nematus spp. and other genera of the Nematini tribe, with the degree of success inversely related to genetic divergence as estimated from COI sequences. The confirmation of parthenogenetic reproduction in N. oligospilus and the fact that it has a very limited pool of genotypes have important implications for understanding and managing this species and its biology, including in terms of phenotypic diversity, host relationships, implications for spread and future adaptive change. It would appear to be an excellent model study system for understanding evolution of invasive parthenogens that diverge without sexual reproduction and genetic recombinatio...|$|E
