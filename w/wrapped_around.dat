This paper investigates this effect in two ways. Different experimental setups will be shown and described including results and theories concerning the fluid <b>wrap</b> <b>around.</b> It can be proven, that bursting bubbles caused by etching support the fluid <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> {{as well as some}} additives and surface morphologies. Additionally, surface tension, surface energy and surface morphologies can be found as influencing factors. Further investigations for better understanding of the fluid <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> will be described...|$|R

5|$|Before marriage, women {{used to wear}} a Kirgi (sari) and Baju (blouse). The Kirgi is a {{piece of}} cloth not longer than four feet, and about three feet wide. It was <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> the body from the waist down. A jacket with long sleeves called a Baju, was used to cover {{the upper part of the}} body. This dress was a sign of the bride's virginity and was worn during the Ros ceremony. The Kirgi was <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> the waist, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder. To wear the sari with its end thrown over the shoulder, known as Worl, is the {{exclusive}} right of a married woman. Married women used to wear sarees the general way. The Salwar kameez is another form of popular dress for females. The Mangalorean Catholic bride's wedding sari is known as a Sado. It is usually a red-coloured Banarasi sari which is made of finely woven silk and is decorated with elaborate engravings. In olden days, the bride wore on her head a red cloth, three feet square. Gold ornaments were absent in those days: the bride went to the church dressed as a virgin girl. In modern times, the bride wears (in place of the Kirgi) a red sari, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder; it is <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> the waist. The bride wears a few gold ornaments, some rings on the fingers, earrings, and at least two of the Dantoni (golden combs). Other ornaments worn by the bride in the olden days included Kanti, Chakrasar, Kap, Karap, Mugud, Kanto, and Dantoni.|$|E

They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E

The match ended when Snitsky came off the second rope onto a steel chair that was <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> Kane's neck and pinned him to win the match.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA flow (continuous real action) on {{a compact}} {{orientable}} surface M of genus greater than one (a sphere {{with at least}} two handles) has sufficient room for orbits to <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> one of the handles in an exotic fashion. Specifically, an orbit that is <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> one handle can, between wraps, spend increasing amounts of time <b>wrapping</b> and unwrapping <b>around</b> a second handle before returning to the first for the next <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> it. As a result the omega limit set of such an orbit can contain a simple closed curve of fixed points around the second handle in spite of <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> the first handle. In an earlier paper (Colloq. Math. 84 / 85 (2000) 235), the authors constructed such a flow from this perspective and studied its lift to the universal covering space of the surface. In this paper it is shown that many of the properties of the example are consequences of a general theory that extends classical limit cycle theory...|$|R

5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed of sand and clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E

5|$|Historically, Texas culture {{comes from}} a blend of Southern (Dixie), Western (frontier), and Southwestern (Mexican/Anglo fusion) influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another.

A popular food item, the breakfast burrito, draws from all three, having a soft flour tortilla <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> bacon and {{scrambled}} eggs or other hot, cooked fillings. Adding to Texas's traditional culture, established in the 18th and 19th centuries, immigration has made Texas a melting pot of cultures from around the world.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the {{relationship}} between strings and five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to quantize the branes. Starting in 1991, {{a team of researchers}} including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If one considers a five-dimensional brane <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured relationship between strings and branes was reduced to a relationship between strings and strings, and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 15. It traversed westward and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 29. The system quickly developed deep convection and a low-level circulation, and on September 1 it organized into Tropical Depression Nine-E while located about 170miles (270km) off the southwest coast of Mexico. The depression initially moved west-northwestward, and shortly after forming it turned to the north-northwest. Under favorable conditions, the depression slowly strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette on September 2 while located 220miles (350km) west of Manzanillo. By later that day, the convection <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> the center of circulation. Henriette quickly organized and intensified into a hurricane on September 3 while located 135miles (235km) west-southwest of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco. Upon reaching hurricane status, one computer model predicted Henriette to continue moving northward through the Gulf of California, though most forecast a turn to the northwest.|$|E
