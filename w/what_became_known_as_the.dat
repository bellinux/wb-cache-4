In response Arab employees of the company killed 39 Jewish employees in <b>what</b> <b>became</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Haifa Oil Refinery massacre. The Jewish Haganah militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of Balad al-Shaykh, where many of the Arab refinery workers lived, in <b>what</b> <b>became</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Balad al-Shaykh massacre. Control of Haifa was critical in the ensuing civil war, since it was the major industrial and oil refinery port in British Palestine.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, L'Enfant's {{vision of a}} grand {{national}} capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core. <b>What</b> <b>became</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan {{is thought to have}} largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design.|$|E
5|$|During his campaign, Chandler {{had promised}} {{that he would}} fund a medical school at the University of Kentucky, {{despite the fact that}} the University of Louisville already had a medical school and a poll of state {{physicians}} showed overwhelming opposition to the plan because of this. Nevertheless, Chandler delivered on his promise, allocating $5million to the establishment of <b>what</b> <b>became</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Albert B. Chandler Medical Center.

Gromoboi sailed to Kronstadt in <b>what</b> <b>became</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 'Ice Voyage' and was placed into reserve shortly after her arrival.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 the French {{microbiologist}} Charles Chamberland {{invented a}} filter, {{known today as}} the Chamberland filter or Chamberland–Pasteur filter, that has pores smaller than bacteria. Thus he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In the early 1890s the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study <b>what</b> <b>became</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1939, the {{invasion}} of Poland by Nazi Germany began. Consequently, Britain and France, obligated by the Anglo-Polish military alliance and Franco-Polish alliance to attack Germany {{in the case of}} such an invasion, demanded that Germany withdraw.

They took minimal military action during <b>what</b> <b>became</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Phony War.|$|E

Golda Meir finally agreed to the formation of the Agranat Commission towards the end of November 1973.

5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, attempted to remove the offending judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court. Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original court continued to claim authority as the court of last resort in the state; during <b>what</b> <b>became</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Old Court-New Court controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy. It was a politically tumultuous time.|$|E

In November 1916, Germany had inquired {{to find out if}} Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany {{was having a hard time}} finding trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E
