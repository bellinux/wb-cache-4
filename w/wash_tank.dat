40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the ultrasonic pressure distribution in a sonoreactor and an ultrasonic <b>washing</b> <b>tank</b> by finite element method (FEM) by taking into account the coupling effect between the acoustic pressure in water and the mechanical vibration of the solid structure. To examine the ultrasound intensity distribution in a sonoreactor with a fixed volume of water, the ultrasonic pressure distribution at different L values, which was the distance between the tip of the ultrasound probe and the bottom of the reactor inner wall, was simulated. The ultrasound intensity distribution was then calculated based on the acoustic pressure distribution obtained from the FEM simulation. The validity of the computer simulation was evaluated by comparing the ultrasound intensity distributions in the sonoreactor at two different L values with the result of a microbial inactivation test conducted in the same sonoreactor for each L value when treated by mano-thermo-sonication in a batch operation. The acoustic pressure field between two transducer boxes in a custom-made ultrasound-assisted <b>washing</b> <b>tank</b> was simulated, which was then compared with the result of an erosion test with aluminum foils. A relatively good agreement was achieved between the FEM simulation and the pitting patterns formed on the aluminum foils caused by cavitation activities.

A novel molecule-based method, using strain- and genus-specific oligonucleotide probes, was developed to detect and enumerate specific campylobacter strains in mixed populations. Strain-specific oligonucleotide probes were designed for the short variable regions (SVR) of the flaA gene in individual Campylobacter jejuni strains. A 16 S rRNA Campylobacter genus-specific probe was also used. Both types of probes were used to investigate populations of campylobacters by colony lift hybridization. The specificity and proof of principle of the method were tested using strains with closely related SVR sequences and mixtures of these strains. Colony lifts of campylobacters were hybridized sequentially with up to two labeled strain-specific probes, followed by the generic 16 S rRNA probe. SVR probes were highly specific, differentiating down to 1 nucleotide in the target sequence, and were sufficiently sensitive to detect colonies of a single strain in a mixed population.

40|$|On March 18, 2009 a Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) GC Line Filter Assembly was {{received}} at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). This filter assembly {{was removed from}} operation following the completion of Sludge Batch 4 processing in the DWPF. Work on this sample was requested in a Technical Assistance Request. This document reports the pictures, observations, samples collected, and analytical results for the assembly. The assembly arrived at SRNL separated into its three component filters: high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) - 1, HEPA- 2, and a high efficiency mist evaporator (HEME). Each stage of the assembly's media was sampled and examined visually and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Solids built up in the filter housing following the first stage HEME, were dissolved in dilute nitric acid and analyzed by ICP-AES and the undissolved white solids were analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD). The {{vast majority of the}} material {{in each of the three}} stages of the DWPF GC Line Filter Assembly appears to be contaminated with a Hg compound that is {approx} 59 wt% Hg on a total solids basis. The Hg species was identified by XRD analysis to contain a mixture of Hg{sub 4 }(OH) (NO{sub 3 }) {sub 3 } and Hg{sub 10 }(OH) {sub 4 }(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 6 }. Only in the core sample of the second stage HEPA, did this material appear to be completely covering portions of the filter media, possibly explaining the pressure drops observed by DWPF. The fact that the material migrates through the HEME filter and both HEPA filters, and that it was seen collecting on the outlet side of the HEME filter, would seem to indicate that these filters are not efficient at removing this material. Further SRAT off-gas system modeling should help determine the extent of Hg breakthrough past the Mercury Water <b>Wash</b> <b>Tank</b> (MWWT). The SRAT off-gas system has not been modeled since startup of the facility.

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility has {{experienced}} significant {{issues with the}} stripping and recovery of mercury in the Chemical Processing Cell (CPC). The stripping rate has been inconsistent, often resulting in extended processing times to remove mercury to the required endpoint concentration. The recovery of mercury in the Mercury Water <b>Wash</b> <b>Tank</b> has never been high, and has decreased significantly since the Mercury Water <b>Wash</b> <b>Tank</b> was replaced after the seventh batch of Sludge Batch 5. Since this time, essentially no recovery of mercury has been seen. Pertinent literature was reviewed, previous lab-scale data on mercury stripping and recovery was examined, and new lab-scale CPC Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) runs were conducted. For previous lab-scale data, many of the runs with sufficient mercury recovery data were examined to determine what factors affect the stripping and recovery of mercury and to improve closure of the mercury material balance. Ten new lab-scale SRAT runs (HG runs) were performed {{to examine the effects}} of acid stoichiometry, sludge solids concentration, antifoam concentration, form of mercury added to simulant, presence of a SRAT heel, operation of the SRAT condenser at higher than prototypic temperature, varying noble metals from none to very high concentrations, and higher agitation rate. Data from simulant runs from SB 6, SB 7 a, glycolic/formic, and the HG tests showed that a significant amount of Hg metal was found on the vessel bottom at the end of tests. Material balance closure improved from 12 - 71 % to 48 - 93 % when this segregated Hg was considered. The amount of Hg segregated as elemental Hg on the vessel bottom was 4 - 77 % of the amount added. The highest recovery of mercury in the offgas system generally correlated with the highest retention of Hg in the slurry. Low retention in the slurry (high segregation on the vessel bottom) resulted in low recovery in the offgas system. High agitation rates appear to result in lower retention of mercury in the slurry. Both recovery of mercury in the offgas system and removal (segregation + recovery) from the slurry correlate with slurry consistency. Higher slurry consistency results in better retention of Hg in the slurry (less segregation) and better recovery in the offgas system, but the relationships of recovery and retention with consistency are sludge dependent. Some correlation with slurry yield stress and acid stoichiometry was also found. Better retention of mercury in the slurry results in better recovery in the offgas system because the mercury in the slurry is stripped more easily than the segregated mercury at the bottom of the vessel. Although better retention gives better recovery, the time to reach a particular slurry mercury content (wt%) is longer than if the retention is poorer because the segregation is faster. The segregation of mercury is generally a faster process than stripping. The stripping factor (mass of water evaporated per mass of mercury stripped) of mercury at the start of boiling were found to be less than 1000 compared to the assumed design basis value of 750 (the theoretical factor is 250). However, within two hours, this value increased to at least 2000 lb water per lb Hg. For runs with higher mercury recovery in the offgas system, the stripping factor remained around 2000, but runs with low recovery had stripping factors of 4000 to 40, 000. DWPF data shows similar trends with the stripping factor value increasing during boiling. These high values correspond to high segregation and low retention of mercury in the sludge. The stripping factor for a pure Hg metal bead in water was found to be about 10, 000 lb/lb. About 10 - 36 % of the total Hg evaporated in a SRAT cycle was refluxed back to the SRAT during formic acid addition and boiling. Mercury is dissolved as a result of nitric acid formation from absorption of NO{sub x}. The actual solubility of dissolved mercury in the acidic condensate is about 100 times higher than the actual concentrations measured. Mercury metal present in the MWWT from previous batches could be dissolved by this acidic condensate. The test of the effect of higher SRAT condenser temperature on recovery of mercury in the MWWT and offgas system was inconclusive. The recovery at higher temperature was lower than several low temperature runs, but about the same as other runs. Factors other than temperature appear to affect the mercury recovery. The presence of chloride and iodide in simulants resulted in the formation of mercurous chloride and mercurous iodide, respectively, in the offgas system. Actual waste data shows that the chloride content is much less than the simulant concentrations. Future simulant tests should minimize the addition of chloride. Similarly, iodine addition should be eliminated unless actual waste analyses show it to be present; currently, total iodine is not measured on actual waste samples...|$|E

40|$|Testing was {{completed}} {{to demonstrate the}} viability of the newly developed glycolic acid/formic acid flowsheet on processing in the Defense Waste Processing Facility's (DWPF) Chemical Process Cell (CPC). The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) initiated a sludge matrix study to evaluate the impact of changing insoluble solid composition on the processing characteristics of slurries in DWPF. Four sludge simulants were prepared to cover two compositional ranges in the waste. The first was high iron/low aluminum versus low iron/high aluminum (referred to as HiFe or LoFe in this report). The second was high calcium-manganese/low nickel, chromium, and magnesium versus low calcium-manganese/high nickel, chromium, and magnesium (referred to as HiMn or LoMn in this report). These two options can be combined to form four distinct sludge compositions. The sludge matrix study called for testing each of these four simulants near the minimum acid required for nitrite destruction (100 % acid stoichiometry) and at a second acid level that produced significant hydrogen by noble metal catalyzed decomposition of formic acid (150 % acid stoichiometry). Four simulants were prepared based on the four possible combinations of the Al/Fe and Mn-Ca/Mg-Ni-Cr options. Preliminary simulant preparation work has already been documented. The four simulants were used for high and low acid testing. Eight planned experiments (GF 26 to GF 33) were completed to demonstrate {{the viability of the}} glycolic-formic flowsheet. Composition and physical property measurements were made on the SRAT product. Composition measurements were made on the condensate from the Mercury Water <b>Wash</b> <b>Tank</b> (MWWT), Formic Acid Vent Condenser (FAVC), ammonia scrubber and on SRAT samples pulled throughout the SRAT cycle. Updated values for formate loss and nitrite-tonitrate conversion were found {{that can be used in}} the acid calculations for future sludge matrix process simulations with the glycolic acid/formic acid flowsheet. Preliminary results of the initial testing indicate: (1) Hydrogen generation rate was very low throughout all SRAT cycles. (2) The mercury concentration of the SRAT product was below the 0. 8 wt% limit in all runs. (3) Nitrite in the SRAT product was < 100 mg/kg for all runs. (4) Foaminess was not an issue using the nominal antifoam addition strategy in these tests. (5) The high aluminum sludges (LoFe, HM type sludges) were much more viscous than the Hi Fe sludges. At 100 % acid stoichiometry, the SRAT products from the high aluminum sludges were very viscous but at 150 % acid stoichiometry, the SRAT products from the high aluminum sludges were very thin. This makes the glycolic acid/formic acid flowsheet an improvement for processing more viscous sludges. (6) The pH of the SRAT products was from 2. 7 - 3. 1 for the 150 % acid stoichiometry runs and 5. 1 - 6. 1 for the 100 % acid stoichiometry runs, significantly lower than is typical of the baseline nitric acid/formic acid flowsheet...|$|E
40|$|Phase III {{simulant}} flowsheet {{testing was}} completed using the latest composition estimates for SB 6 /Tank 40 feed to DWPF. The {{goals of the}} testing were to determine reasonable operating conditions and assumptions for the startup of SB 6 processing in the DWPF. Testing covered the region from 102 - 159 % of the current DWPF stoichiometric acid equation. Nitrite ion concentration was reduced to 90 mg/kg in the SRAT product of the lowest acid run. The 159 % acid run reached 60 % of the DWPF Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) limit of 0. 65 lb H 2 /hr, and then sporadically exceeded the DWPF Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) limit of 0. 223 lb H 2 /hr. Hydrogen generation rates peaked at 112 % of the SME limit, but higher than targeted wt% total solids levels may have been partially responsible for rates seen. A stoichiometric factor of 120 % met both objectives. A processing window for SB 6 exists from 102 % to something close to 159 % based on the simulant results. An initial recommendation for SB 6 processing is at 115 - 120 % of the current DWPF stoichiometric acid equation. The addition of simulated Actinide Removal Process (ARP) and Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU) streams to the SRAT cycle had no apparent impact on the preferred stoichiometric factor. Hydrogen generation occurred continuously after acid addition {{in three of the}} four tests. The three runs at 120 %, 118. 4 % with ARP/MCU, and 159 % stoichiometry were all still producing around 0. 1 lb hydrogen/hr at DWPF scale after 36 hours of boiling in the SRAT. The 120 % acid run reached 23 % of the SRAT limit and 37 % of the SME limit. Conversely, nitrous oxide generation was subdued compared to previous sludge batches, staying below 29 lb/hr in all four tests or about a fourth as much as in comparable SB 4 testing. Two processing issues, identified during SB 6 Phase II flowsheet testing and qualification simulant testing, were monitored during Phase III. Mercury material balance closure was impacted by acid stoichiometry, and significant mercury was not accounted for in the highest acid run. Coalescence of elemental mercury droplets in the mercury water <b>wash</b> <b>tank</b> (MWWT) appeared to degrade with increasing stoichiometry. Observations were made of mercury scale formation in the SRAT condenser and MWWT. A tacky mercury amalgam with Rh, Pd, and Cu, plus some Ru and Ca formed on the impeller at 159 % acid. It contained a significant fraction of the available Pd, Cu, and Rh as well as about 25 % of the total mercury charged. Free (elemental) mercury was found in all of the SME products. Ammonia scrubbers were used during the tests to capture off-gas ammonia for material balance purposes. Significant ammonium ion formation was again observed during the SRAT cycle, and ammonia gas entered the off-gas as the pH rose during boiling. Ammonium ion production was lower than in the SB 6 Phase II and the qualification simulant testing. Similar ammonium ion formation was seen in the ARP/MCU simulation as in the 120 % flowsheet run. A slightly higher pH caused most of the ammonium to vaporize and collect in the ammonia scrubber reflux solution. Two periods of foaminess were noted. Neither required additional antifoam to control the foam growth. A steady foam layer formed during reflux in the 120 % acid run. It was about an inch thick, but was 2 - 3 times more volume of bubbles than is typically seen during reflux. A similar foam layer also was seen during caustic boiling of the simulant during the ARP addition. While frequently seen with the radioactive sludge, foaminess during caustic boiling with simulants has been relatively rare. Two further flowsheet tests were performed and will be documented separately. One test was to evaluate the impact of process conditions that match current DWPF operation (lower rates). The second test was to evaluate the impact of SRAT/SME processing on the rheology of a modified Phase III simulant that had been made five times more viscous using ultrasonication...|$|E

The UV 254 (F) was the best indicator for PAA decay and as such for the E. coli O 157 inactivation with PAA + LA. The disinfection efficiency of PAA + LA increased with decreasing pH.

Based on the obtained results, PAA + LA seems to be better suited than chlorine for disinfecting process wash water with a high organic load but a higher disinfectant residual is necessary due to the slower E. coli O 157 inactivation kinetics when compared to chlorine.

25|$|The {{increase}} in scale {{brought a new}} problem. Until then, the <b>washing</b> of <b>tanks</b> after cargo discharge was done by water. In December 1969 three tankers exploded during <b>tank</b> <b>washing.</b> The Dutch Shell tanker Marpessa sank off Dakar and became the largest merchant vessel ever lost. The other two, the British Shell tanker Mactra and the Norwegian Kong Haakon VII were damaged heavily, but remained afloat. Shell investigated the matter {{and came to the}} conclusion that water drops that impact steel with high velocity generates static electricity that can cause explosions in combination with cargo vapors. This only became apparent with the large sizes of the tanks of VLCC's.|$|R
50|$|Ice resurfacers are {{generally}} {{composed of a}} snow container, hot water <b>tanks,</b> a <b>wash</b> water <b>tank,</b> the conditioner, and a board brush. The engine or motor of the vehicle is responsible both for propelling the resurfacer and also powering the hydraulics that control the various functions, such as lowering the conditioner or raising the snow dump.|$|R
40|$|The zinc {{present in}} the dead <b>tank</b> <b>wash</b> water of plating {{industry}} is of about 300 ppm approximately. The aim of the experiment was to reduce the zinc content in the effluent. Treatment by ion exchange produces reusable water. Generally dead <b>tank</b> <b>wash</b> water contains about 1 % of the plating bath concentration. If this water is sent as waste the zinc present will be left unused and it pollutes the environment, so the recovery of zinc from dead <b>tank</b> <b>wash</b> water is more important. For this process the synthetic ion exchange resin Amberlite (IR- 120) was used and the resin was regenerated using acid as regenerant. Mass transfer coefficient has been derived for adsorption and desorption, adsorption mass transfer coefficient has been calculated and breakthrough curve have been drawn for experimental values. The result shows that the zinc - recovery process is feasible and effective in ion exchange process...|$|R

50|$|Aboard Valour {{the three}} pairs of port and {{starboard}} fuel tanks (#'s 4, 5 & 17) were connected by cross-connect lines equipped with isolation valves. The #12 port and starboard <b>wash</b> water <b>tanks</b> were similarly arranged, {{with the addition of}} a smaller secondary cross-over line. These valves were required, by regulation, to be kept closed when underway. Nonetheless, the #5 port and starboard fuel tanks (which were feeding the day tank for the main engines) were left open, and this was a standard practice. During the post-accident dives, it was discovered that the isolation valve between the #4 port and starboard fuel tanks was also left open. In addition, it's probable (but unconfirmed) that the isolation valve on the secondary cross-connect line between the <b>wash</b> water <b>tanks</b> was also left open. The valves are kept closed to prevent hydrostatic balancing between the tanks and to minimize free surface effect, both of which are detrimental to a vessel's stability.|$|R
