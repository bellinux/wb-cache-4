5|$|A new <b>wooden</b> <b>door</b> was {{installed}} {{during the reign}} of al-Hakim in 1009. In 1125, al-Amir installed a new wooden mihrab. An additional dome was constructed {{during the reign of}} al-Hafiz li-Din Allah. He additionally ordered the creation of a fourth arcade around the courtyard and had a porch built on the western end of the sahn.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} floor of the home the rooms remain much the same as they were when Glidden lived in the house. An {{original}} multi-paneled <b>wooden</b> <b>door</b> remains at the entry from the porch to the central hall. The door, however, was altered, having glass panels installed to admit more light. The staircase is also original and its newel posts resemble those found in the Isaac and Harriet Ellwood House, another Haish designed home, and the Gurler House, whose architect is unknown though it was quite possibly Haish, both in DeKalb.|$|E
5|$|The spiral {{staircase}} {{to the second}} floor is original. The floor continues the two-room design, and the roof, largely a post-war replacement with only a few surviving medieval timbers, is intended to resemble the original medieval design. The fireplace and windows are original, as probably is the 14th-century <b>wooden</b> <b>door</b> to the floor. Both the wall between the two rooms, and its stone doorway, were built in the 18th century. The room contains a display {{on the history of the}} tower, and some of the original wooden foundations of the building.|$|E

5|$|The mosque was {{expanded}} during {{the rule of}} the caliph al-Aziz (975–996). According to al-Mufaddal, he ordered the restoration of portions of the mosque and had the ceiling raised by one cubit. The next Fatimid caliph, al-Hakim, would continue to renovate the mosque, providing a new <b>wooden</b> <b>door</b> in 1010. However, al-Hakim's reign saw the completion of the al-Hakim Mosque, and al-Azhar lost its status as Cairo's primary congregational mosque. In May 1009 the al-Hakim Mosque became the sole location for the caliph's sermons; prior to this, al-Hakim would rotate where the Friday sermon was held. Following al-Hakim's reign, al-Azhar was restored by al-Mustanṣir. Additions and renovations were carried during the reign of the remaining Fatimid caliphs.|$|E
5|$|A {{bank and}} ditch {{enclosure}} {{was a simple}} form of defence, and when found without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enhanced {{by the addition of}} a stone curtain wall. Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a <b>wooden</b> <b>door.</b> This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor– to make it harder to throw objects in– and to change the entrance from ground floor to first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls. Castles were not just defensive sites but also enhanced a lord's control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area, and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.|$|E

25|$|The first temples {{were mostly}} mud, brick, and marble {{structures}} on stone foundations. The columns and superstructure (entablature) were <b>wooden,</b> <b>door</b> openings and antae were protected with wooden planks. The mud brick walls were often reinforced by wooden posts, in {{a type of}} half-timbered technique. The elements of this simple and clearly structured wooden architecture produced all the important design principles that were to determine the development of Greek temples for centuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{root cellar}} is promarily {{constructed}} of field stone and mortar, with a wood shingled gable roof on top. Access into the cellar is an inclined double wooden cellar {{door at the}} surface, down a set of stairs, and through a second <b>wooden</b> <b>door</b> {{at the bottom of}} the stairs. The cellar has a round air vent on one side and a square screened hole on the other, providing air movement into the cellar.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} DIN {{doors are}} defined in DIN 18101 (published 1955-07, 1985-01, 2014-08). The door sizes are also {{given in the}} construction standard for <b>wooden</b> <b>door</b> panels (DIN 68706-1). The DIN commission was also responsible for the harmonized European standard DIN EN 14351-1 for exterior doors and DIN EN 14351-2 for interior doors (published 2006-07, 2010-08), which defines the requirements for the CE marking giving standard sizes by examples in the appendix.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} chapels, {{dedicated}} to the four evangelical saints, two of minor dimensions (probably the older confessionals) and two {{on the side of}} the epistle. Both series of chapels had rounded niches, with Tuscan pilasters, with the last two covered in gold-leaf retables. Likewise they are surmounted by three rectangulartribunas guarded by wooden balusters. On the epistle side, the pulpit, of turned, square wood balusters, is accessible from a <b>wooden</b> <b>door</b> and its covered in a decorated canopy.|$|E
25|$|Paneled <b>wooden</b> <b>doors</b> open into an anteroom, {{from which}} another set, flanked by single <b>wooden</b> <b>doors</b> that {{correspond}} to the side aisles, lead to the sanctuary.

25|$|The {{entrance}} to the ossuary used to be closed with a grill and a <b>wooden</b> <b>door,</b> which were destroyed by vandals who also destroyed several wooden coffins and stole some skulls and other bones. As a result, the portal was walled up in 1990. Thanks to this, the ossuary was saved from the flood which struck Olomouc in 1997. The entrance was reopened in 1998 to assess the range of necessary repairs and {{to stop the spread}} of mould, and was then walled up again.|$|E
25|$|A simple cornice {{marks the}} {{roofline}} around the entire building, with modillions {{in the end}} gables. On the front side, the central bay projects to form {{the base of the}} steeple. All three bays on the front elevation have a red paneled double <b>wooden</b> <b>door</b> surrounded by fluted pilasters with a projecting cornice on top. Above each one on the second story is a window topped with semicircular fanlight. At the attic is a decorative circular light. This is echoed by a round-arched louvered vent {{on each side of the}} steeple.|$|E
25|$|The nave is roofed by {{a series}} of crossed vaults. It is divided by an {{intricate}} wooden separation into two sections: the one in front reserved for men and the rear reserved for women. Each section has two ranks of natural wooden benches and its own thick <b>wooden</b> <b>door.</b> The wooden divider is a piece of delicate art and we know from the inscription commemorating its consecration that it was the work of a skilled artisan from Damietta, Egypt, a city still known today for its excellent wood artisans.|$|E
