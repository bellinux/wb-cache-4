5|$|The victory <b>was</b> <b>Michael</b> Schumacher's {{fifth of}} the season, his fourth at the circuit, and the result meant that he {{extended}} his lead in the Drivers' Championship to twenty-two points in front Coulthard, with Häkkinen a further two points behind.

Benetton, on 18 points, pushed their rivals Williams down to fourth place, with nine races of the season remaining. 100,000 people attended the race.|$|E
5|$|Efforts to {{establish}} a national archive began in 1971, when a Committee on the Preservation of Public Records was established by Guze’ Cassar Pullicino. One year later, in 1972, a section of Malta's public records at Casa Leoni was opened up {{to the public and}} research facilities were provided for the public's use. Initially under the oversight of Malta's Ministry for Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, the Archives moved to the Grandmaster's Palace, the home of the House of Representatives of Malta, within a few months. At that point, the government official in charge of the Archives <b>was</b> <b>Michael</b> Ellul.|$|E

5|$|Salo and Alesi {{became the}} first drivers to make {{scheduled}} pit stops on lap 16. Coulthard made a pit stop one lap later to remove the debris from his radiator and rejoined in sixth. Button became the race's fifth retirement because of an engine failure on lap 19. Michael Schumacher continued to set consecutive fastest laps, as he built an 8.8-second gap to Barrichello by his first pit stop on lap 24. Barrichello took over the lead for one lap before his pit stop on the following lap handing it back to Michael Schumacher. By the end of lap 26, all of the leading drivers on two-stop strategies had taken their pit stops. The race order <b>was</b> <b>Michael</b> Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, Herbert, Verstappen, Villeneuve, Häkkinen, Wurz, Irvine, Zonta, Fisichella, Salo, Gené, Ralf Schumacher, Mazzacane, Alesi and Trulli.|$|E
5|$|The next NASA {{astronaut}} {{to stay on}} Mir <b>was</b> <b>Michael</b> Foale. Foale and Russian {{mission specialist}} Elena Kondakova boarded Mir from Atlantis on mission STS-84. The STS-84 crew transferred 249 items between the two spacecraft, along with water, experiment samples, supplies and hardware. One of the first items transferred to Mir was an Elektron oxygen-generating unit. Atlantis was stopped three times while backing away during the undocking sequence on May 21. The aim was to collect data from a European sensor device designed for future rendezvous of ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) with the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|Zemeckis and Gale {{wrote the}} script after Gale mused upon {{whether he would}} have befriended his father if they had {{attended}} school together. Various film studios rejected the script until the financial success of Zemeckis' Romancing the Stone. Zemeckis approached Steven Spielberg, who agreed to produce the project at Amblin Entertainment, with Universal Pictures as distributor. The first choice {{for the role of}} Marty McFly <b>was</b> <b>Michael</b> J. Fox. However, he was busy filming his television series Family Ties and the show's producers would not allow him to star in the film. Consequently, Eric Stoltz was cast in the role. During filming, Stoltz and the filmmakers decided that the role was miscast, and Fox was again approached for the part. Now with more flexibility in his schedule and the blessing of his show's producers, Fox managed to work out a timetable in which he could give enough time and commitment to both.|$|E

5|$|Broccoli and Saltzman {{tried to}} {{convince}} Sean Connery to return as James Bond, but he declined. At the same time United Artists approached both Batman actor Adam West and Burt Reynolds. Reynolds told the studios that Bond should be played by an Englishman and turned the offer down. Among the actors to test for the part of Bond were Julian Glover, John Gavin, Jeremy Brett, Simon Oates, John Ronane, and William Gaunt. The main frontrunner for the role <b>was</b> <b>Michael</b> Billington. United Artists was still pushing to cast an American to play Bond but producer Albert R. Broccoli insisted that the part should be played by a British actor and put forward Roger Moore. After Moore was chosen, Billington remained {{on the top of}} the list in the event that Moore would decline to come back for the next film. Billington ultimately played a brief role in the pre-credit sequence of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Moore, who had been considered by the producers before both Dr. No and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was ultimately cast. He tried not to imitate either Connery's or his own prior performance as Simon Templar in The Saint, and Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay into Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted approach to Bond.|$|E
5|$|In the {{scenario}} of the British war effort {{and the threat}} from the militant movement in India, {{it was a major}} factor for the passage of the Defence of India Act 1915. Among the strongest proponents of the act <b>was</b> <b>Michael</b> O'Dwyer, then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, and this was largely due to the Ghadarite movement. It was also a factor that guided British political concessions and Whitehall's India Policy during and after World War I, including the passage of Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917. The events of the conspiracy during World War I, the presence of Pratap's Kabul mission in Afghanistan and its possible links to the Soviet Union, and a still-active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal (as well as worsening civil unrest throughout India) led to the appointment of a Sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sidney Rowlatt, an English judge. It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal. On the recommendations of the committee, the Rowlatt Act, an extension of the Defence of India Act 1915, was enforced in India.|$|E
5|$|Six of the 12 {{films have}} been adapted into novels—Friday the 13th 1 – 3, Jason Lives, Jason X, and Freddy vs. Jason—with Friday the 13th Part 3 being adapted twice. The first novel <b>was</b> <b>Michael</b> Avallone's 1982 {{adaptation}} of Friday the 13th Part 3; Avallone had previously adapted Beneath the Planet of the Apes and Shock Treatment. The author {{chose to use}} an alternate ending, one that was filmed for Part 3 but never used, as the conclusion for his adaptation. In the alternate ending, Chris, {{who is in a}} canoe, hears her boyfriend Rick's voice and immediately runs back to the house. When she opens the door, Jason is standing there with a machete and decapitates her. The next book was not published until 1986, when Simon Hawke adapted Jason Lives. Hawke would also adapt the first three films into novels, and his adaptation of the original Friday the 13th was published in 1987, with novelizations of Part 2 and 3 both being published in 1988. Hawke's first adaptation, Jason Lives, introduced the character of Elias Voorhees, Jason's father, who was supposed to appear in the film before being cut by the studio. The book explains how Elias has Jason's body buried, instead of the planned cremation, after his death in The Final Chapter.|$|E
