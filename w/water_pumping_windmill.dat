For a given application of the wind machine,the aerodynamic design of rotor involves optimising the rotor and its components to produce maximum power co-efficient, which is the ratio of the actual rotor output to the energy available in the wind for a given rotor area.

40|$|Utilisation of {{wind power}} through {{windmills}} and wind electronic generators has a vast scope {{in the development}} of the arid and semi-arid areas in India. Direct water pumping windmills can make a substantial contribution in supplying water for domestic purposes, live stock and minor irrigation in many villages of Rajasthan. The WP- 2 type of <b>water</b> <b>pumping</b> <b>windmill</b> designed and developed in the National Aeronautical Laboratory, Bangalore, is useful in regions of low and moderate wind speeds. The average wind speed at most cf the places in Rajasthan during the summer months, which are the windiest, varies from 12 to 18 km. p. h. and the windmill gives its optimum output in this range of wind speeds. The wind speed data available for five stations in Rajasthan have been analysed and the monthly quantities of water that can be pumped by a WP- 2 windmill through a height of 10 metres have been worked out for these stations. It is seen that the WP- 2 windmill can pump about 15, 000 gal. of water per day through a height of 10 metres under favourable wind speeds during summer months. The economics of operation of WP- 2 windmills at these places has also been studied. 13; An examination of the monthly quantities of water pumped against the monthly rainfall shows that a t all places studied the water pumped is a maximum during the summer months, i. e., from April to July when water is needed most. 13; A study of the characteristics of wind electric generators of different capacities ranging from 1 kW to 25 kW. in relation to the wind regime in Rajasthan shows that wind electric generators in the range of 2 - 5 kW are comparatively economical...|$|E

40|$|Five topics {{concerning}} {{the use of}} wind power by the Kansas crude oil production industry are explored: (l) the Kansas wind resource; (2) methods of oil production; (3) energy requirements of the oil industry; (4) wind power options; and (5) economics of those options. Wind power {{is found to be}} an economical energy alternative which could {{have a significant impact on}} 0; 1 industry energy requirements. Most of Kansas enjoys winds which average above 12 mi/hr, a value of wind speed for which wind machines are attractive. Furthermore. there is good correlation between areas of high wind and oil production. Two methods of wind power utilization are investigated: direct mechanical pumping and parallel electrical generation. <b>Water</b> <b>pumping</b> <b>windmills</b> should be able to produce up to 65 barrels of fluid per day from wells 1000 feet deep. Very preliminary results indicate the mechanical WECS could easily be economical with a 10 year life if propane is displaced. Parallel electrical generation may be used at nearly any electrified lease. it is the easiest method to implement and has no effect on oil production. In many cases parallel generating wind machines should be economical with a 10 year life.

40|$|Tamil Nadu {{state had}} 719 MW of {{windfarm}} capacity by September 1998 {{out of the}} countryâ€™s total figure of 992 MW, while Andhra Pradesh had 58 MW installed capacity. 1995 - 96 saw a boom when 282 MW windfarms were set up in Tamil Nadu and the capacity in Andhra Pradesh increased by 39 MW. Subsequently, there was a steady decline in the windfarm development in both the states. This case study attempts to trace {{the reasons for the}} boom and the factors that have contributed to the slump in windfarm development in these two states. The role of institutions in determining the effectiveness of national and regional public sector initiatives to promote and disseminate wind energy in the two states is discussed. The study has also looked into the financial, technical, transaction and institutional barriers, which inhibit the diffusion of wind energy in the states. It is suggested in the paper that for rapid growth of wind energy development in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, important measures are needed, which include creation of wind fund, establishment of co-operative windfarms, setting up of wind estates, linking generation to incentives for optimum production, promotion of reliable <b>water</b> <b>pumping</b> <b>windmills</b> and wind battery chargers for small-scale applications. The results of the case study may be used to improve public policy intervention in disseminating wind energy in India. It may also be relevant to multilateral and bilateral aid agencies in their projects and/or programmes to promote cost-effective wind energy technology dissemination in developing countries...|$|R

5000|$|The House in the Clouds is a {{water tower}} at Thorpeness, Suffolk, UK. It {{was built in}} 1923 to receive <b>water</b> <b>pumped</b> from Thorpeness <b>Windmill</b> and was {{designed}} to improve the looks of the water tower, disguising its tank {{with the appearance of}} a weatherboarded building more in keeping with Thorpeness's mock-Tudor and Jacobean style, except seeming to float above the trees. The original capacity of the water tank was 50000 imp gal but during the Second World War, the House in the Clouds was hit by gunfire from anti-aircraft guns based at Thorpeness. The water tank was repaired using its own steel, which resulted in a reduced capacity of 30000 imp gal. In 1977 the water tower was made redundant by a mains water supply to the village, and additional living space was created. In 1979 the main water tank was removed to fully convert the building into a house.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Presently, {{engine cooling}} pump {{is driven by}} toothed belt. Therefore, the pump speed is {{dependent}} on engine speed which varies their output. At normal engine operating conditions (Higher RPM and low load, Higher RPM and high load), mechanical <b>water</b> <b>pumps</b> in existing engines are inevitably oversized and so {{the use of an}} electric <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> together with state-of-the-art thermal management of the combustion engine has measurable advantages. Demand-driven cooling, particularly in the cold-start phase, saves fuel (approx 3 percent) and leads to a corresponding reduction in emissions. The lack of dependence on a mechanical drive also results in considerable flexibility in component packaging within the engine compartment.
