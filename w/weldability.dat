5|$|Niobium is an {{effective}} microalloying element for steel, within which it forms niobium carbide and niobium nitride. These compounds improve the grain refining, and retard recrystallization and precipitation hardening. These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, formability, and <b>weldability.</b> Within microalloyed stainless steels, the niobium content is a small (less than 0.1%) but important addition to {{high strength low alloy}} steels that are widely used structurally in modern automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the <b>weldability</b> of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum is also {{valued in}} steel alloys for its high {{corrosion}} resistance and <b>weldability.</b> Molybdenum contributes corrosion resistance to type-300 stainless steels (specifically type-316) and especially {{so in the}} so-called superaustenitic stainless steels (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO or 1925hMo). Molybdenum increases lattice strain, thus increasing the energy required to dissolve iron atoms from the surface. Molybdenum {{is also used to}} enhance the corrosion resistance of ferritic (for example grade 444) and martensitic (for example 1.4122 and 1.4418) stainless steels.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, <b>weldability,</b> availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological <b>weldability</b> for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|E
25|$|HY-80 {{is a low}} carbon, {{low alloy}} steel with nickel, {{chromium}} and molybdenum (Ni-Cr-Mo) as alloying elements. It has excellent <b>weldability</b> and notch toughness along with good ductility even in welded sections. Their strength and toughness develops during manufacture by a heat-treatment process of quenching and tempering.|$|E
25|$|The density {{decreases}} up to a comonomer {{share of}} 10% {{because of the}} disturbed crystal formation. With higher proportions it approaches to the one of polyvinyl acetate (1.17 g/cm3). Due to decreasing crystallinity ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are getting softer with increasing comonomer content. The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene): weather resistance, adhesiveness and <b>weldability</b> rise with comonomer content, while the chemical resistance decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: stress cracking resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield stress and heat resistance decrease. With a very high proportion of comonomers (about 50%) rubbery thermoplastics are produced (thermoplastic elastomers).|$|E
2500|$|For this {{equation}} the <b>weldability</b> {{based on a}} range of CE values can be defined as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|In welding, {{equivalent}} {{carbon content}} (C.E) {{is used to}} understand how the different alloying elements affect hardness of the steel being welded. This is then directly related to hydrogen-induced cold cracking, which is the most common weld defect for steel, thus it is most commonly used to determine <b>weldability.</b> Higher concentrations of carbon and other alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, silicon, molybdenum, vanadium, copper, and nickel tend to increase hardness and decrease <b>weldability.</b> Each of these elements tends to influence the hardness and <b>weldability</b> of the steel to different magnitudes, however, making a method of comparison necessary to judge the difference in hardness between two alloys made of different alloying elements. There are two commonly used formulas for calculating the equivalent carbon content. One is from the American Welding Society (AWS) and recommended for structural steels and the other is the formula based on the International Institute of Welding (IIW).|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{production}} of a good quality weld can not only depend on the welding methods, but also <b>weldability</b> of base materials. Therefore, the evaluation of <b>weldability</b> is of critical importance before welding operation (see Rheological <b>Weldability)</b> for plastics.|$|E
50|$|The <b>weldability,</b> {{also known}} as joinability, of a {{material}} refers to its ability to be welded. Many metals and thermoplastics can be welded, but some are easier to weld than others (see Rheological <b>weldability).</b> A material's <b>weldability</b> is {{used to determine the}} welding process and to compare the final weld quality to other materials.|$|E
50|$|Rheological <b>weldability</b> (RW) is {{proposed}} {{as a criterion}} to determine reliably <b>weldability</b> of thermoplastics. In a practical manner, RW of thermoplastics is assessed through their rheological properties: viscosity (η) and activation energy (Ea). According to RW criterion, the lower the viscosity (η) during welding process and the lower the absolute value of activation energy (|Ea|), the better the <b>weldability.</b>|$|E
50|$|Consequently, for the {{evaluation}} of <b>weldability,</b> viscosity of molten thermoplastics (polymer melts) have {{to be taken into account}} since welding is a rapid process. It can be said that the lower the viscosity during welding process (at welding temperature and pressure), the better the <b>weldability.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Inconel 718: Gamma double prime {{strengthened}} {{with good}} <b>weldability</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>weldability</b> of steel, {{with regard}} to hydrogen-induced cold cracking, is {{inversely}} proportional to the hardenability of the steel, which measures the ease of forming martensite during heat treatment. The hardenability of steel depends on its chemical composition, with greater quantities of carbon and other alloying elements resulting in a higher hardenability and thus a lower <b>weldability.</b> In {{order to be able}} to judge alloys made up of many distinct materials, a measure known as the equivalent carbon content is used to compare the relative weldabilities of different alloys by comparing their properties to a plain carbon steel. The effect on <b>weldability</b> of elements like chromium and vanadium, while not as great as carbon, is more significant than that of copper and nickel, for example. As the equivalent carbon content rises, the <b>weldability</b> of the alloy decreases.|$|E
5000|$|Inconel 625: Acid resistant, good <b>weldability.</b> The LCF {{version is}} {{typically}} used in bellows.|$|E
5000|$|For this {{equation}} the <b>weldability</b> {{based on a}} range of CE values can be defined as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|Type 304L - {{same as the}} 304 grade but lower {{carbon content}} to {{increase}} <b>weldability.</b> Is slightly weaker than 304.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the metal's high Niobium (Nb) {{levels as}} well as its {{exposure}} to harsh environments and high temperatures, there was concern about the <b>weldability</b> of Inconel 625. Studies were therefore conducted to test the metal's <b>weldability,</b> tensile strength and creep resistance, and Inconel 625 was found to be an ideal choice for welding. Other well known names for Inconel 625 are Haynes 625, Nickelvac 625, Nicrofer 6020, Altemp 625 and Chronic 625 ...|$|E
50|$|Type 301 - highly ductile, for formed products. Also hardens rapidly during {{mechanical}} working. Good <b>weldability.</b> Better {{wear resistance}} and fatigue strength than 304.|$|E

5000|$|... |Ea| {{values of}} such {{polymers}} as PVC {{decrease with increasing}} shear rate (...) , implying better <b>weldability</b> where shear rate (movement) are higher within all cross-section of welding region.|$|E
50|$|Grade 5052-H32 is much {{stronger}} than 3003 while still maintaining good formability. It maintains high corrosion resistance and <b>weldability.</b> Common applications include electronic chassis, tanks, and pressure vessels.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Weldability</b> {{is often}} hard to define quantitatively, so most {{standards}} define it qualitatively. For instance the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines <b>weldability</b> in ISO standard 581-1980 as: [...] "Metallic material {{is considered to}} be susceptible to welding to an established extent with given processes and for given purposes when welding provides metal integrity by a corresponding technological process for welded parts to meet technical requirements as to their own qualities as well as to their influence on a structure they form." [...] Other welding organizations define it similarly.|$|E
50|$|For steel {{there are}} three major failure modes by which <b>weldability</b> can be measured: hydrogen-induced cold cracking, {{lamellar}} tearing, and spot-weld peeling. The most prominent of these is hydrogen induced cold cracking.|$|E
5000|$|Recalling that {{viscosity}} (η) decreases {{with increasing}} temperature (T) and shear rate (...) for most polymer melts, <b>weldability</b> is better where temperature and shear rate (movement) are higher within all cross-section of welding region.|$|E
5000|$|Grade 6: {{contains}} 5% aluminium and 2.5% tin. It is {{also known}} as Ti-5Al-2.5Sn. This alloy is used in airframes and jet engines due to its good <b>weldability,</b> stability and strength at elevated temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Grade 304 is {{the most}} common of the three grades. It offers good {{corrosion}} resistance while maintaining formability and <b>weldability.</b> Available finishes are #2B, #3, and #4. Grade 303 is not available in sheet form.|$|E
5000|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steels {{are the most}} common choice for high vacuum and ultra-high vacuum systems. Not all alloys are suitable; e.g. the free-machining 303 steel contains sulfur, which tends to outgas. Alloys with good <b>weldability</b> under argon arc welding are usually chosen.|$|E
50|$|Fusion welded {{aluminum}} primary {{structures in}} airplanes are virtually nonexistent, because the high-strength alloys utilized have low <b>weldability</b> and low weld-joint efficiencies. Some of the alloys, such as 2024-T4, also have their corrosion resistance lowered in the heat-affected zone if {{left in the}} as-welded condition.|$|E
50|$|As {{the carbon}} {{percentage}} content rises, steel {{has the ability}} to become harder and stronger through heat treating; however, it becomes less ductile. Regardless of the heat treatment, a higher carbon content reduces <b>weldability.</b> In carbon steels, the higher carbon content lowers the melting point.|$|E
50|$|If {{steel is}} not {{properly}} deoxidized, {{it will have}} reduced various properties such as tensile strength, ductility, toughness, <b>weldability,</b> polishability, and machinability. This is due to forming non-metallic inclusions and gas pores, bubbles of gas that get trapped during the solidification process of steel.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{low carbon}} content {{maraging}} steels have good machinability. Prior to aging, {{they may also be}} cold rolled to as much as 90% without cracking. Maraging steels offer good <b>weldability,</b> but must be aged afterward to restore the original properties to the heat affected zone.|$|E
50|$|HY-80 {{is a low}} carbon, {{low alloy}} steel with nickel, {{chromium}} and molybdenum (Ni-Cr-Mo) as alloying elements. It has excellent <b>weldability</b> and notch toughness along with good ductility even in welded sections. Their strength and toughness develops during manufacture by a heat-treatment process of quenching and tempering.|$|E
50|$|Another {{limitation}} to <b>weldability</b> may be {{the change}} of material properties induced by the welding process, such as a high speed of cooling. As detailed discussion of this matter exceeds {{the scope of this}} article, the reader is recommended to seek more information in the appropriate literature.|$|E
