2500|$|With medical attention, {{radiation}} exposure is survivable to a 200 rems acute dose exposure. If {{a group of}} people <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a 50 to 59 rems acute (within 24 hours) radiation dose, none will get radiation sickness. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 60 to 180 rems, 50% will become sick with radiation poisoning. If medically treated, all of the 60–180 rems group will survive. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 200 to 450 rems, most if not all of the group will become sick. 50% of the 200–450 rems group will die within two to four weeks, even with medical attention. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 460 to 600 rems, 100% of the group will get radiation poisoning. 50% of the 460–600 rems group will die within one to three weeks. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 600 to 1000 rems, 50% will die in one to three weeks. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 1,000 to 5,000 rems, 100% of the group will die within 2 weeks. At 5,000 rems, 100% of the group will die within 2 days[...]|$|R

5|$|On 26 March 1957, {{motor car}} 66.03 and center car 18821 were damaged {{in a fire}} at Kristiansand. Both were retired due to the large damages. On 8 June 1969, a unit derailed at between Eidanger and Oklungen, but was restored. Motor car 66.02 <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a fire on 4 June 1975, and again on 28 December 1976. After the latter incident, the car was retired.|$|E
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that over 22 million workers <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> dangerous noise levels, and 10 million <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> solvents that could potentially cause hearing loss every year, with an unknown number <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> other ototoxic chemicals.|$|R
50|$|Testosterone {{levels in}} males {{have been shown}} to vary {{according}} to the ovulating state of females. Males who <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> scents of ovulating women recorded a higher testosterone level than males who <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> scents of nonovulating women. <b>Being</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> female ovulating cues may increase testosterone, which in turn may increase males' motivation to engage in, and initiate, sexual behaviour. Ultimately, these higher levels of testosterone may increase the reproductive success of males <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> female ovulation cues.|$|R

5|$|Agamemnons first {{target service}} took place before her {{modifications}} were completed. On 19 March 1921, she <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> {{a cloud of}} poisonous gas {{to determine the effect}} of gas on a battleship. It was found that gas could penetrate the ship via her various openings, but the ship had not been sealed against gas before the trial and no accurate results applicable to a commissioned battleship could be obtained. On 21 September, she was subjected to machine-gun fire by strafing aircraft. These trials showed that such strafing could harass a battleship, but could not impair her fighting or steaming capabilities, and helped to determine protection for bridge personnel.|$|E
5|$|Although the Chinese {{were unable}} to exploit the {{breakthrough}} in the UN lines, {{the weakness of the}} ROK II Corps on the Eighth Army's right flank <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the Chinese commanders. During the planning of the Chinese Second Phase Campaign, Peng would again focus his attention towards the ROK II Corps at the Eighth Army's right flank, resulting in a disastrous defeat for the UN forces at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River. To commemorate this battle as China's official entry into the Korean War, October 25 is currently the War to Resist America and Aid Korea Memorial Day in China.|$|E

5|$|Americium often enters {{landfills}} from discarded smoke detectors. The rules {{associated with}} the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old David Hahn extracted the americium from about 100 smoke detectors {{in an attempt to}} build a breeder nuclear reactor. There have been a few cases of exposure to americium, the worst case being that of chemical operations technician Harold McCluskey, who at the age of 64 <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 {{as a result of an}} explosion in his lab. McCluskey died at the age of 75 of unrelated pre-existing disease.|$|E
5|$|Born in North Carolina, Coffin <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> and {{developed}} an opposition to slavery as a child. He followed {{his family and}} immigrated to Indiana in 1826, following the slaveholders' persecution of Quakers. In Indiana he became a local business leader, merchant, and farmer. Coffin's accumulated wealth from his business interests allowed {{him to become a}} major investor in the Richmond, Indiana, branch of the Second State Bank of Indiana, where he served as director in the 1830s. Coffin's financial position and standing in the community also provided the mead to supply food, clothing, and transportation for the Underground Railroad operations in the region.|$|E

5|$|Lacking artistic {{stimulation}} in Morgantown, Lazzell {{journeyed to}} Provincetown, Massachusetts, in 1915. Already an artists' colony, Provincetown was {{a mecca for}} European artists escaping World War I. Stella Johnson and Jessie Fremont Herring, two of Lazzell's companions from her tour in Italy, were already in Provincetown and Lazzell stayed with Johnson's mother. Lazzell took a morning outdoor painting class that summer from Charles Webster Hawthorne at his Cape Cod School of Art where she <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Fauvist color and technique. She returned to Morgantown in the autumn and held an exhibition in her studio that October.|$|E
5|$|Mahendra's {{passion for}} cinema {{prompted}} him to leave for India and join the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune in 1966. He had to take up cinematography as he could not gain admissions to other disciplines. At the institute he <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> world cinema as he got an opportunity to watch films made by François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, both associated with the French New Wave movement. In 1969, Mahendra graduated from the institute with a gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Stratton <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> {{multiple}} influences {{through his}} life. As an undergraduate student of Howison, {{he learned about}} philosophy and religion. At Yale and later at Wundt's lab, he switched to experimental psychology and studied perception, memory and emotion. His exposure to World War I, serving in the Army then, focused his mind on issues {{of war and peace}} and international relations. Stratton's later work reflected these elements of his experience. He was also a scholar of the classics and translated some Greek philosophers.|$|E

50|$|Speakers of Turkish and Azerbaijani can {{communicate}} with each other but both languages have substantial variation and mutual intelligibility is enhanced when Azerbaijani speakers have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Turkish television (e.g. Turkish soap operas) or when Turkish speakers have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Azerbaijani pop music. Most Azerbaijanis, however, <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Turkish television, and, therefore, they tend to be better able to understand Turkish than vice versa. There are also numerous Turkish schools in the Republic of Azerbaijan that give students more exposure to Turkish than the average Turkish-speaker has to Azerbaijani.|$|R
5|$|The Algodones Dunes, which border old Cahuilla shorelines, {{were formed}} by sand blown from Lake Cahuilla. This theory was first {{formulated}} in 1923. The process occurred either {{immediately after the}} lake reached modern highstands, or during earlier higher stands. Most likely, sand was transported to the dune field during times where the lake receded and its bed <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> wind. Various stages of Lake Cahuilla may correspond to waves of migrating dunes.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{then moved}} to London to board with his older brother John, a 19-year-old {{apprentice}} builder. This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was ready to take him on as an apprentice surveyor. While in London, Alfred attended lectures and read books at the London Mechanics Institute. Here he <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer Robert Owen and of Thomas Paine. He left London in 1837 to live with William and work as his apprentice for six years.|$|E
5|$|Whatever {{the exact}} {{course of events}} of the early 9th century, {{the failure of the}} Slavic attack on Patras {{consolidated}} the recently re-established Byzantine control over the Peloponnese, and Nikephoros I's policies led to the successful re-Christianization and Hellenization of the peninsula. The defence of Patras also secured the Byzantine Empire's main maritime road of communication with Italy and the West, as it opened up the shorter route through the Corinthian Gulf, instead of the longer, more dangerous route around the Peloponnese that <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Arab attacks.|$|E

50|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2000 used geographic census data and outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration data {{to examine the}} disparities of NO2 air pollution across the United States. The study found that there is disproportional disparities {{in terms of both}} race and socioeconomic groups. The people of color <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 4.6 ppb more than average NO2 concentrations than white people. Those who live in below poverty level <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 1.2 ppb more. Lower-income Caucasians <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 3.4 ppb higher NO2 concentrations than the higher-income Caucasians. The study also reports disproportional disparities of NO2 concentration exposure by education level; those who without high school education are more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> higher concentrations. Association between NO2 exposure and cancer development has been found in many studies.|$|R
