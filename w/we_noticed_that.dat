500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Party" [...] was {{directed}} by Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson. As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm just doing a cameo. We just had a really good time [...] While filming the video, <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> we were doing certain stuff that we used to do as kids. We kinda felt a little goofy for a second, so we stopped. But we just had a good time.". Model Shaun Ross also makes a cameo in the video.|$|E
2500|$|On November 9, 2012 {{the band}} {{announced}} on their official site, {{that they are}} parting ways with singer Heidi Parviainen, along with drummer Heikki Saari and guitarist Kasperi Heikkinen. Parviainen announced via Facebook, saying [...] "Early this year <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> we had {{reached the point where}} we didn't have much to offer to each other any more, and my own ambitions and Amberian Dawn's goals weren't coinciding any longer." [...] It was also revealed that ex-members Joonas Pykälä-aho (drums) and Emil [...] "Emppu" [...] Pohjalainen (guitar) would be replacing the two departing band members.|$|E
2500|$|Gary Vincent, an {{employee}} of Funspot and now curator of the Classic Arcade Museum, {{came up with the}} idea of collecting the games in one spot to give visitors to the arcade a different way of understanding the games. Opened in the late 1990s, the American Classic Arcade Museum collects games built no later than 1987. When asked why 1987 was picked as the cut off date, Vincent replied, [...] "We set the cut off date as 1987 because that is pretty much about the time when <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> the videogame industry was starting to change. Instead of having fantasy-based games, puzzle-based, space shoot 'em up games or whatever, it seemed to switch over to more of what I call 'kick-punch-shoot' games." ...|$|E

60|$|Here <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{the sides}} of the tunnel were covered with quaint sculptures, mostly of mailed figures driving in chariots. One, which was {{exceedingly}} beautiful, represented a whole battle scene with a convoy of captives being marched off in the distance.|$|E

60|$|We {{climbed on}} to the dais by some marble steps, and sat {{ourselves}} down in four curious chairs of metal that {{were more or less}} copied from that which served Oro as a throne; at least the arms ended in graven heads of snakes. These chairs were so comfortable that I concluded the seats were fixed on springs, also <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> they were beautifully polished.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> above Dubuque {{the water}} of the Mississippi was olive-green--rich and {{beautiful}} and semi-transparent, with the sun on it. Of course the water was nowhere as clear or of as fine a complexion as it is in some other seasons of the year; for now it was at flood stage, and therefore dimmed and blurred by the mud manufactured from caving banks.|$|E

60|$|By {{the time}} we had {{returned}} we had taken quite a long walk, but we were glad of it, for the exercise tranquilized us both. On our way back <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> a road which seemed to come up from below us joined the one {{we were on a}} short distance from the place where our accident occurred. This, probably, was the lower road which had been spoken of when we changed horses.|$|E
60|$|He clasped {{the dear}} little terrier in his arms; and then <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{there was a}} sausage {{adhering}} to its tail. The pantaloon said we must have put in a sausage too many, but Joey said the machine had not worked quite smoothly and that he feared this sausage was the dog's bark, which distressed David, for he saw how awkward it must be to a dog to have its bark outside, and we were considering {{what should be done}} when the dog closed the discussion by swallowing the sausage.|$|E
6000|$|This {{habit of}} growth should, no doubt, be encouraged; and {{they should not be}} trimmed up, as some {{travelling}} practitioners have advised. In 1802 {{there was not a single}} fruit-tree in Chatham, the next town to Orleans, on the south; and the old account of Orleans says: [...] "Fruit-trees cannot be made to grow within a mile of the ocean. Even those which are placed at a greater distance are injured by the east winds; and, after violent storms in the spring, a saltish taste is perceptible on their bark." [...] <b>We</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> they were often covered with a yellow lichen-like rust, the Parmelia parietina.|$|E

"As {{we passed}} the two-story little frame house {{occupied}} by the American Club, <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> the balcony had been decorated all around with wreaths of evergreens and flowers, and the flag was flying from the pole on the roof. Stanzey, the consul, and Arkright, a gold-mine owner, were smoking on the balcony. Me and Liverpool waved our dirty hands toward 'em and smiled real society smiles; but they turned their backs to us and went on talking. And we had played whist once with the two of 'em up {{to the time when}} Liverpool held all thirteen trumps for four hands in succession. It was some holiday, we knew; but we didn't know the day nor the year.|$|E
60|$|In Frankfort {{everybody}} wears clean clothes, and I think <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{this strange}} {{thing was the}} case in Hamburg, too, and in the villages along the road. Even in the narrowest and poorest and most ancient quarters of Frankfort neat and clean clothes were the rule. The little children of both sexes were nearly always nice enough to take into a body's lap. And as for the uniforms of the soldiers, they were newness and brightness carried to perfection. One could never detect a smirch or a grain of dust upon them. The street-car conductors and drivers wore pretty uniforms which seemed to be just out of the bandbox, and their manners were as fine as their clothes.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> in {{the jewelry}} stores {{they had some}} of the {{articles}} marked [...] "gold" [...] and some labeled [...] "imitation." [...] We wondered at this extravagance of honesty and inquired into the matter. We were informed that inasmuch as most people are not able to tell false gold from the genuine article, the government compels jewelers to have their gold work assayed and stamped officially according to its fineness and their imitation work duly labeled with the sign of its falsity. They told us the jewelers would not dare to violate this law, and that whatever a stranger bought in one of their stores might be depended upon as being strictly what it was represented to be. Verily, a wonderful land is France! ...|$|E

60|$|CHARTERIS. Not at the Ibsen club, {{quite the}} contrary. After all, {{what can we}} do? You know what breaks up most clubs for men and women. There's a quarrel--a scandal--cherchez la femme--always {{a woman at the}} bottom of it. Well, we knew this when we founded the club; but <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> the woman at the bottom of it was always a womanly woman. The unwomanly women who work for their living and know {{how to take care of}} {{themselves}} never give any trouble. So we simply said we wouldn't have any womanly women; and when one gets smuggled in she has to take care not to behave in a womanly way. We get on all right. (He rises.)

6000|$|Here {{we had to}} {{dismount}} to descend a most fearful precipitous path consisting of boulders piled together in the wildest confusion, {{from one to another}} of which we had to jump, driving the horses before us. Half-way down we off-saddled to rest ourselves, and as we did so <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> the gall was running from one of the horses' noses. We knew too well what was the matter, and so left him there to die during the night. This horse was by far the finest we had with us, and his owner used to boast that the poor beast had often carried him, a heavy man, from his house to Pretoria, a distance of nearly ninety miles, in one day. He was also a [...] "salted" [...] horse. It is a curious thing that the sickness generally kills the best horses first.|$|E

"Ay, we {{saw their}} marks, no doubt," [...] said the guide, {{knocking}} the ashes {{out of his}} pipe, and raising himself from his reclining posture {{to that of a}} tailor, the more conveniently to recharge that beloved implement. [...] "Ay, we saw their marks, and they was by no means pleasant to look on. After we had landed above the p'int, as Francois told ye, Dick Prince and me went up one o' the gullies, an' then gettin' on one o' them flat places that run along the face of all the mountains hereabouts, we pushed straight up the river. We had not gone far when, on turnin' a p'int, we both clapped eyes at the same moment on the most ill-lookin' blackguard of a wolf I ever saw. Up went both our guns at once, and I believe we were very near puttin' a bullet in each of his eyes, when <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> these same eyes were not bookin' at us, but starin', most awful earnest like, up a gully in the mountains; so we looked up, an', sure enough, there we saw a deer on the mountain-top, tossin' its head and snuffin' round to see that the coast was clear before it came down to the water. <b>We</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> a regular beaten deer-track passed down this gully, and master wolf, who knowed the walk very well, was on the lookout for his dinner; so we waited quiet till the deer came down, an' Dick put a bullet in its heart, an' I put one into the wolf's head, so they both tumbled down the cliffs together. The shot made another deer, that we had not seen, start off into the river; but before it got a few yards from the shore, Dick loaded again and put a bullet into its head too, an' it was washed ashore at the p'int below us.|$|E
