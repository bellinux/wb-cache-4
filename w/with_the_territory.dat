5|$|There was a {{long string}} of {{conflicts}} with Tibet over territories in the Tarim Basin between 670–692, and in 763 the Tibetans even captured the capital of China, Chang'an, for fifteen days during the An Shi Rebellion. In fact, it was during this rebellion that the Tang withdrew its western garrisons stationed in what is now Gansu and Qinghai, which the Tibetans then occupied along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> of what is now Xinjiang. Hostilities between the Tang and Tibet continued until they signed a formal peace treaty in 821. The terms of this treaty, including the fixed borders between the two countries, are recorded in a bilingual inscription on a stone pillar outside the Jokhang temple in Lhasa.|$|E
5|$|Defending a {{breeding}} territory is fairly common among male dragonflies, especially among species that congregate around ponds in large numbers. The territory contains desirable {{features such as}} a sunlit stretch of shallow water, a special plant species, or a particular substrate necessary for egg-laying. The territory may be small or large, depending on its quality, the time of day, {{and the number of}} competitors, and may be held for a few minutes or several hours. Some dragonflies signal ownership with striking colours on the face, abdomen, legs, or wings. The common whitetail (Plathemis lydia) dashes towards an intruder holding its white abdomen aloft like a flag. Other dragonflies engage in aerial dogfights or high-speed chases. A female must mate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> holder before laying her eggs. There is also conflict between the males and females. Females may sometimes be harassed by males {{to the extent that it}} affects their normal activities including foraging and in some dimorphic species females have evolved multiple forms with some forms appearing deceptively like males. In some species females have evolved behavioural responses such as feigning death to escape the attention of males.|$|E

25|$|North Borneo {{produced}} timber for export; {{along with}} agriculture this industry remained the main economic resource for the British in Borneo. As {{the population was}} too small to effectively serve the economy, the British sponsored various migration schemes for Chinese workers from Hong Kong and China to work in the European plantations, and for Japanese immigrants to participate in the economic activities of North Borneo. The starting of World War II with the arrival of Japanese forces however brought an end to protectorate administration, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> placed under a military administration and then designated as a crown colony.|$|E

25|$|When the Roman {{garrison}} left around 410, {{the various}} parts of Britain were left to govern and defend themselves.

Powys roughly coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> of the Celtic Cornovii tribe whose civitas or administrative centre during the Roman period was at Viroconium. Gwynedd, {{at the height of}} its power, extended as far east as the Dee estuary. Gradually, from the 5th century onwards, pagan tribes from the east, including the Angles and Saxons, conquered eastern and southern Britain, which later became England.|$|E

25|$|Territorial {{males of}} this species perch upon {{prominent}} vegetation at high elevation (1500m or higher) and chase intruders away.

Intruding visitors are common among this species, as males jockey for the best territory. On occasion, the intruder engages in aerial combat <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> owner over possession of the perch, a tree or bush. The two males will clash wings and spiral vertically upwards engaging in an aerial contest for the territory.|$|E
25|$|When Congress {{passed the}} Second Organic Act in 1912, Alaska was reorganized, and renamed the Territory of Alaska. By 1916, its {{population}} was about 58,000. James Wickersham, a Delegate to Congress, introduced Alaska's first statehood bill, but it failed {{due to the}} small population and lack of interest from Alaskans. Even President Warren G. Harding's visit in 1923 could not create widespread interest in statehood. Under {{the conditions of the}} Second Organic Act, Alaska had been split into four divisions. The most populous of the divisions, whose capital was Juneau, wondered if it could become a separate state from the other three.
