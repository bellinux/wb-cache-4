40|$|Background Women with 21 -hydroxylase {{deficiency}} present much {{variability in}} external genitalia virilization, {{even among those}} with similar impairments of 21 -hydroxylase (21 OH) activity. Objective To evaluate {{if the number of}} CAG (nCAG) repeats of the androgen receptor gene influences the degree of external genitalia virilization in women with CYP 21 A 2 mutations, grouped according to impairment of 21 OH activity. Patients The nCAG was determined in 106 congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) patients and in 302 controls. The patients were divided, according to their CYP 21 A 2 genotypes, into Groups A and B, which confer total and severe impairment of 21 OH activity, respectively. Methods The inactivation pattern of the X-chromosome was studied through genomic DNA digestion with Hpa II. The CAG repeat region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analysed by GeneScan. Results The nCAG and the frequency of severe skewed X-inactivation did not differ between normal women and patients. The nCAG median in genotype A was 20. 7 (IQR 2. 3) for Prader I + II, 22. 5 (3. 6) for Prader III and 21 (2. 9) for Prader IV + V (P 0. 05). A significant difference was found regarding the nCAG median in patients presenting Prader III from genotypes A and B. Conclusions <b>We</b> <b>observed</b> <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> in the degree of external genitalia virilization in both CYP 21 A 2 genotypes, and we showed that the CAG repeats of the androgen receptor gene influences this phenotypic variability...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Pneumococcal disease {{constitutes}} a major global health problem. Adults aged 50 {{years or older}} and younger adults with specific chronic health conditions are at particular risk for invasive pneumococcal disease, associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. In Europe, two types of vaccines are used in adults for pneumococcal immunization: pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV 23) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 13). The {{aim of this study}} is to provide an overview and compare the national guidelines for pneumococcal immunization for adults in Europe. METHODS In November 2016, national guidelines on pneumococcal vaccination for adults of 27 European countries were obtained by Google search, the website of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and contacting public health officials. In our analysis we distinguished between age-based and risk-based guidelines. RESULTS <b>We</b> <b>observed</b> <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> regarding age, risk groups, vaccine type and use of boosters. In age-based guidelines, vaccination is mostly recommended in adults aged 65 years or older, using PPV 23. A booster is generally not recommended. An upper age limit for vaccination is reported in two countries. In the immunocompromised population, vaccination with both vaccines and administration of a booster is mostly recommended. In the population with chronical health conditions, there is more heterogeneity according vaccine type, sequence and administration of boosters. Asplenia is the only comorbidity for which all countries recommend vaccination. CONCLUSIONS There is great variability in European pneumococcal vaccination guidelines regarding age, risk groups, vaccine type and boosters. For ease of implementation, European unification of the guidelines is needed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Plant-soil {{feedbacks}} (PSFs) are {{mechanisms by}} which plants alter the structure, chemistry, and biology of soil which then influences plant survival. Over time, PSFs {{have the ability to}} alter forest composition because the soil biota associated with adult trees differentially affects the establishment of conspecific or heterospecific seedlings. Greenhouse studies have shown that host-preferred pathogens act as a type of PSF that can potentially infect different species of seedlings. We conducted a field study over two summers comparing the survival of four seedling species underneath three adult tree species in a temperate forest. We applied fungicide to the soil surrounding half of the seedlings in order to exclude the most common fungal pathogens. We found that initial stem height and soil moisture significantly influenced seedling survival for all species. Possibly due to unusually extreme drought, <b>we</b> <b>observed</b> <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> in survival rates, and so we found no statistically significant differences between our test and control groups. However, we were able to quantify the effects of the pathogenic fungal community associated with specific tree canopies on the survival of conspecific and heterospecific seedlings. We found indications of conspecific seedling-canopy species interaction which affected survival, although this varied among species. Prunus serotina seedlings treated with fungicide experienced a ~ 92 % increase over the average survival of seedlings under control conditions. Comparisons found that under control conditions, all seedling species were negatively affected by the fungal communities associated with P. serotina canopies except for E. umbellata. Conversely, fungal communities associated with A. saccharum canopies tended to have the weakest affect for all native species. Overall, we found that 2 seedlings treated with fungicide tended to experience increased survival, though the relative degree of effects varied. In summary we did not observe strong changes in PSF effects between treatments of conspecific canopies on seedlings survival but we were able to detect differential survival probabilities due to the fungal community which may contribute to the coexistence of these species...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{envelope}} {{models are}} widely used to forecast potential {{effects of climate change}} on species distributions. A key issue in climate envelope modeling is the selection of predictor variables that most directly influence species. To determine whether model performance and spatial predictions were related to the selection of predictor variables, we compared models using bioclimate variables with models constructed from monthly climate data for twelve terrestrial vertebrate species in the southeastern USA using two different algorithms (random forests or generalized linear models), and two model selection techniques (using uncorrelated predictors or a subset of user-defined biologically relevant predictor variables). There were no differences in performance between models created with bioclimate or monthly variables, but one metric of model performance was significantly greater using the random forest algorithm compared with generalized linear models. Spatial predictions between maps using bioclimate and monthly variables were very consistent using the random forest algorithm with uncorrelated predictors, whereas <b>we</b> <b>observed</b> <b>greater</b> <b>variability</b> in predictions using generalized linear models...|$|R
40|$|Pop-out search {{implies that}} the target is always the first item selected, {{no matter how many}} {{distractors}} are presented. However, increasing evidence indicates that search is not entirely independent of display density even for pop-out targets: search is slower with sparse (few distractors) than with dense displays (many distractors). Despite its significance, the cause of this anomaly remains unclear. We investigated several mechanisms that could slow down search for pop-out targets. Consistent with the assumption that pop-out targets frequently fail to pop out in sparse displays, <b>we</b> <b>observed</b> <b>greater</b> <b>variability</b> of search duration for sparse displays relative to dense. Computational modeling of the response time distributions also supported the view that pop-out targets fail to pop out in sparse displays. Our findings strongly question the classical assumption that early processing of pop-out targets is independent of the distractors. Rather, the density of distractors critically influences whether or not a stimulus pops out. These results call for new, more reliable measures of pop-out search and potentially a reinterpretation of studies that used relatively sparse displays...|$|R

40|$|Background: Alzheimer's {{disease is}} the most common {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease. In recent years, numerous progresses in the discovery of novel Alzheimer's disease molecular biomarkers in brain as well as in biological fluids have been made. Among them, those involving lipid metabolism are emerging as potential candidates. In particular, an accumulation of neutral lipids was recently found by us in skin fibroblasts from Alzheimer's disease patients. Therefore, with the aim to assess whether peripheral alterations in cholesterol homeostasis might be relevant in Alzheimer's disease development and progression, in the present study we analyzed lipid metabolism in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Alzheimer's disease patients and from their first-degree relatives. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 93 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and from 91 of their first-degree relatives. As controls we utilized 57, cognitively normal, over- 65 year-old volunteers and 113 blood donors aged 21 - 66 years, respectively. Data are reported as mean +/- standard error. Statistical calculations were performed using the statistical analysis software Origin 8. 0 version. Data analysis was done using the Student t-test and the Pearson test. Results: Data reported here show high neutral lipid levels and increased ACAT- 1 protein in about 85 % of peripheral blood mononuclear cells freshly isolated (ex vivo) from patients with probable sporadic Alzheimer's disease compared to about 7 % of cognitively normal age-matched controls. A significant reduction in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in plasma from Alzheimer's disease blood samples was also observed. Additionally, correlation analyses reveal a negative correlation between high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and cognitive capacity, as determined by Mini Mental State Examination, as well as between high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and neutral lipid accumulation. <b>We</b> <b>observed</b> <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> in the neutral lipid-peripheral blood mononuclear cells data and in plasma lipid analysis of the subjects enrolled as Alzheimer's disease-first-degree relatives. However, about 30 % of them tend to display a peripheral metabolic cholesterol pattern similar to that exhibited by Alzheimer's disease patients. Conclusion: We suggest that neutral lipid-peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma high density lipoprotein-cholesterol determinations might be of interest to outline a distinctive metabolic profile applying to both Alzheimer's disease patients and asymptomatic subjects at higher risk of disease...|$|E

40|$|We have {{determined}} the Wadati–Benioff Zone seismicity and {{state of stress}} of the subducting Nazca slab beneath central and southern Peru using data from three recently deployed local seismic networks. Our relocated hypocenters are consistent with a flat slab geometry that is shallowest near the Nazca Ridge, and changes from steep to normal without tearing to the south. These locations also indicate numerous abrupt along-strike changes in seismicity, most notably an absence of seismicity along the projected location of subducting Nazca Ridge. This stands {{in stark contrast to}} the very high seismicity observed along the Juan Fernandez ridge beneath central Chile where, a similar flat slab geometry is <b>observed.</b> <b>We</b> interpret this as indicative of an absence of water in the mantle beneath the overthickened crust of the Nazca Ridge.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{provides}} a synthesis on socioeconomic inequalities in cancer incidence, mortality and survival across countries and within countries, with particular {{focus on the}} Italian context; the paper also describes the underlying mechanisms documented for cancer incidence, and reports some remarks on policies to tackle inequalities. From a worldwide perspective, the burden of cancer appears to be particularly increasing in developing countries, where many cancers with a poor prognosis (liver, stomach and oesophagus) are much more common than in richer countries. As {{in the case of}} incidence and mortality, also in cancer survival <b>we</b> <b>observe</b> a <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> across countries. Different studies have suggested a possible impact of health care on the social gradients in cancer survival, even in countries with a National Health System providing equitable access to care. In developed countries, there is increasing awareness of social inequalities as an important public health issue; as a consequence, there is a variety of strategies and policies being implemented throughout Europe. However, recent reviews emphasize that present knowledge on effectiveness of policies and interventions on health inequalities is not sufficient to offer a robust and evidence-based guide to the choice and design of interventions, and that more evaluation studies are needed. The large disparities in health that we can measure within and between countries represent a challenge to the world; social health inequalities are avoidable, and their reduction therefore represents an achievable goal and an ethical imperative. </p...|$|R
40|$|Two {{recently}} developed methods for quantifying tropospheric ozone abundances based on Aura data, the Trajectoryenhanced Tropospheric Ozone Residual (TTOR) and an assimilation of Aura data into Goddard Earth Observing System Version 4 (ASM), are compared to ozone measurements from ozonesonde data collected in April-May 2006 during the INTEX Ozonesonde Network Study 2006 (IONS 06) campaign. Both techniques use Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) observations. Statistics on column ozone amounts for both products are presented. In general, the assimilation compares better to sonde integrated ozone to 200 hPa (28. 6 % difference for TTOR versus 2. 7 % difference for ASM), and both products are biased low. To better characterize {{the performance of}} ASM, ozone profiles based on the assimilation are compared to those from ozonesondes.

40|$|AbstractEarth has likely cooled {{by several}} hundred degrees over its history, which has {{probably}} affected subduction dynamics and associated magmatism. Today, {{the process of}} compositional buoyancy driven upwelling, and subsequent underplating, of subducted materials (commonly referred to as “relamination”) is thought {{to play a role}} in the formation of continental crust. Given that Archean continental crust formation is best explained by the involvement of mafic material, we investigate the feasibility of mafic crust relamination under a wide range of conditions applicable to modern and early Earth subduction zones, to assess if such a process might have been viable in an early Earth setting. Our numerical parametric study illustrates that the hotter, thicker-crust conditions of the early Earth favour the upward relamination of mafic subducting crust. The amount of relaminating subducting crust is observed to vary significantly, with subduction convergence rate having the strongest control on the volume of relaminated material. Indeed, removal of the entire mafic crust from the subducting slab is possible for slow subduction (∼ 2 cm/yr) under Archean conditions. <b>We</b> also <b>observe</b> <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> in the depth at which this separation occurs (80 – 120 km), with events corresponding to shallower detachment being more voluminous, and that relaminating material has to remain metastably buoyant until this separation depth, which is supported by geological, geophysical and geodynamical observations. Furthermore, this relamination behaviour is commonly episodic with a typical repeat time of approximately 10 Myrs, similar to timescales of episodicity observed in the Archean rock record. We demonstrate that this relamination process can result in the heating of considerable quantities of mafic material (to temperatures in excess of 900 [*]°C), which is then emplaced below the over-riding lithosphere. As such, our results have implications for Archean subduction zone magmatism, for continental crust formation in the early Earth, and provide a novel explanation for the secular evolution of continental crust...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} Ca ions to inhibit Ca {{channels}} presents {{one of the}} most intriguing problems in membrane biophysics. Because of this negative feedback, Ca channels can regulate the current that flows through them. The kinetics of the channels depend on voltage, and, because the voltage controls the current, a strong interaction exists between voltage dependence and Ca dependence. In addition to this interaction, the proximity of pores and the local concentration of ions also determine how effectively the Ca ions influence channel kinetics. The present article proposes a model that incorporates voltage-dependent kinetics, current-dependent kinetics, and channel clustering. We have based the model on previous voltage-clamp data and on Ca and Ba action currents measured during the action potential in beating heart cells. In general <b>we</b> <b>observe</b> that <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> exists in channel kinetics from patch to patch: Ba or Ca currents have low or high amplitudes and slow or fast kinetics during essentially the same voltage regime, either applied step-protocols or spontaneous cell action potentials. To explain this variability, we have postulated that Ca channels interact through shared ions. The model we propose expands on our previous model for Ba currents. We use the same voltage-dependent rate constants for the Ca currents that we did for the Ba currents. However, we vary the current-dependent rate constants according to the species of the conducting ion. The model reproduces the main features of our data, and we use it to predict Ca channel kinetics under physiological conditions.

Our choice of this methodological approach was based upon both the theoretical developments in the area of Program Evaluation and the availability of relevant information. We used three different set of data to estimate the Propensity Scores which allowed us to analyze the question on how sensitive Program impact estimates are to different propensity score specifications? This question has not been addressed by the previous literature. Our results indicate first, that Program impact on earnings were statistically significant for young males and adult females. This result was not sensitive to the number of nearest neighbors. Second, the estimated Program impact on employment was statistically significant for adult females only. Again the result was not sensitive to the number of nearest neighbors. Third, impact estimates on earnings and employment for the groups with statistically significant results were not sensitive to the different sources of information used to estimate the propensity scores.

Diving patterns appeared to fit these predictions more in 1996 than 1995 suggesting that diving behavior was affected more by annual changes in environmental conditions than by physiological constraints on breathing and diving as predicted by optimal breathing models. Activity patterns at inland nest sites were monitored on a near-daily basis during three breeding seasons to assess the relationships between activity and both weather and date. Daily activity was highly variable within and among sites and years and I <b>observed</b> <b>greater</b> <b>variability</b> in activity levels than has been previously reported for this species. Activity varied greatly during all portions of the breeding season and analyses revealed that weather and date variates explained little of the variability present. It also appeare...|$|R
40|$|This thesis will {{investigate}} {{the patterns of}} initialed-nicknaming in English. I shall claim that this process {{is another example of}} phonology depending on orthography. Nicknames have a very wide range of forms and derivations. Even dismissing those nicknames which are not formed from the subject's original name, <b>we</b> <b>observe</b> <b>great</b> diversity: Jonathans throughout the English-speaking world commonly go by Jack, John, Johnny, Jacko, Jackie, John-John, J, or J 1. Initialed nicknames like J or JJ and their derivation and distribution will be the focus of this thesis, followed by a brief outlining {{of work to be done}} on these forms' treatment in Optimality Theory...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{conditions}} that lead to Stroop interference for a meaningless linguistic label. Tiffany's cognitive model of drug abuse implies that individuals will respond more slowly to drug-related words compared to neutral words in an emotional Stroop task, because the former have many automatic associations (e. g. positive expectancies). To examine this proposal, we trained participants to associate a meaningless label with either one other word or several other words and examined the induced Stroop interference for these meaningless labels. In two experiments, and contrary to expectations from Tiffany's work, <b>we</b> <b>observed</b> <b>greatest</b> Stroop interference for the meaningless label with just one association. These results are {{discussed in terms of}} associative learning theory...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the neural mechanisms involved in vocal emotion processing, {{the current study}} employed {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to investigate the neural structures engaged in processing acoustic cues to infer emotional meaning. Two critical acoustic cues – pitch and speech rate – were systematically manipulated and presented in a discrimination task. Results confirmed that a bilateral network constituting frontal and temporal regions is engaged when discriminating vocal emotion expressions; however, <b>we</b> <b>observed</b> <b>greater</b> sensitivity to pitch cues in the right mid superior temporal gyrus/sulcus (STG/STS), whereas activation in both left and right mid STG/STS was observed for speech rate processing.
