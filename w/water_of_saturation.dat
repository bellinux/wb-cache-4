30|$|Among {{the above}} items, a {{discussion}} was previously presented on porosity, {{and except for}} <b>water</b> <b>saturation,</b> product <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> by porosity, and product <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> by absolute value of the logarithm of porosity, other items returned totally unacceptable differentiations.|$|R
30|$|In this study, after {{ordering}} {{data from}} high {{to low and}} determining the frequency of each datum, the cumulative frequency diagram <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> was drawn (Fig.  8) then communities and threshold limit anomalies from matrix were determined by trending straight lines to points series and specifying failure point on the line (Fig.  9). The matrix means that the amount <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> related to rock matrix and anomalies means the amount <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> resulted from the secondary geological processes.|$|R
30|$|Due to its nature, product <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> by {{porosity}} cannot {{serve as}} a good expression for differentiating the rock types in the model, because the cases with low porosity possess high water saturation and those with high porosity hold low water saturation (as an example, a point with porosity and <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> 4 % and 60 %, respectively, and another point with porosity and <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> 12 % and 20 %, respectively) fall within the same range when {{the result of this}} relationship is concerned.|$|R

40|$|This work {{consists}} {{in studying the}} effect <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> aggregates {{on the development of}} shrinkage and the potential cracking risk of early age ordinary concrete. Different concretes were obtained from a given concrete mixture by changing only the initial degree <b>of</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> limestone aggregates. Three degrees <b>of</b> <b>saturation</b> were studied, namely: 0 % (dry aggregates), 50 % (partially saturated aggregates) and 100 % (saturated aggregates). From the experimental results, the early age behaviour and the mechanical properties of the concrete strongly depend on the <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> aggregates. A relative cracking risk was estimated from a stress-based approach and experimentally assessed parameters. The potential risk of cracking of these different concretes was shown to be different. Even if the total water content is kept constant, the water remaining in the cement paste actually depends on the initial <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> aggregates. The early age behaviour of concrete and the development of its early age properties depend on the amount <b>of</b> added <b>water</b> during the mixing. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

30|$|The {{variation}} in the batches indicates that the electrical conductivity generally decreases after the batch reactions. It shows increasing trend in batch 8 and 11. This {{may be due to}} the regeneration process during the flow <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> the available exchange sites.

40|$|Abstract: Theoretical study <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> in {{oil-water}} {{fluid flow}} area is meaningful to the high, stabilized {{production and the}} improvement of ultimate recovery. At present, there is no theoretical description <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> in the oil and water seepage process. Combining relational expression between relative permeability and water saturation with the fractional flow equation produces an expression <b>of</b> <b>water</b> cut changed by water saturation; Introducing Taylor expansion and Vieta's theorem to the differentiation <b>of</b> <b>water</b> cut gives a theoretical expression <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> in oil-water fluid flow area; Possibility of continuity <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> is also discussed. Applying this formula to certain sandstone reservoir in China achieves good results: In oil-water seepage process, water saturation is continuous in certain interval and the values of it are double in another interval; the oil recovery can be re-calculated and improved with this new equation. This new water saturation equation lays a base {{for the study of}} residual oil mobility and enhanced oil recovery...|$|R
30|$|Both of the {{remaining}} expressions mentioned (<b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> and product <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> by absolute value of the logarithm of porosity) exhibited identical differentiation of the tested samples. As such, since the logarithm of porosity represents no particular physical concept and {{considering the fact that}} its application is basically associated with no improvement in sample differentiation, but rather adds the associated uncertainty with the porosity to that <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation,</b> as a final conclusion, residual water saturation was selected to serve as reservoir rock differentiation parameter.|$|R

30|$|In this method, rock typing {{is based}} on the form of {{capillary}} pressure curves and, particularly, corresponding residual water saturations. Considering the form of the capillary pressure curves, one can see that the curves exhibit mostly similar trends and curvatures in different ranges <b>of</b> initial <b>water</b> <b>saturation.</b> Considering this behavior {{and the fact that the}} samples in the same class should be close to one another in terms <b>of</b> residual <b>water</b> <b>saturation,</b> the rock differentiation parameter should be selected in such a way that capillary pressure curves in each rock type are close to one another in terms <b>of</b> residual <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> the samples, that is, residual <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> samples serve as an important criterion considered for selecting the differentiation parameter.|$|R
40|$|Estimation {{of dynamic}} petrophysical {{properties}} of water-bearing sands invaded with oil-base mud from {{the interpretation of}} multiple borehole geophysical measurements Zoya Heidari 1 and Carlos Torres-Verdín 2 Nonmiscible fluid displacement without salt exchange takes place when oil-base mud (OBM) invades connate water-saturated rocks. This is a favorable condition for the estimation of dynamic petrophysical properties, including saturation-dependent capillary pressure. We developed and successfully tested a new method to estimate porosity, fluid saturation, per-meability, capillary pressure, and relative permeability of water-bearing sands invaded with OBM from multiple borehole geophysical measurements. The estimation method simulates the process of mud-filtrate invasion to calculate the correspond-ing radial distribution <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation.</b> Porosity, permeabil-ity, capillary pressure, and relative permeability are iteratively adjusted in the simulation of invasion until density, photoelectric factor, neutron porosity, and apparent resistivity logs are accu-rately reproduced with numerical simulations that honor the postinvasion radial distribution <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation.</b> Examples <b>of</b> application include oil- and gas-bearing reservoirs that exhi-bit a complete capillary fluid transition between water at the bot-tom and hydrocarbon at irreducible water saturation at the top. We show that the estimated dynamic petrophysical properties in the water-bearing portion of the reservoir are in agreement with vertical variations <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> above the free water-hydrocarbon contact, thereby validating our estimation method. Additionally, it is shown that the radial distribution <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> inferred from apparent resistivity and nuclear logs {{can be used for}} fluid-substitution analysis of acoustic compres-sional and shear logs...|$|R
40|$|NoA novel {{technique}} for the laboratory {{characterization of the}} frequency-dependent acoustic surface admittance of partly saturated samples of sands is presented. The technique {{is based on a}} standard laboratory de-watering apparatus coupled with a standard acoustic impedance tube. The dependence of the surface admittance on the degree <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> is investigated for two samples of sand with widely different flow resistivities. It is shown that a relatively small change (e. g., from 0 % to 11 % by volume) in the degree <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> can result in a much larger change (e. g., twofold) in the acoustic surface admittance. An empirical relationship is found between the peaks observed in the real part of admittance spectra for the low flow resistivity sand and the degree <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation.</b> The data are compared with predictions of two widely used ground impedance models: a semiempirical single parameter model and a two parameter model. A modified two-parameter version of a single-parameter model is found to give comparable fit to the two-parameter model. However, neither model provides an accurate fit...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNatural soils {{of various}} types have {{different}} electrical properties due to the composition, structure, water content, and temperature. In order to investigate the electrical properties of lateritic soil, electrical conductivity experiments have been conducted on a self-developed testing device. Test {{results show that the}} electrical conductivity of laterite increases with the increase <b>of</b> <b>water</b> content, degree <b>of</b> <b>saturation</b> and dry density. When the water content is below the optimum water content, the electrical conductivity of soils increases nonlinearly and the variation rate increases dramatically. However, when the <b>water</b> content, degree <b>of</b> <b>saturation,</b> or dry density increases to a certain value, the electrical conductivity tends to be a constant. In addition, soil electrical conductivity increases with the increase of temperature, and it is observed that the electrical conductivity decreases with the increase of the number of wetting–drying cycles...|$|R
30|$|The {{simultaneous}} equations above can {{be solved}} by iteration method. We can get the distribution <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> in the reservoir, liquid rate, pressure, oil rate along wellbore, and watercut in the wellhead at any time.|$|R
30|$|This {{also can}} explain the {{phenomena}} mentioned by Zhong et al. (2007). Zhong et al. report that some wells with the thief zone characteristics do not have water breakthrough at early stage; however, when injection pressure decrease at the late stage, injection rate of these wells is higher than before. Obviously, this cannot be simply explained by absolute permeability heterogeneity. This {{can be explained by}} variant <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation.</b> Due to slow change <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> changes, water saturation in high permeable channels increase gradually. After long time, once the high mobility channel forms, the injection pressure decreases, and injection rate is also higher than before.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There {{is seldom}} {{research}} on describing the changing trend of water-oil displacement efficiency based {{on time and}} water drive frontal position. In previous study, our team gave the theoretical expression <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> in oil-water fluid flow area based on time and distance. In this work, we mainly focus on the prediction of water-oil displace-ment efficiency combining the permeability experiment and theoretical expression <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation.</b> This new expres-sion gives the micro water-oil displacement efficiency in different frontal position and time. The prediction results show: that the predicting accuracy is high and practicable, and we can shorten the time and cost of experiment and this predic-tion method is meaningful in guiding the actual oilfield development...|$|R
40|$|Prediction <b>of</b> {{formation}} <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> can {{be achieved}} through capillary pressure data in saturation-height modeling. The LSMPQS (Level Set Method Progressive Quasi Static) method is the newest numerical simulation which is basically utilized for determining critical curvatures for drainage and imbibitions curves; consequently {{it can be used}} for studies on saturation history. Thus, the amounts <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturations</b> were obtained by drainage simulation in saturation-height modeling. The saturation results from Indonesian model that is the best traditional log-derived saturation model in tight shaly sandstones were compared with this simulation results.

At {{the end of the}} IWIR process, the maximum water saturation reached is equal to approximately 60  %; this was found to be less with the up- and down-dip 90 ° inclination cases (Cases 2 and 3). However, {{by the end of the}} DWIR process, all three orientations exhibited an irreducible <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> about 10  %.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} tasks in reservoir engineering is characterizing different parameters <b>of</b> the reservoir. <b>Water</b> <b>saturation</b> is a parameter which helps evaluating the volume of hydrocarbon in reservoirs. Determination of this parameter started from 1942 by integrating some well logs in clean sandstones.

To treat the problem <b>of</b> dependency <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> estimation on core analysis in previous works, other scientists proposed using rock physics and arrived at improved models <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> estimation. More recently, interpreters have used seismic attributes to evaluate water saturation values directly or estimating proper rock physical properties such as shale volume which are useful in water saturation estimation process...|$|R
30|$|A single scan {{provides}} every position <b>of</b> <b>saturation</b> at {{a specific}} time. Image processing of the CT data provides values <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>saturation</b> (fraction <b>of</b> the pore volume occupied by water) along the core length.
