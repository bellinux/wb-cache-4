5|$|The {{decision}} to invite Bach {{was made by}} the council on 15 January 1723. The council seemed to have preferred Bach and Graupner because they were invited to show two cantatas each, while other candidates were requested to show only one. Two candidates even had to present their <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> service. Graupner's performance took place on the last Sunday after Epiphany, 17 January 1723. Two days before the event, the town council already agreed to offer him the position.|$|E

If it is against the law, this is one time when the law should be broken.|$|E
5|$|Decay {{is set in}} {{the same}} {{location}} and timeframe as Half-Life. Half-Life takes place at a laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility, situated in a remote desert in New Mexico. In Half-Life, the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter-dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen, allowing the alien creatures of Xen to attack the facility. The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal, ultimately traveling to Xen to do so. Like the previous expansions, Decay shows the story of Half-Life {{from the perspective of a}} different set of protagonists. In Decay, players assume the roles of Colette Green and Gina Cross, two doctors who <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> labs as Freeman, analyzing anomalous materials and specimens retrieved from Xen in prior teleportation experiments. After the experiment that causes the alien invasion takes place, Green and Cross must work with two ranking members of the science team, Dr. Richard Keller and Dr. Rosenberg, to contain and stabilize the deteriorating situation in Black Mesa.|$|E

5|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{questioned}} whether a royal affinity could actually <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as a noble one. It {{has been suggested that}} since the king had to be a lord to his retainers and provide good lordship, but also king to the entire people, a contradiction existed, resulting in a decline in local stability where this occurred. At the same time, even powerful magnates such as Gaunt could cause local dissatisfaction by retaining some and, inevitably, excluding others. On the other hand, it has also been pointed out how, particularly for kings, recruitment into the affinity was a clear promotion which could act as an encouraging loyalty or offered a political amnesty.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} change in the fort's conservation and preservation outlook was its declaration as a Historic Relic under the Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act in 1972. Up to then there had been growing awareness of the significance of the site in terms of the state's colonial heritage. Control of the park was moved to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), and the fort and surrounds became designated as Fort Glanville Conservation Park. The National Estate Grants Program provided funds in 1975 for conservation work; NPWS began this <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year and the caravan park boundary was moved southwards. Though the site had long been neglected, there was minimal permanent damage to its structure. During the 1970s reconstruction, much of the stockade was replaced. The replaced timbers are visibly different as they have shrunk significantly with large gaps that are not evident in the original timber. Adelaide City Council agreed to return the 64-pounder guns and new wheels were made; replacing those rotted over half a century before. In a ceremony on 2 October 1980, the 100th anniversary of the guns first firing, one of the 64-pounders was fired again; later a commemoration plaque was added to the fort's flagpole's base. Shortly after this firing the Fort Glanville Historical Association was formed, and was incorporated in 1981. Fort Glanville was opened for public visitation in 1981.|$|E
5|$|From 1918, Burnet {{attended}} the University of Melbourne, {{where he lived}} in Ormond College on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin's work and {{was influenced by the}} ideas of science and society in the writings of H. G. Wells. He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in the library to feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond's First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing shyness, Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, but he was also dogged by peer pressure to enlist in the military, which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted {{by the end of the}} war. In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest in showing empathy towards them.|$|E

25|$|In the Director's Cut and the Final Cut, {{there is}} a {{sequence}} in which Deckard daydreams about a unicorn; later, he finds an origami unicorn outside his apartment, left there by Gaff, suggesting that Gaff knows about Deckard's dream {{in the same manner}} that Deckard knows about Rachael's implanted memories. Scott confirmed this interpretation was his intent in the unicorn daydream. However, while memory implantation for replicants is established elsewhere in the movie, it is unclear if daydreams <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way.|$|E
25|$|Fuel cells come in many varieties; {{however, they}} all <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> general manner. They {{are made up}} of three {{adjacent}} segments: the anode, the electrolyte, and the cathode. Two chemical reactions occur at the interfaces of the three different segments. The net result of the two reactions is that fuel is consumed, water or carbon dioxide is created, and an electric current is created, which can be used to power electrical devices, normally referred to as the load.|$|E
25|$|Single-elimination {{style or}} {{knock-out}} style are also sometimes used for chess tournaments. In fact, {{the first international}} chess tournament was held in single-elimination style. In single-elimination tournaments, the loser of a game is immediately eliminated from winning the first prize. In most single-elimination chess tournaments {{there is a chance}} for players to compete for positions other than first. Players are normally given seeds based on their rating in order to prevent the highest ranked players from facing each other early in the competition. Double-elimination tournaments <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as single-elimination tournaments except that a player loses eligibility to take first prize after two losses.|$|E

25|$|Ivanov's career, {{in terms}} of his {{background}} and rise through Russia's state structures, has often been compared to Putin's, fueling speculation that Ivanov might run for president in 2008. Three months younger than Putin, Ivanov had been a student contemporary of Putin's in their hometown of Leningrad where both completed competitive specialized secondary education programs (Putin in chemistry, Ivanov in English language) before attending Leningrad State University. Both completed postgraduate studies in counterintelligence; and both joined the foreign intelligence service shortly afterward. However, according to Ivanov's recollections, he did not become acquainted with Putin during their years as students, but rather when both were assigned to <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> foreign intelligence division in Leningrad.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} {{well-known}} experiments in structural geology are those involving orogenic wedges, which are zones in which mountains are built along convergent tectonic plate boundaries. In the analog versions of these experiments, horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop, which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting {{and the growth of}} a critically tapered (all angles remain the same) orogenic wedge. Numerical models <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as these analog models, though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt. This helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of a mountain range. These studies can also give useful information about pathways for metamorphism through pressure, temperature, space, and time.|$|E
25|$|In {{certain areas}} of Jharkhand, poverty and {{consequent}} malnutrition {{have given rise to}} diseases like tuberculosis (TB).

25|$|When Zhang Hua {{recommended}} Chen Shou {{to serve}} as a Gentleman Palace Writer (中書郎), the Ministry of Personnel appointed Chen Shou as the Administrator (太守) of Changguang Commandery (長廣郡) instead on the recommendation of Xun Xu. The Jin Shu mentioned that Xun Xu detested Zhang Hua and disliked Chen Shou for his association with Zhang Hua, so he urged the Ministry of Personnel to reassign Chen Shou to another position. Chen Shou declined the appointment on the grounds that he had to look after his elderly mother. The Huayang Guozhi gave a different account of Chen Shou's relationship with Xun Xu. It stated that Xun Xu and Zhang Hua were very pleased with Chen Shou's Sanguozhi and they remarked that Chen Shou surpassed Ban Gu and Sima Qian. However, later, Xun Xu was displeased by the Wei Shu – one of the three sections in the Sanguozhi – and did not want Chen Shou to <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> office as him, so he had Chen Shou reassigned to be the Administrator of Changguang.|$|E
