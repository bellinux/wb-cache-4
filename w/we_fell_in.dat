25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1807 I was on board of the ship Canton, {{belonging}} to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when <b>we</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in,</b> at sea, near the termination of a very heavy equinoctial gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Pole, in England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from the Canton, which was sent {{to take off the}} English crew, the brig's own boats having been all swept away, and her crew in a state of intoxication. I found onboard of her two Newfoundland pups, male and female, which I saved, and subsequently, on our landing the English crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased these two pups of the English captain for a guinea apiece. Being bound again to sea, I gave the dog pup, which was called Sailor, to Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut pup, which was called Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow's Point. The history which the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had directed his correspondent to select and send him a pair of pups of the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The dog was of a dingy red colour; and the slut black. They were not large; their hair was short, but very thick-coated; they had dew claws. Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most sagacious in every thing, particularly so in all duties connected with duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Merino ram for the dog, {{at the time of the}} Merino fever, when such rams were selling for many hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after; and may still be known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor breed. The slut remained at Sparrows Point till her death, and her progeny were and are still well known, through Patapsco Neck, on the Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer relate most extraordinary instances of the sagacity and performance of both dog and slut, and would refer you to their friends for such particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect with sufficient accuracy to repeat.|$|E
500|$|... "Remember the Time" [...] {{is a new}} jack swing song. The lyrics {{recall a}} {{youthful}} love affair: [...] "Do you remember when <b>we</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love/We were young and innocent then". The song {{is set in the}} key of an original F Minor with Jackson's voice range from Eb3 to C5. The song's tempo is moderate at 116 beats per minute.|$|E
500|$|Bobby Hankinson of Houston Chronicle said [...] "It's fun and summery and it's all capped {{off with}} a confetti slushee attack to the crowd. Loved it."

[...] Brett Berk of Vanity Fair noted that [...] "the lovable dorks sing about being the lovable dorks <b>we</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love with (even if we often no longer {{recognize}} them as such)".|$|E
25|$|I {{resisted}} it completely. I just didn't {{know how}} we could make it last for two hours. But 20th Century Fox was really keen; our producer was really keen. So we thought, OK, we'll write the script. And after three months, <b>we</b> <b>fell</b> madly <b>in</b> love with the script. Unfortunately, Fox did not.|$|R

500|$|Expecting {{to show a}} new {{and more}} mature side visually, TLC were in Los Angeles {{discussing}} about the project when a Matthew Rolston-directed music video for Salt-N-Pepa came on. [...] "We were looking at it and said, 'Whoever did this video has to do the 'Creep' video. <b>We</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love with the way it was shot," [...] Thomas said. Often times, she remembered the video that they were seeing was [...] "Whatta Man", however, during their interview with MTV in 1995, the show cited [...] "None of Your Business", a video which was also done by Rolston and had more visual similarities to the final [...] "Creep" [...] video. Lopes also recalled the moment: [...] "We were very, very adamant about redoing the 'Creep' video because we were coming back out [...] And we were like, 'Look at that video Salt-N-Pepa got. Man, we're going to kick nobody's butts putting these videos out. [...] is budi, [...] is whack, we've got to do it over.'" [...] Their management team then suggested going back to the editing room to find better shots and have the video redone, but group declined and said: [...] "There is no better shot." [...] Initially, TLC reached out to Rolston and set up the third version's shooting in LA.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{performances}} and selection in the episode {{were met with}} mixed response from critics. The original track [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] received general acclaim from critics. Berk praised the performance, and gave it four stars. He opined, [...] "All four stars are for the lyrics [...] in which the lovable dorks sing about being the lovable dorks <b>we</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> love with [...] ". In her review for the episode, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised the song, and called it a [...] "true anthem" [...] that [...] "ends triumphantly". Raymond Flandez of The Wall Street Journal gave a positive review of the song: [...] "The song {{grew out of a}} collaborative brainstorming session that went beyond rhyming dictionaries or first attempts at ditties such as 'Trouty Mouth', 'Big Ass Heart', and 'Hell to the No'." [...] Jarrett Wieselman of the New York Post commended the show for the use of original songs, and wrote [...] "Glee entered uncharted territory last night [...] no, not Kurt's first kiss. I'm talking about New Directions dabbling in, and debuting, their very first original songs. It was as risky for the show as it was for the group since opting to perform wholly new creations would either give them a leg up on the competition or put them six feet under." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle praised the song, and deemed it [...] "fun and summery".|$|E
2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way <b>we</b> <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E

6000|$|Ah, my dear Sir, {{those were}} romantic days, you must remember! Days when men placed the {{possession}} of the woman they loved above every treasure, every consideration upon earth.

5000|$|The band became {{intrigued}} in recording dance-oriented music around 1989-1990, as {{the band}} listened {{to the music of}} Happy Mondays, Spiritualized and The Orb. Furthermore, Haskins had been using drum machines for some time, whereas vocalist Daniel Ash used a $35 drum machine when recording as Tones on Tail in the early 1980s. Ash later recalled that it was primarily listening to the Orb, Orbital and Leftfield that sparked the band's interest in making electronic music: [...] "I started to hear that stuff in the '90s. It completely seduced Love and Rockets. <b>We</b> completely <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> with that attitude toward music. That's why we made Hot Trip to Heaven." ...|$|R
