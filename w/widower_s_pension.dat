40|$|Analyzing event history {{data from}} the 2010 China Family Panel Studies and 13 {{qualitative}} interviews, we examine the complex and gendered relationship between family relations and remarriage in China. Distinct roles are played {{by the presence of}} pre-school, school-age and adult children in configuring the remarriage of women and men after divorce and after widowhood. The remarriage of widows but not divorcées is positively associated with the presence of parents and siblings respectively. Remarriage is more likely in the presence of large extended families. Whereas single and remarried divorcé(e) s equally provide care to their children, such care provision is less likely among remarried than single <b>widow(er)</b> <b>s.</b> Compared with their single counterparts, remarried divorcé(e) <b>s</b> and particularly <b>widow(er)</b> <b>s</b> are less likely to receive care from their children. We underline the importance of considering the “linked lives” of family members and comparing distinct life-course circumstances in the study of remarriage. We demonstrate that remarriage is far from an “individualized” institution, and that the state’s privatization of marriage seems to reinforce the “familialization” of remarriage practices in China...|$|R
40|$|Aims and objectives. To {{evaluate}} a feasible, best practice mental health screening and referral clinical pathway for generalist community nursing care of war veterans and war <b>widow(er)</b> <b>s</b> in Australia. Background. War veterans commonly experience mental health difficulties {{and do not}} always receive required treatment, as can also occur for war <b>widow(er)</b> <b>s.</b> Whenever opportunity arises, such as during community nursing care, {{it is vital to}} identify mental health problems in a health promotion framework. Design. A clinical pathway was developed by literature review and consultation and then trialled and evaluated using mixed methods – quantitative and qualitative. Methods. Community nurses who trialled the pathway completed an evaluation survey and attended focus groups. General practitioners responded to an evaluation survey. Results. Most nurses found the pathway clear and easy to understand but not always easy to use. They emphasised the need to establish trust and rapport with clients prior to implementing the pathway. It was sometimes difficult to ensure effective referral to general practitioners for clients who screened positive for a mental health problem. When referral was accomplished, general practitioners reported adequate and useful information was provided. Some general practitioners also commented on the difficulty of achieving effective communication between general practitioners and nurses. Conclusions. Nurses and some general practitioners found the pathway useful for their practice. They offered several suggestions for improvement by simplifying the trialled pathway and accompanying guidelines and strategies to improve communication between nurses and general practitioners. This study adds understanding of how community nurses might productively screen for mental health difficulties. Relevance to clinical practice. The trialled pathway, which was modified and refined following the study, is an evidence-based resource for community nurses in Australia and similar contexts to guide practise and maximise holistic care for war veterans and war <b>widow(er)</b> <b>s</b> and possibly other client groups. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{main problem}} with China <b>s</b> <b>pension</b> system, the {{inability}} of paying the pensions {{for more and more}} old people, had been supposed to be dealt with by China <b>s</b> <b>pension</b> reform. But can the reform actually reach its goal? The existing literatures had already simulated the proposed reform arrangements and policy options under certainty. 	But the effect of the pension reform in China by its nature is uncertain. The studies on its uncertainty will be more helpful on policy making. Employing a simple but complete model that had been used in simulating the certain results of China <b>s</b> <b>pension</b> reform, this paper presents a method to analyze the uncertainty of the effect of pension reform, to simulate and to compare the potential policy options. 	The uncertainty can come from two main sources: the demographic dynamic and economic development. Demographic dynamics depends on fertility, mortality and migration, while economic development depends on future unemployment, interest rate, GDP growth, inflation, real wage, etc. The uncertainties of all these variables lead to the uncertainty of the pension system. But all these factors are unknown for us. 	This paper gives the method to model the stochastic process of these random variables in term of Markov chain and introduce these variables uncertainties into the simulation model. The simulation can be done with Monte Carlo fashion. Here the method is illustrated by analysis of the uncertainty that comes from GDP growth and inflation, which both cooperate affecting the real wage. In the simple simulation model, the real wage is the key to simulate the uncertainty of the pension system variables and of the economic development. With the stochastic process description of the economic inputs, and the relationship between the economic inputs and the pension system arrangements, the uncertainty of China <b>s</b> <b>pension</b> reform can be simulated. The same work can be done to the demographic dynamic inputs, too. The suggestions on simulating the potential policy options are also given {{at the end of this}} paper. 	The method is presented by using the simple model, but it is not supposed to be used only in this model. Uncertainty exists in the nature of pension system. So it is possible and necessary to apply the uncertainty analysis to all the estimates about the future of China <b>s</b> <b>pension</b> system.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown in {{economic}} research that public pay-as-you-go defined-benefit pension plans penalize those who continue to work beyond a certain age by reducing the present discounted value of future retirement benefits. In discussions on the effectiveness of policies aimed at eliminating this age-dependency in worker retirement decisions, it is often assumed either that the benefits in all future periods have the same weight in the present discounted value or that the discount rate is close to unity due to low real interest rates used in this case. In this paper we show, using the example of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>pension</b> scheme, that discounting plays a crucial role, since the formula for the present discounted value of future retirement benefits is sensitive to the discount rate used.

By analyzing pension plan data from the IRS Form 5500 and finances of the plan s sponsoring employer from COMPUSTAT with a fixed-effects ordinary least squares model and a simultaneous model, we find that a 10 % increase {{in the use of}} defined contribution plans (including 401 (k) plans) reduces employer pension costs per worker by 1. 7 3. 5 %.

There is a clear broad strategy even though not all of the reforms fit obviously within it a generous means-tested system, extensive private provision and a diminished contributory pension. In the long term, this strategy has advantages in terms of containing public sector liabilities, but involves further downgrading the contributory principle. It will also affect the incentive to save for many individuals. Individuals currently on means-tested benefits will be able to keep more of their savings as a result of the reform. But those currently outside the means-tested benefit regime who expect to be brought into it as a result of the reforms will face a diminished incentive to save. ...|$|R
