5|$|Norway Airlines was {{established}} on 2 April 1987 by Kjell Adserø and his holding company Hell Holding, {{along with several}} other investors from Trøndelag—the largest of which was Lyng Industrier. The business model was to operate charter flights from Norway to the Mediterranean; {{eighty percent of the}} market was carried out with foreign airlines and Adserø believed that Norwegians not only <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> Norwegian carrier, but {{would be willing to pay}} more for one. The company had an initial share capital of NOK10 million and established its head office and main base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. Separate companies, organized as kommandittselskap, wer established to own each aircraft and lease them to the airline. The aircraft owner companies paid 28.7 million United States dollars for each Boeing 737-300, which were delivered new from Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Shares in the aircraft owning companies was offered to the public with a four-percent annual return on investment. Part of the investment model was based on tax advantages.|$|E

5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, {{and that the}} authors <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> peace brought about by an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German workers would most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons why {{it would be in}} their best interest to call for an armistice. These reasons were that the citizens, after twenty months of war, would understand that they had been deceived into believing they were taking part in a defensive war; that they would recognize that the German state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; that the German Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} Ubon Air Base in the Ubon Ratchathani Province of eastern Thailand on 1June 1962 and flew its first operational patrol four days later. Facilities at Ubon were initially spartan, and the pilots and ground crew lived in tents. Construction of permanent accommodation began {{under the supervision}} of No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron in September 1962, however, and facilities were later further improved. Despite Malaysia's policy of neutrality in regards the conflict in Southeast Asia, No.79 Squadron operated as a detachment of the RAAF force (No.78 Wing) based at Butterworth throughout its time in Thailand. Aircraft and personnel were regularly transferred between Butterworth and Ubon, and most pilots' nominally six-month-long tours of duty in Thailand were broken into several shorter periods during which they and their aircraft were illegally rotated between the two bases. In March 1963 the Defence Committee, which was the highest decision-making body of the Department of Defence, recommended to Cabinet that No.79 Squadron be withdrawn from Thailand {{on the grounds that the}} British and New Zealand contingents had left the country. The Cabinet's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee decided against this on 28March as it was believed that maintaining the squadron at Ubon helped maintain good relationships with Thailand and the United States. The Thai Government was discreetly asked if it <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> different form of assistance, however.|$|E

Despite that, he faced some criticism from those who complained that they <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> more established voice, such as Marv Albert or Kevin Harlan.

The European version was released the same year, but was called Independence War Special Edition instead since it was reasoned that 'deluxe' doesn't mean much to the French or German audiences. The American version also included a $10 rebate for owners of Independence War, but no rebate was included with the European version.|$|E

25|$|In December 2007, Transit New Zealand {{noted that}} the more than 160 options had been narrowed down to only two alignments. The first {{possible}} alignment (of approximately 4.5km length) would be a parallel link several hundred meters directly {{to the east of}} the existing bridge (either as a bridge or a tunnel), while the second alignment (of approximately 6.5km length) would start in the same general environs in North Shore City, but travel diagonally southeastwards to link up with the motorway at Grafton Gully, east of the Auckland CBD. The second option, due to the need to cross shipping lanes, would need to be a tunnel. It could also possibly be connected to the CBD via a side branch tunnel (for use by public transport only). North Shore City has noted that it <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> tunnel option for aesthetic reasons, and to potentially emplace light rail within the tunnel at a future stage.|$|E
25|$|In February 2014, it was {{announced}} that funding had been secured for the first phase of Midland Metro's Line Two extension to Eastside, including three new stops at either Moor Street or Albert Street, and Curzon Street, before a terminus at Adderley Street. Centro are currently undertaking public consultation of two proposed routes, with both proposals aiming to join the existing Line One at a junction between Bull St and Corporation St. The main aim of the consultation is to establish whether commuters <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> shorter, and therefore quicker, route through to Curzon Street from New Street, or if a slightly longer route with a tram stop directly outside Moor Street would be more agreeable. If the latter option were favoured, it would mark the achievement of what has long been regarded as a major aim for the Metro, namely to connect all three (four when Curzon St reopens) city-centre stations by rapid transit. Any extension would have to be completed before the projected commencement of High Speed 2 services in 2026.|$|E

Zendaya drew criticism because people felt that she was too light skinned and did not greatly resemble Aaliyah. She voiced her strong respect for Aaliyah before dropping out of the project. She explained her choice to withdraw from the film in videos on Instagram. Aaliyah's family has been vocal in their disapproving of the film. Her cousin Jomo Hankerson stated the family <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> [...] "major studio release along the lines" [...] of What's Love Got to Do with It, the biopic based on the life of Tina Turner. Aaliyah's family has consulted a lawyer to stop Lifetime from using [...] "any of the music, or any of the photographs and videos" [...] they own and Jomo Hankerson claimed the TV network [...] "didn't reach out." [...] On August 9, 2014, it {{was announced}} that Chattrisse Dolabaille and Izaak Smith had been cast as Aaliyah's collaborators Missy Elliott and Timbaland. Dolabaille received criticism for her appearance in comparison with that of Missy Elliot.
