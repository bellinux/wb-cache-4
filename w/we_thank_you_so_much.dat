50|$|Official {{statement}} from the band here:After 4 years of being in The Wage of Sin, I can honestly say I have made some truly great and unforgettable memories and friends. And while I wouldn't give up the time I spent in this band for anything, {{at this point it}} does not make sense for us to keep the band going any longer. The girls have become very busy with their other bands: Rachel full time w/Most Precious Blood, Vanessa w/Infidel (formerly Rebel Alliance), and Laura w/All for Nothing. Laura is also currently getting her Masters and working part-time, Vanessa is working, and I am currently working and traveling as a TV producer. Needless to say this has left us with very little time to dedicate to The Wage of Sin. We have so many amazing, dedicated fans asking us to play shows, do interviews, and be on compilations-anything to help our band out. While we are completely grateful and flattered that people are going {{out of their way to}} support us, I feel it is unfair for us to continue the band when the fans are currently dedicating more time than the actual members. There are so many other bands working their asses off, making huge sacrifices to write and play music to as many people as possible which deserve and need your support so much more than we do at this point. While we do have so much fun when we do play shows, unfortunately those moments are very few and far between lately. We have been lucky to have shared some wonderful experiences and are happy about the things we have accomplished together- releasing two CDs, touring the US and Europe, having a video on Headbangers Ball and Much Music, and most importantly having built friendships with the people we have met along the way. But being that we have all committed to touring with other bands or working for the rest of the year, we feel we would just be dragging on if we continued to go out this rate of trying to squeeze in shows on those rare occasions when our four worlds happen to collide and allow us to do so. To all of our fans, friends, anyone who has booked us, played with us, shared equipment with us, given us a place to stay, or cooked for us, and to the labels that have put out our music (Immigrant Sun, Beniihana, Burial, Elephant Eye, Kablio Muzika), and all our fill-ins (Bryan, Nick, Jerry, Chino) - <b>we</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for making our time in this band so amazing and for affording us so many great opportunities! Because this band is more than just the 4 people in it, we all felt it would be very unappreciative to NOT play some final shows. We want these shows to be THANK YOUs to everyone who has supported us, and final celebrations of the fun times we have had together these past few years. There are no bad feelings between us- we just all have our hearts in different places and support each other in each of our endeavors. Since we cannot give this band our full attention any longer, it's time to end it while we are still smiling.|$|E
