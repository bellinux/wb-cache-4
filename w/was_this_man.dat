Actor John Noble used material he had created since the airing of the pilot, which he explained was his sense of [...] "what <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> like before he deteriorated." [...] The production crew tried different methods with the actor to create a younger Walter, such as changes to his hair, make-up, and wardrobe; they ultimately decided on using [...] "tabs" [...] to keep the wrinkles in his face back. He did not wear a wig, but the crew did add parts {{to the front and}} back. When asked what preparation went into playing a younger Walter, Noble explained: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Quite a lot, but in {{the sense}} in my {{preparation}} to find the Walter {{that we all know}} now, I {{had to go back to}} him right at the beginning to see where he came from. So that process was started before the pilot really, what <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> like before he deteriorated, so I was able to revisit that. Physically, of course, what I had to do was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task. I was aided enormously by my hair and makeup and special effects people here in terms of getting the overall, and indeed wardrobe helped a lot as well. And then we, the shot up through these beautiful lenses that we got a different feel to the episode than we would now. All of those elements work together... to create this version that you see in the episode." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1938, deHavilland {{began dating}} {{business}} tycoon, aviator, and filmmaker Howard Hughes, {{who had just}} completed his record-setting flight {{around the world in}} 91 hours. In addition to escorting her about town, he gave the actress her first flying lessons. She later said, [...] "He was a rather shy man ... and yet, in a whole community where the men every day played heroes on the screen and didn't do anything heroic in life, here <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> who was a real hero." [...] In December 1939, she began a romantic relationship with actor James Stewart. At the request of Irene Mayer Selznick, the actor's agent asked Stewart to escort deHavilland to the New York premiere of Gone with the Wind at the Astor Theater on December 19, 1939. Over the next few days, Stewart took her to the theater several times and to the 21 Club. They continued to see each other back in Los Angeles, where Stewart provided occasional flying lessons and romance. According to deHavilland, Stewart proposed marriage to her in 1940, but she felt that he was not ready to settle down. Their relationship ended in late 1941 when deHavilland began a romantic relationship with film director John Huston while making In This Our Life. [...] "John was a very great love of mine", she would later admit, [...] "He was a man I wanted to marry." ...|$|E
